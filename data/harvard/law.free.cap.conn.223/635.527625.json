The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of imprisonment of fifty years. From this judgment of conviction, the defendant appealed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that: (1) the trial court improperly denied his motions to suppress certain evidence and the identification of him as the fruits of an illegal stop and seizure; (2) the trial court denied him his constitutional right to confrontation when a hearsay statement made by his brother was admitted into evidence, because his brother did not testify and, therefore, could not be cross-examined; (3) the prosecutor improperly commented on the defendant\u2019s election not to testify, in violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional and statutory right to remain silent; and (4) the trial court improperly instructed the jury on reasonable doubt. We find merit in the defendant\u2019s first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>claim and, therefore,'we reverse the judgment of conviction and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. In the early morning hours of August 25, 1988, the Wethersfield police department responded to a telephone call from the Almar Motel in Wethersfield. At the motel, police found a man, later identified as Domingo \u201cBilly\u201d Huertas, lying outside of room 107, bleeding from a wound in his chest. Huertas was taken to a local hospital and given emergency treatment, but he died shortly after his arrival.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After securing aid for Huertas, the police followed a trail of blood to room 100. The doorjamb of room 100 had been broken and the lock plate was on the ground, indicating that the door had been forced open. Inside the room, the police observed more blood and the room in disarray. They found two firearms, a .38 caliber semi-automatic handgun and a .22 caliber handgun. Behind the motel the police found a green cloth bag on the ground. The registration card for room 100 indicated that it had been rented for one week on August 22, 1988, by Charles Morales.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">On the evening of August 24, 1988, Jose Huertas, who was the victim\u2019s brother, Morales, the victim and a man named \u201cEdgar\u201d were at Morales\u2019 home in Hartford. Morales gave the victim a .38 caliber handgun and put a .22 caliber handgun into a small box along with a kilogram of cocaine. The four men then went to the Almar Motel, where they drank beer and smoked \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. After approximately one and one-half hours, Jose, Edgar and Morales left the motel. The victim remained in the motel room with the cocaine and the handguns. Additional facts will be detailed in connection with the consideration of specific issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly denied his motions to suppress certain physical evidence and identification evidence. On August 29, 1988, four days after the homicide of Huertas, Wallingford police officer William Birney seized cocaine from a gym-type duffel bag he found in the woods off Center Street in Wallingford. Birney subsequently identified the defendant as the man whom he had seen toss the bag into the woods. The defendant sought to suppress the cocaine and Birney\u2019s identification of him on the basis that they were the fruits of an illegal seizure, in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8 and 9 of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motions to suppress. Relying on the provisions of our state constitution, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The trial court held a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motions to suppress, at which Birney was the only witness. Birney, a patrolman with approximately two and one-half years of experience at the time relevant to this appeal, testified as follows. On August 29, 1988, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>approximately 12:50 a.m., Birney was patrolling in the area of East Main Street and Center Street in Wallingford in a marked police cruiser. Birney was wearing a uniform and a badge and was armed with a nightstick and a firearm. Birney described the area as primarily residential, with a shopping plaza that contains several small businesses. At the time of the patrol, all of the businesses were closed. Birney was aware that there had recently been a series of burglaries on East Main Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">As Birney drove east on East Center Street, he saw a man and woman walking toward him. He recognized the woman as Nanette Williams, whom he recognized as having recently been arrested on larceny and burglary charges. Although it was \u201cvery warm\u201d out, Williams was wearing a \u201cthick jacket.\u201d Her male companion, later identified as the defendant, was wearing a zipped \u201cwinter\u201d jacket and carrying a tan, \u201cgym-type\u201d duffel bag. As Birney drove past Williams and the defendant, they \u201ckind of looked at each other\u201d and appeared to quicken their pace. Birney was familiar with Wallingford\u2019s \u201cstreet people\u201d and had never seen the defendant. Birney thought that it was \u201cstrange\u201d that the defendant was wearing a winter jacket when it was \u201cso warm out.\u201d It was not raining at the time. Birney knew from experience that burglars often wear heavy clothing to protect themselves from injury when they break windows. He had a \u201chunch\u201d that Williams and the defendant had recently committed or were about to commit a burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Birney turned the cruiser around and drove back in the direction of Williams and the defendant. He stopped about seven yards away from them, exited the cruiser and stood by the driver\u2019s side door. Birney asked Williams what she and the defendant were doing. She replied that they were coming from the Junction Cafe. Birney knew that they were, in fact, walking in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>direction of the Junction Cafe and that the cafe had closed at 11 p.m., nearly two hours earlier. Birney then asked the defendant to identify himself and the defendant answered, \u201cFreddy Velez.\u201d Both Williams and the defendant appeared nervous and kept glancing at each other. Birney asked the defendant to approach the cruiser. The defendant handed the duffel bag to Williams and stepped toward Birney. Birney instructed the defendant to bring the bag with him. The defendant then \u201cgrabbed the bag away from [Williams], gave a quick look up and down, and ran away.\u201d Birney yelled to the defendant to \u201cstop\u201d and pursued him on foot through a yard and into a wooded area. Birney saw the defendant throw down the duffel bag as he entered the wooded area. Birney retrieved the bag, which was open. Inside the duffel bag he saw two plastic bags containing white powder, which subsequently tested positive for cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The following morning, Birney and other Walling-ford police officers searched the wooded area. In the area where Birney had last seen the defendant, another officer found a wallet containing a Connecticut identification card bearing the defendant\u2019s photograph and the name \u201cRaphael Torres.\u201d As a result of the evidence retrieved by Birney and other Wallingford police officers, along with other evidence, the defendant was later arrested and charged with various crimes related to the homicide of Huertas.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The trial court concluded that an investigatory stop had occurred at some point after Birney <em>exited </em>his cruiser and began to question the defendant and Williams. The trial court found that Birney had based his conduct on his knowledge of recent burglaries in the area, his recognition of Williams as having been arrested recently for burglary and larceny, his experience that burglars often wear heavy outer garments and Williams\u2019 responses to his questions. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>court found further that the defendant\u2019s flight had provided Birney with additional grounds to stop the defendant. The trial court concluded that Birney had had a reasonable and articulable suspicion to believe that the defendant had been, or was about to be, engaged in criminal activity and, therefore, his stop of the defendant had been justified. Finally, the trial court concluded that the defendant had retained no reasonable expectation of privacy in the duffel bag once he had discarded it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5Z\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>In his appeal to this court, the defendant claims that Birney made an investigatory stop without a reasonable and articulable suspicion, in violation of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8 and 9 of the Connecticut constitution. The state argues that Birney did not effectuate a stop but, rather, engaged in a \u201cconsensual encounter\u201d with the defendant. Alternatively, the state contends that even if a stop occurred, Birney had a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop the defendant, based on the observations he had made before exiting his cruiser, together with Williams\u2019 responses to his questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u201cOn appeal, it is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous. . . . The trial court\u2019s conclusions must stand unless they are legally and logically inconsistent with the facts.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>197 Conn. 620, 625, 500 A.2d 1299 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Our threshold inquiry is at what point, if any, did the encounter between Birney and the defendant constitute an investigatory stop or seizure. If we conclude that there was such a seizure, we must then determine whether Birney possessed a reasonable and articula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>ble suspicion at the time the seizure occurred. We conclude that, pursuant to article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 of the state constitution, there was a seizure. We conclude, further, that the stop was not supported by a reasonable and articulable suspicion and, therefore, that the contrary conclusion of the trial court was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The defendant appears to concede that under current fourth amendment analysis, Bimey\u2019s actions would not constitute a seizure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we confine our analysis to the relevant provisions of the Connecticut constitution. The defendant argues that under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 of our state constitution, he was seized when Bimey asked him to come over to the cruiser with his bag.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state argues that no seizure took place and urges this court to adopt the holding of <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 1547, 113 L. Ed. 2d 690 (1991); see footnote 6, supra; in interpreting the contours of a seizure under the state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">In analyzing claims of illegal seizure under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 of the Connecticut constitution, we have previously adopted the standards created by the United States Supreme Court for the analysis of claims of illegal seizure under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution. See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>1, 20-22, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 553-54, 100 S. Ct. 1870, 64 L. Ed. 2d 497, reh. denied, 448 U.S. 908, 100 S. Ct. 3051, 65 L. Ed. 2d 1138 (1980); <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 501-502, 103 S. Ct. 1319, 75 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1983). We have thus defined a person as \u201cseized\u201d under our state constitution when \u201c \u2018by means of physical force or a show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>186 Conn. 287, 291, 440 A.2d 984, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 878, 103 S. Ct. 173, 74 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1982), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>supra. In determining whether a seizure has occurred, so as to invoke the protections of our state constitution, we have stated that a court is to consider whether \u201c \u2018in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>supra, 292, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>supra, 554. \u201cWhether there has been such a seizure in an individual case is a question of fact.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The state urges us to abandon these well established standards for the test now employed by the United States Supreme Court in determining whether a seizure has occurred under the fourth amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>supra. The state argues that Birney\u2019s interaction with the defendant was a \u201cconsensual encounter,\u201d or, at most, an \u201cattempted seizure.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The state contends that in light of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>supra, this court should hold that there was no seizure of the defendant under the state constitution and, therefore, that the search of the defendant\u2019s bag did not violate his state constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>supra, two police officers, wearing jackets with \u201cpolice\u201d embossed on both sides, were patrolling a high-crime area in an unmarked vehicle. A group of youths, including the defendant, fled at the approach of the police vehicle. One of the officers gave chase on foot. He observed the defendant toss away a small rock. After restraining the defendant, the officer recovered the rock, which later proved to be cocaine. The United States Supreme Court framed the question presented as \u201cwhether, with respect to a show of authority as with respect to application of physical force, a seizure occurs even though the subject does not yield.\u201d Id., 1550. The state conceded that the officer did not have the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d required under <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, to stop the defendant. <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>supra, 1549 n.1. The court concluded, however, that the police officer\u2019s chase of the defendant was not a \u201cseizure\u201d of the person within the meaning of the fourth amendment. In reaching this conclusion, the court reasoned that a seizure 'for fourth amendment purposes is equivalent to an arrest at common law, which it defined as requiring \u201ceither physical force . . . or . . . submission to the assertion of authority.\u201d (Emphasis omitted). Id., 1551. The court thus held that, even if it was assumed that the officer\u2019s pursuit constituted a \u201cshow of authority\u201d for fourth amendment purposes, because the defendant did not submit to that authority until <em>after </em>he had discarded the cocaine, the cocaine was properly admitted into evidence. Id., 1552.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>The state urges this court to read the definition of a \u201cseizure,\u201d as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>supra, into article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 of our state constitution. The state argues that since Birney never applied physical force to the defendant\u2019s person and the defendant did not submit to Birney\u2019s assertion of authority when he ordered the defendant to stop, the defendant\u2019s state constitutional rights were not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">\u201cIt is well established that federal constitutional and statutory law establishes a minimum national standard for the exercise of individual rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection for such rights. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992). Although we have often relied upon decisions of the United States Supreme Court interpreting the fourth amendment to define the protections provided by related provisions of our state constitution, we have at times determined that the state constitution affords greater protections to the citizens of Connecticut than does the federal constitution, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 579 A.2d 58 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 547 A.2d 10 (1988). We have stated, moreover, that \u201c[t]he Connecticut constitution is an instrument of progress, it is intended to stand for a great length of time and should not be interpreted too narrowly or too literally so that it fails to have contemporary effectiveness for all of our citizens.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra, 115. Thus, \u201c \u2018the law of the land\u2019 may not, in [the] state constitutional context, also be \u2018the law of the state of Connecticut.\u2019 \u201d Id., 114. In the present case, we must decide whether article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 of the Connecticut constitution afford greater protection to the citizens of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>state than does the federal constitution in the determination of what constitutes a seizure. We conclude that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The state claims that \u201c[t]he restraints associated with a common law arrest or detention best exemplify the contours of what constitutes a seizure\u201d under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 of the Connecticut constitution. The state contends that at common law, arrest contemplated \u201cthe physical touching of a suspect, or the employment of means that ensure[d] the effective control over or confinement of the suspect.\u201d The state argues, therefore, that pursuant to the common law doctrine of arrest as it existed in Connecticut, our state constitutional standard is \u201ccoextensive\u201d with the federal standard set forth in <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>supra. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">At common law in Connecticut, an arrest was defined as \u201cthe apprehending or restraining the person of another . . . .\u201d 2 Z. Swift, A System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1796) p. 386 (System). While it is true that at common law \u201cmere words\u201d could not effect an arrest, an arrest could be made without touching the person if sufficient indicia were present that the person was not free to leave. 1 Z. Swift, A Digest of the Laws of Connecticut (1822) p. 499 (Digest) (arrest occurs when peace officer enters a room, tells defendant he is arresting him and locks the door). Legal documents in existence prior to the adoption of the state constitution in 1818 demonstrate a profound concern with the right of personal liberty. In writing of this \u201csacred and inestimable right\u201d in 1796, Zephaniah Swift, who served as Chief Justice of this court from 1815 to 1819, stated that \u201cno man can be restrained of his liberty; be prevented from removing himself from place to place, as he chuses; be compelled to go to a place contrary to his inclination, or be in any way imprisoned, or confined, unless by virtue of the express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>laws of the land.\u201d 1 Z. Swift, System, supra, p. 180. The only violation of the right of personal liberty was by false imprisonment, which consisted of \u201cthe detention of a person without any legal authority.\u201d 2 Z. Swift, System, supra, p. 57. Moreover, every \u201cdetention\u201d or \u201cconfinement\u201d of the person \u201cin any shape,\u201d including <em>the forcible detention of a person in the street, </em>constituted an imprisonment. Id.; see also 1 Z. Swift, Digest, supra, p. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">In <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>supra, Justice Scalia, writing for a majority of the United States Supreme Court, purported to rely on the common law definition of arrest for the conclusion that a seizure under the fourth amendment requires either physical force or submission to the assertion of authority. In response to the dissenters\u2019 contention that an <em>attempted </em>arrest was also unlawful at common law, Justice Scalia wrote: \u201c[I]t is irrelevant that English law proscribed \u2018an unlawful <em>attempt </em>to take a presumptively innocent person into custody.\u2019 . . . [N]either usage nor common-law tradition makes an attempted seizure a seizure. The common-law may have made an attempted seizure unlawful in certain circumstances; but it made many things unlawful, very few of which were elevated to constitutional proscriptions.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 1550-51 n.2. We are persuaded that the distinction made by the United States Supreme Court between an arrest and an attempted arrest at common law does not guide our determination of what constitutes a seizure under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 of our state constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>The distinction between an arrest and an attempted arrest at common law reflected the difference between battery and assault. <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>supra, 1553-54 (Stevens, J., dissenting); see also 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d Ed.) \u00a7 9.2. We have previously set forth the concept of the right of personal liberty and the scope of the intrusions on that right, as they existed at common law in this state. \u201cEvery confinement of a person <em>in any </em>shape\u201d constituted an imprisonment, for which, if it were accomplished without legal authority, an action for false imprisonment would lie. (Emphasis added.) 1 Z. Swift, Digest, supra, p. 18. Among the specific intrusions on personal liberty that constituted an imprisonment at common law was the unlawful, forcible detention of a person <em>in the street. </em>On the basis of these common law antecedents of article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 of our constitution, we are persuaded that the dichotomy between an attempted arrest and an arrest \u201cshould not take on constitutional dimensions.\u201d See <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>supra, 1553 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Accordingly, we decline to adopt the restricted definition of a seizure employed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Hodari D. </em>and adhere to our precedents in determining what constitutes a seizure under the state constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>204 Conn. 187, 193-94 n.4, 527 A.2d 1168, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 927, 108 S. Ct. 293, 98 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>supra, 290-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">We now apply these precedential standards to the facts of this case. Birney was on patrol in a marked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>police cruiser. He drove past the defendant and Williams, turned around and stopped approximately twenty feet away from them. Birney then stepped out of the cruiser and stood next to the driver\u2019s door as the defendant and Williams walked toward him. Birney was dressed in full police uniform and visibly armed with a gun and a nightstick. After Birney asked Williams where she and the defendant were going, he asked the defendant his name. The defendant gave him the name \u201cFreddy Velez.\u201d Birney told the defendant to approach the cruiser. The defendant gave the bag to Williams and stepped toward Birney. Birney told the defendant to bring the bag with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The state characterizes this entire interaction as a consensual encounter. Under our state constitution what starts out as a consensual encounter becomes a seizure if, on the basis of a show of authority by the police officer, a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have believed that he was not free to leave. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>supra, 291-92. In view of all the circumstances, including the lateness of the hour, the fact that Birney was armed and the fact that there was no one other than the defendant and Williams in the vicinity, we are persuaded that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would not have believed that he was free to ignore Birney\u2019s instructions and walk away. Accordingly, we conclude that a seizure took place within the meaning of article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Having determined that a seizure of the defendant took place, we must next determine whether the trial court properly concluded that the seizure was based on a reasonable and articulable basis of suspicion. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 of our state constitution permit a police officer \u201cin appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner\u201d to detain an individual for investigative purposes even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>supra, 195; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>216 Conn. 172, 184, 579 A.2d 484 (1990). In determining whether the detention was justified in a given case, a court must consider if \u201c '[bjased upon the whole picture the detaining officers [had] a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Scully, </em>195 Conn. 668, 674, 490 A.2d 984 (1985), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417-18, 101 S. Ct. 690, 66 L. Ed. 2d 621 (1981). A court reviewing the legality of a stop must therefore examine the specific information available to the police officer at the time of the initial intrusion and any rational inferences to be derived therefrom. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Braxton, </em>196 Conn. 685, 689, 495 A.2d 273 (1985). These standards, which mirror those set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, with regard to fourth amendment analysis, govern the legality of investigatory detentions under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 of our state constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Scully, </em>supra, 674-75 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The defendant contends that the factors considered by Birney in asking the defendant to approach the cruiser with his duffel bag did not amount to a reasonable and articulable suspicion. The state counters that if this court concludes that Birney\u2019s request that the defendant bring the bag over to the police car was a seizure, Birney at that point had reasonable and articulable suspicion based on his initial observations of the appearance and behavior of Williams and the defendant, coupled with Williams\u2019 responses to Birney\u2019s questions. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Although burglaries had been reported in the general area of Birney\u2019s patrol, Birney had not received any report that a burglary had been committed in that area on the evening of August 29, 1988, nor did he possess information linking the defendant or Williams to a particular burglary in the area. Moreover, although Birney testified that the manner of dress of the defendant and Williams fit the profile of burglars, he acknowledged that homeless people often dress in a similar manner and carry items with them. The fact that Williams was known to Birney as a recent arrestee for larceny and burglary could not supply Birney with reasonable suspicion about the defendant. In addition, the fact that Birney did not recognize the defendant from his familiarity with \u201cstreet people\u201d in Wallingford could not provide justifiable grounds for a stop. Finally, while Williams may have given false answers to Birney\u2019s questions, her responses did not provide Birney with a reasonable suspicion regarding <em>the defendant\u2019s </em>activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">We are persuaded that Birney\u2019s suspicion that the defendant had been or was about to be engaged in criminal activity was not constitutionally sound.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We also reject the state\u2019s argument, and the trial court\u2019s conclusion, that the defendant\u2019s flight, when viewed in conjunction with Birney\u2019s other observations, provided Birney with the requisite level of suspicion to seize the defendant. While a suspect\u2019s flight may, in certain cases, be considered in determining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>there existed a reasonable and articulable basis of suspicion; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>14 Conn. App. 574, 578, 542 A.2d 342 (1988); police conduct that <em>provokes </em>flight precludes the consideration of this factor. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>10 Conn. App. 532, 540, 524 A.2d 655, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 801, 525 A.2d 965 (1987). As the Appellate Court has warned: \u201cWere it otherwise, the officer could use the suspicious conduct that he himself induced as evidence that the defendant was acting suspiciously.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">We recognize that police on patrol perform a variety of functions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, a police officer, in carrying out his duties, may stop and speak to an individual on the street without necessarily implicating the individual\u2019s constitutional rights. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Damon, </em>214 Conn. 146, 153, 570 A.2d 700, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 819, 111 S. Ct. 65, 112 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra. We acknowledge, furthermore, that the police must enjoy a certain degree of latitude in making investigative stops. Nevertheless, the requirement of a reasonable and articulable factual basis for an investigative stop must be met. We have consistently stated that a police officer\u2019s decision to detain an individual for investigatory purposes \u201cmust be predicated \u2018on more than a mere hunch.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Scully, </em>supra, 675; <em>State </em>v. <em>Aversa, </em>197 Conn. 685, 691, 501 A.2d 370 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">We are persuaded that the informational basis advanced by Birney to justify his stop of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>ant, which Birney himself characterized as a \u201chunch,\u201d was insufficient to support a reasonable and articulable suspicion. In a close case like the present one, the balance ought to be struck on the side of the freedom of the citizen from governmental intrusion. To conclude otherwise would be to elevate society\u2019s interest in apprehending offenders above the right of citizens to be free from unreasonable stops. The record in the present case does not disclose circumstances which, viewed in their totality, yielded sufficient specific and articulable facts to make constitutionally reasonable Birney\u2019s detention of the defendant. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant was illegally seized, in violation of article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Our conclusion that the defendant was illegally seized does not end our inquiry. We must next determine whether the defendant\u2019s discarding of the bag and Birney\u2019s resulting seizure of the cocaine and identification of the defendant were the products of the illegal seizure. We conclude that they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">After oral argument to this court, the parties submitted supplemental briefs on the question of whether there was a basis in fact and in law to sustain the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motions to suppress under the doctrine of abandonment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In his supplemental brief, the defendant argues that he did not voluntarily abandon the bag because his action was induced by an illegal seizure of his person and, thus, the trial court\u2019s ruling cannot be upheld on a theory of abandonment. The state contends, in its brief, that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>court\u2019s ruling should be affirmed on the basis that the defendant retained no reasonable expectation of privacy in the bag when he discarded it in the course of Birney\u2019s pursuit of him.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We are persuaded that the trial court\u2019s ruling cannot be sustained on a theory of abandonment and, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s finding to the contrary was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In distinguishing abandonment for the purposes of search and seizure analysis from the concept of abandonment in property law, the Minnesota Supreme Court has stated: \u201cIn the law of search and seizure . . . the question is whether the defendant has, in discarding the property, relinquished his reasonable expectation of privacy so that its seizure and search is reasonable within the limits of the Fourth Amendment. ... In essence, what is abandoned is not necessarily the defendant\u2019s property, but his reasonable expectation of privacy therein.\u201d <em>St. Paul </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>306 Minn. 337, 346, 237 N.W.2d 365 (1975). The court went on to state that \u201c[wjhere the presence of the police is <em>lawful </em>and the discard occurs in a public place where the defendant cannot reasonably have any continued expectancy of privacy in the discarded property, the property will be deemed abandoned for purposes of search and seizure.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 346-47; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>218 Conn. 85, 106-107, 588 A.2d 145, cert. denied, U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 330, 116 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1991). Conversely, \u201cwhere a person has disposed of property in response to ... an <em>illegal </em>[seizure or search by police], courts have not hesitated to hold that property inadmissible.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d Ed.) \u00a7 2.6 (b); see, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>602 F.2d 726, 729-30 (5th Cir. 1979) (objects thrown out of car window after illegal stop properly excluded from evidence); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemmon, </em>318 Md. 365, 380-81, 568 A.2d 48 (1990) (drugs discarded by defendant fleeing police after illegal seizure inadmissible); but see <em>State </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>368 So. 2d 1331, 1335-36 (Fla. App. 1979), cert. dismissed, 383 So. 2d 1200 (Fla. 1980) (\u201ca person\u2019s otherwise voluntary abandonment of property cannot be tainted or made involuntary by a prior illegal police stop of such person\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Boodle, </em>47 N.Y.2d 398, 404, 391 N.E.2d 1329, 418 N.Y.S.2d 352, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 969, 100 S.

We are persuaded that the weight of authority counsels in favor of our conclusion that there was no abandonment in this case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">In <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>supra, 1550, the United States Supreme Court intimated in dicta that even where there is an initial unlawful seizure, the defendant\u2019s flight terminates the seizure so that items discarded in the course of flight are not evidence disclosed \u201cduring the course of an arrest.\u201d We disagree. Article first, \u00a7 8 of our state constitution protects citizens against the admission of evidence at trial that is obtained as a result of the unlawful activities of the police. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra, 108-10. The relevant inquiry is whether the unlawful conduct of the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number><em>induced, </em>the disposal of the incriminating items by the defendant. We reject the implication of the dicta in <em>Hodari D., </em>that the chain of causation is broken when a suspect escapes from an unlawful seizure, thereby allowing the admission in evidence of items subsequently discarded. We are persuaded that following this reasoning could encourage illegal stops by the police. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra; 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d Ed.) \u00a7 2.6 (b) n.62.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The trial court concluded that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the duffel bag that he discarded during Birney\u2019s pursuit of him. This conclusion of the trial court was clearly erroneous. We conclude that the defendant did not abandon the duffel bag that he discarded during Birney\u2019s <em>unlawful </em>pursuit of him. We conclude, however, that the defendant\u2019s wallet and its contents were properly admitted into evidence under a theory of abandonment since the record does not disclose that the wallet was discarded in response to Birney\u2019s pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">We have concluded that the cocaine and the identification of the defendant as the person who discarded the duffel bag containing the cocaine were the fruits of an illegal seizure. Accordingly, the trial court should have excluded this evidence pursuant to article first, \u00a7 8 of the state constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra. The state has the burden of proving that the admission of evidence in violation of our state constitution was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Duntz, </em>223 Conn. 207, 221, 613 A.2d 224 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Janes, </em>215 Conn. 173, 184, 575 A.2d 216 (1990). \u201cThe test for harmfulness is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the improperly admitted evidence contributed to the conviction . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Duntz, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>supra. The state has advanced no argument that the admission of the cocaine and the identification of the defendant were harmless error and, therefore, has failed to meet its burden. We conclude that the admission of this evidence was harmful to the defendant. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The defendant next claims that he was denied his constitutional right to confrontation when a hearsay statement made by his brother was admitted into evidence, because his brother did not testify and, therefore, could not be cross-examined. Because we are reversing the judgment of conviction on the basis of the defendant\u2019s first claim, we address this claim only insofar as it may arise on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Robert Cruncleton was arrested on September 20, 1988, on charges arising from the homicide of Huertas. Cruncleton had previously given a statement to the Wallingford police in which he identified the defendant as the person who shot Huertas. Thereafter, the defendant was arrested on an unrelated charge in San Jose, California, as a result of which he was extradited to Connecticut on the basis of an outstanding arrest warrant for the murder of Huertas.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Six days after the shooting at the Almar Motel, on August 31,1988, prior to the arrest of either Cruncleton or the defendant, the Wethersfield and Walling-ford police executed a search warrant at the Wallingford home of Edwin Oquendo, the defendant\u2019s brother. The search warrant was issued for the purpose of locating and seizing the shotgun used in the shooting of Huertas, as well as shotgun shells and small, circular red plastic cap devices. The search warrant was executed shortly after 12 a.m. on August 31, 1988. The search of Edwin\u2019s home did not yield the items that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>had been sought, but resulted in the seizure of narcotics material. The police asked Edwin if he had any knowledge of the shooting of Huertas, to which he replied affirmatively. Edwin then accompanied the police to the Wethersfield police station at approximately 12 a.m. on August 31, 1988, where he gave a written statement over the course of approximately one and one-half hours. In his statement, which was made under oath, Edwin described the activities of the defendant, Cruncleton and the defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Maria Morales, on the early morning of August 25, 1988. Edwin stated that he had seen the defendant retrieve a shotgun from Maria\u2019s car. He also stated that he had seen the defendant pry the lock off a tan colored metal box that Maria had removed from the car. Edwin further stated that the box contained a large, thick manila envelope and two plastic bags that appeared to contain cocaine. Edwin also related to the police certain inculpatory statements that he had overheard the defendant make with respect to the shooting at the Almar Hotel.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">At the trial of the defendant, Edwin refused to testify.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The state sought to have Edwin\u2019s statement admitted into evidence through the testimony of John Salvatore, the Wethersfield police detective to whom Edwin had made the statement. The state argued first that the statement was admissible under the principle of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986). Alternatively, the state argued that Edwin\u2019s statement was admissible under the residual exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>to the hearsay rule. The defendant objected to the admission of Edwin\u2019s statement on the grounds that: (1) <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, was not applicable;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (2) the statement did not fall into any recognized exception to the hearsay rule; and (3) admission of the statement would violate his rights to confrontation and cross-examination under the state and federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The trial court concluded that the portion of the statement relating to Edwin\u2019s personal observations of the defendant, Cruncleton and Maria Morales on the morning of August 25, 1988 was admissible.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In concluding that Edwin\u2019s statement was admissible, the court found that the statement was reasonably necessary for the resolution of the case and that it bore sufficient indicia of reliability. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 662-66, 491 A.2d 345 (1985).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> After the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>ruled that it would admit Edwin\u2019s statement through Salvatore, it indicated to defense counsel that the defendant would have the opportunity to cross-examine Edwin regarding the statement. The defendant objected to the procedure proposed by the court. After Salvatore had testified regarding Edwin\u2019s statement, Edwin was called to the stand and refused to answer any questions on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The defendant first claims that Edwin\u2019s statement was improperly admitted because it did not come within any specific exception to the hearsay rule and did not qualify for admission under the residual exception because it was lacking in the requisite indicia of reliability. The state does not argue that Edwin\u2019s statement fell into any of the traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule. Rather, it argues that the statement was properly admitted under the so-called \u201cresidual\u201d exception to the hearsay rule. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">\u201cAn out of court statement is hearsay when it is offered to establish the truth of the matters contained therein.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>supra, 661. As a general rule, hearsay evidence is not admissible unless it falls under one of several well established exceptions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Outlaw, </em>216 Conn. 492, 505, 582 A.2d 751 (1990). The purpose behind the hearsay rule is to effectuate \u201cthe policy of requiring that testimony be given in open court, under oath, and subject to cross-examination.\u201d 2 C. McCormick, Evidence (4th Ed.) \u00a7 253. The \u201cresidual,\u201d or \u201ccatch-all,\u201d exception to the hearsay rule allows a trial court to admit hearsay evidence not admissible under any of the established exceptions if: (1) there is \u201ca reasonable necessity for the admission of the statement,\u201d and (2) the statement is \u201csupported by the equivalent guarantees of reliability and trustworthiness essential to other evidence admitted under the traditional hearsay exceptions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>supra, 664; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Outlaw, </em>supra, 499-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>The state contends that the trial court properly concluded that Edwin\u2019s statement met both requirements of the two-pronged test set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>supra. With respect to the first prong of the test, that there be a reasonable necessity for the statement\u2019s admission, the state claims that the evidence: (1) was highly probative; (2) could not have been obtained from any other source, as Edwin was the only \u201cneutral\u201d party present to observe the defendant\u2019s conduct on the morning of August 25, 1988; and (3) was the only evidence corroborating Cruncleton\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s involvement in the Almar Motel incident.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We have stated that \u201cthe necessity requirement is met when, unless the hearsay statement is admitted, the facts it contains may be lost, either because the declarant is dead or <em>otherwise unavailable, </em>or because the assertion is of such a nature that evidence of the same value cannot be obtained from the same or other sources.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>supra, 665. In the present case, Edwin was \u201cotherwise unavailable\u201d since he refused to testify at the trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>179 Conn. 431, 441, 426 A.2d 799 (1980) (although witness present in court, testimony unavailable due to invocation of testimonial privilege); see also 2 C. McCormick, supra, \u00a7 253, pp. 131-32 (declarant is unavailable if he persists in refusing to testify despite court order to do so). Accordingly, the trial court properly concluded that the first prong of the <em>Sharpe </em>test had been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The state argues that the trial court also properly concluded that Edwin\u2019s statement met the second prong of the <em>Sharpe </em>test. The state claims that the reliability and trustworthiness of the statement were evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>denced by the following: (1) Edwin informed the police that he had knowledge of the shooting of Huertas before any contraband was discovered in his home; (2) Edwin\u2019s statement was voluntarily given, within five days of the shooting; (3) the statement was based on Edwin\u2019s personal observations and he was given time to make corrections before signing it; (4) the statement was made under oath, potentially subjecting Edwin to criminal penalties;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (5) Edwin was not in custody when he gave the statement; (6) Edwin\u2019s statement tended to inculpate his brother; and (7) the details of Edwin\u2019s statement were independently corroborated by Cruncleton\u2019s testimony, the testimony of Jose Huertas, the victim\u2019s brother, and the defendant\u2019s admission to the San Jose police that he had been present at the Almar Motel during the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The defendant claims that Edwin\u2019s statement lacked the requisite indicia of reliability and trustworthiness due to the circumstances under which it was obtained and, therefore, failed to meet the second criteria of the <em>Sharpe </em>test. The defendant emphasizes the following circumstances as indicative of the statement\u2019s lack of reliability: (1) the search warrant on Edwin\u2019s home was executed late at night; (2) the police seized narcotics as a result of the search; (3) Edwin\u2019s statement was given after 12 a.m. in a police station in another town; (4) Edwin was at the Wethersfield police station for approximately two and one-half hours; and (5) while at the police station, Edwin saw Cruncleton, who was Edwin\u2019s close friend and housemate.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The defendant argues that these factors, when viewed together, defeat the state\u2019s claim that Edwin\u2019s statement was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>under circumstances guaranteeing reliability and trustworthiness. We are persuaded that Edwin\u2019s statement did not meet the second prong of the test set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>supra, and, accordingly, was improperly admitted by the trial court under the residual hearsay exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>supra, 665, we stated that \u201c[t]he circumstantial probability of trustworthiness and reliability can be found in a variety of situations.\u201d In that case, the defendant objected to the admission through a police witness of the out-of-court statement of the victim\u2019s neighbor. After learning of the shooting of the victim, the declarant had reported to the police that in the early morning of the day the victim was shot, he had seen an unfamiliar car with two men in it parked near the victim\u2019s house. The declarant had given the police the license plate number of the car. We concluded that the proffered hearsay statement was reliable on the basis that the declarant did not know the defendant or the owner of the car, and, therefore, \u201cwould have had no reason to offer the police a false statement.\u201d Id. In upholding the trial court\u2019s admission of the statement, we noted, moreover, that the declarant was a witness at the defendant\u2019s trial and, thus, was available for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In contrast to the declarant\u2019s statement in <em>Sharpe, </em>the circumstances surrounding the giving of Edwin\u2019s statement to the Wethersfield police reveal that it \u201cwas not imbued with guarantees of reliability and trustworthiness sufficient to support its admission.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Outlaw, </em>supra, 499. First, we reject the state\u2019s contention that Edwin \u201cwould not incriminate [his brother] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>unless the accusation were true.\u201d In view of the facts that the police were seeking the murder weapon in Edwin\u2019s house and that they had found narcotics as the result of their search, we cannot say that the circumstances surrounding Edwin\u2019s statement \u201cestablish a \u2018motivational basis for truth-telling\u2019 equivalent to those associated with the traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule . . . .\u201d Id., 500. In addition, Edwin\u2019s close friendship with Cruncleton tends to undermine the trustworthiness of his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Second, unlike the declarant in <em>Sharpe, </em>Edwin refused to testify and, therefore, was not \u201c \u2018a witness at the trial and available for cross-examination.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Outlaw, </em>supra, 499, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>supra, 665. As we noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Outlaw, </em>supra, cross-examination has appropriately been described as \u201c \u2018the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u2019 \u201d See 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn Rev. 1974) \u00a7 1367, p. 32. We have consistently stated that \u201can important function of cross-examination is the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Arline, </em>223 Conn. 52, 60, 612 A.2d 755 (1992); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubesky, </em>195 Conn. 475, 482, 488 A.2d 1239 (1985). Given the incriminating nature of the evidence contained in Edwin\u2019s statement to the police, the defendant\u2019s lack of opportunity to cross-examine Edwin regarding his statement further diminished the reliability needed for its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that Salvatore\u2019s testimony regarding Edwin\u2019s statement was hearsay that did not fall under any exception to the hearsay rule, and, therefore, should have been excluded. Because we conclude that this evidence was inadmissible on the basis that it did not fall within the residual hearsay exception, as set forth in <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Sharpe, supra, we need not reach the defendant\u2019s claim that its admission violated his state and federal constitutional rights.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">In this opinion Peters, C.

I agree with the state\u2019s attorney that [the] defendant was not taken into custody. Simply shouting at him doesn\u2019t do that. I think that what happened was when the officer drove up alongside of these people, the two people that were walking along the street at night, a police cruiser pulls up next to them, they stopped. I don\u2019t know whether there was a <em>Terry </em>stop at that point or not. But, certainly, when the officer got out and began to question them\u2014in other words, at that point, I suppose they could have turned around and walked ahead and if he wanted to make a stop then he could have yelled for them to stop or commanded them to stop. But, in any event, they did stop, and the officer began to question them. And, I think, then, somewhere along the\u2014at that time, we did have some type of an investigatory stop. And, then, the question is whether the officer had reasonable, articulate\u2014a reasonable, articulate reason to stop them; he needs some type of probable cause to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"AxH\">\u201cThis was in an area, a residential area, of homes and businesses. There had been, according to the officer, burglaries in the area. The people that he observed, the female was a person who had been arrested. The question is whether she had been arrested more than once. But, certainly, he had knowledge she had been arrested for burglary and for larceny. The\u2014she was wearing\u2014she and her companion were both wearing jackets. The officer indicated\u2014he testified the weather was warm that evening and the jackets aroused his suspicion because people breaking and entering would wear jackets for protection and, I suppose, to secrete any items that may have been taken, on their person. It may have been that there were other reasons to wear jackets. The weather might have been sufficient so that people would have jackets, but these people not only had the jackets in their possession but they had the jackets on and, according to the officer, zipped up. If it was a warm evening in which there were\u2014rain or storms in the area, the people could have taken the jackets off; it would have made more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>sense. They could carry the jackets. Mr. Oquendo, the person identified as Mr. Oquendo, was carrying a bag. The jacket could have been put in the bag. So, these things seem to indicate that the officer did have a reasonable, articulate reason to stop and conduct an investigation. And, when the female made the reply that didn\u2019t\u2014to the officer didn\u2019t make sense, that they were coming from a particular bar and\u2014which had been closed for some time and, I think, actually going in the wrong direction, those two things further caused him to have a reason to investigate what the parties were doing. At that point or very shortly thereafter, I think testimony is that [the] defendant gave the bag to the female and approached the officer and then took the bag back and absconded. I think the officer had a right under the law to continue his investigation, and he chased after the defendant, yelled for him to stop. I don\u2019t believe that he ever exercised any control over him, took custody of him so to actually make an arrest. He did have reason to continue his investigation. The flight itself is further concern; he was carrying a bag. Then, what we had was, in the dark at night, the defendant ran down a trail into a wooded area and threw the bag away. At that point, I think the officer was justified in taking the bag because even though there weren\u2019t other people around, it was in a wooded area, at night. The bag\u2014it\u2019s highly questionable anyone throwing a bag or something like that away under those circumstances, as to whether they had any reasonable expectation of privacy in the bag. There was a case that I was involved in, I don\u2019t remember the name of it, but a similar thing, a bag with a shotgun in it, and the fellow was being chased by the officer; he threw the bag away; the officer picked up the bag, and I know the Appellate Court or the Supreme Court upheld that as\u2014the Appellate Court, I believe, on the grounds that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in the bag\u2014once he throws it away.</p>\n<p id=\"Axy\">\u201cThat being the case, then there was the right to seize it. The officer was concerned that if he left the bag there, also, and went after the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>ant, then this other woman\u2014the woman could have gone back, opened the bag, and taken a weapon out of it.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ-\">\u201cSo under those circumstances, I think he had a right to seize the bag, and since there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in the bag, had a right to ascertain as to whether there was any weapon in it or any other item, and he did so. The\u2014it would appear to me that there\u2019s been no\u2014in this whole proceeding, there\u2019s been no violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under the Constitution of the United States or the law of the state of Connecticut. And, therefore, I\u2019m going to overrule your motion to suppress, and the items may be admitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ar4\">The trial court did not hold a separate hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress Bimey\u2019s identification of him as the person who discarded the bag containing the cocaine. In its judgment, however, the trial court indicated that it had denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress Birney\u2019s identification of him on October 4, 1990, the same date the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the cocaine. The state asserts that the present record contains no findings on whether Bimey\u2019s identification of the defendant arose from his stop of the defendant. The state, therefore, asks this court, in the event that we should conclude that an illegal seizure occurred, to remand the case to the trial court for further findings on whether the identification resulted from the illegal detention. It is apparent from the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress identification evidence that the defendant sought to suppress identification of him as the individual who <em>discarded </em>the bag, because it was only after the discard that Birney discovered that the bag contained contraband. Thus, because we conclude that there was an illegal seizure of the defendant prior to his discarding of the bag; see part IA, infra; no remand on the issue of identification is necessary. In so concluding, we do not, however, address the admissibility of any identification evidence that may have arisen out of Birney\u2019s observations of the defendant <em>prior to </em>the illegal seizure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b668-8\"> In <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. , 111 S.

I dissent from the majority opinion because I conclude that (1) the police officer, William Birney, had a reasonable and articulable suspicion to make an investigative stop of the defendant, and (2) it is therefore unnecessary and imprudent to reach the question of whether the definition of a \u201cseizure\u201d under article first, \u00a7 7,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of our state constitution should be determined by the analysis of the United States Supreme Court, under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution, in <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. , 111 S.

All the businesses were closed. When Birney drove past the defendant and Williams in his marked police cruiser, they looked at each other and quickened their pace. Birney knew that Williams, the defendant\u2019s companion, had recently been arrested on larceny and burglary charges. Despite the weather and time of year, both the defendant and Williams were inappropriately dressed in winter clothing that Birney knew was the kind of clothing worn by burglars to protect themselves from injury when they break windows. Birney knew that the defendant was not one of the town\u2019s street people. When Birney asked them what they were doing, Williams, obviously answering for both of them, lied. They both appeared to be nervous and kept glancing at each other. When Birney asked the defendant to approach the cruiser, the defendant, instead of either walking away or complying with the request with bag in hand, gave the duffel bag to Williams before stepping towards Birney. If all of this is not reasonable and articulable suspicion, I do not know what is.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The majority\u2019s analysis attempting to undermine this conclusion is flawed. It consists mainly of supplying a series of possible benign inferences that could have been drawn by Birney from what he saw and confronted at 12:50 a.m. on that warm August night.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The problem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>with that analysis is that it ignores the equally (at the least) rational inferences that Birney <em>did </em>draw from what he saw and heard\u2014inferences that gave him plainly reasonable and articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. Moreover, the fact that Birney characterized his state of mind as a \u201chunch\u201d is irrelevant. It is axiomatic that the proper standard is objective\u2014namely, what a reasonable police officer in that situation would have concluded\u2014not subjective. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>559 F.2d 420 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 969, 98 S. Ct. 516, 54 L. Ed. 2d 457 (1977); 1 W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 3.3 (b), p. 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">There is nothing in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, or any of our precedents following it, that requires that a police officer draw only the benign inferences in favor of the defendant and precludes that officer from drawing rational, incriminatory inferences. Indeed, we have held to the contrary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofield, </em>220 Conn. 38, 45, 595 A.2d 1349 (1991), citing <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 21; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 148-49, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981). Any other scheme would eviscerate the <em>Terry </em>stop doctrine, since on any given set of facts amounting to reasonable and articulable suspicion there would inevitably be different inferences that could have been, but were not, drawn by the police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>The result of this analysis is that, even if we were to adopt the position of the defendant that there had been a seizure in this case, it would avail him nothing, since Birney\u2019s activity was not illegal. Therefore, contrary to the conclusion of the majority, the defendant did not run away and discard the bag in response to any police illegality, and the evidence should be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">This also means, moreover, that we should not undertake to decide on this record whether our state constitution requires a definition of \u201cseizure\u201d that is different from and more broad than that applicable under the fourth amendment to our federal constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Traditionally, and for sound jurisprudential reasons, we only decide constitutional questions when it is necessary to do so. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rinaldi, </em>220 Conn. 345, 353, 599 A.2d 1 (1991). Indeed, in the difficult and delicate area of search and seizure our recent history indicates the wisdom of such state constitutional prudence. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 238-45, 46, 496 A.2d 498 (1985) <em>(Shea </em>and <em>Callahan, Js., </em>dissenting), with <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 594 A.2d 917 (1991) (overruling <em>Kimbro). </em>The majority opinion misapplies the reasonable and articulable suspicion standard, and unwisely ignores this history.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-10\"> I am puzzled by the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cpursuant to article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 <em>and 9 </em>of the state constitution, there was a seizure.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See p. 646 of the majority opinion. Article first, \u00a7 7, is, of course, our state counterpart to the federal fourth amendment. Article first, \u00a7 9, which provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be arrested, detained or punished, except in cases clearly warranted by law,\u201d is our criminal due process clause, and has not generally been regarded as adding significantly to search and seizure analysis. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>216 Conn. 172, 579 A.2d 484 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\"> I also note that, when stating the facts upon which this claim is based, the majority stated that \u201cBirney <em>asked </em>the defendant to approach the cruiser.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See p. 642 of the majority opinion. When applying its legal analysis to these facts, however, it stated that \u201cBirney <em>told </em>the defendant to approach the cruiser.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 653. As I understand the record, the first formulation is accurate. Moreover, there would ordinarily be a difference between a police officer <em>asking </em>and <em>telling </em>a citizen to do something, a distinction that may well be relevant to whether the citizen reasonably believed that he was free to disregard the officer\u2019s request or order, and therefore relevant to the question of whether there was a seizure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b692-7\"> I also take issue with the majority\u2019s scope of review of the trial court\u2019s determination of reasonable and articulable suspicion. The majority subjects that determination to a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review. I disagree. Although the determination of the underlying facts by the trial court is subject only to the limited, \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d scope of review, the ultimate legal judgment of whether those facts amount to reasonable and articulable suspicion is ultimately a legal determination upon which our scope of review is plenary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kyles, </em>221 Conn. 643, 660, 607 A.2d 355 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b693-6\"> These inferences are that: Birney had not received a report of any burglary that night in the area, or a report linking the defendant or Williams to any such burglary; homeless people often dress and carry items similar to those of the defendant and Williams; Williams\u2019 recent arrest for larceny and burglary supplied no suspicion regarding the defendant; and Williams\u2019 lie in response to Birney\u2019s question could not provide reasonable suspicion about the defendant\u2019s activities. Even on its face, this analysis does not pass muster, in my view.</p>\n<p id=\"Auv\">The fact that Birney had not received a burglary report that night did not in and of itself destroy what is nonetheless reasonable and articulable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>suspicion based on <em>all </em>the facts and circumstances available to him, including the series of previous burglaries and Williams\u2019 arrest for burglaries. Similarly, the fact that homeless people might dress similarly to the defendant and Williams did not preclude Birney from forming the reasonable suspicion that these two individuals, dressed as they were, acting as they were, in the place that they were, at that time of night, were burglars. Finally, it is simply not accurate to say that Williams\u2019 lie cannot be attributed in any way to the defendant. Birney did not ask only Williams what <em>she </em>was doing; he asked her \u201cwhat she <em>and the defendant </em>were doing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See p. 641 of the majority opinion. Certainly it was rational and permissible for Birney to infer that her answer was intended for both of them, particularly in the face of the defendant\u2019s silence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b695-6\"> Indeed, the majority also misapplies our own precedent in its analysis of article first, \u00a7 7. The majority cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>186 Conn. 287, 291, 440 A.2d 984, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 878, 103 S. Ct. 173, 74 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1982), for the proposition that we \u201chave thus defined a person as \u2018seized\u2019 <em>under our state constitution </em>when \u2018 \u201cby means of physical force or a show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) See p. 647 of the majority opinion. <em>Ostroski, </em>however, decided no such proposition. Although the defendant in <em>Ostroski </em>had claimed the protection of article first, \u00a7 7, apparently without any independent analysis thereof; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>supra, 290; it is clear that the court\u2019s analysis was confined to the proposition that the defendant had been seized within the meaning, at that time, of the fourth amendment. Thus, there was no occasion for the court in <em>Ostroski </em>to discuss the state constitution. Id., pp. 291-94.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
