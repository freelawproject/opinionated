The license revocation was based on charges of misconduct brought against the plaintiff by the defendant department of health services (department). The trial court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal and remanded the matter to the board for a new hearing. The defendants appealed the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and the plaintiff cross appealed. <em>Dragan </em>v. <em>Connecticut Medical Examining Board, </em>24 Conn. App. 662, 591 A.2d 150 (1991). The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment in part and reversed it in part. We granted the defendants\u2019 petition for certification to appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The facts relevant to the disposition of the certified issues are as follows. The plaintiff is a physician licensed to practice medicine in Connecticut. The defendants are state agencies within the meaning of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq. In May, 1983, the board, on motion of the department, notified the plaintiff of charges it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>was bringing against him and issued an order summarily suspending the plaintiffs medical license pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7\u00a7 4-182 (c) and 19a-17 (c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The charges pertained to the plaintiffs treatment of a patient, Collette Connor, for drug addiction. The board commenced license revocation hearings on June 1, 1983, in accordance with the contested case provisions of the UAPA. The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office also instituted a criminal proceeding against the plaintiff, making factual allegations that were, in part, identical to those that were before the board in its license revocation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">At the same hearing before the board, the department presented Dr. Clayton Weed as its first witness. During cross-examination of Weed, the plaintiff requested that the department produce a letter Weed had written regarding one of the plaintiff\u2019s patients. At that time, the plaintiff also requested copies of any written statements or the substance of any statements made by individuals whom the department intended to call as witnesses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The department agreed to produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>a copy of the letter written by Weed, but would not concede that it was required to produce other documents in its possession. The board instructed the parties to try to reach an agreement and stated that it would rule on the matter if no agreement could be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">At the June 1, 1983 hearing, the department also called Connor to testify. Prior to the department\u2019s direct examination of Connor, the plaintiff asked to inspect the substance of any oral statements Connor had given to the department or the police or any other law enforcement agency that were in the possession of the department. The plaintiff argued that the production of such statements prior to Connor\u2019s direct testimony would enable him to review them while she testified and thereby avoid delay between direct and cross-examination. The board denied the plaintiff\u2019s request. At the conclusion of Connor\u2019s direct examination, the plaintiff once again requested copies of Con-nor\u2019s prior statements. Thereafter, the board stated that the plaintiff had advised it that he had attempted to subpoena certain documents from the Stamford police department that were essential to his cross-examination of Connor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties agreed that the plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination of Connor could be reserved while the plaintiff attempted to obtain corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>pliance with the subpoena. The board indicated that in the interim it would not rule on the plaintiffs request for production of Connor\u2019s prior statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">At the beginning of the next hearing, which was held on June 7, 1983, counsel for the department stated that Connor was having transportation difficulties and had not yet arrived. He stated that she was expected to arrive later that morning. He stated farther that, unless the plaintiff objected, the department would proceed to call other witnesses. The plaintiff did not object, but stated that he had expected to begin cross-examination of Connor that morning. At the same hearing, the department called another of the plaintiff\u2019s patients, Shahin Shahidi Green, as a witness. During the course of cross-examination of Green, the plaintiff requested the disclosure of statements Green had given to the Stamford police department. The board noted that such statements were the subject of an outstanding subpoena issued to the Stamford police department. The plaintiff informed the board that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office had filed a motion in the Stamford Superior Court to quash the plaintiff\u2019s subpoena. The plaintiff stated further that the trial court had stayed the execution of his three subpoenas until June 21, 1983. He requested that he be given the opportunity to recall Green when the trial court had ruled on the state\u2019s motion to quash.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The board granted the plaintiff\u2019s request and suspended the hearing without scheduling another hearing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">On June 21, 1983, the trial court ordered the Stamford police department to produce the plaintiffs patient files as well as any related records, such as insurance records, prescription forms, books, appointment books and certain photographs. The trial court did not, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>ever, rule on the subpoena calling for the release of the prior statements of witnesses. Rather, the trial court requested the plaintiff to submit a memorandum of law in support of his claim that he was entitled to such statements. The plaintiff sent a letter to the department\u2019s counsel, dated July 22, 1983, updating the department on the status of his subpoenas to the Stamford police department and the state\u2019s motion to quash those subpoenas.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff also stated in the letter that \u201cwe would reserve the right to recall Collette Connor and Shahin Green following our cross-examination [at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>next hearing] in the event that additional documents ordered produced by Judge Nigro contain impeachment or other cross-examination material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AKs\">At the next hearing before the board, which was held on August 2, 1983, the plaintiff requested the board to stay the license revocation proceeding until the resolution of the criminal charges pending against him. The board granted the plaintiffs request for a stay and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>entered into a consent order permitting the plaintiff to practice medicine, subject to certain restrictions and conditions, during the period of the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The criminal prosecution concluded on April 4, 1984.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On August 28, 1984, the board resumed the license revocation proceeding. The plaintiff did not request the department or the board to produce Connor at the hearing that day. After the department concluded its case on August 28, the plaintiff presented his case. Upon completion of the plaintiffs testimony, counsel for the plaintiff stated: \u201cI reserve the right to submit any additional exhibits, you know, subject to whatever objections that the Department of Health Services may have.\u201d The board\u2019s chairman noted that \u201cthe hearing is completed now\u201d and then adjourned the hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>On October 23, 1985, the board issued a decision finding that the first six counts of the revised statement of charges had been proven and entered an order permanently revoking the plaintiffs medical license.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The plaintiff appealed the board\u2019s decision to revoke his license to the Superior Court. That court reversed the board\u2019s decision on the following grounds: (1) the plaintiff had been denied his right to cross-examine Connor; (2) the plaintiff should have been furnished with witnesses\u2019 statements prior to the hearing; (3) the board failed to make it clear on the record that all members who had voted on the decision had read the record prior to voting on it; and (4) the board had failed to address certain issues raised by the plaintiff regarding the consent order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court remanded the case to the board and ordered the department to furnish the plaintiff with copies of the prior statements at issue, allow for cross-examination of Connor, and hear evidence and rule on the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>request to terminate the restrictions under the consent order. The defendants appealed to the Appellate Court and the plaintiff cross appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The Appellate Court sustained the trial court\u2019s judgment insofar as it concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s right to cross-examine Connor and his right to the discovery of witnesses\u2019 prior statements had been violated. <em>Dragan </em>v. <em>Connecticut Medical Examining Board, </em>supra, 668. It reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment insofar as it actually ordered the board to implement specific corrective remedies on rehearing, such as the ordering of cross-examination and the disclosure of witnesses\u2019 statements. Id., 669-70.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This appeal followed from our grant of certification to consider whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s right of cross-examination of Connor had been violated and that the plaintiff was entitled by due process of law to the prior statements of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">We now turn to the first issue certified in this case, namely, whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s right to cross-examine Con-nor had been violated. General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 4-178 (3) provided that \u201c[in contested cases] a party may conduct cross-examinations required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.\u201d The defendants acknowledge that the plaintiff had a statutory right to cross-examine Connor, but assert that the plaintiff waived this right by failing to raise such a claim during the license revocation proceedings and by failing to seek appropriate relief from the board. Alternatively, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>defendants claim that the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff did not have an opportunity to cross-examine Connor was incorrect.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We agree with the defendants that the plaintiff waived his right to cross-examine Connor.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The plaintiff asserts at the outset that the defendants cannot raise their claim of waiver before this court because they did not specifically plead it before the trial court. See, e.g., <em>DelVecchio </em>v. <em>DelVecchio, </em>146 Conn. 188, 195, 148 A.2d 554 (1959). This claim is without merit. The plaintiff did not allege that he had been denied the right to cross-examine Connor in his petition to appeal to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Instead, this issue was raised by the trial court during oral arguments on September 20, 1988, more than four years after the conclusion of the board\u2019s hearings. On that date, the court requested the parties to submit memoranda on \u201cthe lack of cross-examination\u201d of Connor. The defendants filed with the trial court a supplemental memorandum in November, 1988, in which they contended that, because the plaintiff had not sought from the board an order compelling Connor\u2019s attendance and had not requested the board to strike her direct testimony, the plaintiff could not prevail on his claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>he had been denied his right to cross-examine Connor. In these circumstances, we conclude that the defendants are not now barred from claiming that the plaintiff waived his right to cross-examine Connor.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">\u201cWaiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right. It is not necessary that a waiver be made in express terms. It may be inferred from the declarations and conduct of the party if it is reasonable to do so.\u201d <em>Cutlip </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>168 Conn. 94, 96, 357 A.2d 918 (1975). In <em>Cutlip, </em>we noted that the plaintiff, who claimed on appeal that his due process rights had been violated because he had not been afforded a reasonable opportunity to obtain counsel, had \u201celected to proceed with the hearing after having been amply informed that he could have counsel if he so desired.\u201d Id. Consequently, we concluded that \u201c[hjaving waived his opportunity to be represented by counsel, the plaintiff cannot now claim that he was denied that opportunity.\u201d Id. Similarly, in <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>202 Conn. 453, 461-63, 521 A.2d 1040 (1987), we held that the plaintiff\u2019s failure promptly to seek disqualification of an adjudicator in a motor vehicle license suspension hearing for engaging in ex parte communications with a witness constituted a waiver of this claim. See also <em>Clisham </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>223 Conn. 354, 367-68, 613 A.2d 254 (1992) (claim that board member was impermissibly biased deemed waived if not raised in timely manner).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Other jurisdictions that have considered whether a plaintiff in an administrative proceeding has waived his right to cross-examine a witness have stated that the right to cross-examine, like other constitutional and statutory rights, can be waived if not asserted in a timely fashion. See, <em>e.g., Martin v. Wolfson, </em>218 Minn. 557, 569, 16 N.W.2d 884 (1944) (\u201cright to have witnesses sworn and subjected to examination in an admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>istrative hearing . . . considered as waived where interested persons participate therein without questioning the procedure\u201d); <em>Joyner </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em>279 N.C. 226, 235, 182 S.E.2d 553, reh. denied, 279 N.C. 397, 183 S.E.2d 241 (1971) (right to cross-examine \u201cis a right which the licensee waives if he does not assert it in apt time\u201d); see also <em>Haaland </em>v. <em>Pomush, </em>263 Minn. 506, 513, 117 N.W.2d 194 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The record does not support the plaintiffs assertion that he properly preserved his right to cross-examine Connor. Throughout the several days of administrative hearings held before the board, which took place over the course of more than one year, the plaintiff never claimed that he had been denied the right to cross-examine Connor. Following the department\u2019s direct examination of Connor, the plaintiff requested that, because he had not yet been able to review Connor\u2019s prior statements, his cross-examination of Connor be <em>reserved </em>while he attempted to obtain compliance with the subpoena to the Stamford police department directing the production of witnesses\u2019 statements. When Con-nor\u2019s appearance at the board\u2019s next scheduled hearing on June 7, 1983, was delayed due to transportation problems, the plaintiff indicated his intention to have cross-examined her that morning, but took no further steps, either later during that hearing or on subsequent hearing dates, to assert his right to undertake Connor\u2019s cross-examination. By contrast, at the close of the hearings on August 28, 1984, more than one year after the hearings had begun, the plaintiff reserved only the right to submit additional <em>exhibits </em>for the board\u2019s consideration. See footnote 8, supra. When the board\u2019s chairman stated that the hearing was completed, the plaintiff did not then assert that he had been denied an opportunity to cross-examine Connor.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s failure to assert in timely fashion his right to cross-examine Connor might arguably be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>excused if he lacked any remedy to compel her presence at a board hearing. The defendants assert, however, that the plaintiffs failure to request the board to subpoena Connor pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19a-10,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or to move the board to strike Connor\u2019s testimony on direct examination resulted in a waiver of the right to raise this claim. See <em>Jutkowitz </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>220 Conn. 86, 95-96, 596 A.2d 374 (1991) (\u201cfailure to utilize remedy available to cure defect can constitute a waiver of the right to object to the alleged defect\u201d). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In response to the defendants\u2019 claim that the plaintiff had failed to request the board to subpoena Con-nor, the plaintiff contends that, on May 24, 1983, he sent a letter to the board requesting it to subpoena Con-nor. We are not persuaded that this measure adequately preserved the plaintiff\u2019s claim that his right to cross-examination had been violated. The letter, sent eight days before the beginning of the board\u2019s hearings, requested the board to subpoena nine witnesses, including Connor. The timing of this request to subpoena numerous witnesses manifests that it was not made in response to any perceived violation of the plaintiff\u2019s right to cross-examine Connor. In fact, the board subsequently advised the plaintiff at the June 1, 1983 hearing that he could subpoena any witness to the hearing. The plaintiff stated that he understood and that he intended to do so. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-85.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Yet at no time thereafter did the plaintiff subpoena Connor to appear or request the board to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>With respect to the defendants\u2019 claim that the plaintiff, to preserve his right of cross-examination, could have moved the court to strike Connor\u2019s testimony on direct examination; see, e.g., <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>205 Conn. 542, 549, 534 A.2d 888 (1987); <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Indusco Management Corporation, </em>164 Conn. 262, 271, 320 A.2d 811 (1973); the plaintiff responds that such an effort would have been futile because the board had \u201cruled against [the plaintiff] on virtually every contested issue of evidence/discovery.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s claim, that moving to strike Connor\u2019s direct testimony would have been futile, is based upon mere speculation and conjecture and, therefore, is meritless. See <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>209 Conn. 310, 316, 551 A.2d 704 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>198 Conn. 506, 512, 503 A.2d 1165 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Because the plaintiff never asserted during the course of the license revocation proceeding that his right to cross-examine Connor had been violated and because he failed to utilize available administrative remedies to cure any alleged defect, we conclude that the plaintiff waived his right to cross-examine Connor. A party to an administrative proceeding cannot be allowed to participate fully at hearings and then, on appeal, raise claims that were not asserted before the board. \u201c \u2018We have made it clear that we will not permit parties to anticipate a favorable decision, reserving a right to impeach it or set it aside if it happens to be against them, for a cause which was well known to them before or during the trial.\u2019 <em>Krattenstein </em>v. <em>G. Fox &amp; Co., </em>155 Conn. 609, 616, 236 A.2d 466 (1967); see <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>199 Conn. 496, 517, 508 A.2d 415 (1986).\u201d <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The second issue certified on appeal is whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>was entitled by due process of law to the statements of various witnesses at the license revocation proceeding hearings. Without conceding that the due process clause required disclosure of witnesses\u2019 prior statements, the defendants contend that the plaintiff waived his right to challenge the nondisclosure of statements by not pursuing this claim before the board. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">At the time of the proceeding to revoke the plaintiff\u2019s medical license, the UAPA did not mandate the disclosure of witnesses\u2019 prior statements either before or during the hearing. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 4-177. In 1989, the legislature enacted General Statutes \u00a7 4-177c, which provides that, in a contested case, \u201ceach party . . . shall be afforded the opportunity to inspect and copy relevant and material records, papers and documents not in the possession of the party of such agency . . . .\u201d The plaintiff asserts that, in enacting \u00a7 4-177c, the legislature merely confirmed that such disclosure was required by the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">We need not decide, however, whether the plaintiff in this case had a due process right to disclosure of witnesses\u2019 statements prior to the enactment of \u00a7 4-177c.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Even if such a right existed, the plaintiff failed promptly and adequately to assert such a right before the board. \u201cWe have held that the failure to raise a procedural claim or the failure to utilize a remedy available to cure a procedural defect can constitute a waiver of the right to object to the alleged defect.\u201d <em>Jutkowitz </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>supra, 95; see also <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>211 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Conn. 508, 536, 560 A.2d 403 (1989); <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 461-63; <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>158 Conn. 208, 213-14, 257 A.2d 795 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">With regard to prehearing discovery, the plaintiff contends that his May 24, 1983 letter to the board adequately preserved any right he might have had to discovery of witnesses\u2019 statements. The letter, however, did not mention disclosure of witnesses\u2019 statements. Instead, in the letter, the plaintiff requested the board to issue subpoenas to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office and the Stamford police department directing the production of the medical and patient files of eighteen of the plaintiff\u2019s patients, prescription forms, insurance forms, correspondence pertaining to the eighteen patients, and the plaintiff\u2019s appointment books. The record does not reflect that the plaintiff made any effort, prior to the hearing, to procure copies of witnesses\u2019 prior statements. By failing to request prehearing discovery of these statements, the plaintiff waived any claimed right to such discovery. See <em>Jutkowitz </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>supra, 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">At the June 1, 1983 hearing, the plaintiff made a general request that the department provide him with copies of prior written statements or the substance of any prior oral statements, in the possession of the department, made by individuals whom the department intended to call as witnesses. The board did not rule on this request, but, rather, instructed the parties to attempt to reach an agreement on the issue of disclosure. Both before and after Connor\u2019s direct testimony on June 1, 1983, the plaintiff requested disclosure of her prior statements. The board denied the plaintiff\u2019s first request and postponed ruling on the second request until the Stamford Superior Court had made a ruling on the plaintiff\u2019s attempt to subpoena documents from the Stamford police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>The plaintiffs July 22, 1983 letter to the department\u2019s counsel; see footnote 6, supra; indicated that its efforts to obtain witnesses\u2019 prior statements were directed solely at the Stamford police department and the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. Rather than contending that the department had an obligation to produce witnesses\u2019 statements or that the board had an obligation to order their production, the plaintiff stated in the letter that the actions of the <em>police department </em>and the <em>state\u2019s attorney </em>to bar enforcement of the subpoenas violated the plaintiff\u2019s right to administrative due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">At no point during the course of the hearings, which spanned more than a one year period, did the plaintiff return to the board and request a ruling on either his general request for disclosure of witnesses\u2019 prior statements or his more specific request for disclosure of Con-nor\u2019s prior statements. Accordingly, we are persuaded that the plaintiff waived any claim of entitlement to the prior statements of any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court with instructions to reach the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-8\"> We granted certification limited to the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">\u201c1.

Lynch, Esq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASV\">Office of the Attorney General</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVz\">30 Trinity Street</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKz\">Hartford, Connecticut 06106</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avq\">RE: Department of Health Services vs. Myroslaw Dragan</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFU\">Dear Mr. Lynch:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALy\">Reference is made to your letter of July 8, 1983 requesting that (1) we advise the Medical Examining Board of the status of the proceedings in Stamford, Connecticut; (2) the parties attempt to reach agreement to proceed in certain areas; and (3) we advise the Board regarding possible hearing dates. We respond below to the foregoing requests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC1\">As you know, the proceedings in Stamford, Connecticut involve motions by the State\u2019s Attorney of the Judicial District of Stamford-Norwalk moving to quash three <em>subpoenas duces tecum </em>issued on behalf of Myroslaw Dragan directing the City of Stamford Police Department to produce records and documents in its possession for use in the instant proceedings. On June 21, 1983, Superior Court Judge Martin L. Nigro heard oral arguments by counsel for both sides and directed the Stamford Police Department, through its representative, the State\u2019s Attorney, to produce the documents called for in our June 10th subpoena consisting of patient files, insurance records etc. as well as any statements of Dr. Dragan called for in our May 31st subpoena.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsV\">On July 5, 1983, after numerous requests on our part, the Police Department released copies of some but not all of the files which Judge Nigro directed it to produce. The remaining records <em>ordered to be produced </em>on June 21, 1983 are expected to be turned over on Monday, July 25, 1983.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anp\">With respect to the remaining records called for in May 31st and June 2nd subpoenas, the Court directed the parties to submit their arguments in writing. On July 14, 1983, we submitted our affidavit and memorandum of law. (Our submission therein was delayed because of the unavailability of hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>ing transcripts of the Medical Board proceeding until July 5, 1983). The State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s response was due on July 21,1983. The Court will then rule on the remaining portion of the motions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2H\">It is our contention both before this Board and in Superior Court that Dr. Dragan is both legally and equitably entitled to production of the remaining documents which, in substantial part, were made available by the Stamford Police Department for inspection by Investigator Kardys of the Department of Health Services for use in initiating the instant proceeding. Indeed, we cannot conceive of more egregious behavior occurring during the course of an administrative hearing than is present here. That is, the Stamford Police Department, the party which was most instrumental in initiating this disciplinary proceeding by releasing to the Department of Health Services much of the information presently under subpoena, is now attempting to defeat Dr. Dragan\u2019s chances of prevailing in this proceeding by withholding vitally important documents necessary to a full cross-examination of the witnesses called to sustain the summary suspension of Dr. Dragan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqP\">We view the attempt by the Stamford Police Department and the State\u2019s Attorney to bar enforcement of duly issued subpoenas in this proceeding as constituting deliberate mischief which can only serve to deny Dr. Dragan his right to administrative due process including his right to a timely hearing and to confront the witnesses against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac3\">As to a further hearing date, we had suggested Tuesday, July 26,1983 with the provision that we would reserve the right to recall Collette Con-nor and Shahin Green following our cross-examination on that date in the event that additional documents ordered produced by Judge Nigro contain impeachment or other cross-examination material. Most recently, Mr. Pavis has advised us that the earliest date on which the Board can resume this hearing is Tuesday, August 2nd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac7\">We, of course, are desirous of an early completion of these proceedings and are prepared to go forward immediately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUhf\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbDO\">Francis J.
