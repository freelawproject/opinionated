Montes and Dalila Montes<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (defendants) appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of strict foreclosure by the trial court rendered in favor of the plaintiff, Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc., on the plaintiffs complaint, and from the judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff on the defendants\u2019 counterclaims. The defendants claim that the trial court\u2019s decision was improper because: (1) the terms and conditions of two second mortgage loan transactions were unconscionable; (2) the plaintiff violated the federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) by its failure accurately to disclose and include, in the finance charge, a fee that it charged the defendants for recording a future assignment of the second mortgage; (3) the plaintiff violated General Statutes \u00a7 <em>36-224l</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>by charg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>ing the defendants a prepaid finance charge that exceeded 10 percent of the principal amount of the loan; and (4) based on the defendants\u2019 first three claims,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), codified in General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We reverse and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The relevant facts are as follows. The defendants were a married couple from Puerto Rico who had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>living on the mainland of the United States for more than twenty years. In February, 1984, the defendants purchased a home in New Haven for $25,000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They financed the purchase with a down payment of $3000 and a $23,700 mortgage loan from People\u2019s Bank, with monthly mortgage payments of $407. In July, 1987, Tech Energy, a Connecticut home repair and improvement company, contacted Dalila Montes and offered to provide vinyl siding for the defendants\u2019 home at a cost of approximately $10,000. The defendants agreed to purchase the siding, and thereafter Tech Energy submitted a loan application of the defendants to the Tolland Bank in order to finance the cost of the siding. The loan application stated that the defendants had a monthly income of $1195. Tolland Bank denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Tech Energy then submitted the same Tolland Bank loan application to the plaintiff in order to obtain a second mortgage loan. The plaintiff approved the loan based upon the following factors, in addition to the information contained in the loan application. The plaintiff had obtained a credit report indicating that the defendants had been regularly paying their first mortgage loan to People\u2019s Bank. The plaintiff also took into consideration the fact that there was \u201cgood loan equity in this case\u201d and that the funds were going to be used to improve the property and, thus, the security for the loan. Furthermore, Dalila Montes stated to the plaintiff\u2019s president that, in addition to the income listed on the application form, Luis Montes \u201chad some additional income\u201d from work in \u201csome sort of trade.\u201d Neither the plaintiff nor the defendants documented the amount of this additional income or its specific source. On the basis of the foregoing information, the plaintiff approved the loan and placed the defendants in a \u201cno-income verification loan program.\u201d Under the \u201cno-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>income verification loan program\u201d the plaintiff did not require the defendants to verify the amount of Luis A. Montes\u2019 additional income.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The loan closing was held on November 16, 1987. The defendants were required to grant to the plaintiff a second mortgage on their residence in order to secure the loan. In order for the plaintiff to obtain a second mortgage position, however, it was necessary to pay off three prior liens on the defendants\u2019 residence\u2014a lien held by the state for child support in the amount of $8950, a lien held by the city of New Haven welfare department in the amount of $1290.31 and a judgment lien for a medical bill in the amount of $2431. These prior liens on the residence totaled $12,671.31. Therefore, the principal amount of the loan, as stated in the note and the loan closing statement, was $26,500,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which included the payment of the prior liens, $9902 for the cost of the siding,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> $1300 in closing costs,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a $2500 prepaid finance charge and $126.69 paid directly to the defendants. The annual interest rate was 18 percent. The promissory note provided that the defendants were to make thirty-five monthly payments of $399.38, and a final \u201cballoon\u201d payment of $26,810.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Approximately seven months later, after they had made seven timely mortgage payments, the defendants sought another loan for approximately $9000 from the plaintiff to be used for additional improvements to their home in order for them to sell it within one year. On the basis of a new credit report indicating that the defendants had continued to pay their first mortgage and had made every payment on the plaintiffs second mortgage, the plaintiff approved the new loan. The loan closing was held on May 26, 1988.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The principal amount of the new loan, as stated in the note and the loan closing statement, was $43,500,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which included $27,070.05 to pay off the November, 1987 loan, $2451.33 in closing costs,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> a $4350 prepaid finance charge and $9628.62 paid directly to the defendants. The annual interest rate was 19 percent. The promissory note provided that the defendants were to make thirty-five monthly payments of $691.17, and a final \u201cballoon\u201d payment of $44,075.03. The defendants made no payments on this mortgage loan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>The plaintiff thereafter filed this foreclosure action. The defendants proffered special defenses, alleging failure to release the November, 1987 mortgage, an unconscionable contract and a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 <em>36-2241. </em>The defendants also filed counterclaims alleging violations of CUTPA, TILA and \u00a7 36-224l. The trial court rejected the defendants\u2019 special defenses and counterclaims and rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure. The defendants appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The defendants\u2019 first claim is that the trial court improperly concluded that the terms of the two second mortgage loan transactions were not unconscionable and thus were enforceable. The defendants argue that the loan transactions were procedurally unconscionable, due to the defendants\u2019 \u201clack of knowledge and lack of voluntariness,\u201d and that the transactions were substantively unconscionable due to the \u201coppressive character of the contract terms.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude, however, from the facts as found by the trial court and as supported by sufficient evidence in the record, that the mortgage transactions in question were not unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">We first consider our standard of review of a claim of unconscionability. \u201cThe question of unconscionability is a matter of law to be decided by the court based on all the facts and circumstances of the case. <em>Iamar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>tino </em>v. <em>Avallone, </em>2 Conn. App. 119, 125, 477 A.2d 124 (1984); see <em>Hamm </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>180 Conn. 491, 493, 429 A.2d 946 (1980). <em>Fairfield Lease Corporation </em>v. <em>Romano\u2019s Auto Service, </em>4 Conn. App. 495, 498, 495 A.2d 286 (1985). Thus, our review on appeal is unlimited by the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Iamartino </em>v. <em>Avallone, </em>supra.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Texaco, I\u00f1c. </em>v. <em>Golart, </em>206 Conn. 454, 461, 538 A.2d 1017 (1988). This means that the ultimate determination of whether a transaction is unconscionable is a question of law, not a question of fact, and that the trial court\u2019s determination on that issue is subject to a plenary review on appeal. It also means, however, that the factual findings of the trial court that underlie that determination are entitled to the same deference on appeal that other factual findings command. Thus, those findings must stand unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). This is particularly apt in a case such as this, where the factual claims involve the extent of the defendants\u2019 lack of commercial acumen, their unfamiliarity with the English language resulting in their inability to comprehend the terms of the mortgage that they signed, and their unfamiliarity with the ordinary incidents of mortgage loans. The trial court is in a unique position to assess such factual questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u201cThe purpose of the doctrine of unconscionability is to prevent oppression and unfair surprise. J. Calamari &amp; J. Perillo, Contracts (3d Ed.) \u00a7 9-40.\u201d <em>Edart Truck Rental Corporation </em>v. <em>B. Swirsky &amp; Co., </em>23 Conn. App. 137, 142, 579 A.2d 133 (1990). \u201cAs applied to real estate mortgages, the doctrine of unconscionability draws heavily on its counterpart in the Uniform Commercial Code which, although formally limited to transactions involving personal property, furnishes a useful guide for real property transactions. <em>Olean </em>v. <em>Treglia, </em>190 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Conn. 756, 762, 463 A.2d 242 (1983); <em>Hamm </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>[supra, 495].\u201d <em>Iamartino </em>v. <em>Avallone, </em>supra, 125; see generally A. Leff, \u201cUnconscionability and the Code\u2014The Emperor\u2019s New Clause,\u201d 115 U. Pa. L. Rev. 485, 546, 550-53 (1967); M. Ellinghaus, \u201cIn Defense of Unconscionability,\u201d 78 Yale L.J. 757, 812-14 (1969). \u201cAs Official Comment 1 to \u00a7 2-302 of the Uniform Commercial Code suggests, [t]he basic test is whether, in the light of the general commercial background and the commercial needs of the particular trade or case, the clauses involved are so one-sided as to be unconscionable under the circumstances existing at the time of the making of the contract. <em>Hamm </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>supra, 495-96.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Golart, </em>supra, 462. The determination of unconscionability is to be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances. Id. Applying this test to the underlying facts found by the trial court, we conclude that the defendants have not established that the mortgage transactions in question were either procedurally or substantively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The defendants argue that the mortgage loan transactions were procedurally unconscionable due to their \u201clack of knowledge\u201d about the terms of the loans and their \u201clack of voluntariness\u201d in entering into the loans. The defendants argue that because of their illiteracy in English and their lack of business acumen, the terms of the mortgages unfairly surprised them and that, therefore, there was a \u201clack of voluntariness\u201d in the transactions. The defendants bolster this claim by the fact that they were unrepresented by counsel in both loan transactions. They contend, moreover, that they did not know that they would have to pay off the prior liens on their home in order to obtain the November, 1987 mortgage loan. Were the defendants\u2019 arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>based upon favorable factual findings, they might well have prevailed on appeal. Their assertions, however, are contrary to the facts found by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The trial court found, on the basis of its observation of both defendants, who testified without the aid of a Spanish interpreter, that neither defendant had any difficulty with the English language, in understanding any questions put to them by counsel or the court, or in understanding the judicial proceedings. The court also found that the defendants had entered into a prior mortgage transaction, namely, their first mortgage with People\u2019s Bank. The court further found that the defendants were \u201cintelligent and energetic\u201d persons, and that, having lived in the mainland United States for more than twenty years, they understood its judicial, \u201clegal and financial systems.\u201d Finally, the court found that the defendants defaulted on the mortgage, not because they did not understand their obligations thereunder or because their income while living together was insufficient to support the mortgage payments, but because the breakdown of their marriage subsequent to the mortgage closing impaired their financial situation. These findings are adequately supported by the evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Both defendants testified that the attorney closing the loan fully explained the documents to them. Luis Montes testified that he had no questions and Dalila Montes testified that she fully understood the terms of the loan. The attorney for the plaintiff testified that he had spent approximately one-half hour fully explaining each document to them. Furthermore, Dalila Montes testified that although the plaintiff\u2019s lending officer spoke both English and Spanish, Dalila Montes spoke to her only in English. Regarding the defendants\u2019 lack of business acumen, the defendants had been through a loan closing once before when they had purchased their home and, therefore, the trial court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>entitled to infer that they had had some experience with loan transactions. Moreover, although the defendants had a right to be represented by their own counsel, which was fully explained to them by the plaintiffs attorney, the defendants signed a form waiving that right. Also, the plaintiffs president testified that \u201c[e]very customer we work on is told right up front [that] we would have to secure a second position on the security.\u201d The trial court could infer from this statement that the defendants were so informed. Further, it is clearly stated on the forms, which were fully explained to the defendants, that the prior liens on their home were being paid. There was evidence, moreover, that the defendants\u2019 financial situation had deteriorated after they had separated, and that Dalila Montes had used some of the mortgage proceeds to pay her legal fees resulting from their marital dissolution. Finally, although Dalila Montes testified that she could not read or write in any language and although Luis Montes testified that he speaks English only a \u201clittle bit,\u201d the trial court was not required to, and did not, credit that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings, adverse to the defendants\u2019 claims of procedural unconscionability, are supported by the record and are not clearly erroneous. On the basis of those findings and the record, we cannot conclude that this transaction was procedurally unconscionable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The defendants next argue that the mortgage loan transactions were substantively unconscionable due to the oppressive \u201cmathematics\u201d of the loan transaction. This claim is based on the defendants\u2019 contention that they had only the $1195 in monthly income listed on the loan application form with which to pay the $1098 monthly mortgage payments due for the first and second mortgages. Thus, the defendants argue, they were left with only $97 per month for living expenses after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>the mortgage payments. On the basis of these figures, they claim \u201cit is obvious that [the plaintiff did not] believe the defendants would make the payments,\u201d and that the plaintiff intended only to foreclose on the loan in order to reap the equity in their home. This argument, however, like the defendants\u2019 earlier arguments regarding procedural unconscionability, founders on the absence of a factual foundation. First, the trial court did not find either that the plaintiff believed that the defendants would fail to make their mortgage payments, or that the plaintiff intended simply to reap the defendants\u2019 equity in the home by making a loan to them that the plaintiff knew they could not repay. Nor is such a finding compelled by this record, because there was evidence to support a contrary finding, namely, that the defendants were able, and considered themselves able, to make the payments.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s president testified that Dalila Montes had told the plaintiff that her husband had additional income. Therefore, the plaintiff could reasonably have believed that the defendants had more monthly income than was reported on the loan application form. Such a belief was somewhat bolstered by the fact that the defendants had made every mortgage payment on their first mortgage and had made all seven payments on the initial, November, 1987 loan.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>defendants represented to the plaintiff that they intended to use the loan proceeds to improve their home so that they could sell it within one year. Since the defendants had made the previous seven loan payments, there was evidence to support a finding that the plaintiff could have reasonably believed that the defendants would continue to do so until they sold the property within the year. Moreover, the trial court specifically found that the defendants\u2019 separation and marital dissolution caused their default. Thus, although in a case where the court has found an intentional reaping of equity a mortgagor might prevail on a claim of unconscionability, this record does not compel such an inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The defendants next argue that it was unconscionable for the plaintiff to charge a 10 percent prepaid finance charge on the November, 1987 loan transaction and then charge another 10 percent prepaid finance charge again, within six months, on the May, 1988 loan transaction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 <em>36-2241 </em>permits a person engaged in the secondary mortgage loan business, such as the plaintiff, to charge prepaid finance charges in an amount not greater than 10 percent of the principal amount of the loan. See footnote 3, supra. The November, 1987 transaction was unrelated to the May, 1988 transaction. The defendants sought the loan in November, 1987, in order to finance vinyl siding for their home. In May, 1988, the defendants sought a loan for additional home improvements, with the intention to sell the property within one year.</p>\n<p id=\"AOU\">Had the defendants obtained the May, 1988 loan from a second mortgage company other than the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>that company certainly could have required payment of the November, 1987 loan in order to secure a second mortgage position and could have charged 10 percent in prepaid finance charges pursuant to \u00a7 36-224l. Thus, the fact that the plaintiff charged the same amount for undertaking a new and increased risk does not ipso facto make this transaction unconscionable. Moreover, there was no evidence that the interest rates or points charged on either loan, or on the two loans taken together, were beyond the ordinary charges then prevailing in the secondary loan market. Indeed, the only evidence regarding that issue was that those charges were \u201cin the middle of the market on the private sector loan.\u201d We cannot conclude, therefore, that, solely because the plaintiff charged a total of twenty points on two separate, albeit closely related in time, loan transactions, that the second loan transaction was unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In sum, while the defendants may have been imprudent in entering into the May, 1988 transaction, we cannot conclude, on the basis of the record in this case, that the defendants were oppressed or unfairly surprised, or that the terms of the transactions were so one-sided as to be unconscionable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The defendants\u2019 second claim is that the plaintiff violated the federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) by its failure accurately to disclose and include, as part of the finance charge, a fee that it charged the defendants for recording a future assignment of the May, 1988 mortgage. The defendants seek, therefore, to rescind the May, 1988 mortgage loan transaction. The plaintiff claims that such fees are specifically exempted from the finance charge and, therefore, it was not required to disclose and include such a charge in the finance charge. We agree with the defendants that the plaintiff violated TILA.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>The following facts are relevant to this issue. In both the November, 1987 and May, 1988 mortgage loan transactions, the plaintiff included in the amount financed by the defendants a fifty dollar recording fee.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In both transactions the plaintiff also charged the defendants a prepaid finance charge. During the trial, the plaintiffs president testified that the fifty dollar recording fee charged in each transaction included fees to record the mortgage, to record any releases, and to record any future assignment of the mortgage to a buyer of the mortgage loan. Thus, in the November, 1987 loan transaction, $27.50 was charged to the defendants to record the mortgage and releases, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-34a (a),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and $22.50 was charged to record, in the future, the assignment of the mortgage to a buyer of the mortgage loan.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The plaintiff, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>never assigned the mortgage and, thus, never incurred a recording fee for such an assignment. In the May, 1988 loan transaction, $17.50 was charged to record the mortgage and to record the release of the November, 1987 mortgage, and $32.50 was charged to record any future assignment of the mortgage.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This mortgage, however, was also never assigned. The defendants claim that the failure accurately to disclose and include, in the finance charge, the fees charged to the defendants to record a future assignment of the mortgage violated TILA. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u201cWe approach this question according to well established principles of statutory construction designed to further our fundamental objective of ascertaining and giving effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 673, 509 A.2d 20 (1986); <em>Hayes </em>v. Smith, 194 Conn. 52, 57, 480 A.2d 425 (1984). In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. <em>Dart &amp; Bogue Co. </em>v. <em>Slosberg, </em>202 Conn. 566, 572, 522 A.2d 763 (1987) .... <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. 583, 589, 522 A.2d 771 (1987).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 459, 600 A.2d 310 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The federal Truth in Lending Act, as amended in particular by the Truth-in-Lending Simplification Reform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Act of 1980, was enacted as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act of 1968, and is codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 et seq. The purpose of TILA is \u201cto promote the informed use of consumer credit by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.1 (b). Title 15 of the United States Code, \u00a7 1604 provides that \u201c[t]he Board [of Governors of the Federal Reserve System] shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this title [15 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1601 et seq.]\u201d That board has promulgated TILA regulations, known as Regulation Z, which are codified at 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.1 et seq. (Regulation Z).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u201cThe regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to authority of the Truth in Lending Act require that the cost of credit, or, in the words of the regulations, the \u2018finance charge\u2019 be clearly disclosed and that its component charges be identified.\u201d <em>George </em>v. <em>General Finance Corporation of Louisiana, </em>414 F. Sup. 33, 34 (E.D. La. 1976). We must first determine, therefore, whether a fee charged to a borrower to record a future mortgage assignment is a finance charge. If we conclude that such a fee is a finance charge, we must then determine what disclosure requirements TILA imposes on a lender and whether the plaintiff violated TILA by not complying with those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.4 (a) defines a finance charge as \u201cthe cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount. It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of the extension of credit.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Based on this definition, a fee charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>to a borrower to record the future assignment of a mortgage is a finance charge because it certainly is a charge payable directly by the consumer and imposed directly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit. This conclusion is bolstered by Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.4 (b) (6) which states that a finance charge includes \u201c[c]harges imposed on a creditor by another person for purchasing ... a consumer\u2019s obligation, if the consumer is required to pay the charges in cash as an addition to the obligation . . . .\u201d In the present case, the plaintiff required the defendants to pay in cash a \u201c[charge] imposed on [the plaintiff] by another person [namely, an assignee,] for purchasing . . . [the defendants\u2019] obligation . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The plaintiff argues, however, that a charge for the future assignment of the mortgage falls within two exemptions from the definition of finance charge\u2014Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.4 (c) (7) (i) and (e) (1). We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.4 (c) (7) (i) excludes from the definition of finance charge \u201c[f]ees for title examination, abstract of title, title insurance, property survey, and similar purposes.\u201d A fee for recording a future assignment of the mortgage is not a fee for such a \u201csimilar [purpose].\u201d The purposes of the specified fees are to ensure that the borrower actually owns the property in question, and that the lender\u2019s security interest therein is protected. Recording of a potential future assignment, however, does not share either of those closely related purposes; rather, it relates solely to the lender\u2019s future attempt to realize its investment in the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Similarly, Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.4 (e) (1) specifically exempts certain security interest charges from the definition of finance charge, including \u201cfees prescribed by law that actually are or will be paid to public officials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>for . . . perfecting . . . a security interest.\u201d A fee for recording a future assignment of the mortgage does not relate to a perfection of the security interest created by the mortgage. That security interest was perfected when the mortgage itself was recorded. Furthermore, those two sections of Regulation Z apply to fees charged to a borrower that relate to the loan transaction at hand. In the present case, the potential assignment of the mortgage to another person would have been unrelated to the loan made to the defendants, but would have related to a separate future transaction between the plaintiff and a buyer of the mortgage loan. Our conclusion is supported by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605 (d) and (e), which exclude certain fees from the definition of finance charge if they are fees <em>\u201cwith respect to that transaction.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) We conclude, therefore, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>a fee charged to a borrower to record the future assignment of a mortgage is a finance charge and that since, in the present case, the charge was paid at the consummation of the transaction, it was a prepaid finance charge.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Our conclusion is in accord with at least one other court. See <em>In re Brown, </em>106 B.R. 852 (Bankr.E.D. Pa. 1989); but see <em>Shroder </em>v. <em>Suburban Coastal Corporation, </em>729 F.2d 1371 (11th Cir. 1984).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Having concluded that the fee charged to the defendants to record the future assignment of the mortgage was a prepaid finance charge, we next consider what disclosure requirements TILA imposed on the plaintiff and whether the plaintiff complied with such requirements. A lender is required to make \u201cmaterial disclosures\u201d to a borrower and, if it fails to do so, the borrower has the right to rescind the loan transaction. Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.23 (a) (3). Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.23 (a) (3) n.48 provides that \u201c[t]he term <em>material disclosures </em>means [inter alia,] the required disclosures of the . . . finance charge . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.18 requires: \u201cFor each transaction the creditor shall disclose the . . . (d) . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>finance charge . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.18 (c) (1) (iv) further mandates a lender to itemize, in the amount financed, the \u201cprepaid finance charge.\u201d Thus, the failure of a lender accurately to disclose both the prepaid finance charge and the overall finance charge constitutes a violation of TILA.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">In the present case, the prepaid finance charge that was disclosed to the defendants in the November, 1987 loan transaction was $2500. The actual finance charge, however, that should have been disclosed was $2522.50, which included the $22.50 future mortgage assignment recording fee that was charged to the defendants. Similarly, the finance charge that was disclosed to the defendants in the May, 1988 loan transaction was $4350. The actual finance charge, however, that should have been disclosed was $4405, which included the $32.50 charge to the defendants for the future assignment of the May, 1988 mortgage and the $22.50 charge to the defendants for the future assignment of the November, 1987 mortgage, mortgages that were never actually assigned.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, the plaintiff failed accurately to disclose and include the future mortgage assignment recording fee in the prepaid finance charge. Since this charge was not included in the prepaid finance charge, the overall finance charge was also underdisclosed. This resulted in a material nondisclosure in violation of TILA and, therefore, the defendants had the right to rescind the May, 1988 loan transaction. We recognize that non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>disclosure of a $55 fee may seem minuscule in the context of a $43,500 loan transaction. \u201cHowever, once the court finds a violation, no matter how technical, it has no discretion with respect to the imposition of liability.\u201d <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Imperial Motors, </em>539 F.2d 506, 510 (5th Cir. 1976); see also <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Award Dodge, Inc., </em>620 F. Sup. 135 (D. Conn. 1985) (failure of creditor to disclose $1 as filing fee to list creditor\u2019s security interest violated TILA).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Having concluded that the plaintiff violated TILA by failing accurately to disclose and include, in the prepaid finance charge, the future mortgage assignment recording fee, we next turn to the defendants\u2019 remedies for such a violation. Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.23 (a) (1) provides that \u201c[i]n a credit transaction in which a security interest is or will be retained . . . each consumer . . . shall have the right to rescind the transaction . . . .\u201d Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.23 (a) (3) further provides that \u201c[i]f the required . . . material disclosures are not delivered, the right to rescind shall expire 3 years after consummation [of the transaction] . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Thus, the defendants had the right to rescind the May, 1988 loan transaction within three years of the consummation of the loan transaction. The defendants claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>that since they rescinded the loan on October 15, 1990, within three years of the May, 1988 transaction, they timely rescinded the transaction. Because the issue of whether the defendants effectively rescinded the transaction was not considered by the trial court and was not briefed on appeal, we remand the case to the trial court for a determination of the rights and remedies afforded the defendants for the plaintiffs TILA violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The defendants\u2019 third claim is that the plaintiff violated General Statutes \u00a7 <em>36-2241; </em>see footnote 3, supra; in the May, 1988 loan transaction by charging the defendants a prepaid finance charge that exceeded 10 percent of the principal amount of the loan. On the basis of our analysis in part II of this opinion, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Section <em>36-224l </em>(a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o person engaged in the secondary mortgage loan business in this state as a lender or a broker . . . may (1) charge . . . directly or indirectly, as an incident to or a condition of the extension of credit in any secondary mortgage loan transaction, any loan fees, points, commissions, transaction fees or similar prepaid finance charges determined in accordance with chapter 657 and regulations adopted thereunder which exceed in the aggregate ten per cent of the principal amount of the loan . . . .\u201d The statute is clear and unambiguous on its face that a second mortgage lender cannot charge a prepaid finance charge that exceeds 10 percent of the principal amount of the loan. In the present case, the principal amount of the May, 1988 loan was $39,150.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>As we concluded in part II of this opinion, the actual amount of the prepaid finance charge was $4405<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> or approximately 11 percent of the principal amount of the loan.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Therefore, the plaintiff violated \u00a7 36-224l<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>with respect to the May, 1988 loan transaction.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Having concluded that the plaintiff violated \u00a7 36-224l (a), we remand the issue of the defendants\u2019 remedies to the trial court.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The defendants\u2019 final claim is that the plaintiff violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA); see footnote 5, supra; because of: (1) the unconscionability of the mortgage loan transactions; (2) the plaintiff\u2019s violation of General Statutes \u00a7 36-224l; and (3) the plaintiff\u2019s violation of the federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA). We agree that the plaintiff\u2019s violation of \u00a7 36-224l and TILA constituted a violation of CUTPA.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">It is well settled that in determining whether a practice violates CUTPA we have \u201cadopted the criteria set out in the \u2018cigarette rule\u2019 by the federal trade commission for determining when a practice is unfair: \u2018(1) [W]hether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise\u2014whether, in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some common law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers [competitors or other businessmen].\u2019 <em>Conaway </em>v. <em>Prestia, </em>[191 Conn. 484, 492-93, 464 A.2d 847 (1983)], quoting <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>405 U.S. 233, 244-45 n.5, 92 S.

A practice may be unfair because of the degree to which it meets one of the criteria or because to a lesser extent it meets all three. Statement of Basis and Purpose, Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising and Business Opportunity Ventures, 43 Fed. Reg. 59,614, [and] 59,635 (1978).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 569 n.15. \u201cThus a violation of CUTPA may be established by showing either an actual deceptive practice; see, e.g., <em>Sprayfoam, Inc. </em>v. <em>Durant\u2019s Rental Centers, Inc., </em>39 Conn. Sup. 78, 468 A.2d 951 (1983); or a practice amounting to a violation of public policy. See, e.g., <em>Sportsmen\u2019s Boating Corporation </em>v. <em>Hensley, </em>[192 Conn. 747, 474 A.2d 780 (1984)].\u201d <em>Web Press Services Corporation </em>v. <em>New London Motors, Inc., </em>203 Conn. 342, 355, 525 A.2d 57 (1987). Furthermore, a party need not prove an intent to deceive to prevail under CUTPA. See id., 363 (knowledge of falsity, either constructive or actual, need not be proven to establish CUTPA violation).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>The first criterion of the <em>Sperry </em>rule requires us to consider whether the unfair practice alleged, in the present case, a violation of \u00a7 36-2247 and TILA, offends public policy to the extent that it constitutes a breach of established concepts of fairness. <em>Web Press Services Corporation </em>v. <em>New London Motors, Inc., </em>supra, 355. We conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s violations of both statutes amount to such a breach. This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the plaintiff violated two different statutes, each implementing different public policies and effectuating those policies through different legislative means. An examination of each statute\u2019s public policies, and means of effectuating those policies, is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The primary public policy underlying TILA is to promote \u201cthe informed use of consumer credit.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.1 (b). Title 15 of the United States Code, \u00a7 1601 (a) states in relevant part that \u201cthe purpose of [TILA is] to <em>assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms </em>so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The House of Representatives report accompanying TILA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>provides that \u201c[y]our committee believes that <em>... the credit disclosure features of [TILA] . . . [are] fundamental to its legislative purpose. </em>This aspect of the bill is designed to provide consumers with basic information in connection with their credit transactions so that they may effectively \u2018comparison shop\u2019 for credit in order to obtain credit on the most favorable terms available in the market place.\u201d (Emphasis added.) H. Rep. No. 1040, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 18, reprinted in 1968 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1975. Thus, TILA seeks to effectuate its public policy of promoting the informed use of credit by requiring lenders to disclose credit terms to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">By promoting the informed use of credit, TILA also seeks to increase competition and to protect consumers from unfair practices. For example, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 (a) states that TILA was enacted because \u201cCongress [found] that economic stabilization would be enhanced and the competition among the various financial institutions and other firms engaged in the extension of consumer credit would be strengthened by the informed use of credit.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The House of Representatives report further provides that \u201c[f]or the relatively unsophisticated consumer, particularly those of modest means, [TILA] . . . will provide their only protection against unscrupulous merchants or lenders. . . .These provisions not only will protect the consumer, but will further protect the honest businessman from unethi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>cal forms of competition engaged in by some unscrupulous creditors who prey upon the poor through deceptive credit practices.\u201d H. Rep. No. 1040, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 18, reprinted in 1968 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1975-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">TILA does not, however, seek to effectuate its public policies by imposing a cap on any credit terms. \u201c[T]he truth in lending and credit advertising title, neither regulates the credit industry, nor does it impose ceilings on credit charges. It provides for full disclosure of credit charges, rather than regulation of the terms and conditions under which credit may be extended. It is the view of your committee that such full disclosure would aid the consumer in deciding for himself the reasonableness of the credit charges imposed and further permit the consumer to \u2018comparison shop\u2019 for credit. It is your committee\u2019s view that full disclosure of the terms and conditions of credit charges will encourage a wiser and more judicious use of consumer credit.\u201d H. Rep. No. 1040, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 7, reprinted in 1968 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The primary public policy underlying \u00a7 36-224l is to protect consumers of credit regardless of whether they are informed of the credit terms. This statute is particularly aimed at those consumers who will pay an exorbitant prepaid finance charge because they desperately require credit. In hearings before the Banking Joint Standing Committee, the then department of banking commissioner Brian J. Woolf<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> stated: \u201cUnfortunately the individual [credit consumers are] in a posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>tion in which they . . . desperately [need] . . . funds and when one desperately needs funds they are willing to pay\u2014take out a loan for $10,000, a loan that's only going to [give them] $6,000 after they have paid the upfront fees . . . .\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Banks, 1983 Sess., p. 29. Woolf further stated that \u201cthere does come a point in time where ... a person ... of this kind who is desperate in the need of funds should have some type of protection and I think that there is a . . . time when a government . . . [sees] gross abuses, I think that it's time the government should\u2014step in and say, well, the limit has been reached and therefore some type of protection is necessary for the . . . [consumer].''Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Banks, 1983 Sess., p. 31. \u201cI think the best approach would be to limit . . . [the] upfront points that any second mortgage lender can charge to a\u2014to a borrower.\u201d Id., p. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Section 36-224l, thus, effectuates its public policy through different legislative means than does TILA. Rather than requiring a lender to disclose the prepaid finance charge to the consumer of credit, \u00a7 <em>36-2241 </em>requires that a lender cannot charge a prepaid finance charge that exceeds 10 percent of the principal amount of the loan. Thus, while TILA seeks to promote the informed use of consumer credit by requiring lenders to disclose credit terms, \u00a7 36-224l seeks to protect credit consumers, particularly those who desperately require credit and whose choice of creditors is limited, by limiting the prepaid finance charge that a lender can charge to a borrower.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Section <em>36-224l </em>also seeks to protect a more narrow class of consumers, namely, consumers of credit in the secondary mortgage market. Second mortgage businesses often aggressively advertise the ease with which a consumer can obtain credit. Furthermore, such advertisements are often aimed at unsophisticated and desperate consumers. In hearings before the Joint Standing Committee on Banks, in response to questions by various Senators and Representatives, Raphael Podolsky, a representative from the Legal Services Training and Advocacy Project, stated that \u201c[t]his is not a competitive market in kind of a classic economic sense. You have to remember that unlike say [Connecticut Bank and Trust Company], which does not go out and aggressively push in second mortgage loans. This is an industry in which people go out and try and sell you a loan. They may contact you at your house. They may make aggressive use of advertising. Unless the customer is fairly sophisticated and understands that they could go shopping at a bank and maybe get a better deal, they very often don\u2019t know that there are alternative ways of financing plus they tend to be upgraded.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Banks, 1983 Sess., p. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>In light of the foregoing, it is clear that \u00a7 <em>36-224l </em>and TILA both express equally strong, yet different, public policies of informing and protecting consumers of credit. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff\u2019s violations of both statutes offend public policy so as to amount to an established concept of unfairness.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Turning to the second criterion of the <em>Sperry </em>rule, we must consider whether the plaintiff\u2019s violation of TILA and \u00a7 <em>36-224l </em>was \u201cimmoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous.\u201d Our consideration of this criterion is guided by the factual findings of the trial court. The court found that \u201cthe actions of the plaintiff were not unfair or deceptive in the conduct of its business nor were they immoral or unethical or oppressive or unscrupulous . . . .\u201d Since the record does not reflect any intent by the plaintiff to deceive the defendants, we conclude that these factual findings are not clearly erroneous. We therefore conclude that the second criterion of the <em>Sperry </em>rule has not been satisfied in this case. We note, however, that \u201c \u2018[a]ll three criteria do not need to be satisfied to support a finding of unfairness. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>McLaughlin Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>supra, 569 n.15. Therefore, we turn to the third criterion of the <em>Sperry </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The third criterion requires us to consider whether the plaintiff\u2019s violation of TILA and \u00a7 36-224l caused substantial injury to the defendants. In considering this criterion, the Federal Trade Commission has stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>\u201c \u2018The independent nature of the consumer injury criterion does not mean that every consumer injury is legally \u201cunfair,\u201d however. To justify a finding of unfairness the injury must satisfy three tests. It must be substantial; it must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition that the practice produces; and it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided.\u2019 \u201d <em>McLaughlin Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>supra, 569-70, quoting letter from Federal Trade Commission to Senators Ford and Danforth (Dec. 17, 1980) (reprinted in Averitt, \u201cThe Meaning of \u2018Unfair Acts or Practices\u2019 in \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,\u201d 70 Geo. L.J. 225, 291 [1981]). We conclude that, in the present case, the plaintiff\u2019s violation of TILA and \u00a7 36-2247 did cause the defendants substantial injury. We cannot conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s TILA violation, by itself, in failing accurately to disclose and include $55 in the prepaid finance charge, caused the defendants a substantial injury. This TILA violation, however, coupled with the plaintiff\u2019s violation of \u00a7 36-224l did cause the defendants a substantial injury since they were charged a prepaid finance charge of $490; see footnote 30, supra; or a full percentage point above the maximum 10 percent of the principal amount of the loan that a lender may charge to a borrower pursuant to \u00a7 36-2247.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">On the the basis of the foregoing considerations, we conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s violations of TILA and \u00a7 36-224l did cause substantial injury to the defendants. Although the second criterion of the <em>Sperry </em>rule has not been met, the degree to which the other two criteria have been met leads us to conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s violation of TILA and \u00a7 36-224l was an unfair trade practice in violation of CUTPA. See <em>McLaughlin Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>supra, 569 n.15. This conclusion is particularly appropriate since CUTPA\u2019s \u201ccover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>age is broad and its purpose remedial. <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corporation, </em>184 Conn. 607, 616, 440 A.2d 810 (1981).\u201d Id., 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Having concluded that a violation of either \u00a7 <em>36-2241 </em>or TILA may constitute a violation of CUTPA, we next turn to the defendants' remedies under CUTPA. General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> provides the remedy for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>CUTPA violation and states in subsection (a) that \u201c[a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment of a method, act or practice prohibited by section 42-110b, [see footnote 5, supra,] may . . . recover actual damages.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Subsection (d) further provides for recovery of costs, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and injunctive or other equitable relief. See footnote 41, supra. These elements of relief will have to be determined on the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">In their special defenses and counterclaims, the defendants pleaded that the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage was unenforceable. As noted above, the issues of remedies flowing from those defenses and counterclaims were not considered by the trial court or briefed in this court. Accordingly, we have, with respect to the defendants\u2019 special defenses and counterclaims based upon TILA, CUTPA and \u00a7 <em>36-2241, </em>left the issues of the appropriate remedies therefor to the trial court upon the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">If the trial court concludes that any such remedy justifies withholding enforcement of the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage, the judgment on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint must be reversed. If, however, the trial court does not conclude that any such remedy justifies withholding enforcement of the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage, the judgment on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint must be affirmed and new law days set.

Certain fees relating to a loan transaction, such as recording fees, document preparation fees and credit investigation fees, are specifically excluded from the definition of a finance charge and, thus, a lender may include these fees as part of the amount financed, which increases the amount a borrower must borrow. See 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.4 (1992). The finance charge, conversely, ordinarily consists of the prepaid finance charge, commonly known as the points, and the interest that the borrower will pay over the life of the loan.

The plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Shroder </em>v. <em>Suburban Coastal Corporation, </em>729 F.2d 1371 (11th Cir. 1984), for the proposition that a charge to borrowers for the recording of a future assignment of a mortgage is not a finance charge, is tenuous. In that case, the court noted that \u201c[t]he fee for recording assignment of the mortgage was sufficiently itemized on the Truth-in-Lending disclosure statement. There was no lumping together of various fees under the heading \u2018official fees.\u2019 The item \u2018recording fees\u2019 was broken down into deed, mortgage, and other. The fee for recording assignment of the mortgage was entered under the item \u2018other.\u2019 \u201d Id., 1382. In the present case, unlike in <em>Shroder, </em>nowhere on the plaintiff\u2019s disclosure statement was the charge to record the future assignment of the mortgage disclosed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b123-6\"> Title 15 of the United States Code, \u00a7 1638 (a) (3) similarly mandates a creditor to disclose the \u201c \u2018finance charge\u2019, not itemized, using that term.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\"> Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.20 (a), entitled \u201cRefinancings,\u201d provides that \u201c[t]he new finance charge [in a refinancing] <em>shall include any unearned portion of the old finance charge </em>that is not credited to the existing obligation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Since, as we have concluded, the $22.50 future mortgage assignment recording fee charged to the defendants in the November, 1987 loan transaction was a finance charge, and since that recording fee was never incurred by the plaintiff and was thus an \u201cunearned portion of the old finance charge\u201d in the May, 1988 refinancing, it should have been included as part of the finance charge in the May, 1988 loan transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b124-6\"> We note that even though a technical violation of TILA subjects a lender to liability, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640 (c) provides that \u201c[a] creditor . . . may not be held liable . . . for a [TILA] violation . . . if the creditor . . . shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error . . . .\u201d That section further provides, however, that \u201can error of legal judgment with respect to a person\u2019s obligations under this subchapter is not a bona fide error.\u201d Since the plaintiff\u2019s decision not to include the future mortgage assignment fee in the finance charge was an error of legal judgment with respect to its obligations under TILA, it was not a bona fide error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\"> Title 15 of the United States Code, \u00a7 1635 (f) similarly provides that \u201c[a]n obligor\u2019s right of rescission shall expire three years after the date of consummation of the transaction . . . notwithstanding the fact that the information and forms required under this section or any other disclosures required under this chapter . . . have not been delivered to the obligor . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\"> The plaintiff calculated, in the note and in the loan closing statement, that the principal amount of the loan was $43,500. See footnote 11, supra. That calculation, however, was incorrect because it included, in the principal amount, the prepaid finance charge. Such a charge should have been categorized as interest, and not principal. The plaintiff also included the closing costs as part of the principal amount of the loan. Ordinarily, elos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ing costs are not part of the principal since a borrower pays those costs at the closing either out of the borrower\u2019s own pocket or by a reduction in the amount of the loan proceeds disbursed to the borrower. In the present case, however, it is clear from the record that the defendants borrowed the amount of the closing costs from the plaintiff which, in turn, increased the principal amount of the loan. We thus conclude that the principal amount of the loan was $39,150 which included $27,070.05 to pay off the November, 1987 loan, $2451.33 in closing costs and $9628.62 paid directly to the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\"> Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 36-2241, the maximum amount that the plaintiff could have charged the defendants in prepaid finance charges was $3915 since the principal amount of the loan was $39,150. Therefore, the plaintiff overcharged the defendants by $490.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"Ag4\"> The defendants also claim that the finance charge, together with the loan closing costs, such as the appraisal fees, title fees and attorney\u2019s fees must not exceed 10 percent of the principal amount of the loan. The defendants argue that by the plain language of General Statutes \u00a7 36-2241, all \u201ctransaction fees,\u201d including closing costs, must be considered when determining whether a lender has exceeded the 10 percent limit. We conclude that the defendants\u2019 construction of the statute is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\u201cAccording to the rule of ejusdem generis, unless a contrary intent appears, where general terms are followed by specific terms in a statute, the general terms will be construed to embrace things of the same general kind or character as those specifically enumerated. 2A J.

We sit as a court of equity in reviewing this appeal from the granting of foreclosure of the defendants\u2019 property. See <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>188 Conn. 316, 320, 449 A.2d 182 (1982). A long standing equitable principle requires that \u201c[e]quity will not afford its aid to one who by his conduct or neglect has put the other party in a situation in which it would be inequitable to place him [or her].\u201d <em>Glotzer v.

Since I believe that the cumulative effect of the two loans made by the plaintiff and secured by the mortgages (second mortgage I and II) is unconscionable under established principles of equity, I would not enforce the terms of the note secured by second mortgage II according to its tenor. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Instead, the majority allows the equitable powers of this court to be used to the advantage of the plaintiff mortgagee, Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc., a sophisticated money lender, in the foreclosure of a mortgage on the property of the defendant mortgagors, Luis Montes and Dalila Montes. The defendants are uneducated Hispanic persons who are far from fluent in the English language,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and who were not represented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>counsel. Compounding these problems, the closing attorney for the plaintiff chose to conduct the closing for second mortgage II out of his vehicle at the parking lot of a restaurant in Branford.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In the often cited case of <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Walker-Thomas Furniture Co., </em>350 F.2d 445, 449-50 (D.C. Cir. 1965), the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that \u201c[u]nconscionability has generally been recognized to include an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party. Whether a meaningful choice is present in a particular case can only be determined by consideration of all the circumstances surrounding the transaction. In many cases the meaningfulness of the choice is negated by a gross inequality of bargaining power. The manner in which the contract was entered is also relevant to this consideration. Did each party to the contract, considering his obvious education or lack of it, have a reasonable opportunity to understand the terms of the contract, or were the important terms hidden in a maze of fine print and minimized by deceptive . . . practices? Ordinarily, one who signs an agreement without full knowledge of its terms might be held to assume the risk that he has entered a one-sided bargain. But when a party of little bargaining power, and hence little real choice, signs a commercially unreasonable contract with little or no knowledge of its terms, it is hardly likely that his [or her] consent, or even an objective manifestation of his [or her] consent, was ever given to all the terms. In such a case the usual rule that the terms of the agreement are not to be questioned should be abandoned and the court should consider whether the terms of the contract are so unfair that enforcement should be withheld.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In the present case, the loan transactions began with a contractor\u2019s attempt to finance the sale of vinyl sid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>ing to the defendants for their home through the Tolland Bank and now ends in this foreclosure action in which they may lose their home. Unable to obtain conventional financing at the bank for the siding, the contractor took the defendants\u2019 application that was originally completed for the Tolland Bank \u201cdown the line\u201d into the hands of the plaintiff. The defendants then completed the two loan transactions with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">At the time of entering into the loans, the defendant Luis Montes, who had previously suffered a heart attack, was afflicted with a kidney disease that necessitated dialysis treatment, which left him permanently disabled and unable to work. The defendants had a total monthly income of $1195, including Luis Montes\u2019 social security disability benefits. The trial referee found that the defendants \u201cwere not neophytes in the financial world,\u201d but this finding is not supported by the evidence. The trial referee predicated his finding on the fact that when the defendants originally purchased their home for $25,000, it was financed by a first mortgage of $23,700 from People\u2019s Bank that provided for monthly payments of $407, including property taxes. The defendants\u2019 participation in one legitimate transaction with People\u2019s Bank, however, does not support the trial referee\u2019s conclusion that they had the sophistication to understand fully the present transactions and the financial implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Under the terms of second mortgage II, plus the seven monthly payments previously made under second mortgage I, the defendants would have been required to pay principal, bonus points,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> interest, attorney\u2019s fees, and other associated costs totaling $70,486.61<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>than four years of financing. In return, they only received benefits in cash, payment to other creditors and the vinyl siding, totaling $32,328.62.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The result is a net cost of $38,157.99 to the defendants for approximately forty-two months of financing. Equalizing these costs of $38,157.99 over that period (seven months under second mortgage I and thirty-five months under second mortgage II), the cost of the net actual economic benefits of $32,328.62 was $908.52 per month. This amounts to a shocking 33.7 percent per annum costs for the financing, which the plaintiff conceded was fully secured.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, when second mortgage II was entered into the defendants received an additional benefit of only $10,897.95 (cash of $9628.62 and credit life insurance of $1251.33), for which they not only had to pay interest but also bonus points of $4350 which, put in percentage terms, was a bonus of approximately 40 percent. Although the exorbitant rates on a fully secured loan, under the circumstances of this case, do not shock the conscience of the majority, they do mine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>The defendants\u2019 case, however, does not stop there. Equally problematic is that the defendants could never repay either one of the loans that had been secured by the mortgages. Second mortgage I required monthly payments of $806.38 ($407 for the first mortgage and taxes and $399.38 for second mortgage I) from the defendants\u2019 monthly income of $1195, which amounts to 67 percent of their total income. How could they be expected to live on the balance of $388.62, that is\u2014pay for utilities, heat, food, clothing and other necessities, plus any payroll deductions?</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Second mortgage II called for outrageous payments of $1098.17 per month ($407 for the first mortgage and taxes and $691.17 for second mortgage II) or a whopping 92 percent of the defendants\u2019 gross monthly income. The majority speculates that the defendants had additional income because they were able to live and pay second mortgage I for seven months. When this speculation is applied to second mortgage II, it is obvious that the monthly payments were outrageous because the defendants were unable to make a single payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Furthermore, the defendants could never be expected to pay the balloon payments\u2014the lump sum payment due at the end of the term of the loan\u2014on second mortgage I in the amount of $26,810.61 and on second mortgage II in the amount of $44,075.03, both of which were in excess of the original principal amounts of the notes secured by the mortgages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As the court in <em>Campbell Soup Co. </em>v. <em>Wentz, </em>172 F.2d 80, 84 (3d Cir. 1948), stated, the \u201csum total of its provisions drives too hard a bargain for a court of conscience to assist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>To justify its finding that the loans were not unconscionable, the trial referee and the majority rely on the plaintiff\u2019s claim that it was told that the defendant Luis Montes had some additional income, not shown on the application. There is no evidence to support such a finding. The plaintiff\u2019s president, Richard Coppola, was unable to testify as to the dollar amount of this additional income, there was no documentary evidence to support this claim and there was not even a note in the corporation\u2019s records to verify that he was so advised.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>\u201cIt does not seem too much to say that one who voluntarily extends credit by disregarding a known risk, or risks which could be discovered by a reasonable effort, should bear the loss when loss occurs. If such a standard imposes some brake on the credit boom, it would be a brake wisely applied in the interests of both the consumers and the extenders of credit.\u201d V. Countryman, \u201cImprovident Credit Extension: A New Legal Concept Aborning?\u201d 27 Mex. L. Rev. 1, 23 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">It is clear to me that the defendants could neither pay the monthly payments nor pay the balloon payment at the end of the term of the loan. Indeed, the loan secured by second mortgage II was made solely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>basis of the equity that the defendants had in the house. \u201cMany financial experts refer to such mortgage companies as \u2018equity skimmers\u2019 because the loans are based not on a person\u2019s ability to repay them, but on the amount of equity in their home. They charge that the companies make these loans with the intention of foreclosing upon the homeowner and reaping a profit through the equity in the home.\u201d J. Morris, \u201cBorrowers Beware,\u201d Manchester, New Hampshire, Sunday News, Feb. 4, 1990, p. A-7.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The evidence indicated that at the time of the foreclosure the house had a value of $90,000. The possible practice of equity skimming under the circumstances of this case is unconscionable and this court should hold as much.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The defendants concede that they are not entirely without blame; any credit extension that is improvident on the part of the creditors is also improvident on the part of the debtor. Nevertheless, \u201ctypically the creditor is better equipped\u2014by education, experience, resources, and the nature of his role\u2014to avoid and distribute the risk of improvidence. Hence, as between the two blameworthy participants in the improvident credit extension, it seems . . . that in most cases the burden of loss should be placed on the improvident creditor by means of a remedy conferred on the improvident debtor.\u201d V. Countryman, supra, 17. Surely, taking into consideration the circumstances of the defendants, this is such a case. \u201c [Protection must be given to those who do not have the economic sophistication or the awareness possessed by others who may be less concerned about credit; the [Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA)] must be applied to protect the unthinking, the unsuspecting and the credulous . . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>Exposition Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Trade Commission, </em>295 F.2d 869, 872 (2d Cir.

Sup. 183, 190, 416 A.2d 170 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The majority treats this case just as it would a transaction between commercial parties. It relies on such cases as <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Golart, </em>206 Conn. 454, 538 A.2d 1017 (1988) (commercial property); <em>Hamm </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>supra (mortgage on a roadside tavern); <em>Edart Truck Rental Corporation </em>v. <em>B. Swirsky &amp; Co., </em>23 Conn. App. 137, 579 A.2d 133 (1990) (rental of truck for paper recycling business); <em>Iamartino </em>v. <em>Avallone, </em>2 Conn. App. 119, 122, 477 A.2d 124, cert. denied, 194 Conn. 802, 478 A.2d 1025 (1980) (residential property wherein mortgagee was contractor, involved in home improvement business and owned a variety of property, including a shopping center).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Instead of reviewing this case through the lens of commercially savvy parties, we must determine whether the loans were unconscionable on the basis of a transaction between a professional mortgage lender and unsophisticated credit consumers who had a total monthly income below the poverty level. Paraphrasing the language of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Hume v. United States, </em>132 U.S. 406, 411, 10 S. Ct. 134, 33 L. Ed. 393 (1889), unconscionability is defined as a transaction that no person in his or her senses and not under delusion would make on the one hand and no honest and fair person would accept on the other. The New York courts have applied the doctrine of unconscionability as follows: \u201cIn <em>Frostifresh Corp. </em>v. <em>Reynoso, </em>[52 Misc. 2d 26, 27, 274 N.Y.S.2d 757 (1966), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 54 Misc. 2d 119, 281 N.Y.S.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>964 (1967)], the court refused to enforce a contract where the Spanish speaking customers had signed an installment contract for a refrigerator, and agreed to pay $1,145.88 for a refrigerator worth $348. The court held that the [defendants were handicapped by a lack of knowledge, both as to the commercial situation and the nature and terms of the contract which was submitted in a language foreign to them. The same situation invalidated a contract in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Star Credit Corp., </em>[59 Misc. 2d 189, 298 N.Y.S.2d 264 (1969)]. The court there stated its concern for the uneducated and often illiterate individuals who are the victims of the gross inequality of bargaining power and the overreaching by merchants who would take advantage of their ignorance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Biscardi, </em>62 App. Div. 2d 975, 976-77, 403 N.Y.S.2d 544 (1978); see also <em>Community Acceptance Corporation of Denham Springs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kinchen, </em>417 So. 2d 22 (La. App. 1982) (unconscionable promissory note made between a finance and loan company and three individuals). Applying this standard, I conclude that the cumulative effect of both loan transactions was unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Accordingly, I would reverse on this issue and remand the case to the trial court with direction to reduce the finance charges and other associated costs on the loan secured by second mortgage II in order to reflect the legal rate of interest. General Statutes \u00a7 37-1 (a). I also disagree with part IV of the majority decision which holds that there was no violation of CUTPA as a result of the loan transaction being unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">I write separately on Part II because I am not certain what the majority means by an \u201ceffective\u201d rescission. If the trial court finds that the defendants gave notice of the rescission in accordance with 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635 (b), which no one disputes, then the defendants were not required to return the consideration to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>plaintiff as a condition of the rescission. Section 1635 states the following: \u201c(b) When an obligor exercises his right to rescind under subsection (a) of this section, he is not liable for any finance or other charge, and any security interest given by the obligor, including any such interest arising by operation of law, becomes void upon such a rescission. Within 20 days after receipt of a notice of rescission, the creditor shall return to the obligor any money or property given as earnest money, downpayment, or otherwise, and shall take any action necessary or appropriate to reflect the termination of any security interest created under the transaction. If the creditor has delivered any property to the obligor, the obligor may retain possession of it.\u201d Only when the creditor fulfills these obligations, is the obligor required to \u201ctender the property to the creditor.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635 (b). Furthermore, to the extent that the remand of the majority could be interpreted to give the trial court discretion to determine whether the plaintiff is entitled to a foreclosure if there was a rescission, I disagree. Under the circumstances of this case, the rescission would void the mortgage and there can be no remedy of foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">I concur with the majority opinion insofar as it holds in part II that the plaintiff violated the federal Truth in Lending Act, in part III that the plaintiff violated General Statutes \u00a7 <em>36-2241 </em>and in part IV that there were other unfair trade practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Accordingly, I dissent in part and concur in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\"> One defendant could not read any English and the other a \u201clittle bit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\"> Bonus points are referred to in the majority opinion as the \u201cprepaid finance charge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b140-8\"> The payments that had been made under second mortgage I, and the payments that were to be made under second mortgage II under the terms of the loan transaction were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Seven monthly payments of $399.38 under second mortgage I $2795.66</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atn\">Amount to pay off balance of note secured by second mortgage I 27,070.05</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApF\">Closing costs for second mortgage II 2451.33</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUh\">Bonus points on second mortgage II 4350.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXj\">Cash to the defendants 9628.62</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZH\">46,295.66</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A46\">Thirty-five monthly payments of $691.17 24,190.95</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfG\">$70,486.61</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b141-13\"> The actual cash and economic benefits derived from the two loan transactions under second mortgage I and II are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-14\">Vinyl siding $9902.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-15\">Prior debts paid 12,671.31</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-16\">Cash from second mortgage I 126.69</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-17\">Cash from second mortgage II 9628.62</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-18\">$32,328.62</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b141-19\"> As a result of substantial payments taken out in advance, the effective rate of interest is higher.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b141-20\"> A question of unconscionability is a matter of law; <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Golart, </em>206 Conn. 454, 461, 538 A.2d 1017 (1988); and, as the majority points outs, it \u201cis subject to a plenary review on appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\"> The note secured by second mortgage I was $26,500, and the note secured by second mortgage II was $43,500.

Social Security\u2014no, that\u2019s the wife. Social Security, yes, that's it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuU\">\u201cQ. Social Security, and the amount is how much?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMV\">\u201cA. It shows here $475.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al8\">\u201cQ. What was the wife\u2019s income listed as?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ1\">\u201cA. $640.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3l\">\u201cQ. A month?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApT\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVF\">\u201cQ. For a total of $1,125 a month?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGB\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq8\">\u201cThe Court: The exhibit speaks for itself. Is there any other income other than Social Security on there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai1\">\u201cThe Witness: Not listed on the application, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARs\">\u201cBY MR. WELCH-RUBIN:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Are\">\u201cQ. And it was your valuation that out of that listed income and some unknown amount of additional income they had, you thought they had, they could pay a $407.00 first mortgage plus an additional $399 and change to you on the November, \u201987 mortgage, so over $800 a month in mortgage payments alone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvY\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azy\">\u201cQ. Out of approximately $1,100 in gross income?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHB\">\u201cA. No, not $1,100 in gross income. We thought there was more and that is the reason we put them in the low income verification program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHC\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t need any verification of the amount that was more?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARl\">\u201cA. No, it was unnecessary. If they felt they could make the payments, it would have been the only reason they could have borrowed the money.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b145-5\"> We may take judicial notice of this newspaper article. <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>213 Conn. 548, 562 n.20, 569 A.2d 518 (1990); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>173 Conn. 120, 123 n.1, 376 A.2d 1085 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
