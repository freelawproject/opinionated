Loiseau, Jr., appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment rendered on the jury verdicts on the second and sixth counts of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, its award of punitive damages to the plaintiff, and its refusal to set aside the verdicts or to remit the jury\u2019s compensatory damages award. The plaintiff, Ricky Berry, cross appeals challenging certain jury instructions given by the trial court and the verdict directed in favor of the named defendant, Edward M. Loiseau, Sr., on the first count of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The plaintiff appeals separately from the trial court\u2019s ruling limiting the amount of punitive damages awarded on the sixth count of the complaint to one third of the jury\u2019s verdict on that count, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 52-251c. We affirm the judgment of the trial court with respect to the defendant Edward M. Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s appeal and the first claim of the plaintiff\u2019s cross appeal. We reverse the judgment of the trial court with respect to the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>claim of the plaintiffs cross appeal and we reverse, in part, with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s separate appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The plaintiff brought this action against his former employer, Bird Electron Beam Corporation (Bird), Bird\u2019s president, Edward M. Loiseau, Sr. (Loiseau, Sr.), and Bird\u2019s vice president, Edward M. Loiseau, Jr. (Loiseau, Jr.). In a six count complaint, the plaintiff alleged, respectively, false imprisonment, assault and battery, wrongful termination, breach of an implied covenant of good faith, defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Bird and Loiseau, Sr., filed a seven count counterclaim, alleging, respectively, misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of a nondisclosure agreement, intentional interference with a business relationship, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, corporate defamation and personal defamation. After a jury trial, the plaintiff prevailed on the counts of his complaint alleging assault and battery, wrongful termination, breach of an implied covenant of good faith and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The trial court directed verdicts for the defendants on the false imprisonment count, on which the jury was hung, and the defamation count. The trial court set aside the jury\u2019s verdicts for the plaintiff on the counts alleging wrongful termination and breach of an implied covenant of good faith. The trial court accepted the jury\u2019s verdicts in the amount of $7500 on the assault and battery count and $50,000 on the intentional infliction of emotional distress count. The plaintiff filed a motion for a retrial of the false imprisonment count.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">With respect to the defendants\u2019 counterclaim, the plaintiff prevailed on all counts but those alleging breach of fiduciary duty, corporate defamation and personal defamation. The jury returned verdicts: for Bird on the fourth count, alleging breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty, in the amount of one dollar; for Bird on the sixth count, alleging corporate defamation, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>amount of one dollar; and for Loiseau, Sr., on the seventh count, alleging personal defamation, in the amount of one dollar. The plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the jury\u2019s verdicts on counts four, six and seven of the defendants\u2019 counterclaim. The trial court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The trial court submitted interrogatories to the jury, asking whether punitive damages were warranted on the plaintiff\u2019s intentional infliction of emotional distress count, and on the sixth and seventh counts of the defendants\u2019 counterclaim, alleging corporate defamation and personal defamation. The jury responded in the affirmative. Subsequently, the trial court adjudged that the plaintiff should recover of Loiseau, Jr., $57,500, plus punitive damages, to be determined in a subsequent proceeding, and that Bird and Loiseau, Sr., should recover of the plaintiff four dollars<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> plus punitive damages, to be determined in a subsequent proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">After a hearing, the trial court awarded punitive damages to the plaintiff to be recovered of Loiseau, Jr., in the amount of $16,667, and to the defendants, Bird and Loiseau, Sr., to recover of the plaintiff in the amount of $50,000. Loiseau, Jr., appealed and the plaintiff cross appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment rendered on the complaint, and the plaintiff appealed separately to the Appellate Court from the judgment rendered on the counterclaim. We transferred the appeals and the cross appeal to ourselves from the Appellate Court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">On appeal, Loiseau, Jr., claims that the trial court improperly: (1) permitted the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Harry Powers Dunne, and lay witnesses, David <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Gamage and Doreen DeNomme, to testify when the plaintiff had failed to disclose their names in response to the defendants\u2019 interrogatories, and had failed to disclose the name of his expert witness in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D); (2) permitted the plaintiff\u2019s witness, Gamage, to testify to \u201cprior bad acts\u201d of Loiseau, Jr., when such testimony was inadmissible character evidence offered only to show Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s propensity to commit such acts; (3) failed to set aside the jury\u2019s verdicts on the counts of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleging assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress; (4) failed to remit the jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages on the intentional infliction of emotional distress count; (5) awarded the plaintiff punitive damages when there was no evidence to support such an award; and (6) failed to declare a mistrial on the basis that plaintiff\u2019s counsel was guilty of misconduct during the course of the trial, which prejudiced the defendants in the eyes of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">In his cross appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly: (1) failed to instruct the jury, with respect to the defamation counts of the defendants\u2019 counterclaim, that the plaintiff enjoyed a qualified privilege to report the defendants\u2019 business improprieties to public authorities, and, therefore, the defendants had the burden of proving malice in order to prevail on these counts; and (2) directed a verdict in favor of Loiseau, Sr., on the false imprisonment count of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint when the jury was unable to reach a verdict on that count. Finally, in his separate appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly: (1) measured the amount of punitive damages awarded him by the amount of attorney\u2019s fees he had incurred; and (2) applied General Statutes \u00a7 52-25lc (b) to limit the amount of punitive damages awarded to one third of the jury\u2019s verdict on the sixth count of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. Bird is an electron beam welding shop that performs welding services for various federal defense contractors. From September, 1984, through March 7, 1987, the plaintiff was employed by Bird, during which time he was trained and certified as an electron beam welder. During the course of the plaintiff\u2019s employment at Bird, he was subjected to repeated physical abuse by Loiseau, Jr., including being punched and choked. The plaintiff observed Bird employees engage in improper procedures, including the production and shipping to Bird\u2019s customers of inferior welds, the scrapping of parts and the use of noncertified welders to perform work under the name of a certified welder. The plaintiff accumulated data on the improper procedures employed at Bird. As a result of the plaintiff\u2019s activities, Loiseau, Sr., and Loiseau, Jr., confronted the plaintiff on March 7, 1987, after which date the plaintiff did not return to work at Bird. Thereafter, the plaintiff discussed the alleged improprieties of Bird and Loiseau, Sr., with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the United States Department of Defense and with other persons in the electron beam welding business. Additional facts will be detailed in relation to specific issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">We first dispose of the Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">The defendant Loiseau, Jr., first claims that the trial court improperly permitted the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Harry Powers Dunne, and lay witnesses, David Gamage and Doreen DeNomme, to testify when the plaintiff had failed to disclose their names in response to the defendants\u2019 interrogatories and had failed to disclose the expert\u2019s name in compliance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends that the trial court properly allowed Dunne to testify because it had granted permission to the defendants, during voir dire, to present two previously undisclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>witnesses. The plaintiff contends further that Gamage and DeNomme were properly permitted to testify as rebuttal witnesses. We conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in admitting the testimony of Dunne, Gamage and DeNomme.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">The plaintiff called Dunne, a psychologist, to testify in support of his claim that he had suffered physical damage and emotional distress as a result of Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s actions. The plaintiff had not disclosed Dunne\u2019s name prior to trial in response to the defendants\u2019 interrogatories or in compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D). During voir dire, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney informed defense counsel that he intended to introduce expert testimony concerning the plaintiff\u2019s emotional distress claim and economic damages. On the first day of trial, the defendants filed a motion in limine to exclude such expert testimony on the basis that the plaintiff had failed to disclose any experts in response to interrogatories or pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D). After hearing argument, the trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motion. In so doing, the trial court reasoned that the defendants had disclosed two witnesses for the first time during voir dire.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court, therefore, permitted Dunne to testify in exchange for allowing the defendants\u2019 two previously undisclosed witnesses to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">After the defendants deposed Dunne, they renewed their motion in limine to exclude his testimony. The defendants argued that they had inadequate time to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>obtain and prepare effectively rebuttal witnesses on the plaintiff\u2019s emotional distress claim. The trial court again denied the defendants\u2019 motion but granted them time to retain an expert on the issues of emotional distress and economic damages. The trial court ordered that the defendants\u2019 expert be permitted, prior to testifying, to examine the plaintiff and administer several psychological perspective tests to him. The trial court also ordered that the plaintiff be permitted to depose the defendants\u2019 expert during the course of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The plaintiff called Gamage and DeNomme, former employees of Bird, to testify in support of his assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims against Loiseau, Jr. In interrogatories served on the plaintiff nearly two years prior to trial, the defendants had requested the identity of each witness that the plaintiff intended to call and the substance and basis of his or her testimony. The plaintiff had responded by stating that \u201c[n]o witnesses have been selected at this time.\u201d The plaintiff never supplemented his response. Because Gamage and DeNomme had never been disclosed in response to the defendants\u2019 interrogatories, the defendants objected when the plaintiff, several days into the trial, announced his intention to call them. The plaintiff had mentioned Gamage in response to the defendants\u2019 interrogatories asking for the disclosure of witnesses to Bird\u2019s and Loiseau, Sr.\u2019s alleged business improprieties, but neither Gamage nor DeNomme had been identified in response to interrogatories regarding witnesses to Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s alleged physical abuse of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s attorney argued to the trial court that the failure to disclose Gamage\u2019s name in response to interrogatories regarding Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s actions was justified because he had become aware that Gamage might have relevant testimony on that issue only after Loiseau, Sr., had testified in the plaintiff\u2019s case-in-chief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>The plaintiffs attorney also represented to the trial court that he had learned only several days earlier that DeNomme had information regarding the plaintiffs case. He offered DeNomme as a rebuttal witness to impeach the testimony of Loiseau, Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Over the defendants\u2019 objection, the trial court permitted Gamage and DeNomme to testify. In permitting Gamage to testify, the court reasoned that Gamage had been named as a witness in response to the defendants\u2019 interrogatories and, therefore, was not a \u201csurprise\u201d witness. With respect to its decision to allow DeNomme\u2019s testimony, although the trial court did not offer a specific reason on the record, it noted that DeNomme\u2019s name had arisen during Loiseau, Sr.\u2019s testimony two days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s attorney represented to the trial court that he had not contacted Gamage until one or two days before Gamage testified and that he had contacted DeNomme for the first time only a few days before the trial. Gamage testified, on cross-examination, however, that an attorney from the law firm of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney had interviewed him more than one year prior to the trial. DeNomme testified that she had been contacted by the plaintiff five days prior to trial and had been served with a subpoena on the day before the trial began. The defendants, arguing that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney had made misrepresentations to the trial court, moved to strike the testimony of Gamage and DeNomme after each of them had testified. The trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The defendant Loiseau, Jr., argues that the trial court improperly admitted the testimony of Gamage, DeNomme and Dunne, thereby fatally prejudicing his case. The substance of the testimony that the defendants sought to exclude was as follows. Gamage testified that while he was employed by Bird, he and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>employees had engaged in \u201chorseplay\u201d with Loiseau, Jr., which had at times \u201cgot out of hand.\u201d Gamage also testified that, prior to the plaintiffs employment at Bird, he had observed Loiseau, Jr., violently assault another employee, Mike Pellerman, by punching him until he fell to the ground and choking him. Finally, Gamage testified that after the resolution of a lawsuit brought against him by Bird to enforce a noncompetition agreement, Loiseau, Jr., had threatened him over the telephone. DeNomme testified that she had observed Loiseau, Jr., punch the plaintiff. She testified further that she believed that the plaintiff had not consented to the touching because he had run from Loiseau, Jr. Dunne, the plaintiff\u2019s expert, testified that as a result of the alleged mistreatment by Loiseau, Sr., and Loiseau, Jr., the plaintiff suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder. In particular, Dunne testified that the plaintiff\u2019s condition had been caused by Loiseau, Sr.\u2019s threatening him with a gun and by Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s physical abuse of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">We first address Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly denied the motion in limine requesting the exclusion of Dunne\u2019s testimony. The defendants sought the exclusion of Dunne\u2019s testimony on the basis that the plaintiff had failed to respond to interrogatories requesting the disclosure of expert witnesses in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 220 (A) (1) and had failed to comply with \u00a7 220 (D). Pursuant to \u00a7 220 (A) (1), a discovering party may, through interrogatories, require another party to disclose the identity of any expert witness he plans to call at trial and the substance and basis of the expert\u2019s opinions. See footnote 2, supra. If a party fails to comply with a discovery request made under \u00a7 220 (A) (1), the trial court may, upon motion of the discovering party made pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 231, \u201cmake such order as the ends of justice require,\u201d including \u201c[t]he entry of an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>prohibiting the party who has failed to comply from introducing designated matters in evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court similarly may impose sanctions, upon motion, if a party fails to comply with the continuing duty to disclose imposed by Practice Book \u00a7 232.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 220 (D), on which Loiseau, Jr., primarily relies for his claim that Dunne\u2019s testimony should have been excluded, provides that a trial court may, in its discretion, permit an expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>who has not been disclosed within the time limits set forth, to testify \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d See footnote 2, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Loiseau, Jr., argues that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting Dunne to testify. Specifically, he contends that the plaintiff failed to establish good cause for his failure to disclose the name of his expert, as required by \u00a7 220 (D). Neither \u00a7 220 (D) nor the cases interpreting it define what constitutes \u201cgood cause.\u201d The language of the rule, however, makes clear that the trial court is to exercise broad discretion in determining whether good cause exists in a given case. As we have stated: \u201cA trial court\u2019s decision on whether to impose the sanction of excluding the testimony of a party\u2019s expert witness rests within the court\u2019s sound discretion. . . . The action of the trial court is not to be disturbed unless it has abused its broad discretion, and in determining whether there has been such abuse every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of its correctness. ... In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pool </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>209 Conn. 536, 541, 551 A.2d 1254 (1989); see also <em>Mulrooney </em>v. <em>Wambolt, </em>215 Conn. 211, 221-22, 575 A.2d 996 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">In the present case, the defendants revealed two witnesses, George Bakas and George Kolvek, for the first time during voir dire. Although the subject matter of these witnesses\u2019 testimony differed from that of the plaintiff\u2019s expert, we are unable to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing Dunne to testify in exchange for permitting Bakas and Kolvek to testify. We are persuaded that the trial court\u2019s allowance of time for the defendants to retain their own expert and for both parties to depose each other\u2019s expert witnesses adequately protected the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>interests. The defendants were further protected by the fact that the trial court allowed their expert witness, prior to testifying, to examine and to administer a battery of psychological tests to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">While we do not condone the plaintiffs failure adequately to respond to the defendants\u2019 interrogatories or to comply with \u00a7 220 (D), \u201c[u]nder these circumstances, it cannot be said that the [defendants were] prejudiced or that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling as it did. Although sanctions should be imposed to deter those who would use trial-by-ambush tactics . . . the trial court is in the best position to assess the intent behind the behavior of the offending party and, therefore, its decision must be given great weight and deference.\u201d (Citations <em>omitted.) Alpha Crane Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Capitol Crane Co., </em>6 Conn. App. 60, 65-66, 504 A.2d 1376, cert. denied, 199 Conn. 807, 508 A.2d 769 (1986). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in permitting Dunne to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">We next address the propriety of the trial court\u2019s rulings allowing the plaintiff\u2019s lay witnesses, Gamage and DeNomme, to testify. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 218 and 223, a party may, through written interrogatories, discover information material to the subject matter involved in a pending action, which is not privileged and which is within the knowledge of the party to whom the interrogatories are addressed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Failure to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>with such a discovery request is subject to sanctions by the trial court, upon motion of the discovering party in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 231 and 232, including an order excluding designated matters from evidence. See footnotes 4 and 5, supra. As noted in our discussion of the trial court\u2019s admission of Dunne\u2019s testimony, however, a trial court enjoys broad discretion in deciding whether to exclude evidence based on failure to comply with a discovery request. See <em>Pool </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">In the present case, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing Gamage and DeNomme to testify. The record reveals that the trial court, in allowing the testimony of these witnesses, concluded that neither one was a \u201csurprise\u201d witness and, therefore, that the admission of their testimony did not unduly prejudice the defendants. While we agree with the defendant\u2019s general contention that compliance with the rules of discovery should be encouraged, we are persuaded that the trial court acted within its discretion in concluding that no sanction was necessary under Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 231 or 232. We conclude, furthermore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendants\u2019 motions to strike the testimony of Gamage and DeNomme, made on the basis that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney had falsely represented to the court his prior contacts with the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The defendant Loiseau, Jr., next claims that the trial court improperly permitted Gamage to testify to certain \u201cprior bad acts\u201d of Loiseau, Jr., when such testimony was inadmissible character evidence offered only to show his propensity to commit such acts. We conclude that the trial court properly admitted Gamage\u2019s testimony regarding Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s prior conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Gamage testified that Loiseau, Jr., had assaulted Pellerman, a Bird employee, prior to the plaintiff\u2019s employment at Bird. Gamage testified further that Loiseau, Jr., had made a threatening phone call to him after the resolution of a lawsuit brought against him by Bird. Loiseau, Jr., argues that Gamage\u2019s testimony was inadmissible character evidence that irrevocably prejudiced his case. Specifically, he contends that Gamage\u2019s testimony was irrelevant to the defense of consent to the plaintiff\u2019s charges of assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Loiseau, Jr., contends further that, even if Gamage\u2019s testimony was assumed to be relevant, the trial court improperly admitted it, its prejudicial impact having outweighed its probative value. The plaintiff acknowledges that Gamage\u2019s testimony was prejudicial to Loiseau, Jr. He argues, however, that any prejudice was outweighed by the probative value of the testimony on the issue of Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s defense that his physical contact with the plaintiff had been consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s defense to the plaintiffs claims of intentional physical abuse was that employees in Bird\u2019s shop, including the plaintiff, had willingly participated with Loiseau, Jr., in certain rough \u201chorseplay,\u201d such as punching and karate. The plaintiff sought, therefore, to introduce the testimony of Gamage regarding Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s prior assaultive and threatening behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>toward other Bird employees. The defendants objected, but the trial court admitted the testimony. After Gamage testified, the defendants made a timely motion to strike, which the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">\u201cWe may usefully begin our inquiry on this issue by restating the two-step analysis that a trial court must conduct in deciding whether to admit evidence of a party\u2019s collateral misconduct. The court first must determine whether the evidence is relevant and material to an issue properly before the court. . . . Evidence of other misconduct, although not ordinarily admissible to prove the bad character or criminal tendencies of the accused, may be allowed for the purpose of proving many different things, such as intent, identity, malice, motive or a system of criminal activity .... Second, after a finding that the evidence is relevant, the trial court must then decide whether its admission is warranted because its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>200 Conn. 172, 191-92, 510 A.2d 972 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">In the present case, the trial court did not explicitly find that the proffered testimony was relevant and that its probative value exceeded its prejudicial impact. The parties, however, addressed both prongs of the required analysis in argument before the trial court. Accordingly, we may infer such findings from the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the evidence. \u201cBecause of the latitude we accord trial courts on questions of relevance . . . and [b]ecause of the difficulties inherent in [the process of balancing probative value and prejudicial effect], the trial court\u2019s decision [to admit evidence of other misconduct] will be reversed only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done. ... On review by this court, therefore, every reasonable presumption should be given in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 192-93. Applying these standards to the facts of this case, we conclude that the trial court properly admitted the testimony of Gamage regarding Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s collateral misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">We first consider the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Gamage\u2019s testimony was relevant. \u201c[E]vidence that an individual is the kind of person who tends to behave in certain ways almost always has some value as circumstantial evidence as to how Pie] acted (and perhaps with what state of mind) in the matter in question.\u201d 1 C. McCormick, Evidence (4th Ed.) \u00a7 188, p. 793. The plaintiff offered Gamage\u2019s testimony to show the absence of consent to Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s physical contact with him as well as to refute Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s claim that any physical contact that occurred in the Bird shop was merely \u201chorseplay\u201d in which employees willingly participated. Given the substantial deference we accord the trial court\u2019s ruling on relevance, we cannot say that Gamage\u2019s testimony was not relevant for the purpose for which it was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The question of whether the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect is a closer one. \u201c[E]vidence of character in any form\u2014reputation, opinion from observation, or specific acts\u2014generally will not be received to prove that a person engaged in certain conduct or did so with a particular intent on a specific occasion, so-called circumstantial use of character. The reason is the familiar one of prejudice outweighing probative value. Character evidence used for this purpose, while typically being of relatively slight value, usually is laden with the dangerous baggage of prejudice, distraction, time consumption and surprise.\u201d 1 C. McCormick, supra, \u00a7 188, p. 793. The plaintiff concedes that Gamage\u2019s testimony was \u201cno doubt prejudicial\u201d to Loiseau, Jr. As the Appellate Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>stated, however, \u201c[e]vidence that is inadmissibly prejudicial is not to be confused with evidence that is merely damaging. ... All evidence adverse to a party is, to some degree, prejudicial.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Chouinard </em>v. <em>Marjani, </em>21 Conn. App. 572, 576, 575 A.2d 238 (1990). Thus, \u201c[t]o be excluded, the evidence must create prejudice that is <em>undue </em>and so great as to threaten an injustice if the evidence were to be admitted.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The trial court concluded that the probative value of Gamage\u2019s testimony exceeded its prejudicial impact. \u201cIt cannot be said that on the facts of this case the conclusion reached by the [trial court] after balancing these factors was in error.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>170 Conn. 161, 166, 365 A.2d 104 (1976). We are persuaded that \u201c[t]he evidence was neither so remote nor so prejudicial that its significance upon the issues of the case could not be entrusted to the jury.\u201d <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>186 Conn. 632, 638, 443 A.2d 471 (1982).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">The defendant Loiseau, Jr., also claims that the trial court improperly failed to set aside the jury\u2019s verdicts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>as to the second and sixth counts of the plaintiffs complaint because they were not supported by the evidence. Loiseau, Jr., asserts that the plaintiffs testimony was the <em>only </em>evidence presented in support of his claims of assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s argument, in essence, is that the plaintiff\u2019s testimony alone was insufficient as a matter of law to support the jury\u2019s verdicts on the second and sixth counts of the complaint. We reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s claim must fail for two reasons. First, the plaintiff offered the testimony of witnesses other than himself, specifically Carnage and DeNomme, in support of his claim that the physical contact to which he was subjected by Loiseau, Jr., was not voluntary \u201chorseplay.\u201d In addition, the plaintiff offered the expert testimony of Dunne regarding the lasting effects of Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s treatment of him. Second, and more importantly, however, Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s argument wrongly assumes that the plaintiff was required to present more than his own testimony to prevail on the second and sixth counts of his complaint. As the plaintiff states in his brief on appeal: \u2018 \u2018The testimony of Berry as opposed to that of Loiseau [Jr.] was the essence of the trial. The jury believed Berry and did not believe Loiseau Jr. It is as simple as that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">We have stated that \u201c[l]itigants have a constitutional right to have factual issues resolved by the jury.\u201d <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Griffin Hospital, </em>207 Conn. 125, 138, 540 A.2d 666 (1988). This right encompasses the right to have the jury and not the court decide issues of fact as to which reasonable people may reach different conclusions. Id. Thus, the role of the trial court on a motion to set aside the jury\u2019s verdict is not to sit as a seventh juror, but, rather, to decide whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, the jury could reasonably have reached the ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>diet that it did. Id., 139; see <em>A-G Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pepperidge Farm, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 200, 206, 579 A.2d 69 (1990). \u201cThe trial court\u2019s refusal to set aside the verdict is entitled to great weight and every reasonable presumption should be indulged in favor of its correctness. <em>\u201d Mather v. Griffin Hospital, </em>supra. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the jury\u2019s verdicts on the second and sixth counts of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The defendant Loiseau, Jr., next challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to remit the jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages on the sixth count of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Loiseau, Jr., contends that the jury\u2019s award of $50,000 for intentional infliction of emotional distress was \u201cplainly excessive in light of the evidence presented and fell far outside the limits of fair and reasonable compensation for any prior injuries, because [the] plaintiff never sought any medical or other treatment for his alleged injuries and never incurred <em>any </em>medical or other expenses whatsoever.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff argues that he presented sufficient evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s award and that an award for intentional infliction of emotional distress need not be supported by proof of incurred medical expenses. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-216a provides that a trial court shall order a remittitur if it concludes, at the conclusion of the trial, that the verdict is excessive as a matter of law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the present case, the defendants made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>a timely motion to remit the jury\u2019s $50,000 verdict on the sixth count of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">Loiseau, Jr., relies on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Buckman </em>v. <em>People Express, Inc., </em>205 Conn. 166, 530 A.2d 596 (1987), to support his argument that the jury\u2019s verdict was excessive as a matter of law. In <em>Buckman, </em>the plaintiff sued his employer after having been discharged from his employment, alleging that the defendant employer\u2019s bad faith failure to enable him to continue group medical coverage had resulted in, inter alia, emotional distress. The jury heard evidence that, at the time of his discharge, the plaintiff had been suffering from a recurrent ulcer and a problematic dental condition. The defendant was aware of the plaintiff\u2019s serious health problems and his need for continued medical insurance. The plaintiff\u2019s wife, moreover, had been enduring a difficult pregnancy and had a complicated, premature delivery. The jury awarded the plaintiff $51,595.94 in damages, of which only $1595.94 constituted special damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Loiseau, Jr., argues that <em>Buckman </em>stands for the proposition that an award of compensatory damages for emotional distress must be remitted when the amount of special damages incurred by the plaintiff is minimal in comparison with the award. It is true that in <em>Buckman </em>we concluded that, despite the evidence regarding the plaintiff\u2019s and his wife\u2019s health problems and the defendant\u2019s knowledge of them, the jury could not reasonably have found that the plaintiff was entitled to recover $50,000. In reaching the conclusion that the trial court should have ordered a remittitur, we noted that \u201c[t]here [was] no claim and no proof ... of a permanent injury in this case.\u201d Id., 176. We did not, however, as Loiseau, Jr., contends, rely on the minimal amount of special damages incurred by the plaintiff in concluding that the damages award was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>excessive, but reasoned, rather, that the award was \u201c \u2018entirely disproportionate to the loss sustained.\u2019 \u201d Id., 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">When ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion for a remittitur, the trial court was required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Oakes </em>v. <em>New England Dairies, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 1, 13-14, 591 A.2d 1261 (1991). \u201cThe size of the verdict alone does not determine whether it is excessive. The only practical test to apply ... is whether the award falls somewhere within the necessarily uncertain limits of just damages or whether the size of the verdict so shocks the sense of justice as to compel the conclusion that the jury was influenced by partiality, prejudice, mistake or corruption. . . . Every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s refusal to set aside the verdict as excessive should be indulged . . . and its ruling will not be disturbed unless there is a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 14. Applying this standard to the facts of this case, we are persuaded that the trial court properly denied the defendants\u2019 motion to remit the verdict on the sixth count.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, including the testimony of the plaintiff and his expert, Dunne, the jury could reasonably have found that the plaintiff suffered significant emotional distress as a result of Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s actions. The plaintiff testified to his continuing fear of reprisal by Loiseau, Jr., sleep disturbances and other difficulties in adjustment after termination of his employment at Bird. Dunne testified that, as a result, in part, of Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s abuse, the plaintiff suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder, a major psychiatric illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>We have stated that an award of damages for emotional distress may be valid \u201ceven though it is not substantially based on incurred medical expenses.\u201d Id., 15; see <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Michael, </em>188 Conn. 607, 616, 452 A.2d 1157 (1982). \u201cThe test is whether the amount awarded, <em>aside from medical expenses, </em>falls within the necessarily uncertain limits of just damages . . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Oakes </em>v. <em>New England Dairies, Inc., </em>supra, 15. Given the evidence presented at trial and the deference we must accord to the jury\u2019s verdict, \u201cwe cannot say that the verdict, while generous, failed to meet that test.\u201d Id. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly declined to grant a remittitur of the jury\u2019s verdict on the sixth count.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The defendant Loiseau, Jr., also claims that the trial court improperly awarded the plaintiff punitive damages on the sixth count, when there was no evidence to support such an award. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">We have consistently stated that \u201c[i]n order to award punitive or exemplary damages, evidence must reveal a reckless indifference to the rights of others or an intentional and wanton violation of those rights. <em>Collens </em>v. <em>New Canaan Water Co., </em>155 Conn. 477, 489, 234 A.2d 825 (1967).\u201d <em>Venturi </em>v. <em>Savitt, Inc., </em>191 Conn. 588, 592, 468 A.2d 933 (1983); see <em>West Haven </em>v. <em>Hartford Ins. Co., </em>221 Conn. 149, 160, 602 A.2d 988 (1992). If the evidence discloses that a defendant was recklessly indifferent to the rights of a plaintiff, an actual intention to do harm to the plaintiff is not necessary. <em>Collens </em>v. <em>New Canaan Water Co., </em>supra, 490. In the present case, the jury could reasonably have found from the evidence presented at the trial that Loiseau, Jr., subjected the plaintiff to physical abuse, in reckless disregard of the consequences of his actions. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>we are persuaded that the trial court properly allowed the jury to decide whether the plaintiff was entitled to punitive damages on the sixth count of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly failed to declare a mistrial on the basis that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was guilty of misconduct during the course of the trial, which prejudiced the defendants in the eyes of the jury. We conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in denying the defendants\u2019 several requests for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">In support of his argument that the trial court should have declared a mistrial, Loiseau, Jr., points to certain actions taken by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that he charges were \u201cdesigned to, and did, indelibly prejudice the defendants and their counsel in the minds of the jury and robbed the defendants of their fundamental right to a fair and impartial trial.\u201d In particular, he cites the plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s questioning of him in regard to his arrest record, suggestions by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel before the jury that defense counsel\u2019s questioning was improper and that defense counsel had hidden the truth, and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s reference in argument before the jury to the size of defense counsel\u2019s law firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">We have stated that \u201c[a] deliberate attempt by counsel to create a prejudice in the minds of the jury . . . may justify the trial court in granting a motion for a mistrial as a punitive measure.\u201d <em>Bryar </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>152 Conn. 162, 164-65, 204 A.2d 831 (1964); see <em>Furber </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>117 Conn. 478, 481, 169 A. 43 (1933). We have also stated, however, that \u201c[t]he trial court is invested with a large discretion with regard to arguments of counsel, and we should interfere only where that discretion was clearly exceeded or abused to the manifest injury of some party.\u201d <em>Bryar </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 165. The trial court similarly exercises broad discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>tion in deciding what lines of questioning it will allow and whether counsel\u2019s comments before the jury are so prejudicial as to necessitate the declaration of a mistrial. See, e.g., <em>James </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>83 Conn. 702, 706, 78 A. 420 (1910) (trial court is invested with a large discretion over arguments of counsel and \u201c \u2018conduct of the trial in other respects\u2019 \u201d). After reviewing the record for the alleged instances of attorney misconduct, we are persuaded that the trial court in the present case did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendants\u2019 motions for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">We now consider the claims raised by the plaintiff in his cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury, with respect to the defamation counts of the defendants\u2019 counterclaim, that he enjoyed a qualified privilege to report the defendants\u2019 business improprieties to public authorities, and, therefore, that the defendants had the burden of proving malice in order to prevail on these counts. The defendants argue that the plaintiff did not properly preserve this claim because he failed to except to the trial court\u2019s charge in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 315.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We agree with the defendants and, therefore, we do not reach the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">The plaintiff asserts that he specifically requested that the trial court instruct the jury that he had a \u201cquali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>fied immunity\u201d to report to the FBI and to the Department of Defense the \u201cillegal procurement practices\u201d of the defendants Bird and Loiseau, Sr. The plaintiff did not submit a written request to charge with respect to the defendants\u2019 defamation counts. He did, however, except to the trial court\u2019s jury charge immediately after it was given. We conclude, nevertheless, that the plaintiff\u2019s exception did not conform with the requirements of \u00a7 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Section 315 provides that this court is not bound to review claims of error in jury instructions if the party raising the claim did not either submit to the trial court a written request to charge or promptly except to the charge after it was delivered. The rule provides further that \u201c[c]ounsel taking the exception shall state distinctly the matter objected to and the ground of objection.\u201d \u201cThe purpose of the rule is to alert the court to claims of error while there is still an opportunity for correction in order to avoid the economic waste and increased court congestion caused by unnecessary retrials.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Prystash </em>v. <em>Best Medium Publishing Co., </em>157 Conn. 507, 512, 254 A.2d 872 (1969). The defendants argue that the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the trial court\u2019s charge on the counterclaim was so general as to fail to indicate the specific counts of the counterclaim to which he was excepting or the grounds of the exception. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">After the trial court completed its charge to the jury, the plaintiff timely excepted to certain aspects of the court\u2019s instructions on the counts of his complaint. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then stated that he had a \u201cgeneral objection\u201d to the trial court\u2019s charges on the defendants\u2019 counterclaim. During the course of his exception, the plaintiffs counsel twice alluded to a potential \u201cprivilege\u201d that the plaintiff might have to disclose the defendants\u2019 illegal conduct to certain authorities or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>accordance with a legal duty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In connection with his references to privilege, the plaintiffs counsel specifically mentioned the trial court\u2019s charge on the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>ants\u2019 breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty claim. At no point, however, did the plaintiff expressly refer to the trial court\u2019s charge on the defendants\u2019 defamation counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The trial court delivered instructions on all seven counts of the defendants\u2019 counterclaim, which arose from a common set of facts. \u201cWhile we accept, as correct, [the plaintiff\u2019s] statement of what he had in mind, there is nothing to indicate that the court correctly understood what he had in mind.\u201d <em>Bevins </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>146 Conn. 10, 13, 147 A.2d 189 (1958). The plaintiff took only a general exception to the trial court\u2019s charge on the defendants\u2019 counterclaim and failed to draw any nexus between the asserted \u201cprivilege\u201d and the defamation counts. See <em>Iseli Co. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>211 Conn. 133, 139, 558 A.2d 966 (1989). We are persuaded that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cimprecise reference did not reasonably alert the court to the deficiencies in the charge now advanced. Counsel thus failed to \u2018state distinctly the matter objected to and the ground of objection\u2019 as required by Practice Book \u00a7 315 for appellate review.\u201d <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil Co., </em>202 Conn. 234, 237-38, 520 A.2d 1008 (1987). Accordingly, we do not reach the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s first claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s second claim is that the trial court improperly directed a verdict in favor of the defendant Loiseau, Sr., on the false imprisonment count of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint when the jury was unable to reach a verdict on that count. We agree and, therefore, reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the case for a new trial with respect to that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>At the close of the plaintiffs case, the defendants moved for a directed verdict on all six counts of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion with respect to the defamation count only. The remaining counts, including the false imprisonment count, were sent to the jury. The jury reached verdicts in favor of the plaintiff on all counts except the false imprisonment count, on which it was unable to reach a verdict. The plaintiff promptly moved for a retrial of the false imprisonment count.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendants moved to set aside the jury\u2019s verdicts and have verdicts directed in their favor as to counts two, three, four and six. The defendants also renewed their motion for a directed verdict on the false imprisonment count. After hearing argument on the motions, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside and direct verdicts with respect to the wrongful termination and breach of implied covenant of good faith counts. The trial court also directed a verdict for Loiseau, Sr., on the false imprisonment count.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">In directing a verdict on the false imprisonment count, the trial court first reviewed the evidence that had been presented with respect to that count.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>court then concluded: \u201cIt is incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the whole evidence the allegations of this count. The Court finds the plaintiff has failed to do so. The credible evidence falls far short of sustaining that burden, leaving the Court no alternative but to direct the verdict as to count one for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The plaintiff argues that the trial court improperly usurped the province of the jury by directing a verdict on the false imprisonment count after the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Loiseau, Sr., contends, to the contrary, that the trial court acted within its discretion in directing a verdict on the basis that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>was so inconsistent as to be insufficient to support a claim of false imprisonment. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the trial court acted improperly in directing a verdict for Loiseau, Sr., on the false imprisonment count.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 321, a party whose motion for a directed verdict has been denied may move to have the jury\u2019s verdict set aside and to have judgment rendered in accordance with his motion for a directed verdict.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If no verdict has been returned, however, the party simply moves for judgment pursuant to the motion for a directed verdict. The trial court may then either direct the entry of judgment or order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">\u201cThe standard of review of directed verdicts is well settled. A directed verdict is justified if on the evidence the jury could not reasonably and legally have reached any other conclusion. <em>Petyan </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>200 Conn. 243, 244, 510 A.2d 1337 (1986); <em>Golembeski </em>v. <em>Metichewan Grange No. 190, </em>20 Conn. App. 699, 701, 569 A.2d 1157 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>(1990).\u201d <em>Merola </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>21 Conn. App. 633, 636, 575 A.2d 1025 (1990). In reviewing the trial court\u2019s action in directing a verdict for Loiseau, Sr., we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Petyan </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra; <em>Merola </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra. This court has repeatedly stated that directed verdicts are not favored. <em>Petyan </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra; <em>Puro </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>188 Conn. 301, 303, 449 A.2d 176 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">False imprisonment is the unlawful restraint by one person of the physical liberty of another. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Donroe, </em>186 Conn. 265, 267, 440 A.2d 973 (1982); <em>Felix </em>v. <em>Hall-Brooke Sanitarium, </em>140 Conn. 496, 499, 101 A.2d 500 (1953). \u201cAny period of such restraint, however brief in duration, is sufficient to constitute a basis for liability. 32 Am. Jur. 2d, False Imprisonment \u00a7 14.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Donroe, </em>supra. \u201cTo prevail on a claim of false imprisonment, the plaintiff must prove that his physical liberty has been restrained by the defendant and that the restraint was against his will, that is, that he did not consent to the restraint or acquiesce in it willingly.\u201d <em>Lo Sacco </em>v. <em>Young, </em>20 Conn. App. 6, 19, 564 A.2d 610, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 808, 568 A.2d 793 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In the present case, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, established the following. On March 7, 1987, the plaintiff was at his work station-in the Bird shop. Loiseau, Jr., came and took him by the arm and escorted him to Loiseau, Sr.\u2019s office. When the plaintiff was brought into the office, Loiseau, Sr., displayed a revolver. Both Loiseau, Sr., and Loiseau, Jr., used abusive and threatening language toward the plaintiff and accused him of trying to harm their business. Loiseau, Sr., then took the plaintiff by the arm and escorted him to Loiseau, Sr.\u2019s car. The plaintiff did not feel free to leave while he was in Loiseau, Sr.\u2019s car. Loiseau, Sr., drove the plaintiff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>the plaintiffs house where the plaintiff retrieved certain photographs and gave them to Loiseau, Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">In ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict, the trial court properly defined false imprisonment as \u201cthe intentional, unlawful restraint or confinement of a person\u2019s physical liberty through the exercise of force . . . express or implied.\u201d See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Donroe, </em>supra; <em>Lo Sacco </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra. The trial court assumed that the plaintiff\u2019s claim that Loiseau, Sr., had used force was based solely on his possession of a gun. Because the evidence was inconsistent with regard to Loiseau, Sr.\u2019s possession and use of a gun during the events of March 7, 1987, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff had not met his burden of proving the element of force by a preponderance of the evidence. See footnote 12, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">It is uniquely the province of the trier of fact, in this case the jury, to determine the import of the evidence by gauging the credibility of the witnesses. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 255, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772, reh. denied, 466 U.S. 954, 104 S. Ct. 2163, 80 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1984); <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>186 Conn. 387, 391, 441 A.2d 629 (1982). The fact that certain testimony is uncorroborated, or even contradicted, does not make it insufficient to support a verdict if the testimony is believed by the trier. See <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>190 Conn. 173, 179, 460 A.2d 945 (1983). Thus, in the present case, had the jury believed the plaintiff\u2019s testimony regarding the events of March 7, 1987, it reasonably could have found Loiseau, Sr., liable for false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">The jury, however, was unable to reach a verdict with respect to this count. Practice Book \u00a7 321 grants the trial court discretion in determining whether to order a new trial when the jury has not returned a verdict. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>We are persuaded, nonetheless, that the trial court in this case abused its discretion in directing a verdict for Loiseau, Sr., on the false imprisonment count. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial on this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">In his separate appeal, the plaintiff challenges the sufficiency of his punitive damages award. The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly: (1) denied him his constitutional right to have the jury determine the amount of his punitive damages award; (2) applied General Statutes \u00a7 52-251c to limit the amount of punitive damages awarded him to one third of his recovery on the intentional infliction of emotional distress count;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and (3) failed to consider evidence of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>tiffs nontaxable costs in calculating his punitive damages award. The plaintiff also mounts a general challenge to our rule governing the measure of common law punitive damages. We find merit in the plaintiffs second claim and, accordingly, reverse and remand the case to the trial court for a new hearing on punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The relevant facts are as follows. The trial court submitted written interrogatories to the jury concerning punitive damages and instructed that, should the jury find such damages warranted, the court would determine the amount of the award. The jury responded that the plaintiff was entitled to recover punitive damages on his intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, and that the defendants Bird and Loiseau, Sr., were entitled to recover punitive damages on the defamation counts of the counterclaim. Thereafter, the trial court conducted a hearing to determine the amounts of the punitive damages awards, at which the parties submitted evidence of their litigation expenses. The plaintiff submitted evidence of a retainer agreement along with an affidavit summarizing hourly attorney\u2019s fees and costs totaling $143,902.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendants sought hourly attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the amount of $157,655.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>The trial court concluded that the provisions of \u00a7 52-251c controlled the plaintiffs award and, therefore, awarded the plaintiff punitive damages of $16,667, the equivalent of one third of the plaintiffs recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court awarded the defendants $50,000 in punitive damages.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> From this judgment, the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">As an initial matter, we consider the plaintiffs argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that this court should abandon the longstanding rule in Connecticut limiting common law punitive damages to a party\u2019s litigation costs. The plaintiff argues that the rule requiring that punitive damages be measured by attorney\u2019s fees does not adequately serve to punish or deter wrongdoers. He proposes, therefore, that this court should set aside this rule in favor of a rule allowing broader jury discretion in fashioning punitive damages awards.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We decline the plaintiff\u2019s invitation to abandon our well established rule governing punitive damages awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The plaintiff claims that we should abandon our rule limiting punitive damages to litigation expenses less taxable costs in light of <em>Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Haslip, </em>499 U.S. 1, 111 S. Ct. 1032, 113 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1991). In <em>Haslip, </em>the United States Supreme Court upheld an Alabama jury\u2019s punitive damages award against a due process challenge raised by the wrongdoer. In accordance with the common law practice, Alabama allows juries broad discretion over the size of punitive damages awards. In reaching its conclusion that the punitive damages assessed by the jury did not violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, the court reviewed prior cases, including <em>Browning-Ferris Industries of Vermont, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kelco Disposal, Inc., </em>492 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>257, 109 S. Ct. 2909, 106 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1989) <em>(Browning-Ferris Industries). </em>There, a majority of the court had rejected a claim that punitive damages awarded in a civil case between private parties could violate the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment to the United States constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The plaintiff argues that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Haslip, </em>when read in conjunction with its decision in <em>Browning-Ferris Industries, </em>has dispelled a primary concern underlying Connecticut\u2019s limitation on punitive damages, which was first expressed by this court in <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>78 Conn. 492, 62 A. 785 (1906). In <em>Hanna, </em>this court characterized the common law doctrine of punitive damages as a \u201chybrid\u201d that contained elements of a criminal fine. Id., 494. More recently, we reiterated our concern that the determination of punitive damages under the common law rule allowing broad jury discretion is at odds with the generally accepted rule of compensation in civil cases. <em>Waterbury Petroleum Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil &amp; Fuel Co., </em>193 Conn. 208, 236, 477 A.2d 988 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The plaintiff contends that the holdings of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Haslip </em>and <em>Browning-Ferris Industries </em>undermine the rationale behind Connecticut\u2019s rule. The plaintiff acknowledges that these holdings do not affect the constitutionality of Connecticut\u2019s limitations on punitive damages awards. He argues, nonetheless, that this court should abandon the so-called \u201ccompensatory\u201d measure of punitive damages in favor of an \u201cexemplary\u201d type of punitive damages that allows greater jury discretion. The plaintiff contends that absent the \u201cmeasuring rod\u201d of attorney\u2019s fees, juries will be better able to award punitive damages that serve the purposes of deterrence and punishment. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>In <em>Waterbury Petroleum Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil &amp; Fuel Co., </em>supra, we declined a similar invitation to stray from our well settled rule regarding the measurement of punitive damages. We affirmed the continuing viability of a long line of cases holding that common law punitive damages serve primarily to compensate the plaintiff for his injuries and, thus, are properly limited to the plaintiff\u2019s litigation expenses less taxable costs. See, e.g., <em>Alaimo </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>188 Conn. 36, 42, 448 A.2d 207 (1982); <em>Vandersluis </em>v. <em>Weil, </em>176 Conn. 353, 358, 407 A.2d 982 (1978); <em>Collens </em>v. <em>New Canaan Water Co., </em>155 Conn. 477, 488, 234 A.2d 825 (1967); <em>Triangle Sheet Metal Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>154 Conn. 116, 127, 222 A.2d 220 (1966); <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>supra. We recognized, moreover, that our rule, when viewed in the light of the increasing costs of litigation, also serves to punish and deter wrongful conduct. <em>Waterbury Petroleum Products, </em>Inc. v. <em>Canaan Oil &amp; Fuel Co., </em>supra, 237-38. In recent years, we have continued to adhere to the view that our traditional rule remains viable. See, e.g., <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 40, 59 n.4, 578 A.2d 1054 (1990); <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>212 Conn. 509, 559, 562 A.2d 1100 (1989). We remain convinced that a rule limiting punitive damages awards to the expenses of litigation less taxable costs \u201cfulfills the salutary purpose of fully compensating a victim for the harm inflicted on him while avoiding the potential for injustice which may result from the exercise of unfettered discretion by a jury.\u201d <em>Waterbury Petroleum Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil &amp; Fuel Co., </em>supra, 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The plaintiff claims that he was entitled under article first, \u00a7 19 of the Connecticut constitution to have the jury determine the amount of punitive damages to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>be awarded him.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The defendant Loiseau, Jr., argues that the plaintiff has not properly preserved this claim for appellate review. We agree with Loiseau, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The record reveals that the plaintiff did not take an exception after the trial court instructed the jury that the court would determine the amount of punitive damages to be awarded. In addition, the plaintiff has failed to present to this court portions of the trial transcript, if any exist, that disclose an objection to the trial court\u2019s determination of punitive damages, made by the plaintiff during the course of the trial.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>American Thread Co., </em>200 Conn. 108, 110, 509 A.2d 512 (1986) (responsibility of appellant to provide adequate record for appellate review).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 4185 provides that this court is not bound to consider a claim that was not distinctly raised at trial. This rule applies to constitutional claims. <em>DiBerardino </em>v. <em>DiBerardino, </em>213 Conn. 373, 376, 568 A.2d 431 (1990); <em>Sands </em>v. <em>Sands, </em>188 Conn. 98, 106, 448 A.2d 822 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1148, 103 S. Ct. 792, 74 L. Ed. 2d 997 (1983). \u201c \u2018[O]nly in most exceptional circumstances can and will this court consider a claim, constitutional or otherwise, that has not been raised and decided in the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>186 Conn. 490, 505, 442 A.2d 911 (1982). \u201cSuch exceptional circumstances may occur where a new and unforeseen constitutional right has arisen between the time of trial and appeal or where the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>ord supports a claim that a litigant has been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial. . . . An exception may also be made where consideration of the question is in the interest of public welfare or of justice between the parties.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Friedland, </em>222 Conn. 131, 147, 609 A.2d 645 (1992). The plaintiff has pointed us to no such exceptional circumstances in the present case and, accordingly, we decline to review the merits of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">We next address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly applied General Statutes \u00a7 52-251c to limit the amount of his punitive damages award to one third of his recovery on the intentional infliction of emotional distress count. The plaintiff claims that the trial court incorrectly concluded that \u00a7 52-251c required the court to measure the plaintiffs punitive damages award by reference to the contingency fee agreement he had with his attorney. He argues that the trial court should properly have calculated the award based on the number of hours that his attorney actually devoted to the case. We conclude that the trial court acted improperly to the extent that it held that \u00a7 52-251c <em>controlled </em>the amount of punitive damages it was permitted to award the plaintiff. We therefore reverse and remand the case for a new hearing on punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Section 52-251c was enacted in 1986 as part of the Connecticut Tort Reform Act. Public Acts 1986, No. 86-338, \u00a7 1. The statute restricts the size of the fee that an attorney can recover from a client pursuant to a contingency fee agreement in an action to recover damages for personal injury, wrongful death or property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>damage.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Section 52-251c (b) provides that when an attorney and his client enter into such a contingency fee arrangement, \u201csuch fee shall be the exclusive method for payment of the attorney\u201d by the client and \u201cshall not exceed an amount equal to . . . [thirty-three and one-third per cent of the first three hundred thousand dollars\u201d of the damages awarded and received by the client. The trial court concluded that \u00a7 52-251c (b) operated to limit the amount of punitive damages that it could award the plaintiff in accordance with his fee agreement with his attorney. See footnote 16, supra. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">\u201cIn construing any statute, we seek to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 755, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992). It is a well established rule of statutory construction that \u201cwhen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). Section 52-251c, by its terms, regulates the relationship between an attorney and a client with respect to the collection of a contingency fee in certain types of civil actions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>ute does not purport to govern a trial court\u2019s discretion in assessing the amount of punitive damages to be awarded to a party who has a contingency fee agreement with his attorney. \u201c \u2018Courts should not read into clearly expressed legislation provisions which do not find expression in its words.\u2019 \u201d <em>Local 218 Steamfitters Welfare Fund </em>v. <em>Cobra Pipe Supply &amp; Coil Co., </em>207 Conn. 639, 645, 541 A.2d 869 (1988). Accordingly, we hold that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 52-251c controlled the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s punitive damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">In reversing the judgment of the trial court, we do not hold that the trial court improperly considered the plaintiffs fee agreement with his attorney in calculating the punitive damages to be awarded to the plaintiff. Although the plaintiff correctly argues that the trial court misinterpreted the applicability of \u00a7 52-251c, we reject his underlying premise that the factfinder should not consider a contingency fee arrangement in determining punitive damages. This court has previously upheld punitive damages awards computed on the basis of a plaintiff\u2019s contingency fee agreement with his attorney. See <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Casazza, </em>204 Conn. 336, 359-61, 528 A.2d 774 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1006, 108 S. Ct. 699, 98 L. Ed. 2d 651 (1988); <em>Markey </em>v. <em>Santangelo, 195 Conn. </em>76, 80, 485 A.2d 1305 (1985); <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 280, 293-96, 472 A.2d 306 (1984). We note, moreover, that the admission of a written fee agreement as evidence of the plaintiffs litigation expenses is in accord with Connecticut practice. See 6 Connecticut Practice, J. Fitzgerald &amp; R. Yules, Connecticut Trial Practice (1987) \u00a7 5.19, p. 197. Thus, on remand, the trial court may properly consider the terms of the plaintiff\u2019s fee agreement in assessing the amount of punitive damages to be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly excluded nontaxable costs from its award of punitive damages. The plaintiff argues that even if the trial court correctly applied \u00a7 52-251c to limit his punitive damages award, it improperly failed to consider evidence of his nontaxable costs. The defendants contend that the plaintiff submitted insufficient evidence of these costs and, therefore, was not entitled to be compensated for them. Because we are remanding this case for a new hearing on the punitive damages due the plaintiff, we address this claim only insofar as it may arise on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">According to the defendants, the plaintiff\u2019s submission of an affidavit summarizing his nontaxable expenses, without supporting documentation, was inadequate to substantiate his claim. The defendants argue, moreover, that the plaintiff failed to show that the claimed expenses had been incurred in connection with the prosecution of the intentional infliction of emotional distress count, on which the jury had decided that the plaintiff was entitled to punitive damages. The defendants contend that, as a result of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to provide sufficient evidence, the trial court had no basis upon which to award the plaintiff nontaxable costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Common law punitive damages cannot exceed the plaintiff\u2019s expenses of litigation, less his taxable costs. See, e.g., <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>supra, 532-33; <em>Vandersluis </em>v. <em>Weil, </em>supra, 358. Litigation expenses may include not only reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, but also any other nontaxable disbursements reasonably necessary to prosecuting the action. <em>Markey </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>supra, 80. We have stated that \u201cfor an award of punitive damages, it is essential that evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>dence of the cost of the litigation of the case being tried must be offered.\u201d <em>Vandersluis </em>v. <em>Weil, </em>supra; see <em>Chykirda </em>v. <em>Yanush, </em>131 Conn. 565, 568-69, 41 A.2d 449 (1945). Our case law, however, does not specify the type of evidence required to support an award of punitive damages. On remand, the trial court is to consider any evidence that the plaintiff submits regarding nontaxable costs incurred in the prosecution of his intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed with respect to the defendant Edward Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s appeal and the first claim of the plaintiff\u2019s cross appeal. The judgment of the trial court is reversed with respect to the second claim of the plaintiff\u2019s cross appeal and the case is remanded for a new trial on the first count of the plaintiffs complaint. The judgment of the trial court is reversed, in part, with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s appeal and the case is remanded for a new hearing on the award of punitive damages to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">In this opinion Peters, C.

Our conclusion in <em>Richmond, </em>however, is inapposite to the present case. In <em>Richmond, </em>the plaintiff sued the city of Norwich for its negligence in hiring a certain guard at the city\u2019s reservoir. The plaintiff had been shot by that guard while attempting to drive into the reservoir. The trial court, over the defendant\u2019s objection, admitted the testimony of a certain witness regarding the guard\u2019s threatening behavior toward him <em>after </em>the incident that was the subject of the lawsuit. This court concluded that the trial court had erroneously admitted that witness\u2019 testimony because its prejudicial impact outweighed its probative value. Alternatively, this court stated that the defendant might have objected to the evidence on the ground of relevance, in that the action was for negligence and not for an intentional tort. In the present case, Gamage\u2019s testimony concerned Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s <em>past </em>acts and was offered to prove <em>intentional </em>tortious conduct. The trial court could reasonably have concluded that the proffered evidence was both relevant and probative on the issue of the plaintiffs consent to Loiseau, Jr.\u2019s actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b830-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-216a provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf the court at the conclusion of the trial concludes that the verdict is excessive as a matter of law, it shall order a remittitur and, upon failure of the party so ordered to remit the amount ordered by the court, it shall set aside the verdict and order a new trial.

The trial court accepted the defendants\u2019 argument, ruling as follows on the issue of the plaintiff\u2019s punitive damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-13\">\u201cThe Court: As I indicated, we have the matter of the attorneys fees that the Court indicated we would address after having received argument and having reviewed all of the submittals that counsel has made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-14\">\u201cAs to the plaintiff, the Court finds the provisions of Section 52-251[c] of the General Statutes controlling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-15\">\u201cAnd accordingly, allows plaintiff a punitive damage award of sixteen thousand six hundred sixty-seven dollars ($16,667.00).

In awarding the defendants $50,000 in punitive damages when they had sought $157,655, the trial court explicitly rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that all of the claims and counterclaim were so intertwined as to allow them to recover all litigation costs they had incurred, despite the fact that the jury had awarded them punitive damages only on the defamation counts of the counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b847-6\"> The defendants argue that the plaintiff\u2019s claim is not properly before this court because he failed to raise it at the trial level.

Ct. 1032, 113 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1991).
