In this appeal, the defendant deputy commissioner of labor, Lawrence S. Fox (deputy commissioner), in lieu of the defendant commissioner of labor, Betty L. Tianti (commissioner), who disqualified herself, determined that the plaintiff, Electrical Contractors, Inc., was subject to placement on the debarment list because it had disregarded its obligations under \u00a7 31-53, the prerequisite for debarment. The trial court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"A29\">The following facts are not disputed. On June 11, 1986, the plaintiff entered into a contract with the state of Connecticut to install electrical smoke and fire alarms in dormitories at the University of Connecticut in Storrs (UConn project). The plaintiff signed a \u201cContract or Wage Certification Form\u201d certifying that it and its subcontractors would pay all employees on the UConn project the appropriate wages as listed in the schedule of prevailing wage rates, which was attached to the form. The commissioner set the schedule of prevailing wage rates on the basis of the federal schedule of prevailing wage rates, which has been the basis for determining rates for public works contracts since 1977. The prevailing rate schedule for the UConn project contained an hourly wage rate for each job classification, as well as a separate amount under each classification for total benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqg\">The plaintiff commenced work on the UConn project in March, 1987. A short time later, the plaintiff learned that it would have to suspend work from May 9 to May 18,1987, a period encompassing six working days, to minimize noise while the students prepared for final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>exams. As a consequence, the plaintiff proposed the following to its employees: (1) that they work forty-eight hours per week, beginning with the week ending March 21,1987, and continuing for six consecutive weeks; (2) that they be paid for forty hours of work for each of these forty-eight hour work weeks; and (3) that they receive regular pay for the extra hours worked when the job was shut down and no work was performed. The employees were informed that if they chose not to accept the proposal, they would be placed at another job site. Twelve of thirteen employees agreed to accept the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">As a result, the plaintiff had its employees work forty-eight hours a week for seven weeks<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to replace the seven working days that would be missed during the shut down period. The plaintiff kept three sets of records, one accurately disclosing the time worked and two incomplete sets, each showing only partial hours worked per week. As for the eight registered apprentices on the UConn project, the plaintiff calculated their pay by adding the journeyperson\u2019s wage rate to the amount of total benefits and multiplying that amount by the percentage applicable to each apprentice.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Subsequently, one of the plaintiffs employees on the UConn project signed an affidavit stating that he and other employees had worked forty-eight hours per week during this period but had been paid only for forty hours. The affidavit was delivered to the defendant department of labor (department), which commenced an investigation. As a result of the investigation, the department initiated hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>The hearing officer determined that the plaintiff had violated \u00a7 31-53a by disregarding its obligations under \u00a7 31-53 to its employees in that it failed to pay them overtime for time worked in excess of forty hours per week for a seven week period, had failed to pay its apprentice employees 100 percent of the total benefits rate, and had failed to keep true and accurate records. The total amount found to be due to the employees was $5376.19. The plaintiff complied with the department\u2019s order to reimburse its employees the amount owed. The deputy commissioner adopted the findings of facts and decision of the hearing officer and ordered the name of the plaintiff\u2019s firm to appear on the debarment list. No other firm had previously been placed on this list.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The plaintiff appealed the decision of the deputy commissioner to the Superior Court. The trial court affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s administrative appeal. The court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the word \u201cdisregard,\u201d for the purpose of debarment pursuant to \u00a7 31-53a, requires willful or knowing conduct. The court then held that the plaintiff had disregarded its obligations under \u00a7 31-53 by (1) not paying its employees overtime wages, (2) failing to pay its apprentices the proper amount, and (3) failing to keep true and accurate records. The trial court further concluded that the commissioner had properly adopted the applicable federal wage rate determinations. Lastly, the court rejected the plaintiffs argument of selective prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In this appeal, the plaintiff essentially pursues the claims that it raised before the trial court. We affirm the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the commissioner needs to find only that a firm negligently disregarded its obligations in order to trigger debarment under \u00a7 31-53a. We reverse the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to pay overtime wages constituted a vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>lation of \u00a7 31-53 (a) in that overtime is a rate \u201ccustomary or prevailing\u201d for the same work as that done on the UConn project. We reverse the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff was put on notice as to the proper computation of apprentice wage rates. Because we agree with the trial court that the plaintiff failed to keep and maintain true and accurate records, we conclude that on remand the commissioner must determine whether that violation alone is a sufficient ground for debarment under \u00a7 31-53a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">\u201cDisregard\u201d op the Plaintiff\u2019s Obligation</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The plaintiff first claims that any alleged violations of \u00a7 31-53 did not warrant debarment because they were not intentional or willful. Section 31-53a authorizes and directs the labor commissioner to place on the debarment list the names of any firm \u201cfound to have disregarded their obligations under said section 31-53 to employees and subcontractors . . . .\u201d Relying on the definition of \u201cdisregard\u201d in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.), the trial court concluded that an employer \u201cdisregards his obligations to employees within the meaning of the \u00a7 31-53a when he ignores, overlooks or fails to observe such obligations.\u201d Although the plaintiff agrees with this definition, it nonetheless claims that the trial court improperly construed the word to include violations that are not intentional or willful. We disagree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The trial court properly accorded the word \u201cdisregard\u201d its common, everyday definition. \u201cWords and phrases of a statute are to be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language.\u201d <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>204 Conn. 760, 763, 529 A.2d 194 (1987); see General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). To support its position, the plaintiff claims that a different dictionary, the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Second College Edition (1991), should be followed. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defines \u201cdisregard\u201d under its noun definition to mean \u201clack of thoughtful attention or due regard, esp. when willful.\u201d Even the plaintiff\u2019s definition, however, includes negligent conduct. Moreover, the plaintiff conceded at oral argument that its preferred construction of \u201cdisregard\u201d as only willful conduct is strained. Accordingly, we adopt the commonly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>approved definition of \u201cdisregard,\u201d which does not require intentional or willful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The plaintiff also argues that if we condition debarment on conduct that is neither intentional or willful, we would leave employers open to the drastic sanction of debarment for a minor error of a few dollars. The answer is that if the legislature had wished to condition debarment on intentional or willful conduct, then it could have said so. See <em>Buonocore </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>192 Conn. 399, 403, 471 A.2d 961 (1984). For example, in subsection (b) of \u00a7 31-53, the legislature specifically required a finding that an employer \u201cknowingly or willfully\u201d employed workers at a wage rate less than the customary or prevailing rate before the employer would be subject to a fine. Furthermore, under such drastic circumstances the employer would still have recourse to the argument that the commissioner had acted arbitrarily and capriciously. We agree, therefore, with the trial court that conduct that is merely negligent will suffice to support a finding that an employer disregarded its obligations under \u00a7 31-53 in order to trigger debarment under \u00a7 31-53a.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Failure to Pay Overtime Wages</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">We turn next to the plaintiffs claim that the failure to pay overtime wages, although a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 31-76c,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> does not constitute a failure to pay the customary or prevailing wage rate pursuant to \u00a7 31-53 (a) and, therefore, does not call for the sanction of debarment. The trial court, however, agreed with the commissioner that the payment of overtime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>wages is <em>customary </em>in the plaintiffs trade and, therefore, any overtime violation is a violation of the employer\u2019s obligation under \u00a7 31-53 (a). The plaintiff argues that even though it violated \u00a7 31-76c by failing to pay overtime wages, overtime is neither expressly incorporated in \u00a7 31-53 as a \u201ccustomary\u201d wage rate, or impliedly incorporated by reference in \u00a7 31-53 (f) to a different statute. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Section 31-53 (a) requires that employees in public works projects receive wages \u201cat a rate equal to the <em>rate customary or prevailing </em>for the same work in the same trade or occupation in the town in which such public works project is being constructed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff argues that the plain language of the statute indicates that the phrase \u201ccustomary or prevailing\u201d constitutes a unitary term, with both words having the same meaning. The commissioner argues that the words \u201ccustomary\u201d and \u201cprevailing\u201d within the phrase \u201ccustomary or prevailing\u201d mean different things. We agree with the plaintiff for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">First, subsection (a) of \u00a7 31-53 refers to \u201crate\u201d in the singular, thereby indicating that there is only one rate, not a \u201ccustomary rate\u201d and a \u201cprevailing rate.\u201d Second, the commissioner received her authority to determine the prevailing rate of wage under \u00a7 31-53 (d). Subsection (d) authorizes the commissioner to determine only the \u201cprevailing rate of wage.\u201d The statute does not provide comparable methods for determining what would constitute a \u201ccustomary rate of wage.\u201d Subsection (e), the certification procedure, lends itself to the same construction. This subsection requires every contractor on a public works project to \u201ccertify, under oath, to the labor commissioner the pay scale to be used by such contractor . . . .\u201d The commissioner concedes that the \u201cContractor Wage Certification Form,\u201d supplied by the commissioner and signed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the plaintiff, pertained to the prevailing rate only and did not include overtime rates. Moreover, subsection (e) states that the hourly rate of wage and the benefits contribution or payment shall be considered the \u201cminimum rate,\u201d and there is no mention of overtime calculations as forming a part of this minimum rate. Indeed, except for subsections (a) and (b), which refer to the \u201ccustomary or prevailing\u201d wage rate, the gravamen of the statute focuses on the prevailing rate of wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Third, we are not persuaded by the commissioner\u2019s argument that the reference in subsection (f) of \u00a7 31-53 to the investigative provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 31-59 and the enforcement provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 31-69 impliedly incorporate the overtime provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 31-60. This is reading something into the statute that is not there. We decline to follow such a tortuous analysis because it ignores the plain language of subsection (f), which incorporates only those provisions listed. \u201cOur role is to construe legislation as we find it, regardless of whether we think it might have been improved or a preferable result reached by the inclusion of other provisions.\u201d <em>Galullo </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>175 Conn. 182, 186, 397 A.2d 103 (1978); see also <em>American-Republican, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>183 Conn. 523, 529, 441 A.2d 23 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Moreover, the Davis-Bacon Act; 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 276a-2; which the department claims is the model for \u00a7 31-53, does not include overtime wages as a factor in determining the prevailing wage obligation. The federal regulations confirm that the obligation to pay overtime wages is made on the basis of other statutes: \u201cThe [Davis-Bacon Act] excludes amounts paid by a contractor or subcontractor . . . in the computation of overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, and the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act whenever the overtime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>provisions of any of these statutes apply concurrently with the Davis-Bacon Act or its related prevailing wage statutes.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.32 (a). That the Davis-Bacon Act does not include payment for overtime obligations is persuasive authority for our interpretation of what is required in regard to the payment of the prevailing rate of wage. See <em>Ox Ridge Hunt Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>175 Conn. 90, 93, 394 A.2d 194 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">On the basis of our construction of the statute, we hold that overtime is not a \u201ccustomary or prevailing\u201d wage obligation under \u00a7 31-53. It is important to note that there are remedies and penalties independent of the debarment statute for violations of overtime hours and wages. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-68 and 31-69 provide both a civil remedy and criminal penalties for such violations. We conclude that the trial court incorrectly affirmed the decision of the deputy commissioner that the plaintiff \u201cdisregarded\u201d its obligations under \u00a7 31-53 when it committed a violation of the overtime statutes. Accordingly, the decision of the deputy commissioner to place the plaintiff on the debarment list cannot be premised on the plaintiffs admitted violation of the overtime provisions of \u00a7 31-76c.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Apprentice Wages</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s method of calculating payment to its eight registered apprentices on the UConn project was a ground for placing it on the debarment list. The trial court affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff should have calculated the apprentices\u2019 pay on the basis of a percentage of the journeyperson\u2019s wages, <em>plus the full amount of the joumeyperson\u2019s \u201ctotal benefits. \u201d </em>Instead, the plaintiff argues that it paid the apprentices on the basis of <em>a percentage of both </em>the hourly rate and total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>benefits because it was not put on notice as to the proper method of calculation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Neither \u00a7\u00a7 31-53 and 31-53a nor the regulations enacted thereunder mention apprentice wages. We first look, therefore, to the federal prevailing wage rate determinations as adopted by the commissioner pursuant to \u00a7 31-53 (d). The schedule of prevailing rates required for the UConn project stated: \u201cApprentices duly registered . . . are allowed to be paid <em>the appropriate percentage of the prevailing [journeypersons] rate, </em>provided the work site ratio shall not be less than one full-time journey-person instructing and supervising the work of each apprentice in a specific trade.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although the trial court found the prevailing wage rate schedule to be unclear as to apprenticeship wages, both the plaintiff and the commissioner claim that its plain language supports their conflicting positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The plaintiff claims that the prevailing wage rate schedule authorized its method of calculating apprentice wages. The schedule contains two columns of figures: (1) the prevailing rates of wages (hourly rate); and (2) the employee welfare contributions (total benefits). The first paragraph of the prevailing wage rate schedule states that employers who are not required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>to pay employee welfare contributions to a welfare and pension fund must pay that amount directly to each employee as part of his or her hourly wage. The plaintiff argues that, therefore, the schedule itself combines the total benefits and hourly rates into one hourly wage under certain circumstances. That being the case, the plaintiff argues, then the schedule, in its authorization to employers to pay apprentices \u201cthe appropriate percentage of the prevailing [journeypersons] rate,\u201d must regard the \u201crate\u201d as a combination of the hourly rate plus the total benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Conversely, the commissioner claims that the prevailing wage rate schedule is equally clear in its mandate that apprentices shall receive 100 percent of the fringe benefits. The commissioner argues that the wage rate determinations of the United States secretary of labor under the Davis-Bacon Act and other related acts, which were adopted by the commissioner, include both a \u201cbasic hourly rate\u201d and a \u201cfringe benefits\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> amount, in separate columns, for each job classification. Similarly, the state\u2019s prevailing wage rate schedule issued to the plaintiff for the UConn project differentiates between the \u201chourly rate\u201d and the \u201ctotal benefits\u201d amount for each job classification. The commissioner argues that the figures are separate to show that the two columns should not be combined when determining the apprenticeship wages. Moreover, the commissioner reads the plain language of the sentence directing the payment of the welfare and pension fund directly to the employees in certain circumstances to require that the actual amount listed in the \u201ctotal benefits\u201d column be paid to each employee. The commissioner states that it is significant that the term \u201crate\u201d is used only with respect to the hourly rate and not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>the amount of total benefits. Therefore, according to the commissioner, when the prevailing wage rate form stated that \u201capprentices . . . [are] allowed to be paid the appropriate percentage of the prevailing [journey-persons] rate,\u201d it can be read so as to include \u201chourly rates\u201d only and not \u201ctotal benefits\u201d because they are not listed as a \u201crate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">We agree with the trial court that the language of the prevailing wage rate form that was supplied by the commissioner was not sufficiently clear for the commissioner to claim now that the plaintiff was aware of the proper computation of apprentices wages. Accordingly, we will turn to the other sources relied upon by the trial court in its affirmance of the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had notice of the appropriate method to pay apprentices.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In 1983, the office of job training, the designated state apprenticeship agency under the department, sent the plaintiff copies of three virtually identical letters for different projects. The trial court held that the letters establish the required payment method proposed by the department. Because we conclude that the letters, alone, were insufficient to put the plaintiff on notice as to the correct payment procedure for the apprentice wages, we reverse the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">First, the letters are not clear on their face. Each letter contained the names of the registered apprentices for the project and stated: \u201cThe apprentices must be paid the percentage of the program completion rate which is $8.00 or the project [journeyperson\u2019s] rate, whichever is higher, plus the amount of fringe benefits listed on the wage determination for the classification.\u201d The trial court concluded that the word \u201cpercentage,\u201d as used in the letters, applied only to the program completion rate of $8 or the journeyperson\u2019s rate ([% x $8] + fringe benefits). It is a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>able interpretation, however, that the word \u201cpercentage\u201d applies also to the end of the sentence reading \u201cplus the amount of fringe benefits listed\u201d (% [$8 + fringe benefits]). If that is the case, then the plaintiff\u2019s method of calculating apprenticeship wage rates could have been proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Second, the reference to the federal regulations do not definitively establish the proper method. Each letter concluded with a statement that \u201c[e]ach apprentice program sponsor must meet the requirements of [the] Labor Department regulations on Equal Opportunity in Apprenticeship per CFR 29 Part 5.\u201d The letters apparently referred the plaintiff to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5 (a) (4) (iii), which is entitled \u201cEqual employment opportunity,\u201d and states that \u201c[t]he utilization of apprentices, trainees and [journeypersons] under [part five] shall be in conformity with the equal employment opportunity requirements. . . .\u201d This section, \u00a7 5.5 (a) (4) (iii), is the only section in 29 C.F.R. part five that has reference to equal employment opportunities. This section, however, says nothing about the proper calculation of apprenticeship wages or fringe benefits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the three letters sent to the plaintiff did not express the department\u2019s required method of calculating apprenticeship wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Third, the method the plaintiff used to calculate apprentice wages on the UConn project was the same method it had used in 1984 on other state projects. The labor department reviewed the wage records on those projects and did not object to this method of determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ing payments to the apprentices. The plaintiff argues that although the department reviewed the plaintiffs wage records for prevailing wage rate violations, it found no violations. The plaintiff claims on appeal that the trial court mischaracterized this argument as one of estoppel. Although this evidence would not prove estoppel, we agree with the plaintiff that it demonstrates, at a minimum, the department\u2019s own confusion as to the proper method of paying apprentices. We conclude that the plaintiff was not put on notice by the department about the proper calculation of apprentice wage rates. We hold, therefore, that the commissioner may not use the plaintiff\u2019s alleged violation of apprentice wage rates as a ground for placing the plaintiff on the debarment list.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Failure to Keep Proper Records</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The plaintiff also claims that the trial court improperly affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff disregarded its obligation under \u00a7 31-53 because of its failure to keep and maintain true and accurate wage and hour records. The deputy commissioner and the court premised their holding on the following facts found by the hearing officer. The plaintiffs foreperson at the UConn project job site maintained three separate sets of records regarding hours worked. One set of records, known as goldenrods, indicated that the employees worked forty hours a week, Monday through Thursday, from March 28, 1987, through May 2, 1987. The second set of goldenrods indicated that employees worked eight hours on Fridays during that time. A third set of records, called the black and white log book, properly reflected the actual time the employees worked. The payroll registers improperly indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>that the employees had been paid (1) for forty hours when, in fact, no work had been performed, and (2) for forty hours for the weeks in which the employees had worked forty-eight hours. The time cards were also inaccurate. When the investigation against the plaintiff commenced, the plaintiff initially showed the department the inaccurate goldenrods.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff makes three arguments: (1) because the records failed to show the amount of overtime worked, which is not a prevailing wage rate violation, the violation did not constitute a violation under \u00a7 31-53; (2) an employer does not disregard its obligations \u201cto employees\u201d if it disregards its record keeping duties under \u00a7 31-53 (f); and (3) a record keeping violation of \u00a7 31-60-12 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies does not constitute a violation of \u00a7 31-53 (f). We disagree with each of the plaintiff\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The plaintiff first claims that if we conclude that overtime violations do not constitute a prevailing wage rate violation under \u00a7 31-53, any error in the records pertaining to overtime cannot be a basis for debarment under \u00a7 31-53a. We disagree with the plaintiff. Section 31-53 (f) imposes on public work contractors an independent duty to keep and maintain true and accurate records \u201crelating to the wages and hours worked by each employee ... in such manner and form as the labor commissioner establishes to assure the proper payments due to such employees . . . under [\u00a7 31-53] . . . .\u201d Although the legislature is seeking to assure proper payment under \u00a7 31-53, the plain language of subsection (f) refers to <em>all </em>the wages and <em>all </em>the hours worked, which, of course, includes overtime wages and hours. Records that reflect hours <em>not </em>worked, as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>as records that do not reflect the actual hours worked, constitute a violation of the record keeping provision of \u00a7 31-53 (f) because, without accurate records, there can be no assurance that the employees are receiving proper payment under \u00a7 31-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the language of \u00a7 31-53a limits debarment to employers who \u201cdisregard\u201d their obligations \u201cto employees,\u201d and that record keeping violations do not constitute such an obligation to employees. Therefore, the plaintiff argues that it cannot be placed on the debarment list for a record keeping violation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Although \u00a7 31-53a does not define \u201cobligations to employees,\u201d \u00a7 31-53a-l (b) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies does not distinguish between \u201cobligations to employees\u201d and other obligations. Section 31-53a-l (b) defines \u201cdisregarded their obligations\u201d to include a failure to keep records as required by \u00a7 31-53.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In this instance, we accord great deference to the \u201cagency\u2019s interpretation of its own duly adopted regulations.\u201d <em>Griffin Hospital v. Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 497, 512 A.2d 199, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 1023, 107 S. Ct. 781, 93 L. Ed. 2d 819 (1986). Accordingly, the plaintiff disregarded its obligations to its employees when it failed to keep accurate records regarding the employees\u2019 overtime wages and hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">The plaintiff also claims that a record keeping violation of \u00a7 31-60-12a of the Regulations of Connecticut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>State Agencies, upon which the commissioner relies, does not constitute a violation of \u00a7 31-53 (f). The parties agree that the commissioner has not promulgated any record keeping regulations under \u00a7 31-53 (f). General Statutes \u00a7 31-66, which is expressly incorporated in \u00a7 31-53 (f), requires that \u201c[e]ach employer . . . shall keep ... a true and accurate record <em>... as required by the applicable regulations issued by the labor commissioner . . . </em>.\u2019\u2019(Emphasisadded.) Section31-66 is included in part I of chapter 558 of the General Statutes. General Statutes \u00a7 31-60, which is also in part I of chapter 558, authorizes the commissioner, after appropriate consultations, to adopt regulations for all of part I of chapter 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 31-60, the commissioner promulgated \u00a7 31-60-12 (a) and \u00a7 31-60-12 (c) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which require, inter alia, that the employer keep true and accurate records for each employee for three years and that those records include each employee\u2019s total weekly hours, his total hourly, daily or weekly wages, his overtime wage as a separate item from his basic wages, and his total wages paid each pay period. Because \u00a7 31-66 is incorporated by reference in \u00a7 31-53 (f), and because the regulations adopted pursuant to \u00a7 31-60 are applicable to \u00a7 31-66, the regulation requirement of subsection (f) is clearly satisfied by the adoption of \u00a7 31-60-12 (a) et seq. There is no need for the commissioner to adopt separate record keeping regulations that address only \u00a7 31-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">We hold, therefore, that the plaintiff violated its obligation to keep and maintain true and accurate records under \u00a7 31-53 (f). We conclude that on remand the commissioner must determine whether the types of violations that the plaintiff committed in regard to record keeping should subject the plaintiff to debarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the ease is remanded to the trial court with direction to remand the case to the commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AzWx\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-53 provides: \u201c(a) Each contract for the construction, remodeling, refinishing, refurbishing, rehabilitation, alteration or repair of any public works project by the state or any of its agents, or by any political subdivision of the state or any of its agents, shall contain the following provision: \u2018The wages paid on an hourly basis to any mechanic, laborer or workman employed upon the work herein contracted to be done and the amount of payment or contribution paid or payable on behalf of each such employee to any employee welfare fund, as defined in subsection (h) of this section, <em>shall he at a rate equal to the rate customary or prevailing for the same work in the same trade or occupation in the town in which such public works project is being constructed. </em>Any contractor who is not obligated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>by agreement to make payment or contribution on behalf of such employees to any such employee welfare fund shall pay to each employee as part of his wages the amount of payment or contribution for his classification on each pay day.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"AQv\">\u201c(b) Any person who knowingly or wilfully employs any mechanic, laborer or workman in the construction, remodeling, refinishing, refurbishing, rehabilitation, alteration or repair of any public works project for or on behalf of the state or any of its agents, or any political subdivision of the state or any of its agents, at a rate of wage on an hourly basis which is less than the rate customary or prevailing for the same work in the same trade or occupation in the town in which such public works project is being constructed, remodeled, refinished, refurbished, rehabilitated, altered or repaired, or who fails to pay the amount of payment or contributions paid or payable on behalf of each such employee to any employee welfare fund, or in lieu thereof to the employee, as provided by subsection (a), shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars for each offense.

The rate of wage on an hourly basis and the amount of payment or contributions to any employee welfare fund, as defined in subsection (h), or cash in lieu thereof, as provided in subsection (a), shall, at all times, be considered as the minimum rate for the classification for which it was established. Prior to the award of any contract subject to the provisions of this section, such agent shall certify in writing to the labor commissioner the total dollar amount of work to be done in connection with such public works project, regardless of whether such project consists of one or more contracts.

The employees who agreed to the plan worked an additional Friday to compensate for that missed day. The total shutdown, therefore, equalled seven working days, from May 8, 1987, to May 18, 1987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b603-4\"> The contours of our remand make it unnecessary for us to reach the merits of the plaintiffs remaining claims that (1) the commissioner improperly failed to adopt the federal prevailing wage rate determinations and the federal regulations pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-168 of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), and (2) the commissioner selectively prosecuted the plaintiff thereby violating its right to equal protection under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">As for the first claim, General Statutes \u00a7 31-53 (f) requires employers such as the plaintiff to \u201ckeep, maintain and preserve\u201d proper records. This duty is expressly created by statute and, therefore, the commissioner did not need to promulgate a regulation for this purpose. Because we conclude that the plaintiffs record keeping violation was the only violation that could have triggered debarment under the circumstances of this case, we need not address whether the commissioner improperly failed to adopt regulations under the statute in accordance with the UAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">As for the plaintiffs second claim, the plaintiff makes two arguments to this court stemming from the trial court\u2019s dismissal of its claim of selective prosecution. It argues that the trial court improperly denied its motion to hear additional evidence on the issue of selective prosecution. Alternatively, the plaintiff argues that even if it were not entitled to introduce additional evidence, the administrative record is sufficient to make a prima facie showing of selective prosecution. Although we agree with the plaintiff that additional evidence is necessary for a proper determination of this issue, we need not review this claim further because, when the present case is remanded to the department on the record keeping issue, the plaintiff may receive the relief sought. If, however, the commissioner determines that the record keeping violation warrants its placement on the debarment list, then, of course, the plaintiff may take an administrative appeal to the trial court. If it does so, then the trial court must afford the plaintiff the opportunity to present additional evidence on the issue of selective prosecution. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 4-183 (f). (The 1987 statutory provision is applicable, rather than the current provision, because the underlying agency proceeding commenced in 1987.

The plaintiff calculated that a 60 percent apprentice would receive 60 percent of that figure, or $14.51, as his or her hourly wage. The department of labor investigator determined that this method of calculation was improper and a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 31-53 because the statute requires multiplying the prevailing wage rate by the appropriate percentage, <em>and then adding </em>the full \u201ctotal benefits\u201d rate. In the above example, the commissioner concluded that the prevailing wage rate ($18.20) should have been multiplied by 60 percent ($10.92) and then the Ml fringe benefits rate ($5.99) should have been added for a total of $16.91 instead of $14.51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b610-6\"> In this appeal, the parties do not distinguish between the meaning of \u201ctotal benefits\u201d and \u201cfringe benefits.\u201d For the purposes of this section, therefore, we will treat them as synonymous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\"> To hold to the contrary, we would have to conclude that the commissioner was authorized to adopt <em>all </em>the federal regulations in 29 C.F.R., part five.
