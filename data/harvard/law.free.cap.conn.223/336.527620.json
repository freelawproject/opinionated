The plaintiff, Mark Weinberg, appealed the decision of the compensation review division<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> reversing a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner\u2019s award ordering that the defendant employer, ARA Vending Company (ARA),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pay the plaintiff 3.56 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>weeks of compensation for a 30 percent permanent partial disability of his back. We reverse the decision of the review division.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The parties stipulated to the facts essential to the disposition of this appeal. On June 11, 1987, the plaintiff was employed by ARA, which had offices in Derby. Prior to the plaintiffs employment by ARA, on July 26, 1979, while he was a member of the United States Air Force, the plaintiff had fallen from a truck and injured his back. As a result of that injury, the VA awarded the plaintiff a pension based on a 20 percent disability of the lumbosacral spine. On June 11, 1987, during the course of his employment by ARA, the plaintiff suffered an injury to his back that resulted in the herniation of a disc. Both the plaintiff\u2019s physician and ARA\u2019s examining physician assigned to the plaintiff a 30 percent disability of the lumbosacral spine, which included the prior existing disability of 20 percent resulting from the service-connected injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The commissioner made findings in accordance with the stipulation of the parties and ordered ARA to pay 156 weeks of compensation to the plaintiff for the entire resulting 30 percent permanent partial disability of his back. Thereafter, ARA filed a motion to correct, which the commissioner denied. ARA appealed to the review division, claiming that, pursuant to \u00a7 31-349 (a), the plaintiff\u2019s VA disability award should be deducted from the workers\u2019 compensation benefits payable for his overall 30 percent disability of the back. A majority of the review division concluded that \u00a7 31-349 (a) required that the plaintiff\u2019s VA pension be set off against the workers\u2019 compensation award and, therefore, remanded the case to the commissioner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>appealed the decision of the review division to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The plaintiff claims that the review division improperly concluded that \u00a7 31-349 (a) requires that the disability pension awarded him by the VA be deducted from his recovery for permanent partial disability under the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq. The parties stipulated that the 30 percent disability of the plaintiff\u2019s lumbosacral spine found to exist after his work-related second injury included the prior disability of 20 percent awarded by the VA. Since there is no dispute concerning the percentage of disability attributable to the plaintiff\u2019s existing and prior disabilities, the disposition of this appeal turns on whether the review division properly construed the applicable provisions of \u00a7 31-349 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AY4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>\u201cThe construction of a statute generally is a question of law for the court.\u201d <em>Pokorny </em>v. <em>Getta\u2019s Garage, </em>219 Conn. 439, 453, 594 A.2d 446 (1991). Thus, in reviewing the decision of the review division, we must determine whether its interpretation of \u00a7 31-349 (a) is legally and logically correct. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">At the time relevant to this appeal, \u00a7 31-349 (a) provided in relevant part: \u201cIf an employee who has previously incurred, by accidental injury . . . permanent physical impairment, incurs a second disability by accident ... he shall receive compensation for the entire amount of disability . . . <em>less any compensation benefits payable or paid with respect to the previous disability </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff argues that he is entitled to receive workers\u2019 compensation for his entire 30 percent disability because the term \u201ccompensation benefits,\u201d as used in \u00a7 31-349 (a), refers only to compensation under the act. ARA contends that the review division properly concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s VA disability pension constitutes \u201ccompensation\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-349 (a), to be deducted from his recovery under the act. ARA argues, moreover, that to hold it responsible for the plaintiff\u2019s entire disability would contravene the intent of \u00a7 31-349 by, in effect, allowing the plaintiff a \u201cdouble recovery\u201d for his prior disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u201cIn construing any statute, we seek to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 755, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992). \u201c[W]hen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 371 (1987). We have acknowledged, however, in the context of workers\u2019 compensation legislation, that \u201cjsjuch guidance is often of little help . . . since words seldom have precise and unvarying meanings.\u201d <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>H.O. Penn Machinery Co., </em>166 Conn. 352, 359 n.3, 349 A.2d 847 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">When the language of a statute is unclear, we may ascertain the intent of the legislature by looking beyond the language to the statute\u2019s legislative history and the purpose that the statute was intended to serve. <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>supra. \u201cBecause the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is a remedial statute, this court should not impose limitations on the benefits provided for a disabled worker that the statute itself does not clearly specify.\u201d <em>Misenti </em>v. <em>International Silver Co., </em>215 Conn. 206, 210, 575 A.2d 690 (1990). In construing the act, moreover, this court \u201cmakes every part operative and harmonious with every other part insofar as is possible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Min<em>gachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 103-104, 491 A.2d 368 (1985), quoting <em>Bahre </em>v. <em>Hogbloom, </em>162 Conn. 549, 554, 295 A.2d 547 (1972). Because \u00a7 31-349 (a) is part of the larger Connecticut workers\u2019 compensation scheme, the phrase \u201ccompensation benefits,\u201d as it is used in that section, must be construed with reference to the act as a whole. Accordingly, \u201c[i]t is necessary to look beyond the express words of General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 to whatever sources might aid in its interpretation, including its legislative history, its purpose, and the construction given similar statutes in other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>H.O. Penn Machinery Co., </em>supra, 359 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>In construing \u201ccompensation benefits,\u201d as used in \u00a7 31-349 (a), to include the plaintiff\u2019s VA disability pension, the review division stated: \u201cThe words of Sec. 31-349 (a) . . . clearly grant a credit for <em>compensation </em>payable or paid in connection with a previous disability. In this case the claimant has been and continues to be paid <em>compensation </em>in the form of a VA disability benefit for the previous service-connected disability to his back. Had the legislature intended to restrict said credit only to compensation paid for a previous disability resulting from an injury accepted as or found to be compensable under the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as amended, then it would or could have clearly so stated.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Viewing \u00a7 31-349 (a) in light of its legislative history and within the context of the act as a whole, we are persuaded that the legislature did thus intend to restrict the meaning of \u201ccompensation benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The word \u201ccompensation\u201d appears at several places in \u00a7 31-349 (a) to refer to benefits payable under the act. For example, the first sentence of \u00a7 31-349 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe fact that an employee has suffered previous disability . . . shall not preclude him from <em>compensation </em>for a later injury, nor preclude <em>compensation </em>for death resulting therefrom.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 31-349 (a) also provides that \u201c[t]he employer by whom the employee is employed at the time of the injury, or his insurance carrier, shall in the first instance pay all awards of <em>compensation </em>and all medical expenses provided by this chapter for the first one hundred four weeks of disability.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>added.) As used in these provisions, it is apparent that \u201ccompensation\u201d refers to benefits payable under the act and not to disability payments from other sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The review division majority concluded that the term \u201ccompensation benefits\u201d in \u00a7 31-349 (a) included benefits other than those payable under the act on the basis that \u201c[t]he law cannot permit [the plaintiff] to enjoy a windfall, i.e., to be paid twice for a portion of his permanent partial disability.\u201d In thus attempting to enforce what it perceived as the important public policy prohibiting double recovery; see, e.g., <em>Pokorny </em>v. <em>Getta\u2019s Garage, </em>supra; <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corporation/Electric Boat Division, </em>15 Conn. App. 615, 546 A.2d 893 (1988), aff'd, 210 Conn. 580, 556 A.2d 587 (1989); the review division ignored the \u201cfamiliar principle of statutory construction that where the same words are used in a statute two or more times they will ordinarily be given the same meaning in each instance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>AirKaman, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>221 Conn. 751, 758, 607 A.2d 410 (1992), quoting <em>State ex rel. Hyde </em>v. <em>Dowe, </em>129 Conn. 266, 271, 28 A.2d 12 (1942). Nothing in \u00a7 31-349 (a) indicates that \u201ccompensation\u201d was intended to have two different meanings in that section. Where the legislature has used the word \u201ccompensation\u201d throughout the act to mean workers\u2019 compensation benefits payable under the act, we conclude that it is reasonable to construe the term \u201ccompensation benefits\u201d in \u00a7 31-349 (a) to have the same meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The language in \u00a7 31-349 (a) on which the disposition of this appeal turns was added to the statute by No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>79-376 of the 1979 Public Acts. Prior to the 1979 amendment, \u00a7 31-349 (a) did not provide for a setoff against payments received as compensation for an injured employee\u2019s prior disability. The legislative history to the 1979 amendment discloses a statement by then house chairman of the joint standing committee on labor and public employees, Representative Richard J. Balducci, that supports our conclusion that \u201ccompensation benefits,\u201d as used in \u00a7 31-349, refers only to compensation under the act. In remarking on the bill on the floor of the House of Representatives, Balducci stated: \u201cThe bill also clarifies and helps to make easier for both sides problems that may come about due to a loss of a thumb or etc., it\u2019s described as one loss. Let\u2019s say if an individual loses a finger and then somewhere along the line <em>in the course of work is compensated </em>for that loss, he loses an additional three fingers, plus the thumb, he would be <em>compensated </em>for the loss of the three fingers and the thumb, not for the entire hand.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 22 H.R. Proc., Pt. 15, 1979 Sess., p. 5054. It is well established that this court may take judicial notice of statements made on the floor of the House as an indicator of legislative intent. See, e.g., <em>Manchester Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>South Windsor, </em>203 Conn. 267, 276, 524 A.2d 621 (1987). Balducci\u2019s explanation of the bill expressly linked prior compensation to an injury sustained <em>in the course of work. </em>His statement thus bolsters our interpretation that the legislature intended to restrict the deduction in \u00a7 31-349 (a) for \u201ccompensation benefits payable or paid with respect to [a] previous disability\u201d to payments made pursuant to the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Our conclusion that credit for prior compensation under \u00a7 31-349 (a) is limited to payments made under our act finds particular support in a 1991 amendment to the act. We have previously considered subsequent enactments in order to illuminate the legislature\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>intent with respect to prior legislative action. See, e.g., <em>AirKaman, Inc. </em>v. Groppo, supra, 761. Number 91-32, \u00a7 35, of the 1991 Public Acts amended \u00a7 31-349 (a) to provide in relevant part: \u201cIf an employee having a previous disability incurs a second disability from a second injury resulting in a permanent disability caused by both the previous disability and the second injury which is materially and substantially greater than the disability that would have resulted from the second injury alone, he shall receive <em>compensation </em>for . . . the entire amount of the disability . . . <em>less any compensation payable or paid with respect to the previous disability . . . </em>notwithstanding the fact that part of the disability was due to a previous disability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The legislature\u2019s excision of the word \u201cbenefits\u201d from \u00a7 31-349 (a) evinces an intent to give the term \u201ccompensation\u201d a consistent meaning within that section. In fact, No. 91-32 of the 1991 Public Acts substituted \u201ccompensation\u201d for related terms throughout the act. See, e.g., Public Acts 1991, No. 91-32, \u00a7 21 (substituted \u201ccompensation\u201d for \u201cbenefit\u201d and \u201cbenefits\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 31-306).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The 1991 amendment also added the following definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d to General Statutes \u00a7 31-275, the definitions section of the act: \u201cAs used in this chapter and in sections 10 to 14, inclusive, of this Act, unless the context otherwise provides ... (4) <em>\u2018Compensation\u2019 means benefits or payments mandated by the provisions of this chapter, </em>including, but not limited to, indemnity, medical and surgical aid or hospital and nursing service required under section 12 of this Act and any type of payment for disability, whether for total or partial disability of a permanent or temporary nature, death benefit, funeral expense, dependency allowance, payments made under the provisions of section 31-284b, as amended by section 8 of this Act, 31-293a or 31-310, as amended by section 28 of this Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>or any adjustment in benefits or payments required by this chapter.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1991, No. 91-32, \u00a7 1. The act as amended became effective July 1, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The legislative history of No. 91-32 of the 1991 Public Acts indicates that it was intended to be a technical amendment. In commenting on the bill on the floor of the Senate, Senator James H. Maloney, senate chairman of the joint standing committee on labor and public employees, described the bill as \u201cthe bill that makes technical recodification of the Workers\u2019 Compensation statute\u201d and that \u201ccleans up the statute in regard to Workers\u2019 Compensation.\u201d 34 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1991 Sess., p. 836. Similarly, in presiding over a hearing of the joint standing committee, Maloney described the bill as \u201ca technical revision in [e]ffect to the existing statute.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, 1991 Sess., p. 16. He went on to state: \u201cSo we\u2019re not really dealing with changes in the substantive legislation today. If there are substantive changes that are made because of the draft, we do want to hear about that because that\u2019s not what\u2019s supposed to have occurred with this instrument.\u201d Id. Commissioner John Arcudi of the compensation review division, who participated in formulating the proposed revisions, also testified at the hearing that \u201cthe purpose of the bill [was] not to change substance, but to try to simplify language and eliminate archaic language, reduce language if possible . . . .\u201d Id., p. 17. Finally, in commenting on the bill on the House floor, Representative Joseph A. Adamo, house chairman of the joint standing committee on labor and public employees, stated that the bill \u201cbrings into focus a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>new section of describing all the definitions that were utilized and sprinkled throughout the entire chapter.\u201d 34 H.R. Proc., Pt. 5, 1991 Sess., pp. 1959-60. When viewed together, the foregoing statements make clear that the definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d provided in the 1991 amendment merely clarified the term as it had already been used throughout the act and did not enact any substantive change in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">ARA argues that to permit the plaintiff to recover the full 30 percent disability award under the act for an injury for which the YA is already partially compensating him would be to allow him a \u201cdouble recovery,\u201d in contravention of established public policy. In support of this contention, ARA relies on the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion in <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corporation/Electric Boat Division, </em>supra. In <em>McGowan, </em>the plaintiffs filed for and received benefits under the federal Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq., for injuries sustained during the course of their employment with the named defendant. The plaintiffs subsequently sought benefits under the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for scarring resulting from the same injuries, as no such benefits were available under the LHWCA. The plaintiffs argued that their LHWCA benefits should be credited against the benefits available under the Connecticut act on a category by category basis, thus permitting them to recover for scarring. The <em>total </em>benefits that had been awarded each plaintiff under the LHWCA, however, exceeded the <em>total </em>benefits available to each of them under Connecticut law. The Appellate Court concluded that awarding the plaintiffs benefits under Connecticut\u2019s act would constitute an impermissible \u201cdouble recovery.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>While it is true that, as a general principle, our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act prohibits double recovery; <em>Pokorny </em>v. <em>Getta\u2019s Garage, </em>supra, 454; we have recognized that this prohibition is not inviolate. <em>Enquist </em>v. <em>General Datacom, </em>218 Conn. 19, 37, 587 A.2d 1029 (1991) <em>(Glass, J., </em>dissenting). In <em>McGowan, </em>the Appellate Court construed a specific <em>federal </em>act in accordance with United States Supreme Court precedent and the language of the act itself. See footnote 8, supra. The Appellate Court also construed the exclusivity provision of our act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-284, to prohibit the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery of benefits on a category by category basis. <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corporation/Electric Boat Division, </em>supra, 621-22. The Appellate Court was not called upon in <em>McGowan, </em>however, to construe the setoff provision of \u00a7 31-349 (a) at issue in the present case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>The legislature has expressly restricted the term \u201ccompensation\u201d to mean benefits payable under the act, unless the context provides otherwise. Public Acts 1991, No. 91-32, \u00a7 1. The context of \u00a7 31-349 (a) does not reveal a legislative intent to give \u201ccompensation\u201d a meaning other than that expressly provided by the definition in the 1991 amendment. Where the legislature has specifically defined an operative term used within a statute, we are bound to accept that definition; <em>Plasticrete Block &amp; Supply Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>216 Conn. 17, 27, 579 A.2d 20 (1990); unless to do so would create an irrational result that could not have been intended by the legislature. See, e.g., <em>Vernon Village, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>217 Conn. 130, 139-40, 585 A.2d 76 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In <em>Levanti </em>v. <em>Dow Chemical Co., </em>218 Conn. 9, 587 A.2d 1023 (1991), this court construed \u00a7 31-349 to permit recovery for a prior <em>noncompensable </em>injury that is followed by and combines with a subsequent compensable injury. In rejecting the defendant employer\u2019s claim that thus applying \u00a7 31-349 would lead to irrational results by imposing liability on employers for disabilities which are not wholly attributable to their employment, we stated: \u201cSection 31-349 does not create liability. To the contrary, it is an apportionment statute that limits the liability of employers previously imposed.\u201d Id., 17. We concluded that the application of the statute promoted rational results since \u00a7 31-349 would have served to limit the defendant\u2019s liability to 104 weeks if the plaintiff\u2019s resultant disability had warranted an award in excess of that amount. Id., 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>In the present case, our conclusion that the plaintiff may recover benefits for his prior disability both under the act and from the YA results from adherence to the statutory definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d in the act as amended. We are persuaded that this conclusion is not so irrational that it could not have been intended by the legislature; see <em>Enquist </em>v. <em>General Datacom, </em>supra; rather, we conclude that the legislature rationally could have intended to prohibit double recovery under \u00a7 31-349 (a) only to the extent that an employee may not recover twice for the same injury under the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The decision of the compensation review division is reversed and the case is remanded to the compensation review division with direction to deny the defendants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>In this opinion Callahan and Borden, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-349 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe fact that an employee has suffered previous disability, or received compensation therefor, shall not preclude him from compensation for a later injury, nor preclude compensation for death resulting therefrom.

The letter, dated May 28, 1981, stated that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cclaim for disability compensation ha[d] been approved\u201d and assigned the plaintiff a 40 percent \u201ccombined\u201d disability rating that consisted of 20 percent for traumatic arthritis, 10 percent for loss of sense of smell, 10 percent for traumatic brain disease, and zero percent for loss of sense of taste. The plaintiff contends that this court should not automatically assign a 20 percent disability rating to his service-connected back injury because the VA award letter did not specify a disability rating for the lumbosacral spine and because, according to the letter, the plaintiff\u2019s overall VA disability rating was not determined by adding the various assigned disability percentages, but rather by using a combined rating table. In finding that the plaintiff\u2019s VA pension was based on a 20 percent disability of the lumbosacral spine, the commissioner implicitly rejected the contents of the VA award letter to the extent that they were inconsistent with the parties\u2019 stipulation. \u201c[T]he power and duty of determining the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>rests on the commissioner, the trier of facts. . . . The conclusions drawn by him from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. . . . Moreover, on review of the commissioner\u2019s findings, the trial court does not retry the facts nor hear evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Adzima v.

The commissioner was entitled to adopt as a finding the stipulation of the parties and the review division majority properly confined itself to the commissioner\u2019s findings. Accordingly, we decline to consider any of the plaintiff\u2019s arguments that rely on evidence outside the scope of the stipulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\"> The word \u201ccompensation\u201d appears in various other sections of the act to refer to benefits payable thereunder.

The Appellate Court also concluded that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover under Connecticut\u2019s act on the basis of a 1984 amendment to the LHWCA that specifically provided: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provisions of law, any amounts paid to an employee for the same injury, disability, or death for which benefits are claimed under this act pursuant to <em>any other workers\u2019 compensation law . . . </em>shall be credited against any liability imposed by this act.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903 (e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b370-13\"> In <em>Todd Shipyards Corporation </em>v. <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, United States Department of Labor, </em>848 F.2d 125 (9th Cir. 1988), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit considered whether the LHWCA permits an employer to deduct from an injured employee\u2019s scheduled disability percentage the percentage of disability resulting from a previous injury for which the employee receives VA benefits. The LHWCA, as amended in 1984, specifically provides for the setoff of any amounts paid to an employee \u201cpursuant to any other workers\u2019 compensation law\u201d for the same injury, disability or death for which LHWCA benefits are claimed.

The question presented in <em>McLees </em>was virtually identical to the issue in the present case: whether Oregon\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law required consideration of a previous VA disability award when determining the amount of a subsequent Oregon workers\u2019 compensation award for injury to the same part of the body. Oregon\u2019s statute provided in pertinent part: \u201cShould a further accident occur to a worker who is receiving <em>compensation </em>for a temporary disability, or who has been paid or awarded <em>compensation </em>for a permanent disability, his award of <em>compensation </em>for such further accident shall be made with regard to the combined effect of his injuries and his past receipt of money for such disabilities.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 656.005 (9). In concluding that the statute required a credit only for previous compensation paid a worker under Oregon\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system, the court stated: \u201cThe word [\u2018compensation\u2019] standing alone does not convey a meaning that would be unquestioned in all circumstances.

I do not agree that the term \u201ccompensation benefits\u201d is limited to benefits payable under the act and, therefore, respectfully dissent. I would affirm the compensation review division\u2019s determination that the term \u201ccompensation benefits\u201d in General Statutes 31-349 (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> means any compensation from any source, including Veterans Administration benefits. Any other result distorts the plain language of the statute and contravenes our longstanding public policy against \u201ctwo independent compensations for the [same] injury [i.e., double dipping].\u201d <em>Enquist </em>v. <em>General Datacom, </em>218 Conn. 19, 26, 587 A.2d 1029 (1991), quoting <em>Uva </em>v. <em>Alonzy, </em>116 Conn. 91, 98, 163 A. 612 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Although the majority meticulously examines the legislative history of \u00a7 31-349 (a), where, as here, the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for statutory construction or a review of the legislative history; \u201cit is assumed that the words themselves express the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Federal Aviation Administration </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>196 Conn. 546, 550, 494 A.2d 564 (1985), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 213, 222, 479 A.2d 814 (1984). \u201cIf there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute, it does not become ambiguous merely because the parties contend for different meanings.\u201d <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>183 Conn. 566, 571, 440 A.2d 767 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The express language of \u00a7 31-349 (a) grants a credit for <em>\u201cany </em>compensation\u201d payable or paid in connection with a previous disability. (Emphasis added.) There is no language in the statute that restricts the phrase \u201cany compensation\u201d to mean only compensation bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>fits payable under the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Had the legislature intended to restrict the compensation credit to compensation paid for a previous disability resulting from an injury accepted or found to be compensable under the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, then it could have expressly stated that to be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Further, although the majority claims that the definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d added to the act by the 1991 technical amendments support their contention, the majority fails to consider the definition as a whole. Public Acts 1991, No. 91-32. The new definition provides that \u201c[a]s used in this chapter and in sections 10 to 14, inclusive, of this Act, <em>unless the context otherwise provides </em>... (4) \u2018Compensation\u2019 means benefits or payments mandated by the provisions of this chapter . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) By adding the phrase \u201cunless the context otherwise provides,\u201d the legislature recognized that in some cases the circumstances under which the statute is being applied control the meaning of the term \u201ccompensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Section 31-349 permits full compensation for the totality of all the disability that exists but only after other compensation for earlier disabilities has been deducted. Such a system prevents double dipping, a policy to which we have long subscribed in our analysis of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>Gurliacci </em>v. Mayer, 218 Conn. 531, 570, 590 A.2d 914 (1991); <em>Uva </em>v. <em>Alonzy, </em>supra; <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>Lamphier, </em>93 Conn. 20, 104 A. 488 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Under the majority\u2019s construction of the statute, the plaintiff will receive double compensation for a portion of his disability. The plaintiff currently receives compensation from the Veterans Administration (VA) based upon a 20 percent disability. After the second injury, the plaintiff was assigned a total disability of 30 per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>cent, which includes the previous 20 percent disability awarded by the VA. In order to make the plaintiff whole and to avoid double dipping, ARA should only have to compensate the plaintiff for the 10 percent disability ascribable to the second injury. This, when added to the VA benefits, fully compensates the plaintiff for his 30 percent disability. Under the majority\u2019s rationale, the plaintiff will receive compensation for the same 20 percent disability from both the VA and ARA in addition to compensation for the 10 percent disability from the second injury. As a result, the plaintiff will receive 50 percent disability benefits for what is in actuality a 30 percent disability. I submit that such a construction is unwarranted and the VA benefits should be credited against the plaintiffs total compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The majority\u2019s construction of \u00a7 31-349 (a) discourages employers from hiring handicapped employees. One of the purposes in enacting second injury fund legislation like \u00a7 31-349 (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was to prevent discrimination against handicapped workers. <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>H.O. Penn Machinery Co., </em>166 Conn. 352, 355, 349 A.2d 847 (1974). By making the employer liable for the total percentage of disability, employers will be reluctant to hire workers with a previous disability, when the prior injury is compensated by sources other than workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Further, the majority\u2019s construction serves to increase the cost of workers\u2019 compensation in Connecticut, a result the state can ill afford. Under General Statutes \u00a7 31-354 an employer must contribute to the second injury liability fund \u201ca sum not to exceed five per cent of the total amount of money expended by such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>employer ... in payment of his liability under this chapter for the preceding calendar year.\u201d Thus, the more money spent by an employer in workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the more money the employer must contribute to the Second Injury Fund. Whether the employer assumes the total responsibility here or transfers the matter to the Second Injury Fund after 104 weeks, the eventual result will be increased costs to those funding these disability benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\"> See footnote 1 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\"> Under General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 the employer is required to pay all awards of compensation for the first 104 weeks of the disability. After the employer has completed the payments for the 104 weeks, the compensation claim may be transferred to the Second Injury Fund, which thereafter becomes responsible for further compensation benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
