Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The relevant facts were stated by the Appellate Court: \u201cFrom 1985 until December, 1987, the defendant and the victim were romantically involved. In December, 1987, the victim severed her relationship with the defendant. After their breakup, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>ant began repeatedly calling the victim at home and at work. On January 23, 1988, the defendant telephoned the victim and threatened her, stating that she would be sorry if she did not get back together with him. The victim filed a complaint with the Milford police department, but did not seek the defendant\u2019s arrest at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">\u201cOn February 14, 1988, the defendant telephoned the victim at her apartment and asked her to go to lunch with him. She refused his invitation and turned on her answering machine to avoid further calls from him. After the victim showered and got dressed, she noticed that her cat was standing by the door. She opened the door and the defendant forced his way into her apartment, forced her onto the sofa, and sexually assaulted her. The victim then retreated to the bathroom and locked the bathroom door behind her. She stayed in this room until the defendant left the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">\u201cAfter the defendant left her apartment, the victim called a friend, who advised the victim to call 911. The victim then dialed 911 and reported that she had been sexually assaulted and named the defendant as her assailant. The defendant was arrested and charged with first degree sexual assault and burglary in the third degree, and was released on bond.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>25 Conn. App. 503, 505-506, 596 A.2d 449 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed that the trial court improperly denied his motion to strike the testimony of the victim, because of the state\u2019s failure to produce the tape of her 911 telephone call. Id., 507. The Appellate Court stated the following facts that were necessary for the resolution of that claim: \u201cAt trial, the victim testified that when she called her friend after the defendant had left the apartment, she told her, \u2018Tony assaulted me.\u2019 The victim also testified that when she dialed 911 to report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>the incident, she told the police that the defendant had raped her. When the victim\u2019s friend testified, she stated that when the victim telephoned her immediately after the incident she said, \u2018Tony hit me.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">\u201cBefore the trial began, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for discovery seeking \u2018[c]opies of statements of prosecution witnesses in the possession of the State or its agents, including state and local law enforcement officers, which statements relate to the subject matter about which the witness will testify . . . .' Although the 911 call was tape-recorded when it was made, this tape was erased thirty days after the incident pursuant to Milford police department policy. Consequently, the state was unable to produce the tape at the time of trial. The defendant contends that the destruction of the 911 tape and the state\u2019s inability to produce it violated his rights under General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b and Practice Book \u00a7 752. He also alleges that the 911 tape could have explained the discrepancy between the victim\u2019s testimony and that of her friend, and that its nonproduction violated his right to confrontation as guaranteed under the state and federal constitutions.\u201d Id., 508-509</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The Appellate Court held, in accordance with an acknowledgment by the state, that the tape recording of the 911 call was a \u201cstatement\u201d within the meaning of Practice Book \u00a7 749 (2). Id., 509. It also held that, since the erasure of the tape had not been done in bad faith; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>212 Conn. 6, 16, 562 A.2d 470 (1989) (in context of violation of Practice Book \u00a7 752, \u201cbad faith\u201d means done with intent to deprive defendant of information); the defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation had not been violated, and that the violation of Practice Book \u00a7 752 was harmless. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>supra, 510-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>The Appellate Court also held, however, that \u201cbecause . . . the indefinite preservation of 911 tapes can place an unreasonable burden on police departments\u201d; id., 512; henceforth, 911 tapes \u201care excluded from that portion of Practice Book \u00a7 752 that states that a defendant may refrain from moving for production of statements until after a state\u2019s witness has testified.\u201d Id. The court mandated that police departments preserve all 911 tapes for one year \u201cfrom the date of the 911 call.\u201d Id. If within that period a defendant had not requested the preservation of a 911 recording, the police department would be f\u201cee to erase and reuse the tape; if the defendant had requested the tape\u2019s preservation, erasure of the tape would be a per se violation of Practice Book \u00a7 751 et seq. and General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b requiring the trial court to strike the testimony of the witness who had made the 911 call. Id., 513. Recognizing, however, that in some cases there may not have been an arrest within a reasonable time after the 911 call, the court held that if \u201cthe police investigation [were] protracted . . . the police shall bear the burden of preserving the tape for one year from the date of arrest.\u201d Id., 513-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification, as supplemented by the state\u2019s response thereto.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">With respect to the first certified question; see footnote 7; the defendant argues that, first, under the plain language of Practice Book \u00a7 749 (2), a tape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>recording of a 911 telephone call is a \u201cstatement,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that second, such tapes are in the possession of the state or its agents, including not only police departments but all municipalities, and third, it is foreseeable that such tapes might be relevant to criminal prosecutions. Therefore, the defendant contends that such tapes must be preserved by the state and produced upon request of the defendant pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 752. We disagree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude, to the contrary, that despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>fact that the language of Practice Book \u00a7 749 (2), read literally, would cover the tape recording of a 911 telephone call, it is not within the intent of that language to cover such a tape recording and that, therefore, a tape recording of a 911 telephone call is not a \u201cstatement\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 749 (2) that is subject to preservation and to disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 752.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">We begin with a history and description of the 911 emergency telephone call system in our state.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In 1968, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) designated 911 as a nationwide, universal emergency telephone number. Statewide Emergency Communications Study Commission Final Report to the Connecticut General Assembly (1980). After a series of public acts regarding the study and implementation of such a system statewide; see Spec. Acts 1978, No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>35; Spec. Acts 1979, No. 56; Public Acts 1980, No. 80-360; and Public Acts 1981, No. 81-458; in 1984, the legislature enacted what are now General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 28-25 through 28-29b,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> requiring, inter alia, that \u201c[e]ach municipality shall, not later than December 31, 1989, establish and operate a public safety answering point which utilizes enhanced 9-1-1 network features.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 28-25a (b). Pursuant to these statutes, each municipality maintains, on a twenty-four hour basis, a \u201cpublic safety answering point.\u201d A \u201c \u2018[p]ublic safety answering point\u2019 means a facility, operated on a twenty-four hour basis, assigned the responsibility of receiving 9-1-1 calls and, as appropriate, directly dispatching emergency response services, or transferring or relaying emergency 9-1-1 calls to other public safety agencies. A public safety answering point is the first point of reception by a public safety agency of a 9-1-1 call and serves the jurisdictions in which it is located or other participating jurisdictions.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 28-25 (10). A \u201c \u2018[p]ublic safety agency\u2019 means a functional division of a municipality or the state which provides fire fighting, law enforcement, ambulance, medical or other emergency services.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 28-25 (8). Thus, 911 telephone calls consist not only of calls to report crimes, but consist of calls for all emergencies, including fire, ambulance, medical, and any other needed emergency service. Furthermore, such calls are routed, in the first instance, to the \u201cpublic safety answering point\u201d designated by that municipality, which may or may not be the local police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Since the 911 system identifies only the telephone number and geographical location of the source of the incoming call, but not necessarily the location and nature of the need for service, that information can only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>be preserved by writing it down or tape-recording it. Tape-recording is the fastest and most accurate method of logging such calls, and permits the monitor of the call to concentrate on the needs of the caller rather than on writing down the message. The automatic tape-recording of 911 calls also provides a quick and accurate method of retrieving the call in the event of confusion. United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, The Design and Casting of 911 Systems, A Technical Manual, p. 53. Implicit in this legislative scheme for a telephonic emergency response system is the need for speed and accuracy in the interest of public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Since tape recordings of 911 calls are public records, they are subject to the regulations regarding preservation and disposition of such records promulgated by the public records administrator pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 11-8.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Administrative and financial burdens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>play a role in the determination of how long such records must be preserved. Therefore, the public records administrator, acting pursuant to the state librarian\u2019s authority, is required, in carrying out his duties under \u00a7 11-8, to \u201cconsult with the attorney general, the probate court administrator and the chief executive officers of the Connecticut Town Clerks Association and the Municipal Finance Officers Association of Connecticut, or their duly appointed representatives.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 11-8a. Under current retention schedules, promulgated by the public records administrator, tape recordings of 911 calls must be preserved for thirty days, unless within that period of time a notice of intent to file a claim against a municipality or its employee has been filed with the municipality pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-101a (d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Public Records Adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>tration, Records Retention/Disposition Schedules, Municipalities/Towns, p. 23. Thus, a municipality may ordinarily erase and reuse the tape after thirty days. It is significant that this thirty day period, arrived at after the appropriate consultations pursuant to \u00a7 11-8a, is five months less than the six month notice of claim period provided under \u00a7 7-101a (d). The responsible public officials could have mandated that 911 tapes be pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>served for six months to coincide with \u00a7 7-10 la. Instead, it is apparent that they weighed the financial and administrative burdens of retaining tapes against the risks of liability under \u00a7 7-101a.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">With this background in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s contention that the language of Practice Book \u00a7 749 (2) is clear and unambiguous and thus requires the conclusion that a tape recording of a 911 call is a \u201cstatement\u201d within the meaning of that language. The rules of statutory interpretation apply to provisions of the Practice Book. <em>State </em>v. <em>Genotti, </em>220 Conn. 796, 807, 601 A.2d 1013 (1992). If a statute is clear and unambiguous, there is no room for statutory construction. <em>Mercado </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Income Maintenance, </em>222 Conn. 69, 74, 607 A.2d 1142 (1992). The rule that unambiguous language requires only strict application to the facts and prohibits resort to other aids to interpretation only applies, however, where the language is <em>absolutely </em>clear and unambiguous; <em>Elections Review Committee of the Eighth Utilities District </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>219 Conn. 685, 692, 595 A.2d 313 (1991); and where no inherent ambiguity is disclosed by reference to the facts of the case. Furthermore, even if a statute is considered clear on its face, if a literal interpretation of that statute would lead to unworkable results, resort to other aids to determine legislative intent is appropriate. See, e.g., <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corporation </em>v. <em>Kosa, </em>220 Conn. 643, 650-51, 600 A.2d 1 (1991).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>the facts of this case, we do not regard the language of \u00a7 749 (2) to be so absolutely clear that further interpretation is unnecessary. Moreover, even if we were to conclude that the language of \u00a7 749 (2) is clear, a literal interpretation of that section would lead to an unworkable result, which we seek to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 748 through 755 establish, inter alia, a scheme for the discovery and use by the defendant of statements of witnesses for the state. Insofar as it relates to this case, this scheme hinges on the definition of \u201cstatement\u201d in \u00a7 749 (2): \u201cA . . . mechanical, electrical, or other recording . . . which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by a person and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement.\u201d Pursuant to \u00a7 752, after the direct testimony of a state\u2019s witness the trial court \u201cshall, on the motion of the defendant, order the state to produce any [such] statement of the witness in the possession of the state or its agents, including state and local law enforcement officers, which statement relates to the subject matter about which the witness has testified.\u201d In order for the state to comply with \u00a7 752, the state and its agents, including state and local law enforcement agencies, must, therefore, preserve \u00a7 749 (2) \u201cstatements\u201d for subsequent disclosure upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>request by the defendant. Indeed, we have so held. <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>193 Conn. 457, 466, 479 A.2d 199 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Pursuant to these Practice Book sections, whenever the state or its agents tape-records the words of an individual and that individual subsequently testifies for the state in a criminal trial regarding the subject matter of his tape-recorded words, that tape recording must have been preserved for production to the defendant in that trial pursuant to a request under \u00a7 752. Thus, if a tape recording is deemed to be a \u201cstatement\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 749 (2), the state or its agents must preserve that tape recording, or a copy thereof, until its production is requested in a criminal trial some time in the future. This means, therefore, that some such tape recordings must be preserved almost indefinitely, since there will be some cases in which the trial may not take place until many years after the tape recording in question was made, either because no arrest was made until years later, or because the defendant had absconded, or for other valid reasons. It also means that whenever the state or any of its agencies, which under the defendant\u2019s reading of \u00a7\u00a7 749 and 752 includes all municipalities, tape-records an individual\u2019s words, that tape recording must be preserved on the chance that it will be required to be produced at some time in the future pursuant to a request under \u00a7 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Application of this analysis to the tape-recording of 911 telephone calls leads us to conclude at a minimum that, despite the seemingly clear language of \u00a7 749 (2), it is not absolutely clear that the definition of \u201cstatement\u201d was intended to include such a tape recording. Furthermore, even if we were to regard \u00a7 749 (2) as clear, a literal interpretation of that section would lead to an unworkable result. Such a conclusion would mean, as a practical matter, that each municipality would be required by the provisions of the Practice Book to preserve indefinitely tapes of all 911 emergency telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>calls, because it would be impossible for the municipality to determine at the instant of each such call whether it would be required to produce the tape recording at some time in the future. Moreover, since all 911 calls come into one initial public safety answering point and include, not only requests for police services, but calls for fire, ambulance, medical and all other emergency services, and since conceivably any of those calls might be relevant to some subsequent criminal trial, all of those tapes would have to be preserved indefinitely as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The extent of the administrative and financial burdens that this process would impose cannot be gainsaid.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It would defeat the principal purpose of automatically tape-recording 911 calls, namely, speed and accuracy in the interest of public safety, to require the monitor of such calls to record the nature of each call for future potential use under Practice Book \u00a7 752. Therefore, as a practical matter all tapes of 911 calls would have to be preserved. As the amicus, the city of Milford, points out, these are, under the current state of the technology, twenty-four hour tapes, one for each day. Thus, every municipality would be required to pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>chase and preserve indefinitely an ever expanding inventory of twenty-four hour tapes, as well as provide for their adequate storage, security, cataloging, inventorying, retrieval and transfer upon later request.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">That this would be the result of the strict application of purportedly \u201cunambiguous\u201d language, despite the obvious administrative and financial burdens imposed thereby, counsels strongly that we look further into its intended meaning. Indeed, the defendant\u2019s suggested limitation on \u00a7 749 (2), that it applies only to tape recordings that might <em>foreseeably </em>be relevant to a subsequent criminal prosecution, is itself an implicit acknowledgment that the language of \u00a7 749 (2) cannot be taken literally in all cases, since no such limitation appears in that literal language. As applied to tape recordings of 911 telephone calls, therefore, \u00a7 749 (2) is inherently ambiguous. See <em>In re Jessica M., </em>217 Conn. 459, 467-68, 586 A.2d 597 (1991) (General Statutes [Rev. to 1989] \u00a7 45-61f [f] [3] inherently ambiguous when applied to noncustodial parents who must maintain relationship with children through visitation).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">We turn, therefore, to an analysis of the history and purpose of \u00a7 749 (2) in order to determine whether that section was intended to apply to 911 tape recordings. See <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 460, 600 A.2d 310 (1991) (legislative history and legislative policy are relevant aids in determining legislative intent). That analysis convinces us that \u00a7 749 (2) was not intended to encompass tape recordings of 911 emergency telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Until 1976, our rules of practice contained few provisions governing procedure in criminal cases. Responding to the need for a comprehensive set of such rules, the judicial branch established an Advisory Committee to Revise the Criminal Rules, consisting of representatives of the prosecution, defense and judiciary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>L. Orland, Connecticut Criminal Practice (1983) pp. vi-xii. The product of that committee, which included what are now Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 748 through 755, was adopted by the judges of the Superior Court effective October 1, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The definition of \u201cstatement\u201d contained in Practice Book \u00a7 749 was taken from the federal Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> L. Orland, supra, \u00a7 749, p. 203. The Jencks Act, enacted in 1957, was the prompt congressional response to the decision in <em>Jencks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U.S. 657, 77 S. Ct. 1007, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1103 (1957). In <em>Jencks, </em>the United States Supreme Court, \u201c[e]xercising [its] power, in the absence of statutory provision, to prescribe procedures for the administration of justice in the federal courts . . . [had] decided that the defense in a federal criminal prosecution was entitled, under certain circumstances, to obtain, for impeachment purposes, statements which had been made to government agents by government witnesses.\u201d <em>Palermo </em>v. <em>United States, </em>360 U.S. 343, 345, 79 S. Ct. 1217, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1287 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">One of the principal purposes of the federal Jencks Act was to guard against the risk that \u201c[distortion can be a product of selectivity as well as the conscious or inadvertent infusion of the recorder\u2019s opinions or impressions. It is clear from the continuous congressional emphasis on \u2018substantially verbatim recital,\u2019 and \u2018continuous, narrative statements, made by the witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>recorded verbatim, or nearly so\u2019 . . . that the legislation was designed to eliminate the danger of distortion and misrepresentation inherent in a report which merely selects portions, albeit accurately, from a lengthy oral recital. Quoting out of context is one of the most frequent and powerful modes of misquotation.\u201d Id., 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Aside from this general reference to certain of the inferences to be drawn from the legislative history regarding the scope and purpose of the Jencks Act, we have not discovered any similar discussion regarding the scope and purpose of that part of the definition of \u201cstatement\u201d with which this case is concerned, namely, the simultaneous recording of an oral statement of a witness. Senate Report No. 981, which accompanied Senate Bill No. 2377, the Senate version of the proposed legislation, stated that \u201cit is the specific intent of the bill to provide for the production only of written statements previously made by a Government witness in the possession of the United States which are signed by him or otherwise adopted or approved by him, and any transcriptions or recordings of oral statements made by the witness to a Federal law officer . . . .\u201d S.

The House of Representatives version, House Bill No. 7915, did not specifically include tape-recorded statements.

Rep. No. 1271, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., reprinted in 1957 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 1870.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">We draw several conclusions from this history. First, since the source of Practice Book \u00a7 749 (2) is the rule-making authority of the judges of the Superior Court governing the practice and procedure of criminal trials, it is unlikely that they intended that definition of \u201cstatement\u201d to include tape recordings of 911 emergency telephone calls. Although in some instances a violation of Practice Book \u00a7 752 might give rise to a violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>214 Conn. 161, 173, 571 A.2d 79 (1990); Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 748 through 755 were promulgated pursuant to that rule-making authority, rather than pursuant to the command of either the federal or state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Earlier in this opinion, in the context of determining that the language of \u00a7 749 (2) is inherently ambiguous as applied to tape recordings of 911 calls, we outlined the severe administrative and financial burdens that would flow from such an application. See footnote 16, supra, and accompanying text. In the same context, we also discussed the state\u2019s legislative and administrative response to the problem of preserving and maintaining such tapes for lengthy periods of time, namely, that under current schedules promulgated by the public records administrator pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 11-8, municipalities ordinarily need only preserve such tapes for thirty days. The same considerations apply in determining whether \u00a7 749 (2) was intended by the judges of the Superior Court to apply to tape recordings of 911 calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>Since such an application would involve severe financial and administrative burdens on municipalities, we should be cautious about reading judicial language that is employed in the rule-making capacity of the judges so as to impose those burdens. Although the exercise of the judicial rule-making authority will often result in some administrative and financial cost to the parties to litigation, it does not ordinarily involve the imposition of severe burdens on the political entities of our state that, in and of themselves, are not parties to that litigation. Furthermore, there is no indication that, in exercising their authority, either the advisory committee or the rules committee of the judges heard from the public entities that would be most affected by application of \u00a7 749 (2) to tape recordings of 911 calls, namely, the 169 municipalities of this state. It is unlikely that the promulgators of \u00a7 749 (2) considered it to be within their competence and purview, without inquiring into the inherent administrative and financial costs thereof, to make substantive judgments about the advisability of indefinitely preserving all tape recordings of all telephone calls for the entire range of such emergency services. This is particularly true where to do so would involve such serious burdens on the municipalities maintaining that telephonic system.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Thus, when we are asked to read ambiguous rule-making language so as to yield such an unworkable result, we should require a clear indication of judicial intent to do so. There is no such indication in the language or history of \u00a7 749 (2). It is highly unlikely, therefore, that \u00a7 749 (2) was ever intended to encompass tape recordings of 911 calls, as those calls are made and received pursuant to our statewide, legislatively mandated 911 system.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Second, the definition contained in \u00a7 749 (2) derives directly from the Jencks Act. The thrust of the definition of \u201cstatement\u201d under that act was to guard against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>the risk of quotation out of context from a \u201clengthy oral recital.\u201d <em>Palermo </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra. To the extent that the federal definition, as it emerged from the congressional conference, adopted and refined the Senate\u2019s version, which referred to tape-recorded as well as written statements, there is no indication that it was intended to encompass the kind of short, speedy call for emergency assistance that ordinarily characterizes a 911 emergency telephone call.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Finally, \u00a7 749 (2) was adopted by the judges in 1976 and was, at that time, taken directly from the Jencks Act definition adopted by the Congress in 1957. The 911 designation for emergency telephone calls was not designated by AT&amp;T until 1968, however, and the telephonic system currently in place was not legislatively mandated until 1984 and not implemented, in accordance with that mandate, until 1989. This time sequence further convinces us that, when, in 1976, the advisory committee drafted and the judges adopted the language of \u00a7 749 (2), they did not contemplate that it would be applied in 1992 to a complex telephonic system that did not exist in 1976 and that, by legislative mandate, inextricably links, not only local law enforcement agencies, but fire, ambulance, medical and other emergency services as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The conclusion that \u00a7 749 (2) does not include a tape recording of a 911 emergency telephone call does not mean, as the defendant suggests, that the rights of defendants to fair trials will be severely impaired. In the eight years beginning with <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>193 Conn. 457, 479 A.2d 199 (1984), when we first consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>ered the effect of an erased 911 tape recording, pursuant to the state\u2019s concession in that case that the tape recording was a \u00a7 749 (2) \u201cstatement,\u201d neither this court nor the Appellate Court has found the erasure of any such tape recording to have been harmful to the defendant.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>212 Conn. 6, 562 A.2d 470 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>205 Conn. 578, 534 A.2d 1175 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 61, 530 A.2d 155 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanford, </em>25 Conn. App. 255, 594 A.2d 477, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 912, 597 A.2d 338 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dedrick, </em>24 Conn. App. 518, 589 A.2d 1241 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Coriano, </em>12 Conn. App. 196, 530 A.2d 197, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 810, 532 A.2d 77 (1987). Thus, on the basis of our experience to date, we cannot say that the reliability of verdicts in criminal cases requires a construction of \u00a7 749 (2) that would include tape recordings of 911 emergency telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">We emphasize that we do not decide in this case whether, upon a timely motion of the defendant and the requisite showing of good cause, Practice Book \u00a7 745<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> would permit the court to order the state to preserve and produce a 911 tape that had not yet been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>erased. Nor do we decide whether the erasure of the tape recording of a 911 call might, under appropriate factual circumstances, constitute a violation of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights under the due process rubric of destruction of potentially exculpatory evidence. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cerilli, </em>222 Conn. 556, 578 n.15, 610 A.2d 1130 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brosnan, </em>221 Conn. 788, 812, 608 A.2d 49 (1992). We leave those questions to cases that properly present them. We decide only that Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7749 (2) and 752 do not require such preservation and production.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In this opinion Peters, C.

Indeed, that issue was the basis of our third certified question. See footnote 7, infra.

Unlike Practice Book \u00a7 749 (2), which explicitly defines the term \u201cstatement\u201d; see footnote 1, supra; the statute merely refers to \u201cany statement oral or written of the witness in the possession of the prosecution . . . .\u201d Thus, the defendant\u2019s argument pursuant to the Practice Book is stronger than his statutory argument, both because of the lack of a specific definition of the term \u201cstatement\u201d in the statute and because of its requirement that the \u201cstatement . . . [be] in the possession of the <em>prosecution,\" </em>(emphasis added) rather than, as under Practice Book \u00a7 752, \u201cin the possession of the state or its agents, including any state and local law enforcement officers. . . .\u201d Our conclusion that the term \u201cstatement\u201d in \u00a7 749 (2) does not include a tape of a 911 call, therefore, a fortiori applies to the use of the term \u201cstatement\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">This conclusion is buttressed by reference to the only legislative history applicable to \u00a7 54-86b. That history makes no reference to anything resembling a 911 tape, and refers only to \u201cwritten statements and oral statements which have come into the possession of the prosecution,\u201d and to the notion that \u201cthe defendant should have equal access <em>to these statements that are in the files of the prosecution.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) 13 S.

While not conclusive, the language and legislative history of \u00a7 54-86b is consistent with our conclusion, under Practice Book \u00a7 749 (2), that the term \u201cstatement\u201d as used therein does not include a tape of a 911 telephone call.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b760-7\"> We acknowledge, as the defendant points out, that until now our cases have treated a tape recording of a 911 call as a \u201cstatement\u201d under Practice Book \u00a7 749 (2), either by virtue of a specific concession to that effect by the state; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>193 Conn. 457, 466, 479 A.2d 199 (1984); or by virtue of assuming so without deciding. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>212 Conn. 6, 12, 562 A.2d 470 (1989). Despite this history, however, we have never explicitly considered whether that treatment was correct. In <em>Williamson, </em>we certified the question, \u201cwhether tape recorded 911 emergency telephone calls must be preserved on the chance that they might be discoverable under Practice Book \u00a7 752.\u201d Id., 9. We did not reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>that issue, however, because we held that the nonproduction of a tape recording of an interview with a state\u2019s witness required reversal of the conviction.

The jurisdictions that come closest are the District of Columbia, whose Court of Appeals has explicitly assumed without deciding that to be the case; see <em>Slye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>602 A.2d 136, 138 n.6 (D.C. 1992); <em>Bartley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>530 A.2d 692, 697 n.10 (D.C. 1987); and New York, whose Appellate Division of the Supreme Court proceeded on the basis of the concession of the state. <em>People </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>157 App. Div. 2d 519, 549 N.Y.S.2d 710 (1990); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>740 S.W.2d 320 (Mo.

This does not include, moreover, the additional costs for making copies of the tapes when requested if the case comes to trial, for the additional labor required to catalog, inventory, store, maintain and transfer the tapes to the proper party upon request, or for the construction or purchase of adequately dry and ventilated storage facilities in order to prevent the deterioration of the tapes. Nor does this estimate include, of course, the additional cost if such tapes were required to be preserved indefinitely, rather than merely for the one year period established by the Appellate Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\"> Title 18 of the United States Code, \u00a7 3500 (e) defines a \u201cstatement,\u201d for purposes of the Jencks Act, as follows: \u201cThe term \u2018statement,\u2019 as used in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section in relation to any witness called by the United States, means\u2014(1) a written statement made by said witness and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him; (2) a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by said witness and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement; or (3) a statement, however taken or recorded, or a transcription thereof, if any, made by said witness to a grand jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b775-7\"> We do not suggest that Practice Book \u00a7 749 (2) only applies to <em>lengthy </em>recorded statements of witnesses. Certainly, if a tape recording qualifies as a \u201cstatement\u201d under \u00a7 749 (2), its brevity will not disqualify it. We emphasize this statement from <em>Palermo </em>v. <em>United States, </em>360 U.S. 343, 79 S. Ct. 1217, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1287 (1959), only to highlight the fact that it is unlikely that the Jencks Act contemplates a tape recording of a 911 call.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\"> Indeed, that is true as well regarding the only other jurisdictions that have considered the effect on the trial of the erasure of a 911 tape recording assumed to have been a Jencks Act type statement. See, e.g., <em>Slye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>602 A.2d 135, 138 n.6 (D.C. 1992) (harmless error); <em>Bartley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>530 A.2d 692, 697 n.10 (D.C. 1987) (harmless error); see also <em>Seattle </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>44 Wash. App. 735, 723 P.2d 1156 (1986) (harmless error). The sole exception we have found is <em>People </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>157 App. Div. 2d 519, 549 N.Y.S.2d 710 (1990); in which the New York Appellate Division reversed the conviction in apparent reliance on New York precedent requiring reversal per se whenever certain discovery material is not produced, regardless of the effect of the erasure of the tape on the fact-finding process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b776-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 745 provides: \u201cIn addition to any other disclosure or inspection permitted by these rules, the judicial authority may, upon motion of the defendant and a showing of good cause, order such other disclosure, inspection, testing or copying of specific information and materials as the interests of justice may require.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b777-7\">Berdon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AOQ\">dissenting. \u201cA basic tenet of statutory construction is that when a statute [or Practice Book rule] is clear and unambiguous, there is no room for construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v.

In other words, this court may, at any time, conclude that some language is not <em>absolutely </em>clear and rewrite either the rule or the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Unfortunately, this is often done. See, e.g., <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Mansfield Training School, </em>220 Conn. 721, 726-27, 601 A.2d 507 (1992).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Even applying the majority\u2019s new tenet of construction, I fail to see what is not <em>\u201cabsolutely\u201d </em>clear about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>the 911 tape being a \u201cstatement.\u201d Indeed, the majority never explains what is not absolutely clear about it. Section 749 provides, in part, that a \u201cstatement\u201d is a \u201cstenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by a person and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement.\u201d The tape of the victim\u2019s 911 call clearly falls within the Practice Book edict that the state produce any \u201cstatement\u201d of a prosecution witness to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Likewise, \u00a7 54-86b has clear reference to the recordings of a witness on a 911 tape. Section 54-86b provides that the state shall produce a \u201cstatement oral or written.\u201d Reason and logic provide that an \u201coral\u201d statement encompasses a recording of a telephone conversation. A 911 emergency telephone call from the victim, which was made on the day of the crime and which allegedly described the type of crime and provided the identity of the assailant, must surely be such an oral statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The majority does not rely only on the fact that \u00a7 749 (2) is not \u201cabsolutely clear and unambiguous.\u201d They also create another new rule. According to the majority, even if the language to be construed is clear \u201con its face,\u201d this court will avoid enforcing it if \u201ca literal interpretation . . . would lead to unworkable results . . . .\u201d The trouble with this is twofold.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">First, the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corporation </em>v. <em>Kosa, </em>220 Conn. 643, 650-51, 600 A.2d 1 (1991), as precedent is misplaced. The court in <em>Kosa </em>construed an <em>ambiguous </em>statute and merely held the following: \u201c[C]ompelling principles of statutory construction . . . require us to construe a statute in a manner that will not thwart its intended purpose or lead to absurd results. . . .We must avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>a construction that fails to attain a rational and sensible result that bears directly on the purpose the legislature sought to achieve.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Of course, \u201c[w]e have consistently held that if a statute is clear and unambiguous, there is no room for construction.\u201d <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>205 Conn. 27, 33, 529 A.2d 1302 (1987). Second, and more important, there is nothing to indicate that preserving 911 tapes is \u201cunworkable.\u201d There may be some costs involved, but they are insignificant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is especially so if a reasonable limitation is placed upon preserving the tapes, for example one year, as the Appellate Court suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Indeed, the majority of the Appellate Court points out that the \u201cstate acknowledges that the 911 tape is a statement within the meaning of Practice Book \u00a7 749(2) . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>25 Conn. App. 503, 509, 596 A.2d 449 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 752 and General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b provide that after a state witness testifies on direct, upon motion made by the defendant, the court shall order the state to provide to the defense any prior statement made by that witness. Section 54-86b further provides: \u201cIf the prosecution fails to comply with the order of the court [to provide to the defense any prior statement made by a state witness,] the court shall strike from the record the testimony of the witness and the trial shall proceed unless the court in its discretion shall determine that the interests of justice require that a mistrial be declared.\u201d Accordingly, the testimony of the victim should have been stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Moreover, the failure to provide the defense with the tape of the victim\u2019s 911 call implicates the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>right to confrontation under the state and federal constitutions. \u201cWe have recognized that, under certain circumstances, the state\u2019s failure to produce material to which the defendant is entitled under General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b and Practice Book \u00a7 752 may adversely affect a defendant\u2019s ability to cross-examine a state\u2019s witness and thereby infringe upon his constitutional right of confrontation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>[214 Conn. 161, 173-74, 571 A.2d 79 (1990)]. In such a case, [an appellate] court would be warranted in strictly applying the harmless error doctrine to require the state to prove harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>[212 Conn. 6, 22-23, 562 A.2d 470 (1989)]. In determining the effect of the state\u2019s nonproduction on the defendant\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine, we have considered such factors as the trial or reviewing court\u2019s access to the unproduced material, the declarant\u2019s adoption of a counterpart transcript within a short time after making the statement, and the extent to which the defendant\u2019s conviction rested on the testimony of the witness whose pretrial statement had been destroyed. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 174-75 (the fact that the witness reviewed and signed within three days a typed transcription of his statement and the fact that the defendant\u2019s conviction did not rest solely on the testimony of that witness were major factors in applying the more probable than not standard to the harmless error inquiry); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra (the fact that the victim-witness did not review the transcription of her most detailed statement for seven months and that the defendant\u2019s conviction rested solely on the testimony of the victim-witness were major factors in determining that the stricter standard of proof would not have been unwarranted).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>215 Conn. 257, 269-70, 576 A.2d 139 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">When the factors set forth in <em>Belle </em>are applied to this case, it is apparent that the statements made by the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>and recorded on the 911 tape were not accessible to the trial or appellate courts and were not transcribed. More importantly, the defendant\u2019s conviction rested <em>squarely </em>on the testimony of the victim. Accordingly, I agree with the well reasoned dissent of Judge Daly in the Appellate Court that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s right to confront and cross-examine the victim was implicated and the state should have been held to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the [nonproduction of the] missing 911 statement was harmless.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>supra, 527-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">\u201cFrom the evidence adduced at trial, the state could not prove that the [nonproduction of the] missing 911 statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant\u2019s conviction rested squarely on the victim\u2019s testimony in this case and her testimony contained critical inconsistencies. On direct examination, the victim testified that the first person she called after the incident was her friend. The victim claimed that she told her friend that the defendant had assaulted her. She then testified that after this conversation she called 911 and reported: T was raped.\u2019 During her cross-examination, the victim testified that she told her friend, \u2018[the defendant] raped me,\u2019 not \u2018[the defendant] hit me,\u2019 as her friend had testified. She then explained that in her prior testimony she had used the word \u2018assaulted\u2019 because she was afraid to use the term \u2018rape,\u2019 and that she had, in fact, told her friend that she was raped. During recross[-examination], the victim reaffirmed the sequence of her telephone calls and that she had reported to the 911 operator that she had been raped. The victim\u2019s friend testified that the victim called and said \u2018[the defendant] hit me,\u2019 but she was not certain of the wording, and later testified that it sounded like \u2018[the defendant] hit me.\u2019 The state submitted into evidence the victim\u2019s statement to the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>on the day she called 911. The statement contained the victim\u2019s accusation that the defendant had raped her on that day.\u201d Id., 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">The credibility of the victim was on the line and it was a critical issue in the case. Under the circumstances, even if we apply a standard that the state need prove only that it was more probable than not that the state\u2019s nonproduction was harmless; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 175; a reversal is required. Although we are unable to determine what was on the 911 tape, its production would have given the defendant the opportunity to prove that what happened was not, in fact, a sexual assault. In short, I am bewildered by the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b provides: \u201c(a) In any criminal prosecution, after a witness called by the prosecution has testified on direct examination, the court shall on motion of the defendant order the prosecution to produce any statement oral or written of the witness in the possession of the prosecution which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified, and the court shall order said statement to be delivered directly to the defendant for his examination and use.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">\u201c(b) If the prosecution fails to comply with the order of the court, the court shall strike from the record the testimony of the witness and the trial shall proceed unless the court in its discretion shall determine that the interests of justice require that a mistrial be declared.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 749 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe term \u2018statement\u2019 . . . means . . .

This is due, in part, to the fact that the rule prohibiting a court from looking behind the plain and unambiguous language of an act has become blurred to the point where the court will often look beyond that language without first deciding the threshold issue of whether an ambiguity exists. . . . Thus, one can never be certain, no matter how clear and unambiguous the language of an act may be, that the court will not look beyond that language and interpret it in a manner contrary to its literal meaning. Such action, however, disregards the court\u2019s prior warning that the \u2018[g]eneral rules of construction are but imprecise and uncertain guides to the legislative intent behind an ambiguous enactment, and we must employ them with caution.\u2019 <em>[Levin-Townsend Computer Corporation v.
