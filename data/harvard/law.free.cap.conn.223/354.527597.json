J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADu-\">The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the named defendant, the board of police commissioners of the borough of Naugatuck (board), acted with the impartiality mandated by the constitutional guarantees of due process when it voted to remove the plaintiff, Dennis E. Clisham, from the office of chief of police of the borough of Naugatuck.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the course of removal proceedings commenced by the board pursuant to 26 Spec. Acts 934, No. 321, \u00a7 4,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plaintiff filed a motion to disqualify in which he alleged that three members of the five member board were biased against him. The three members did not recuse themselves. After the five board members voted unanimously to remove the plaintiff from the office of chief of police and to terminate his employment with the police department, the plaintiff filed an appeal with the Superior Court pursuant to 26 Spec. Acts 934, No. 321, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Superior Court dismissed the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>appeal. The plaintiff appealed the judgment of dismissal to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The following facts underlie this appeal. The plaintiff, having been a lieutenant in the Naugatuck police department, became chief of police of the borough of Naugatuck as a result of the action of the board on July 26, 1984.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> William Rado, then the mayor of Naugatuck and a member of the board, seconded the board\u2019s appointment of the plaintiff to this office. In May, 1985, Terry L. Buckmiller, a political rival of Rado, was elected mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">On December 9, 1987, the board, comprised of six individuals who had not been on the board at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s appointment, notified the plaintiff in writing that, following an investigation conducted by one of the attorneys for the borough, the plaintiff was being charged with eleven violations of the rules and regulations of the police department. Charges one, two and three alleged that in a Naugatuck bar on October 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>1987, the plaintiff had threatened the lives of two individuals and had \u201csolicit[ed] a physical assault\u201d upon another in violation of rule 17, \u00a7 1 (7), (10) and/or (11) of the rules and regulations of the Naugatuck police department.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Charges four and five alleged that, in a cafe on October 24, 1984, the plaintiff had assaulted an individual, had threatened his life and had threatened the lives of the individual\u2019s family members in violation of rule 17, \u00a7 1 (7), (10) and/or (11) of the rules and regulations of the Naugatuck police department. The sixth charge alleged that the plaintiff had assaulted individuals on three separate occasions and, thus, had \u201cdemonstrat[ed] a propensity for physical assaults upon persons\u201d in violation of rule 17, \u00a7 1 (7), (10) and/or (11).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The board commenced a series of hearings on the charges against the plaintiff on December 15, 1987. The stated purpose of the hearings was to decide whether the board would remove the plaintiff as chief of police. At the first hearing, the plaintiff made an oral motion that, \u201cin the interest of fairness,\u201d board member Buck-miller recuse himself from sitting on the hearings. Buckmiller complied. The parties thereafter agreed that, pursuant to 26 Spec. Acts 934, No. 321, \u00a7 4,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in order to remove the plaintiff from office and terminate his employment with the police department, the remaining five members of the board would have to vote unanimously for his removal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>At the January 26, 1988 hearing, the attorney for the borough began presenting evidence on the charges against the plaintiff. At that hearing, the plaintiff made an oral motion that another board member, Rocco DeCarlo, Sr., recuse himself because DeCarlo was then a defendant in a civil action the plaintiff had brought in the United States District Court. Following an executive session to discuss the motion, the board responded that DeCarlo would recuse himself if the plaintiff would allow the remaining four board members to preside and would accept as final the actions of those four board members. The plaintiff declined the board\u2019s offer and reminded it that the town charter provides that the chief of police can be removed only upon the unanimous vote of five board members. The hearings resumed and DeCarlo remained on the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">At the August 30, 1988 hearing, the plaintiff filed a motion to disqualify board members DeCarlo, Edward Mason and Robert Sharon. The motion alleged that DeCarlo had \u201cexpressed on prior occasions an animosity toward the movant and a conviction that the movant should be removed from office\u201d; that Mason had \u201cpublicly and repeatedly expressed and maintained a belief that the movant should be removed from office and ha[d] actively taken steps to assure that that should occur\u201d; and that Sharon had testified as a witness against the plaintiff before a grand jury. The plaintiff offered to present evidence to support his claims of bias as to each of the three board members named and attempted to call each as a witness. The board sustained an objection to calling the board members as witnesses, but did hear the testimony of two other witnesses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Although the record does not reflect that the board ever made an affirmative ruling to deny the plaintiffs motion to disqualify DeCarlo, Mason and Sharon, the hearings continued with their presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">At the February 14, 1989 hearing, the board voted on each of the six remaining charges. By a four to one margin, the board voted that charges one and three had been proved. The board voted by a three to two margin that the second charge had been proved. It unanimously concluded that charges four and five had not been proved and that charge six had been proved. At the conclusion of the hearing, the board voted unanimously to grant a motion to dismiss the plaintiff from the Naugatuck police department for violating departmental rules and regulations. The board served a written notice of its decision on February 21, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court within thirty days, as required by 26 Spec. Acts 934, No. 321, \u00a7 5, claiming that (1) he was denied a hearing by an impartial panel in violation of his due process rights,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (2) the board improperly based its decision to dismiss the plaintiff on facts known at the time of his appointment, and (3) the board\u2019s decision to remove the plaintiff violated the unanimity requirement of 26 Spec. Acts 934, No. 321, \u00a7 4. The trial court ruled against each of the plaintiff\u2019s claims and, accordingly, rendered a judgment dismissing his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">On appeal to this court, the plaintiff reasserts the three claims he raised below.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because we are persuaded that the participation of Mason in the board\u2019s decision to dismiss the plaintiff denied the plaintiff his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>constitutional right to be heard by an impartial tribunal, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and direct a remand to the board for a new hearing before an impartial panel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Number 321, \u00a7 4, of 26 Spec. Acts 934, provides in relevant part that \u201c[u]pon reasonable notice and after due hearing, the board of police commissioners may remove from office, for malfeasance or for any neglect or refusal to properly perform his duties, any member or officer of said department of police protection, including the chief of police.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because a police chief in Naugatuck can be removed from office only for \u201cmalfeasance or for any neglect or refusal to properly perform his duties,\u201d the plaintiff has a property interest in his position as chief of police that is protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution; see <em>Cleveland Board of Education </em>v. <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 538-39, 105 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>1487, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1985); <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Krause, </em>209 Conn. 352, 366-67, 551 A.2d 710 (1988); <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>181 Conn. 69, 71-73, 434 A.2d 333 (1980); and by article first, \u00a7 8 of the Connecticut constitution. See <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 71-72 (\u201c[article one, section eight of our state constitution . . . given the same effect as the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution\u201d); see also <em>Rodo </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>216 Conn. 541, 555, 583 A.2d 102 (1990); <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>199 Conn. 231, 234, 506 A.2d 139, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 802, 107 S. Ct. 42, 93 L. Ed. 2d 5 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In our analysis of the plaintiffs claim that his due process rights were violated, we must balance \u201cthe governmental interest in existing procedures against the risk of erroneous deprivation of a private interest through the use of these procedures.\u201d <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>supra, 235. That analysis starts from the proposition that the board was acting in a quasi-judicial capacity when it undertook dismissal proceedings against the plaintiff. See id., 234; <em>Catino </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>174 Conn. 414, 417, 389 A.2d 754 (1978). \u201cAt the core of due process is the requirement for an impartial tribunal. See <em>Tumey </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 47 S. Ct. 437, 71 L. Ed. 749 (1927). Due process demands . . . the existence of impartiality on the part of those who function in judicial or quasi-judicial capacities.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rado </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 556; see also <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>McClure, </em>456 U.S. 188, 195, 102 S. Ct. 1665, 72 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\u201cThe applicable due process standards for disqualification of administrative adjudicators do not rise to the heights of those prescribed for judicial disqualification.\u201d <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>supra, 238; see <em>Jutkowitz </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>220 Conn. 86, 100, 596 A.2d 374 (1991). \u201cThe mere appearance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>of bias that might disqualify a judge will not disqualify an arbitrator.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rado </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 556. Moreover, there is a presumption that administrative board members acting in an adjudicative capacity are not biased. <em>Jutkowitz </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>supra; <em>Rado </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra. \u201cTo overcome the presumption, the plaintiff . . . must demonstrate actual bias, rather than mere potential bias, of the board members challenged, unless the circumstances indicate a probability of such bias \u2018too high to be constitutionally tolerable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rado </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, quoting <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 47, 95 S. Ct. 1456, 43 L. Ed. 2d 712 (1975). The plaintiff has the burden of establishing a disqualifying interest. <em>Jutkowitz </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>supra; <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>supra, 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In order to prove bias as a ground for disqualification, the plaintiff must show more than an adjudicator\u2019s \u201cannounced previous position about law or policy . . . .\u201d 3 K. Davis, Administrative Law (2d Ed. 1980) \u00a7 19.2, p. 372; see also <em>Hortonville Joint School District No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hortonville Education Assn., </em>426 U.S. 482, 493, 96 S. Ct. 2308, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1976). He must make a showing that the adjudicator has prejudged adjudicative facts that are in dispute. 3 K. Davis, supra, \u00a7 19.4, p. 382. \u201cA tribunal is not impartial if it is biased with respect to the factual issues to be decided at the hearing.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Mission, </em>705 F.2d 368, 372 (10th Cir. 1983). \u201cThe test for disqualification has been succinctly stated as being whether \u2018a disinterested observer may conclude that [the board] has in some measure adjudged the facts as well as the law of a particular case in advance of hearing it.\u2019 <em>Gilligan, Will &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>SEC, </em>267 F.2d 461, 469 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 896, 80 S.

Ed. 2d 914 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">To support his motion to disqualify Mason, the plaintiff, at the August 30, 1988 hearing, offered the testimony of Carl Miele, then Naugatuck\u2019s Democratic Town Chairman and formerly a political advisor to Buckmiller during his 1985 and 1987 mayoral campaigns. Miele testified that Buckmiller\u2019s \u201cfirst and foremost campaign pledges\u201d had been to \u201cget rid of Chief Dennis Clisham\u201d and that Buckmiller had made public statements to that effect. He testified that, prior to Mason\u2019s appointment to the board, he and Mason had been members of a \u201csmall group of close advisors\u201d to Buckmiller, to which he referred as an \u201cinner circle.\u201d He testified that this group, consisting of five members, had met regularly over an eighteen month period following Buckmiller\u2019s election to the office of mayor in May, 1985. Miele responded affirmatively when asked whether, both before and after Buck-miller\u2019s election as mayor, Mason had expressed \u201csupport for the proposition that Mr. Clisham shouldn\u2019t be police chief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Miele also testified concerning Mason\u2019s efforts to amend the unanimity requirement of 26 Spec. Acts 934, No. 321, \u00a7 4. Miele told the board that, prior to Mason\u2019s appointment to the board, Mason\u2019s \u201cmain objective [had been] the police regulations.\u201d The new regulations \u201cwere to include that the police chief would be dismissed by a majority instead of a unanimous vote.\u201d He testified that the purpose of the effort to change the unanimity requirement had been \u201cto dump Clisham.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The plaintiff asked Miele at the hearing whether it had been brought to his attention through the meetings of the \u201cinner circle,\u201d that \u201cthere was to be a meeting concerning Chief Clisham with certain members of the Board of Police Commissioners.\u201d Miele replied that he had heard in advance that this meeting was to be held and further testified that \u201c[i]t was a meeting where the Borough attorney attended, Mr. Mason attended, a quorum attended, the Mayor attended, and was an illegal meeting where a quorum was present.\u201d He stated that \u201c[t]hey were going to meet and discuss Chief Clisham.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The plaintiff also submitted evidence to the board of a statement that Mason had made to a reporter during the pendency of the removal proceedings. The August, 1988 edition of Connecticut Magazine contained an article focusing on the politics of Naugatuck that, as the trial court observed, \u201ccan reasonably be described as favorable to Buckmiller and contains some unfavorable statements by Buckmiller regarding Clisham.\u201d The article chronicled Rado\u2019s tenure as mayor, the transition to Buckmiller as mayor and the troubles that had plagued and continued to plague the plaintiff as chief of police. The article stated that \u201c[f|rom the very beginning, Buckmiller made no secret of the fact that if he had the power, he would fire Clisham immediately.\u201d The plaintiff offered into evidence a copy of the July 26, 1988 Waterbury Republican, which contained the following quote attributed to Mason: \u201c \u2018Being a supporter of Buckmiller, I thought [the Connecticut Magazine article] was great. ... I thought it was devastating] for Clisham, Rado and company. Whoever wrote it, he\u2019s a friend of mine. Of course, if you\u2019re a Rado supporter, you\u2019re not going to like it.\u2019 \u201d At the September 20, 1988 hearing, the plaintiff offered the testimony of Terry Corcoran, the reporter who wrote the July 26, 1988 article. Coreo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>ran testified that Mason had made the statement that appeared in the July 26 article. He stated that he had chosen to interview Mason because he had been aware that Mason was \u201cin the inner circle with Buckmiller.\u201d Corcoran also testified that Mason\u2019s reference to Clisham was spontaneous and had not been elicited by Corcoran, i.e., that it had not come in response to a question about Clisham.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In 1991, the plaintiff deposed Buckmiller, and introduced in the trial court the transcript of the deposition as additional evidence of Mason\u2019s bias.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Buckmiller stated that, even before he had announced his candidacy, he had believed and had openly stated that the plaintiff should not have been appointed as chief of police. Buckmiller agreed that the plaintiff\u2019s management of the police department was an issue during his first mayoral campaign. He stated that he and Mason, who had been one of his political supporters, had become \u201cgood friends\u201d in January of 1985. Buckmiller stated that Mason had acted as an advisor during his mayoral campaign. He acknowledged that during his mayoral campaign, he had spoken frequently with Mason, approximately once per day. Buckmiller continued to consult frequently with Mason after the election. Buckmiller admitted that in November, 1985, he had publicly stated that the plaintiff should be removed as chief of police.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Buckmiller confirmed Miele\u2019s testimony regarding the effort to amend the regulations to require less than a unanimous vote to remove the chief of police. This amendment was deemed necessary because two of Rado\u2019s appointees remained on the board and, consequently, there were not sufficient votes on the board to remove the plaintiff from the office of chief of police. Buckmiller assigned to Mason the task of amending the regulations to require less than a unanimous vote for removal. The effort was, however, ultimately abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Buckmiller acknowledged that he had had a \u201cmission\u201d to clean up the town of Naugatuck and that Mason had become an ally in this mission. Although Buckmiller stated that Mason had \u201calways told me he liked Ned Clisham,\u201d and that he did not remember Mason saying that \u201cwe should get rid of Ned Clisham,\u201d Buckmiller responded affirmatively when asked: \u201cAnd whether Ted Mason liked or didn\u2019t like Ned Clisham or whether you did or didn\u2019t like Ned Clisham, the police chief, Ned Clisham, was a problem; isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Buckmiller also confirmed Miele\u2019s testimony concerning the November, 1986 illegal meeting attended by Mason and four members of the board, including Buck-miller. The two board members who were holdovers from the Rado administration were not present at that meeting. Buckmiller acknowledged that those in attendance at the illegal meeting had agreed that the office of the chief of police was not being \u201cfulfilled properly\u201d and that the plaintiff should be replaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">On October 6, 1987, Buckmiller appointed Mason and Maruta Jancis to fill two vacancies on the board. Buck-miller indicated in his deposition that he would have appointed only someone who shared his feelings about cleaning up the town and that he had known that Mason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>shared his views about the police department and the position of police chief. The board notified the plaintiff of the charges against him just over two months after Mason\u2019s appointment to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The board contends that, for three reasons, this factual showing is insufficient as a matter of law to demonstrate Mason\u2019s prejudgment of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged misconduct. The board asserts that: (1) the plaintiff failed to assert his claim of Mason\u2019s bias in a timely manner; (2) the evidence adduced by the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that Mason had prejudged any issue that was before the board; and (3) even if Mason should have been disqualified, the doctrine of necessity requires this court to uphold the board\u2019s decision to remove the plaintiff. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">A claim of bias must be raised in a timely manner. \u201cThe failure to raise a claim of disqualification with reasonable promptness after learning the ground for such a claim ordinarily constitutes a waiver thereof.\u201d <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>202 Conn. 453, 462, 521 A.2d 1040 (1987). One court has noted that \u201ca challenge to a judge for bias and prejudice must be made at the first opportunity after discovery of the facts tending to prove disqualification. ... To hold otherwise would be to allow a litigant to pervert and abuse the right extended to him at the cost to the other party of unnecessary expense and labor and to the public of the unnecessary disruption of the conduct of the courts.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Chafin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>5 F.2d 592, 595 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 269 U.S. 552, 46 S. Ct. 18, 70 L. Ed. 407 (1925); <em>see Duffield v. Charleston Area Medical Center, Inc., </em>503 F.2d 512, 515 (4th Cir. 1974) (\u201cclaim of disqualifying bias or partiality on the part of a member of . . . an administrative agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>must be asserted promptly after knowledge of the alleged disqualification\u201d). Moreover, \u201cwe will not permit parties to anticipate a favorable decision, reserving a right to impeach it or set it aside if it happens to be against them, for a cause which was well known to them before or during the [hearing].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">In addressing the issue of timeliness, the trial court found that \u201cit would be . . . quite surprising if Clisham had not known of the facts he alleges at the time of the campaign since Clisham was, or so he claims, a major issue in that campaign.\u201d Consequently, it declined to consider any claims of bias other than the claim stemming from Mason\u2019s statement to Corcoran of the Waterbury Republican, which, the trial court stated, had been raised in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">We conclude that the plaintiff timely asserted his claim that Mason was impermissibly biased and that all relevant evidence was admissible to substantiate that claim. First, although the plaintiff was undoubtedly aware of Buckmiller\u2019s desire to have him removed as chief of police, the record is devoid of evidence tending to show that the plaintiff knew, or should have known, the extent of Mason\u2019s behind the scenes participation in Buckmiller\u2019s campaign to remove the plaintiff from office, prior to obtaining that information from Miele.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Miele, who, as a former close advisor to Buck-miller and member of the \u201cinner circle\u201d with Mason, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>was instrumental in substantiating the plaintiffs claim that Mason was biased, apparently did not come forward until May or June, 1988, with the information he gave to the board at the August 30, 1988 meeting.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This record does not provide support for the trial court\u2019s contrary finding. The plaintiff raised the issue about Mason\u2019s bias at a hearing of the board soon after his discovery of the facts that would provide evidence to support such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Second, once the plaintiff raised his claim of bias following the publication of Mason\u2019s statement in the Waterbury Republican, a claim that the board concedes was timely, the prior evidence of bias was relevant to substantiate that claim. The plaintiff\u2019s claim was based upon evidence of bias that was cumulative in nature. We do not look at each piece of evidence in isolation and treat it as a separate and distinct claim of bias. Rather, to determine whether there was actual bias or a \u201cprobability of such bias too high to be constitutionally tolerable\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Rado </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 556; we look at the uncontroverted evidence of Mason\u2019s role as an advisor and consultant to Buckmiller both before and after the mayoral campaign, his participation in the illegal meeting of a quorum of board members, his attempt to amend the regulations to eliminate the unanimity requirement <em>and </em>his statement to Corcoran of the Waterbury Republican during the pendency of the removal hearings. The plaintiff cannot, therefore, be deemed to have waived his claim that Mason was impermissibly biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">We turn next to the board\u2019s contention that the plaintiff has failed to sustain his burden of proving that Mason had prejudged any issue that was before the board. In addressing the sufficiency of the evidence adduced by the plaintiff, we confront both a procedural and a substantive question. Procedurally, what is the appropriate standard of review of the determination of the trial court concluding that the evidence was insufficient? Substantively, what should our conclusion be?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">As a procedural matter, a trial court adjudicating an administrative appeal that raises an issue of bias will often hold an evidentiary hearing at which testimony about the presence or absence of bias is presented by the interested parties. In such circumstances, \u201c[b]ecause the existence of actual bias on the part of a board member present[s] an issue of fact on which the plaintiff [has] the burden of proof, the determination of the trial court that the evidence did not establish such bias cannot be overturned, unless the subordinate facts found or the admitted or undisputed facts would require a different conclusion as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Rado </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 561. In the present case, however, the trial court heard no testimony on the issue of bias, although it had the authority to do so under \u00a7 7-278.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The question, therefore, arises whether we should defer to the trial court\u2019s factual findings<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that were derived from its review of the same administrative record that is presently before us. We conclude that such deferral is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>\u201c[C]redibility of witnesses and the determination of factual issues are matters within the province of [the board]\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>203 Conn. 525, 540-41, 525 A.2d 940 (1987); and, as noted above, the existence of bias is an issue of fact. Nevertheless, we hold that the uncontradicted evidence of Mason\u2019s bias was overwhelming and, therefore, conclude as a matter of law that Mason\u2019s participation in the hearings violated the plaintiff\u2019s due process right to an impartial panel. Miele\u2019s testimony before the board, which was confirmed in many respects through the deposition testimony of Buckmiller, and which has never been contradicted by the board, demonstrates a probability of bias \u201c \u2018too high to be constitutionally tolerable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rado </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 556. A disinterested observer, viewing the undisputed evidence, would necessarily conclude that Mason had in some measure adjudged the facts of the plaintiff\u2019s case in advance of hearing it. <em>Cinderella Career &amp; Finishing Schools, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Trade Commission, </em>supra, 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The present case is analogous, on its merits, to <em>Staton </em>v. <em>Mayes, </em>552 F.2d 908 (10th Cir. 1977). The plaintiff in <em>Staton </em>was the superintendent of a school district in Oklahoma. The defendants were three members of a five member board that had caused the plaintiff\u2019s dismissal on charges of willful neglect of duty and incompetence. Id., 909-10. In that case, the plaintiff presented undisputed evidence that board member Mayes had made public statements in his campaign for election to the board concerning the plaintiff and that he had \u201cpledged to seek a new top level administration for the schools . . . and [stated that] it had become apparent to him that the trouble lay with the superintendent, and that he would vote to make the necessary change.\u201d Id., 913. Board member Moore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\u201cadmitted going to visit with a board member . . . and saying there was a possibility [that the] plaintiff would be leaving and if they could \u2018be together on the board and not disrupt the board, where we could continue to have school for children, it would be best for all of us.\u2019 \u201d Id., 914. Board member Wade admitted telling a board member that the plaintiff \u201c \u2018has got to go.\u2019 \u201d Id. The court, applying the test enunciated in <em>Cinderella Career &amp; Finishing Schools, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Trade Commission, </em>supra, stated that, although each board member testified that he had based his decision to vote for dismissal solely upon the evidence presented at the hearings, there was sufficient evidence to conclude that the board was not impartial and, thus, that the plaintiff\u2019s due process rights had been violated. <em>Staton </em>v. <em>Mayes, </em>supra, 914-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">We recognize that the statement made by Mayes in <em>Staton </em>that he would \u201cvote to make the necessary change\u201d was more direct evidence of the prejudgment of issues than any statement attributable to Mason. The description of the other two board members meeting with yet another board member and discussing the school superintendent, however, is very similar to Miele\u2019s testimony about Mason\u2019s private actions regarding the plaintiff. In the guise of cleaning up the police department, Mason and Buckmiller pursued possible ways to \u201cdump\u201d the plaintiff, including amending the regulations to require less than a unanimous vote for removal. They held a secret meeting, which was attended by Mason, who had not yet been appointed to the board, Buckmiller and only those members of the board who had been appointed by Buckmiller. At that meeting they discussed the plaintiff and his management of the police department. Moreover, it is highly relevant that Mason\u2019s statement to Corcoran, though perhaps less specific than the public statements made by the board member in <em>Staton </em>during his bid for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>election to the board, was made at a time when Mason was a police commissioner and at a time when the removal hearings were ongoing and evidence was still being taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">When Mason\u2019s statement in the Waterbury Republican is viewed against the backdrop of all of the other evidence of Mason\u2019s bias arising prior to the hearings, we are convinced that the plaintiff has successfully demonstrated that Mason was not capable of judging fairly the ultimate issue of whether the plaintiff should have been dismissed from his position. See <em>Hortonville Joint School District No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hortonville Education Assn., </em>supra, 493. The totality of the evidence did not demonstrate a mere stance on general policy issues; see id., 492-93; nor is this a case where statements were made during the investigation of charges against the plaintiff. See <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>supra, 52-55. Rather, the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated a high probability of bias in favor of removing the plaintiff as chief of police that existed both before and during the hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The board attempts to rebut the inference that Mason was impermissibly biased by focusing upon Mason\u2019s votes on the underlying charges. It emphasizes that Mason voted against a finding that five of the six charges against the plaintiff had been proved. Mason, however, voted unanimously with the remaining four members of the board on the most important factual issue of the entire hearings, i.e., whether to remove the plaintiff as chief of police. The fact that Mason voted in favor of the plaintiff on five charges that did not require a unanimous vote does not negate in any way the substantial evidence tending to show that Mason had prejudged the removal issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We conclude, therefore, that Mason\u2019s participation in the hearings deprived the hearings \u201cof that fairness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>and impartiality necessary to that fundamental fairness required by due process.\u201d <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Webb Ford, Inc., </em>689 F.2d 733, 737 (7th Cir. 1982). The plaintiff cannot be ousted from his office on the basis of so tainted a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The board claims, finally, that, even if the record supports a conclusion that Mason was not an impartial adjudicator, \u201cthe administrative rule of necessity mandates that the board\u2019s decision to terminate Chief Clisham must stand.\u201d Number 321, \u00a7 2, of 26 Spec. Acts 934, provides that the board of police commissioners of the borough of Naugatuck shall consist of the mayor and five other members appointed by the mayor. Section 4 of the same act provides that the chief of police may be removed from office only upon \u201can affirmative vote of five members of the board of police commissioners.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> No other tribunal has been given the authority to remove the chief of police, nor is there a procedure for replacing a board member who is disqualified from hearing an isolated case. The board asserts that, because there is no provision for replacing a disqualified board member, we must resort to the doctrine of necessity to uphold the board\u2019s decision to remove the plaintiff. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">We have recognized that the doctrine of necessity may operate to permit participation in adjudicative proceedings by someone who would otherwise be disqualified. \u201c \u2018Disqualification must yield to necessity where to disqualify would destroy the only tribunal in which relief could be had and thus preclude determination of the issue. In such case it has been held, consistently, the court must act no matter how disagreeable its task maybe.\u2019 <em>\u201d Dacey </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bar Assn., </em>170 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>520, 524, 368 A.2d 125 (1976). The doctrine of necessity applies to administrative tribunals as well as to courts. 3 K. Davis, supra, \u00a7 19.9, pp. 404-405.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We are unpersuaded that the doctrine of necessity validates the plaintiffs ouster in the circumstances of this case. We conclude, to the contrary, that the plaintiffs constitutional right to a fair hearing before an impartial tribunal must be preserved by a remand for a new administrative hearing. The board does not contest the seriousness of the plaintiffs property interest in retention of his position as chief of police. It would be a miscarriage of justice to uphold the board\u2019s actions in this instance merely because the town has not provided a procedure for replacing disqualified board members. There can be no public confidence in a decision rendered by a board whose members include one demonstrating not merely an associational relationship to one of the parties, as in <em>Dacey </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bar Assn., </em>supra, but prejudgment of the very issue that the board was authorized to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">We need not determine what alternatives the board might have pursued in order to proceed after Mason\u2019s disqualification. Some courts have suggested that board members who have disqualifying interests could remedy the situation by resigning. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Miller </em>v. <em>Aldridge, </em>212 Ala. 660, 664, 103 So. 835 (1925); <em>Stahl </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>187 Iowa 1342, 1353, 175 N.W. 772 (1920).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because Mason is no longer a member of the board,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we presume that on remand the board will be so constituted as to conduct an impartial hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to remand the case to the board of police commissioners for a new hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\"> Also named as defendants were the following six individuals who were on the board during the removal proceedings: John J.
