The issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>on appeal are whether the trial court: (1) improperly allowed the state to cross-examine the defendant concerning his failure to disclose certain exculpatory information before trial; (2) abused its discretion in allowing the state to present rebuttal evidence from a police officer; (3) unfairly emphasized the state\u2019s evidence in its charge to the jury; (4) abused its discretion in refusing to order the removal of handcuffs from a defense witness; and (5) improperly refused to declare a mistrial as the result of the state\u2019s references to the absence of two witnesses referred to during the defendant\u2019s case-in-chief. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The jury might reasonably have found the following facts. On April 28, 1989, Officer Ashley Gonzalez of the Norwalk police department was working as an undercover agent in the Mulvoy Street area of South Nor-walk. An \u201carrest team\u201d consisting of Officer Kenneth Riley, Officer Carlos Cotto and Detective Ronald Pine was also in the area to support Gonzalez. According to their plan, Gonzalez, who was wearing a hidden body microphone, would attempt to buy narcotics while the arrest team monitored the transaction. If Gonzalez were successful, the arrest team would respond by making arrests based upon the information provided via the microphone.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">At approximately 2:45 p.m., Gonzalez pulled his unmarked car up to the curb in front of a group of males gathered on the street. Gonzalez gestured to one of the men, later identified as Hugh Pollard, in a manner that indicated that Gonzalez was interested in purchasing drugs. After Pollard approached the car and opened the door, Gonzalez asked him for some \u201cP,\u201d which is a street term for heroin. Pollard told Gonzalez to wait, walked down the sidewalk, and approached a black male, later identified as the defendant. Gonzalez then saw the defendant hand Pollard a glassine envelope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>after a brief conversation between the two. Gonzalez later testified that he had observed this exchange from a distance of approximately fifteen feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">After this exchange, Pollard, still clenching his fist around the glassine envelope, returned to Gonzalez\u2019 car, closed the door, and told Gonzalez to \u201cdrive around\u201d to avoid police surveillance. As Gonzalez drove around the block, Pollard handed him the envelope and, in exchange, Gonzalez gave Pollard $20. Gonzalez then returned Pollard to their original location and radioed descriptions of Pollard and the defendant to the arrest team. Gonzalez then drove to police headquarters where, upon performing a field test on the substance in the envelope, he determined that it was heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">A few minutes after Gonzalez had returned Pollard to the Mulvoy Street area, the arrest team drove to the area and, based on Gonzalez\u2019 descriptions, identified Pollard and the defendant standing on Mulvoy Street. Pine got out of the vehicle, approached Pollard and placed him under arrest. As Riley began walking toward the defendant, the defendant began to run. Riley and Cotto both chased the defendant, during which time Riley observed him drop a brown object. This object was later recovered and found to be a bag containing twelve vials of crack cocaine. The officers pursued the defendant into a housing complex where he was subsequently apprehended. Cotto later testified that the defendant, upon his arrest, \u201cjust kept reiterating that he didn\u2019t have anything, he didn\u2019t have anything.\u201d The police recovered the defendant\u2019s red jacket that he had been carrying as he ran and found, inside one of the pockets, a small notebook with his name on the cover. Inside the notebook there were entries for parties, phone numbers, and what appeared to be drug transactions, e.g., \u201cStevie, two bags\u201d and \u201c5 [grams].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ACd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>The state tried the def\u00e9ndant as an accessory to the heroin sale by Pollard to Gonzalez. At trial, the defendant took the stand and testified that he had never given Pollard a glassine envelope, but had been simply shaking hands with him after making an agreement to wallpaper several rooms in Pollard\u2019s mother\u2019s house. The defendant further testified that he had not been the only person to run when the arrest team arrived and he had done so because he had not wanted his father to know that he had been in the Mulvoy Street area. The defendant also stated that he had not dropped a brown paper bag during the chase prior to his arrest, but that he had seen someone, later identified as Curtis Langley (Gumby), drop it when Gumby had run away.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pollard also testified and corroborated the claim that he and the defendant had been merely shaking hands and that he, Pollard, had acted alone in the sale to Gonzalez. Willie Massey, a bystander at the time of the arrest, corroborated the defendant\u2019s testimony that it was Gumby, not the defendant, who had dropped the brown bag as the group scattered.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Following direct examination, the state\u2019s attorney asked the defendant why he had waited until trial to disclose that it was Gumby who had dropped the bag. The defendant responded that he had told his counsel from the outset that he did not have the bag, but he had wanted to find out Gumby\u2019s real name before dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>closing it to his attorney.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During recross-examination, the trial court asked the defendant why he had not disclosed this information to the authorities.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In his response, the defendant denied having remained silent and testified: \u201cI told Officer Cotto that I did not throw the drugs down.\u201d This exchange constituted the sole reference during trial to the defendant\u2019s alleged nondisclosure. There was no objection to the line of ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>tioning until after completion of the redirect examination that involved the same subject. There was no motion for a mistrial. The defendant now claims that the state\u2019s and the trial court\u2019s questions about his failure to tell his attorney and the authorities about Gumby constituted a violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment pursuant to the holding in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In <em>Doyle, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe use for impeachment purposes of petitioners\u2019 silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving Miranda<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> warnings, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Id., 619. The <em>Miranda </em>tenets \u201crequire that a person taken into custody be advised immediately that he has the right to remain silent, [and] that anything he says may be used against him .... Silence in the wake of these warnings may be nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of these <em>Miranda </em>rights. Thus, every post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous because of what the State is required to advise the person arrested.\u201d Id., 617. \u201c[Such] silence . . . is\u2018insolubly ambiguous\u2019because it may constitute a reliance upon those rights rather than a tacit admission that the accused has an insufficient defense or explanation for his conduct.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>197 Conn. 280, 295, 497 A.2d 35 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\"><em>Doyle </em>applies to bar comment on the defendant\u2019s silence in this case even if he was never subjected to a custodial interrogation following his receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>208 Conn. 455, 466, 545 A.2d 1071 (1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1034, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>109 S. Ct. 847, 102 L. Ed. 2d 979 (1989). A <em>Doyle </em>violation may, however, be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and we conclude that such harmlessness has been established in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>204 Conn. 769, 529 A.2d 1283 (1987), the prosecutor asked the defendant why, after a custodial interrogation had ceased, he did not return to the police to correct allegedly false statements he had made during that interrogation. In addition, the prosecutor commented during closing argument about the defendant\u2019s failure to return to the police. We concluded that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">\u201cA <em>Doyle </em>violation may, in a particular case, be so insignificant that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a guilty verdict without the impermissible question or comment upon a defendant\u2019s silence following a <em>Miranda </em>warning. Under such circumstances, the state\u2019s use of a defendant\u2019s postarrest silence does not constitute reversible error. In limited instances, \u2018 \u201c[w]hen there is but a single reference at trial to the fact of [the] defendant\u2019s silence, the reference is neither repeated nor linked with [the] defendant\u2019s exculpatory story, and the exculpatory story is transparently frivolous and evidence of guilt is otherwise overwhelming, the reference to [the] defendant\u2019s silence constitutes harmless error.\u201d <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>547 F.2d 1240, 1250 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 908, 97 S. Ct. 1705, 52 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1977); <em>Leake </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>432 F.2d 982, 984 (4th Cir. 1970). The [error] has similarly been [found to be harmless] where a prosecutor does not focus upon or highlight the defendant\u2019s silence in his cross-examination and closing remarks and where the prosecutor\u2019s comments do not strike at the \u201cjugular\u201d of the defendant\u2019s story. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>[546 F.2d 583, 594 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 432 U.S. 906, 97 S. Ct. 1701, 52 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Ed. 2d 391 (1977)]; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harp, </em>536 F.2d 601, 603 (5th Cir. 1976).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Zeko, </em>177 Conn. 545, 555, 418 A.2d 917 (1979) . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>supra, 781-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">A number of factors lead us to the conclusion that the error in this case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. First, the state charged the defendant as an accessory to the sale of narcotics based upon Gonzalez\u2019 purchase of heroin from Pollard, a completely independent transaction that took place several minutes before the events involving the dropped bag. The dropped bag incident did not establish directly any element of the crime with which the defendant was charged. Second, the colloquy involving the failure to disclose Gumby to the authorities occurred only at one point during trial and was not mentioned thereafter by either the state\u2019s attorney or the trial court. The matter was not argued to the jury. Third, in response to questioning, the defendant denied having remained silent about the bag, thereby diluting, through his own testimony, the insoluble ambiguity that an accused\u2019s silence following <em>Miranda </em>warnings is supposed to generate. Fourth, trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the question concerning Gumby until after redirect examination, in which counsel elected to pursue the same subject, indicates that he did not consider this portion of the cross-examination to have prejudiced the defendant. Moreover, there was no motion for a mistrial. Id., 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Finally, the questioning did not strike at the \u201cjugular\u201d of the accused\u2019s defense. The defendant corroborated through his own testimony and that of his witnesses, Pollard and Massey, exactly those events to which Gonzalez testified including the sale of the heroin. The defendant\u2019s version differed only in his claim that he had not been involved because he had not given the heroin to Pollard but had been merely shak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>ing hands with him as a means of binding the defendant\u2019s commitment to assist in a wallpapering project. It is arguable that the defendant\u2019s credibility on this point was absolutely critical to his defense, and to the extent that the Gumby matter impacted upon his credibility, the line of questioning did strike at the \u201cjugular\u201d of his defense. The defendant\u2019s testimony, however, did not constitute the sole basis for the claims he was making. Rather his testimony was only one piece of a mosaic that included the corroborating testimony of both Pollard and Massey. Thus, for the jurors to have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, as the trial court instructed, it was necessary for them to reject, as not being credible, not only the defendant\u2019s version of what happened but also the version as described by both Massey and Pollard.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">In this connection, we note that the state\u2019s evidence, although not uncontroverted, was certainly very strong. Gonzalez observed the exchange between the defendant and Pollard from a distance of only fifteen feet. Pollard returned directly to the police vehicle while holding the glassine envelope that Gonzalez saw the defendant hand to him, and the notebook recovered from the defendant\u2019s jacket indicated the defendant\u2019s involvement in drug transactions. Furthermore, the defendant does not claim mistaken identity. He admitted \u201cshaking hands\u201d with Pollard in the transaction in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">It is also arguable that a reversal is warranted because in this case it was the court, rather than the prosecutor, that elicited the fact of the defendant\u2019s failure to inform the authorities regarding Gumby. It is true that, in other contexts, we have placed special emphasis upon improper questions posed by the trial court because of their likely impact on the jury. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>198 Conn. 1, 501 A.2d 1195 (1985). Nonetheless, because this one improper ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>tion by the court was isolated; compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>supra (repeated questions by trial court to defendant\u2019s witness); because the question did not focus solely on the defendant\u2019s failure to inform the authorities, and because it was never traded on or emphasized by either the court or the state, this factor alone is insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to its harmlessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">\u201cThe instant case does not present a prosecutorial focus\u2014by repetitive questioning, on a defendant\u2019s silence, as in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra. Nor can we say that the comments, in the context of . . . the cross-examination of the defendant ... so \u2018highlighted\u2019 the defendant\u2019s silence as to constitute prejudicial error .... Similarly, we cannot say that the comments \u2018struck at the jugular\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s defense, as the context of the prosecution\u2019s comments reveals.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Zeko, </em>supra, 555-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">\u201cThe cases wherein the error has been found to be prejudicial disclose repetitive references to the defendant\u2019s silence, reemphasis of the fact on closing argument, and extensive, strongly-worded argument suggesting a connection between the defendant\u2019s silence and his guilt. See, e.g., <em>Minor </em>v. <em>Black, </em>527 F.2d 1 (6th Cir. 1975); <em>Moye </em>v. <em>Paderick, </em>526 F.2d 589 (4th Cir. 1975); <em>Fowle </em>v. <em>United States, </em>410 F.2d 48, 49 n.1 (9th Cir. 1969); cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>576 F.2d 1152, 1155 (5th Cir. 1978).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Zeko, </em>supra, 557. After viewing the challenged questions in the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a guilty verdict without them.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing Gonzalez to offer rebuttal testimony that was, in essence, merely cumulative of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>prior testimony. The specific testimony that the defendant emphasizes concerned Gonzalez\u2019 ability to see the transaction between Pollard and the defendant and their relative positions after Pollard first left Gonzalez\u2019 car. Gonzalez testified that he had been able to see the side of Pollard\u2019s face while Pollard had been talking with the defendant and that he had been able to see clearly the defendant hand the glassine envelope to Pollard. In order to clarify his testimony, Gonzalez physically demonstrated his position relative to Pollard and the defendant during the exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">During the defendant\u2019s case-in-chief, defense counsel questioned Pollard about his interaction with the defendant after speaking with Gonzalez. When Pollard was asked if he had had his back to the car after having talked with Gonzalez, he responded: \u201cYeah. No, like this.\u201d Pollard then also proceeded to give a physical demonstration of his position relative to Gonzalez and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">After the defense rested, the state\u2019s attorney recalled Gonzalez and asked whether Pollard\u2019s statement that he had had his back to Gonzalez had been accurate or whether it was more of a \u201cside to side\u201d view. At this point, defense counsel objected on the grounds that the proposed testimony was not rebuttal but simply cumulative of the witness\u2019 earlier testimony. The trial court overruled the objection. Gonzalez then explained that Pollard\u2019s back had not been facing him because he had clearly been able to see the transaction between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">\u201cRebuttal evidence is usually \u2018confined to testimony which is directed at refuting the evidence given by the defendant\u2019; <em>State </em>v. <em>Addazio, </em>169 Conn. 416, 427, 363 A.2d 153 (1975); or is \u2018in general contradiction of the testimony given by the defendant . . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Fine, </em>159 Conn. 296, 301, 268 A.2d 649 (1970). \u2018The admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>sion of rebuttal evidence is ordinarily within the sound discretion of the trial court. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Nims, </em>180 Conn. 589, 599, 430 A.2d 1306 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Palozie, </em>165 Conn. 288, 299, 334 A.2d 468 (1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Leopold, </em>110 Conn. 55, 67, 147 A.2d 118 (1929).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Lisella, </em>187 Conn. 335, 337, 445 A.2d 922 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em>200 Conn. 113, 123, 509 A.2d 1039 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Gonzalez\u2019 rebuttal testimony tended to refute the inference raised by Pollard\u2019s testimony that Pollard\u2019s back had been facing Gonzalez and that Gonzalez, therefore, could not have seen any alleged transaction between Pollard and the defendant. While Gonzalez had specifically denied during cross-examination that Pollard had had his back to him, the claim that this might have been the case had never been made until Pollard testified. Under these circumstances, it was well within the discretion of the trial court to allow the state to present Gonzalez\u2019 testimony in rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly charged the jury by unfairly marshalling the evidence so as to favor the state while ignoring the evidence favorable to the defendant and that, therefore, he had been deprived of the fundamental constitutional right to a fair trial. \u201cThe purpose of marshalling the evidence, a more elaborate manner of judicial commentary, is \u2018to provide a fair summary of the evidence, and nothing more . . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>218 Conn. 458, 462, 590 A.2d 112 (1991). \u201c \u2018The trial court may, at its discretion, call the attention of the jury to the evidence, or lack of evidence, bearing upon any point in issue and may comment upon the weight of the evidence so long as it does not direct or advise the jury how to decide the matter.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Mullings, </em>166 Conn. 268, 274, 348 A.2d 645 (1974).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>212 Conn. 387, 408, 563 A.2d 646, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 980, 110 S. Ct. 510, 107 L. Ed. 2d 512 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Duffy, </em>57 Conn. 525, 529, 18 A. 791 (1889).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court mentioned most of the state\u2019s testimonial and physical evidence while \u201cnot the slightest allusion was made to the defendant\u2019s theory of defense.\u201d This is simply not true. The defendant\u2019s theory of defense was that he was present at the scene but that he was merely a bystander, that he had no knowledge of what was occurring, and that he was not a participant in the crime. With respect to this specific claim the trial court stated in its charge: \u201cNow evidence of mere presence, whether as on the scene, in the neighborhood, on the street, whether as an inactive companion, as someone who is passive and just acquiesces in what he saw, or the doing of innocent acts which in fact aid in the commission of a crime, is insufficient to find the defendant guilty as an accessory under the statute.\u201d The trial court further charged: \u201cA person must have knowledge that he possessed or had under his control the heroin, the narcotic substance. If he had no knowledge of it whatsoever, he would not have either possession or control and of course he would not be guilty under those circumstances.\u201d Finally, the trial court stated: \u201cNow I would like to get to the presence of this defendant on the street and in the neighborhood in question on that particular date and time. As I\u2019ve told you, the mere presence of the defendant in the vicinity where the transaction is alleged to have occurred is insufficient in and of itself to support a finding of constructive possession.\u201d We find that the defendant\u2019s claim that trial court\u2019s charge did not make the slightest allusion to his theory of defense, is simply not borne out by what the trial court in fact told the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Further, the trial court told the jury that it must independently weigh all the evidence for itself; that the defendant was entitled to a fair and careful consideration of his testimony; that the defendant\u2019s testimony should not be disregarded merely because he had a prior felony conviction; and that, although the defendant\u2019s flight from the scene tended to evidence a consciousness of guilt, it should consider the defendant\u2019s explanation for fleeing, i.e., that he had not done anything wrong by discussing a wallpapering job with Pollard, but ran away anyway because he had been afraid and because his father had told him to stay away from that area of town.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">We conclude that the trial court did not unfairly emphasize the state\u2019s evidence in its charge so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing the defendant\u2019s request to have the handcuffs removed from a defense witness, Willie Massey. The defendant argues that the trial court abdicated its responsibility to rule on the defendant\u2019s request to have the handcuffs removed by completely deferring to the courtroom sheriffs opinion on the matter. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">At the time of the defendant\u2019s trial, Massey was in custody awaiting trial for murder. Outside the presence of the jury, Massey was brought into the courtroom wearing handcuffs and leg irons. The defendant requested that Massey\u2019s handcuffs be removed prior to the return of the jury noting that there were four security guards present and that there had been no showing that he was a dangerous person. In response, the prosecutor replied: \u201cThey don\u2019t know what they\u2019re dealing with.\u201d At this point, the trial court told the sheriff that there had been a request to remove Massey\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>handcuffs. The sheriff responded that the security force had strict rules forbidding the removal of handcuffs in cases such as Massey\u2019s and that he was definitely a security risk. The trial court thereupon found that Massey was a security risk and stated that it would not jeopardize the safety of the people in the courtroom by ordering removal of the handcuffs. The trial court then granted the defendant\u2019s requests that Massey be seated on the witness stand prior to the return of the jury and that the jury be excused before Massey left the stand. There is no clear indication in the record whether the jurors were aware of Massey\u2019s handcuffs as he sat on the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">\u201c[A] defendant\u2019s right to appear before the jury unfettered is not absolute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>[201 Conn. 605, 613, 518 A.2d 1377 (1986)]. A trial court may employ a \u2018reasonable means of restraint\u2019 upon a defendant if, exercising its broad discretion in such matters, the court finds that restraints are \u2018reasonably necessary\u2019 under the circumstances. Practice Book \u00a7 892; see <em>Sekou </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>[216 Conn. 678, 692, 583 A.2d 1277 (1990)]. In reviewing a shackling claim, our task is to determine whether the court\u2019s decision to employ restraints constituted a clear abuse of discretion. . . . In view of the fact that the law enforcement personnel at our courthouses are responsible for and possess superior experience in matters of courtroom security, it is practicable for a court to \u2018 \u201crely heavily\u201d \u2019 upon the advice of such personnel in determining whether a criminal defendant should be restrained. <em>Sekou </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 693; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>[195 Conn. 1, 9, 485 A.2d 570 (1985)]; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Samuel, </em>431 F.2d 610, 615 (4th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 946, 91 S. Ct. 964, 28 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1971). A court may also consider other information not in evidence, including official records, information supplied by correctional officers and attorneys, and \u2018facts gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>erally known within the limits of its jurisdiction.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>supra, 616; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 505-507, 594 A.2d 906 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">We have also held, however, that \u201c[a] record in some fashion disclosing the justification for using restraints ... is essential to meaningful appellate review of a shackling claim.\u201d Id., 506. The bald, unsupported opinions of the prosecutor and the sheriff were the sole basis for the trial court\u2019s order that Massey remain bound hand and foot during his testimony before the jury. When the trial court indicated to the sheriff that defense counsel had requested that Massey\u2019s handcuffs be removed, the sheriff replied: \u201cNo, sir. We have strict rules that this particular case, cases such as this, that we do not.\u201d The trial court never asked the sheriff to explain what the set of \u201ccases such as this\u201d included and what it was about Massey that made him belong to that set of cases. Because the trial court never elicited the basis of the sheriffs opinion, \u201cthe court not only denied the defendant a meaningful opportunity to respond to that information, but also rendered the record inadequate for our review of its decision to restrain [the witness]. The record, moreover, does not otherwise evince the requisite reasonable necessity for restraints.\u201d Id., 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">\u201cThe negative connotations of restraints, nevertheless, are without significance unless the fact of the restraints comes to the attention of the jury.\u201d Id., 508. The defendant failed to show that the jury ever saw the handcuffs and that he was thereby prejudiced by the ruling. Id., 508-509; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>supra, 617 n.5. Any impropriety was, therefore, harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly refused to. declare a mistrial as a result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>state\u2019s attorney\u2019s reference in closing argument to the absence at trial of two defense witnesses, Alice Brick-house and Gumby. The state\u2019s attorney neither sought nor obtained an advance ruling from the trial court prior to making the remarks concerning the missing witnesses, contrary to the holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>180 Conn. 101, 429 A.2d 813 (1980).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">An examination of the record discloses that the defendant testified that an entry in the notebook found in his jacket, \u201cStevie, two bags,\u201d had referred to someone who had given the defendant two bags of marihuana to pay a debt. The defendant further explained that he had thereafter given the marihuana to a woman named Alice Brickhouse. During closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney recounted the defendant\u2019s testimony regarding the marihuana and then remarked: \u201cI didn\u2019t see that lady here testifying about [how] she received the bags of marihuana.\u201d With reference to the dropped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>bag of cocaine, the prosecutor said: \u201cI have not seen Mr. Gumby or heard from Mr. Gumby in this case.\u201d \u201cThe effect of those remarks was to suggest to the jury that it might draw the inference that any testimony by the missing witnesses would have been unfavorable to the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>197 Conn. 677, 680, 500 A.2d 1330 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">A trial court has broad discretion in ruling on motions for a mistrial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Weinberg, </em>215 Conn. 231, 249, 575 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 967, 111 S. Ct. 430, 112 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1990). \u201cA motion for a mistrial is a drastic remedy, granted only when some event has occurred that is so prejudicial it precludes a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>215 Conn. 716, 732, 579 A.2d 9 (1990).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>24 Conn. App. 678, 684, 591 A.2d 445 (1991), aff'd, 221 Conn. 518, 605 A.2d 1359 (1992). The ultimate question on such motions is whether there was \u201csubstantial and irreparable prejudice to the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 887. Otherwise stated, the question is \u201cwhether the claimed erroneous action of the [trial] court would have been likely to affect the result.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McClain, </em>171 Conn. 293, 300, 370 A.2d 928 (1976). \u201cDue process seeks to assure a defendant a fair trial, not a perfect one.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 565, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982). We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s references to the missing witnesses did not cause the \u201csubstantial and irreparable prejudice\u201d necessary to compel the drastic remedy of a mistrial, and that under the circumstances of this case, any error was harmless. \u201cIn doing so we have viewed the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comments in the context of the entire trial and the instructions that guided the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>supra, 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The testimony of Brickhouse, if offered and favorable to the defendant, would only have corroborated the defendant\u2019s testimony concerning a single entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>in his notebook. The matter of the meaning of this single entry was only marginally related to the offense charged and shed little light on the defendant\u2019s claim that he was simply a bystander during a crime that his own witness, Pollard, agreed had taken place in the defendant\u2019s presence. Similarly, Gumby\u2019s testimony that it was he who had dropped the bag would have been cumulative of Massey\u2019s testimony to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The defendant\u2019s failure to propose the alternative of a curative instruction further undercuts his claim that the trial court abused its discretion in rejecting a mistrial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lucci, </em>25 Conn. App. 334, 348, 595 A.2d 361, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 913, 597 A.2d 336 (1991). The defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court would have denied a request for a curative instruction is pure conjecture. He cannot succeed in showing harmful error by speculating that an alternative he failed to propose might have been rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">In this opinion Peters, C.

I disagree with part I of the majority opinion. The majority concedes that the trial court violated the holding of <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976), when it permitted the state to impeach the defendant by calling attention to his silence after receiving the warnings required by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), and when that court later itself attacked the defendant\u2019s credibility in the same way. The majority claims, however, that even though the defendant\u2019s credibility was crucial to his defense, the error was harmless. This result is reached only by ignoring the undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>The majority asserts that \u201cthe colloquy involving the failure to disclose Gumby to the authorities occurred only at one point during trial and was not mentioned thereafter by either the state\u2019s attorney or the trial court.\u201d Thus, they argue that this case is governed by those authorities that hold that reference to the defendant\u2019s silence can be harmless error when \u201cthere is but a single reference at trial to the fact of [the] defendant\u2019s silence [and] the reference is neither repeated nor linked with the defendant\u2019s exculpatory story . . . .\u201d <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>547 F.2d 1240, 1250 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 908, 97 S. Ct. 1705, 52 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>204 Conn. 769, 781, 529 A.2d 1283 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">In fact, however, there were two distinct episodes in which the state or the court referred to the defendant\u2019s silence and thereby impeached his credibility. The first reference was made by the state\u2019s attorney during cross-examination, and the second was made by the trial court during recross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">During cross-examination, while discussing the defendant\u2019s account of how Gumby had dropped the bag, the prosecutor asked, \u201cWhy did you wait until today to get this out?\u201d The import of this question was obviously that the defendant should have told the authorities his story before trial and that his failure to do so reflected unfavorably on his credibility. The first <em>Doyle </em>violation was complete as soon as the question was asked, and was compounded by the subsequent line of questioning, which focused on the defendant\u2019s postarrest silence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The defendant\u2019s testimony on cross-examination soon moved on to other matters, including the defendant\u2019s own personal use of illegal drugs and his previous con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>versations with Willie Massey, who corroborated his testimony. Redirect examination then was conducted by defense counsel, who elicited testimony from the defendant concerning the entries in his notebook, his conversations with his alleged accomplice, Hugh Pollard, and the reason why the defendant had run from the police at the time of his arrest. Defense counsel, obviously concerned about the damage to the defendant\u2019s credibility caused by the reference to his postarrest silence, then raised that issue again by asking why the defendant had not told him or the police about Gumby, and elicited testimony that the police had never questioned the defendant. Thereafter, testimony ranged over several other topics.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">When recross-examination began, the state\u2019s attorney asked the defendant about several unrelated topics before returning to the issue of whom the defendant had or had not told about Gumby. At that point, for the first time, the defense attorney raised the issue of attorney-client privilege. There then followed a lengthy argument between the attorneys, in the presence of the jury, about the scope of that privilege and whether it applied to the defendant\u2019s alleged failure to tell his attorney about Gumby. This argument itself further focused the jury\u2019s attention on the defendant\u2019s silence about Gumby. Thereafter, questioning resumed. In the middle of that questioning, the trial court interrupted and stated: \u201cOne moment, please. Something else just occurred to me here. It\u2019s not just why didn\u2019t you tell your attorney. <em>The real question is why didn\u2019t you tell the </em>authorities\u2014same question\u2014and then we don\u2019t get at all to this question of violating the attorney-client privilege; but, in either event, you did neither, is that correct?\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">I do not understand how these two incidents, separated by a long period of time, covering nearly thirty transcript pages, during which testimony was taken on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>a number of unrelated topics, can be deemed to have occurred during the same \u201cpoint\u201d of a trial. Whatever the meaning of the court\u2019s new \u201cone point during trial\u201d standard, it is clearly a dramatic departure from the cases on which the court purports to rely, in which there actually, not metaphorically, was \u201cbut a single reference at trial to the fact of defendant\u2019s silence.\u201d Compare <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 1249 (\u201cin the case at bar the prosecutor asked one question eliciting the fact of Chapman\u2019s silence, and that fact was never alluded to again\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>supra, 784 (\u201conly a single question by the prosecutor, a nonresponsive repetitive response by the defendant, and an ambiguous passing comment in the state\u2019s closing argument\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Zeko, </em>177 Conn. 545, 556, 418 A.2d 917 (1979) (\u201csingle comment by the prosecution\u2019s rebuttal witness that the defendant had not given a statement following arrest, with no attempt then or in closing argument to suggest that the jury draw an implication of guilt from silence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Moreover, the second <em>Doyle </em>violation was particularly egregious because it was the trial court that interrupted the prosecutor\u2019s questioning and brought the issue of the defendant\u2019s silence with respect to the authorities to the attention of the jury. As the majority acknowledges, we have often noted that comments of the trial court carry special weight with the jury. Taken in context, the trial court\u2019s improper question was hardly \u201cisolated,\u201d as the majority claims. Nor is it the case that the question \u201cdid not focus solely on the defendant\u2019s failure to inform the authorities.\u201d The defendant\u2019s failure to inform the authorities was precisely what the trial court\u2019s question concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The majority concedes that \u201c[i]t is arguable that the defendant\u2019s credibility . . . was absolutely critical to his defense, and to the extent that the Gumby matter impacted upon his credibility, the line of questioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>did strike at the \u2018jugular\u2019 of his defense.\u201d This, however, understates the damage done to the defendant by the constitutional violation. Although it is true that the dropped bag incident \u201cdid not establish directly any element of the crime with which the defendant was charged,\u201d the state\u2019s version of that incident, if believed, strongly supported the case against the defendant. The state\u2019s theory of the case was that the defendant had acted as the warehouse from which the retailer, Pollard, had taken the drugs during the individual sale. That theory would have been weakened if, at the time of his arrest shortly afterward, the defendant had had no drugs in his possession. It would likewise have been greatly strengthened if the defendant could be shown to have had in his possession the twelve vials of crack cocaine that were found in the brown bag. In this context, the trial court most assuredly did strike at the \u201cjugular\u201d of the defendant\u2019s story when, in the middle of the defendant\u2019s testimony, it interjected a question indicating that there was something suspicious about the defendant\u2019s failure to tell the authorities about the brown bag. The Gumby issue was not only about credibility. It went to the heart of the prosecution\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The defendant\u2019s postarrest silence was not reemphasized by the prosecution on closing argument, but this is not essential for a harmful <em>Doyle </em>error. The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, is inapposite, because in this case the reference to the defendant\u2019s silence was \u201crepeated [and] linked with [the] defendant\u2019s exculpatory story,\u201d the exculpatory story was not \u201ctransparently frivolous,\u201d and evidence of guilt was not \u201coverwhelming.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>In this case, the fact of the defendant\u2019s silence was not merely elicited in passing by the prosecutor. On the contrary, both the prosecutor and the trial court directly linked the fact of the defendant\u2019s silence to his exculpatory story, and used it expressly to cast doubt upon that story.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The defendant\u2019s exculpatory story is less frivolous than the majority opinion makes it appear. The majority opinion reports that his claim was that he \u201chad never given Pollard a glassine envelope, but had been simply shaking hands with him after making an agreement to wallpaper several rooms in Pollard\u2019s mother\u2019s house.\u201d On first blush, such a claim would appear implausible. As the state\u2019s attorney observed while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>cross-examining Pollard, it would be \u201ckind of odd\u201d for Pollard to interrupt a drug transaction in order to talk to the defendant about a completely unrelated matter. Pollard explained, however, that after speaking with the defendant, he had planned to get into Gonzalez\u2019 car and ask him to drive around the block while completing the sale, and that he had hoped to persuade Gonzalez to drive him to another location. The reason for interrupting the transaction thus was that Pollard expected to be leaving the area and wanted to conclude his business with the defendant before doing so. Pollard did in fact enter Gonzalez\u2019 car after speaking with the defendant, and was in fact driven around the block. The question of whether or not this story should be believed is one for the jury, not for this court. I cannot say that it is \u201ctransparently frivolous\u201d or \u201ctotally implausible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Also I cannot agree with the court\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe state\u2019s evidence, although not uncontroverted, was certainly very strong.\u201d This case is already a remarkable dilution of the prior requirement for harmless error. In other cases in which we have found harmless <em>Doyle </em>error, we followed the requirement of <em>Chapman </em>by specifically holding that the indicia of guilt were \u201coverwhelming.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Shashaty, </em>205 Conn. 39, 51, 529 A.2d 1308 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1027, 108 S. Ct. 753, 98 L. Ed. 2d 766 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>supra, 784; <em>State </em>v. <em>Zeko, </em>supra, 556; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>210 Conn. 481, 493-94, 556 A.2d 154 (1989) (not citing <em>Chapman, </em>but finding evidence of guilt \u201coverwhelming\u201d). In this case, moreover, even the \u201cvery strong\u201d characterization exaggerates the state\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The state\u2019s case rested almost entirely on the veracity and accurate perception and recollection of a single witness, Gonzalez. His testimony was contradicted by that of three witnesses: Massey, Pollard, and the defendant. Moreover, as the majority opinion acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>edges, there was testimony to the effect that it was physically impossible for Gonzalez to have seen the defendant hand drugs to Pollard. The court clearly does not mean to cast doubt on the well established rule that \u201c[t]he testimony of a police officer is entitled to no special or exclusive sanctity merely because it comes from a police officer.\u201d 5 D. Borden &amp; L. Orland, Connecticut Criminal Jury Instructions (1986) \u00a7 3.11; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>172 Conn. 223, 228, 374 A.2d 203 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Even if we assume that Gonzalez was telling the truth, he may have been mistaken. He might well have assumed that the only reason Pollard would have for interrupting the transaction would be to obtain drugs from the defendant. The alternative explanation offered by the defendant and Pollard is plausible, but is unlikely to have occurred to Gonzalez. In the seconds that ensued, Gonzalez might well have believed he saw drugs being passed, when in fact all that was happening was that Pollard and the defendant were shaking hands. Perception is tricky, and we often see what we expected to see, and afterward hold an unshakeable conviction that that is what we saw. A jury that had not been prejudiced by unconstitutional considerations may very well have believed the defendant and his two corroborating witnesses instead of Gonzalez. \u201cThe story told by [the defendant] was plausible, and, if believed by the jury, should have led to an acquittal. Because the nature of a <em>Doyle </em>[violation] is so egregious and so inherently prejudicial, reversal is the norm rather than the exception.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Zahradnick, </em>632 F.2d 353, 363 (4th Cir. 1980). In this case, having to choose which set of witnesses to believe, \u201c[t]he jury may well have sought to buttress the [state\u2019s] evidence with the testimony concerning [the defendant\u2019s] silence and whatever inferences could be drawn from it.\u201d <em>Rudolph </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>478 F. Sup. 849, 852 (E.D. Wis. 1979). I cannot con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>elude that there is no reasonable possibility that the repeated references to the defendant\u2019s silence, by both the prosecutor and the trial court, might have contributed to the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">I would reverse and order a new trial. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\"> The subsequent line of questioning appears in footnote 3 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b749-5\"> In our earlier cases considering whether a violation of <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976), had occurred, we frequently quoted the following sentence from <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>547 F.2d 1240, 1250 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 908, 97 S. Ct. 1705, 52 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 393 (1977): \u201cWhen there is but a single reference at trial to the fact of [the] defendant\u2019s silence, the reference is neither repeated nor linked with [the] defendant\u2019s exculpatory story, and the exculpatory story is transparently frivolous and evidence of guilt is otherwise overwhelming, the reference to [the] defendant\u2019s silence constitutes harmless error.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Shashaty, </em>205 Conn. 39, 46-47, 529 A.2d 1308 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1027, 108 S. Ct. 753, 98 L. Ed. 2d 766 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>204 Conn. 769, 782, 529 A.2d 1283 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pellegrino, </em>194 Conn. 279, 292, 480 A.2d 537 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>179 Conn. 328, 336, 426 A.2d 298 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Zeko, </em>177 Conn. 545, 555, 418 A.2d 917 (1979). While that quotation, taken out of context, was not misleading in those cases, it is, however, misleading in the present case. It is preceded by the following two sentences in the original, which make it clear that <em>Chapman </em>would require us to find harmful error in this case: \u201cWhen the prosecution uses [the] defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence to impeach an exculpatory story offered by [the] defendant at trial and the prosecution directly links the implausibility of the exculpatory story to the defendant\u2019s ostensibly inconsistent act of remaining silent, reversible error results even if the story is transparently frivolous. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Luna, </em>539 F.2d 417 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harp, </em>[536 F.2d 601 (5th Cir. 1976)].</p>\n<p id=\"A90\">\u201cWhen the prosecutor does not directly tie the fact of [the] defendant\u2019s silence to his exculpatory story, i.e., when the prosecutor elicits that fact on direct examination and refrains from commenting on it or adverting to it again, and the jury is never told that such silence can be used for impeachment purposes, reversible error results if the exculpatory story is not totally implausible or the indicia of guilt not overwhelming. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Impson, </em>[531 F.2d 274, reh. denied, 535 F.2d 286 (5th Cir. 1976)].\u201d <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 1249.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
