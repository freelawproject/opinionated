J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARJ\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether an exclusion clause in a liquor seller liability insurance policy is sufficiently ambiguous so that it should be read to provide coverage for damages caused by an assault and battery by an intoxicated patron. The defendants, Americo Figueiredo, permittee of the Madison Cafe in Hartford, and its backer, Tomar, Inc., (the insured) sought to implead the Calvert Insurance Company (Calvert) as a third party defendant in a civil action brought against the insured by the plaintiff, Daniel J. Kelly. Calvert filed a motion to strike the third party complaint, which was granted by the trial court, <em>Stengel, J. </em>The trial court, <em>M. Hennessey, J., </em>subsequently rendered judgment in favor of Calvert on the third party complaint. The insured appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the matter to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s judgment following the granting of Calvert\u2019s motion to strike, we \u201cmust take the facts to be those alleged in the [third party] plaintiff\u2019s complaint and construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency.\u201d <em>Michaud </em>v. <em>Wawruck, </em>209 Conn. 407, 408, 551 A.2d 738 (1988); <em>Blancato </em>v. <em>Feldspar Corporation, </em>203 Conn. 34, 36, 522 A.2d 1235 (1987). Accordingly, we assume the following facts as alleged in the insured\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>third party complaint. In January, 1990, Calvert issued to the insured a liquor seller liability insurance policy, effective from January 5, 1990, to January 5, 1991. Under the policy, Calvert agreed to pay damages and to provide the services of defense counsel if the insured were charged with liability under the Connecticut Liquor Control Act, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a730-1 through 30-113, for injuries sustained by any person as a result of the alleged selling or giving of any alcoholic beverage at the Madison Cafe. The policy included the following exclusionary endorsement: \u201cassault and battery exclusion: It is agreed that the insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage arising out of assault and battery or out of any act or omission in connection with the prevention or suppression of such acts, whether caused by or at the instigation or direction of the insured, his employees, patrons or any other person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">On January 14, 1991, Daniel J. Kelly filed a substitute complaint against the insured, pursuant to the Connecticut Dram Shop Act, General Statutes \u00a7 30-102.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kelly alleged that he had sustained injuries on May 22, 1990, when he was struck and stabbed by a Madison Cafe patron to whom the insured had sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>alcohol while that patron was intoxicated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint did not allege that the patron who had struck Kelly was attempting to prevent or suppress an assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">On June 13, 1991, the insured filed a revised third party complaint against Calvert, seeking to force Calvert to defend the insured against Kelly\u2019s claim and to indemnify it in case of any liability. Thereafter, Calvert successfully moved to strike the third party complaint on the ground that the policy\u2019s assault and battery exclusion relieved Calvert of any obligation to defend or indemnify the insured in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The insured appealed from the ensuing judgment in favor of Calvert, raising the following three claims: (1) the exclusion clause in Calvert\u2019s liquor seller liability insurance policy, properly construed, does not exclude coverage for the assault and battery alleged by Kelly; (2) the exclusion clause should be construed in favor of coverage because the clause is ambiguous; and (3) public policy considerations require a construction of the exclusion clause to permit coverage for Kelly\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">The insured maintains first that the assault and battery exclusion clause by its own terms \u201cplainly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>clearly\u201d imposes liability on Calvert for the dram shop claim raised by Kelly. Specifically, the insured asserts that the clause at issue excludes coverage not for generic assaults and batteries, but only for assaults and batteries taking place \u201cin connection with the prevention or suppression of\u201d other assaults and batteries. Calvert argues, on the other hand, that the exclusion clause applies to all assaults and batteries. We agree with Calvert\u2019s interpretation of the exclusion clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Deciding the scope of the exclusion clause \u201cinvolves a determination of what coverage the insured expected to receive and what coverage the insurer expected to provide as disclosed by the language of the policy.\u201d <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Bulaong, </em>218 Conn. 51, 60, 588 A.2d 138 (1991); <em>Hammer </em>v. <em>Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>214 Conn. 573, 583, 573 A.2d 699 (1990); <em>Marcolini </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>160 Conn. 280, 283, 278 A.2d 796 (1971). The words of the policy must be accorded their natural and ordinary meaning. <em>Hammer </em>v. <em>Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>supra. \u201c[C]ourts cannot indulge in a forced construction ignoring provisions or so distorting them as to accord a meaning other than that evidently intended by the parties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The exclusion clause provides in relevant part: \u201c[T]he insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage arising out of assault and battery or out of any act or omission in connection with the prevention or suppression of such acts . . . .\u201d The insured maintains that the prepositional phrase, \u201cin connection with the prevention or suppression of such acts,\u201d modifies both \u201cassault and battery\u201d and \u201cany act or omission.\u201d It argues, therefore, that assaults and batteries are excluded from coverage only when committed in the prevention or suppression of other assaults and batteries.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>The repetition of the words \u201cout of\u201d before \u201cassault and battery\u201d and before \u201cany act or omission\u201d forecloses the insured\u2019s construction of the clause. If we were to adopt that interpretation, the second use of \u201cout of\u201d would be rendered superfluous. \u201cIf it is reasonably possible to do so, every provision of an insurance policy must be given operative effect.\u201d <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>219 Conn. 371, 376, 593 A.2d 498 (1991); <em>A. M. Larson Co. </em>v. <em>Lawlor Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>153 Conn. 618, 621-22, 220 A.2d 32 (1966). The policy therefore does not \u201cplainly and clearly\u201d provide coverage to the insured on Kelly\u2019s assault and battery claim. Cf. <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Western World Ins. Co., </em>481 So. 2d 878, 881 (Ala. 1985) (construing an identical exclusion clause and stating that the clause applies to assaults and batteries); <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>Illinois Founders Ins. Co., </em>84 Ill. 2d 365, 371, 418 N.E.2d 744 (1981) (construing an identical exclusion clause and stating that \u201c[i]t is clear that, under the policy, acts constituting battery are excluded\u201d from coverage). On its face, the exclusion clause does not cover Kelly\u2019s claim against the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The insured next claims, in the alternative, that even if the policy does not clearly include coverage for assaults and batteries, the exclusion clause is at least ambiguous and therefore must be construed against Calvert, the drafter of the policy. The insured asserts that the exclusion clause\u2019s ambiguity is apparent because the parties contend for different interpretations of its language. We hold, however, that the exclusion clause unambiguously relieves Calvert of any obligation to defend or indemnify the insured in connection with Kelly\u2019s dram shop claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Under well established principles of contract construction, we must \u201cconstrue the terms of an insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>policy in favor of insurance coverage because it is the insurance company that has drafted the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 375; see also <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>205 Conn. 246, 250, 532 A.2d 1297 (1987); <em>LaBonte </em>v. <em>Federal Mutual Ins. Co., </em>159 Conn. 252, 256, 268 A.2d 663 (1970). \u201cA necessary predicate to this rule of construction, however, is a determination that the terms of the insurance policy are indeed ambiguous.\u201d <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 375. The fact that the parties advocate different meanings of the exclusion clause \u201cdoes not necessitate a conclusion that the language is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Bulaong, </em>supra, 60; <em>Marcolini </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 284; compare <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 251 (finding ambiguity in an insurance policy where two plausible alternate readings were equally reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The exclusion clause is not ambiguous. The words at issue do not have multiple definitions. See <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 251 (finding the word \u201ccollapse\u201d ambiguous as used in an insurance policy because it may mean \u201ca catastrophic breakdown\u201d or \u201ca breakdown or loss of structural strength\u201d). We can say with a high degree of certainty that the exclusion clause was intended to exclude all assaults and batteries from coverage. See <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Union Labor Life Ins. Co., </em>186 Conn. 507, 514, 442 A.2d 920 (1982) (finding ambiguity where \u201cwe cannot say with any degree of certainty [what the clause] was intended to exclude\u201d). The exclusion clause therefore unambiguously relieves Calvert of any obligation to defend or indemnify the insured in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Finally, the insured claims that the exclusion clause should not be read to exclude assaults and batteries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>from coverage because of \u201cthe public policy goal of assuring that the innocent victims of injuries caused by intoxicated persons be able to recover compensation for those injuries.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The legislature enacted \u00a7 30-102, the Dram Shop Act, in 1933, thereby creating a cause of action against liquor sellers for victims injured by intoxicated persons to whom the liquor sellers have served alcohol. The common law did not allow such a cause of action because the intoxicated person\u2019s consumption of alcohol was held to constitute a break in the causal chain between the liquor seller and the victim. <em>Ely </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>207 Conn. 88, 92-93, 540 A.2d 54 (1988); <em>Kowal </em>v. <em>Hofher, </em>181 Conn. 355, 357-58, 436 A.2d 1 (1980). In enacting \u00a7 30-102 and abrogating the common law bar to a cause of action, the legislature thus allowed some measure of recovery to victims of acts of intoxicated persons. <em>Kowal </em>v. <em>Hofher, </em>supra, 358. The legislature, however, did not require liquor sellers to maintain any level of insurance coverage for potential dram shop liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">To discern the public policy underlying the Dram Shop Act, it is useful to compare the legislature\u2019s enactment of \u00a7 30-102 with its actions regarding motor vehicle liability insurance. General Statutes \u00a7 14-12b<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>requires that all motor vehicles registered in Connecticut carry automobile liability insurance. Additionally, General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requires all such policies to include uninsured motorist coverage, which ensures the protection of insured motorists who are legally entitled to recover damages for bodily injuries from uninsured or underinsured motorists. <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 377, citing <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 249, 449 A.2d 157 (1982); <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number><em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 197, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). \u201cThe \u2018public policy\u2019 embodied in [\u00a7 38a-336] is simply to ensure that a motorist injured by another motorist has at least $20,000 in coverage available.\u201d <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>171 Conn. 463, 474, 370 A.2d 1011 (1976); see also <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">In contrast, the Dram Shop Act evinces no intent by the legislature to ensure a minimum amount of coverage; the statute merely creates a cause of action that was unavailable at common law. Although the legislature is free to require liquor sellers to maintain liability insurance for their potential dram shop liability, just as it has required motor vehicle coverage, the legislature has not done so. We, therefore, reject the insured\u2019s suggestion that the public policy that underlies \u00a7 30-102 must override the plain meaning of the exclusion clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Absent any general public policy that would prohibit the operation of the assault and battery exclusion in the insured\u2019s liquor seller liability insurance policy, the insured\u2019s \u201cpublic policy\u201d claim devolves into an argument that we should read the ambiguous language of the exclusion clause narrowly in order to further the goal of protecting innocent victims from the harmful acts of intoxicated persons. Because we have decided in Part II, supra, that the language of the exclusion clause unambiguously relieves Calvert of any obligations on Kelly\u2019s claim, the insured\u2019s public policy argument must fail.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 30-102. dram shop act; liquor seller liable for DAMAGE BY intoxicated PERSON. If any person, by himself or Ms agent, sells any alcoholic liquor to an intoxicated person, and such purchaser, in consequence of such intoxication, thereafter injures the person or property of another, such seller shall pay just damages to the person injured, up to the amount of twenty thousand dollars, or to persons injured in consequence of such intoxication up to an aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars, to be recovered in an action under this section, provided the aggrieved person or persons shall give written notice to such seller within sixty days of the occurrence of such injury to person or property of Ms or their intention to bring an action under this section.

This second claim does not arise under the Liquor Control Act, and, therefore, the insurance policy at issue does not apply to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b60-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-12b provides in pertinent part: \u201cmotor vehicle REGISTRATION NOT TO BE ISSUED WITHOUT PRESENTATION OF NO-FAULT identification card or policy. ...
