The defendant insured, Jill E. Huntley, was seriously injured when her car was struck by an automobile operated by Michael R. Panus. After he had exhausted the limits of his liability policy, Panus personally paid the defendant the sum of $50,000 pursuant to a settlement agreement. The defendant\u2019s insurer, the plaintiff, Lumbermens Mutual Casualty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Company, sought credit for the payment in the form of a reduction of its liability for underinsured motorist coverage. This appeal follows the trial court\u2019s confirmation of the arbitration panel\u2019s award in favor of the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The parties agreed to the following facts. On May 25, 1989, the defendant was driving home when an automobile driven by Panus crossed over into her lane and struck her vehicle head-on. On April 18, 1991, in her suit against Panus, the trial court rendered a judgment of $1,000,000 in favor of the defendant. Panus was insured by Allstate Insurance Company, which paid the full $100,000 limit of its policy to the defendant. Panus, himself, then paid an additional $50,000 to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The defendant\u2019s underinsured motorist policy issued by the plaintiff provided coverage up to $300,000. Following Panus\u2019 personal payment, a dispute arose between the defendant and the plaintiff as to whether the plaintiff could reduce its liability to the defendant by $50,000, the amount of the tortfeasor\u2019s personal payment, in addition to the $100,000 reduction for the amount paid by the tortfeasor\u2019s liability carrier. The defendant\u2019s insurance policy provided: \u201cAny amounts otherwise payable for damages under this [underinsured] coverage shall be reduced by all sums: 1. Paid because of the \u2018bodily injury\u2019 by or on behalf of persons or organizations who may be legally responsible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Pursuant to the terms of the policy, the parties submitted to arbitration the sole legal issue of whether General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175c, now reorganized and recodified as General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (b) and (d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>and \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) (1) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> permit the plaintiff to reduce its coverage by the $50,000 paid by the tortfeasor. The parties stipulated to the fact that the tortfeasor had personally paid the sum of $50,000 to the defendant. In a split decision, the arbitrators decided that the plaintiff was not entitled to deduct the $50,000 payment by the tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The trial court denied the plaintiffs application to vacate the arbitrators\u2019 award. Relying on <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 530 A.2d 171 (1987),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial court concluded that the plaintiff could not take credit for the tortfeasor\u2019s payment because it was a personal payment, not a payment made by his automobile insurance liability carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly upheld the arbitrators\u2019 decision that the tortfeasor\u2019s personal payment could not be deducted from its payment of underinsured motorist coverage to the defendant. The plaintiff argues that the setoff of the tortfeasor\u2019s payment is warranted both by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) of the regulations, which specifically permits \u201creduction of limits to the extent that damages have been . . . paid by or on behalf of any person responsible for the injury,\u201d and by the defendant\u2019s insurance policy, which requires reduction of all sums paid \u201cby or on behalf of persons or organizations who may be legally responsible.\u201d We agree with the plaintiff that an underinsured motorist carrier may limit its liability by taking credit for a tortfeasor\u2019s personal payment to the insured, and we reverse the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In reviewing compulsory arbitration cases, this court must conduct a de novo review of the arbitrators\u2019 interpretation and application of the law. <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>supra, 191. The defendant argues that \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) (1) of the regulations, to the extent that it allows for the setoff, is inconsistent with the language and intent of \u00a7 38-175c (b) (1), which requires an insurance carrier to pay its insured \u201cafter the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds or insurance policies . . . have been exhausted . . . .\u201d The defendant contends that the legislature, in amending \u00a7 38-175c to include subsection (b) (1), impliedly repealed \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) (1) of the regulations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">We begin our analysis with the history and relationship between \u00a7 38-175c and \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) (1) of the regulations. Section 38-175C, which provides that all automobile liability policies must include uninsured motorist coverage, was first enacted in 1967 and did not prohibit the reduction of uninsured motorist cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>age by the amount of a tortfeasor\u2019s personal payment. Public Acts 1967, No. 510. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38-175a,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the insurance commissioner adopted regulations, effective January 1, 1968, which provide in pertinent part: \u201c[The automobile liability insurance] policy may provide for the reduction of limits to the extent that damages have been . . . paid by or on behalf of any person responsible for the injury . . . .\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) <em>(1);</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Darrow, </em>161 Conn. 169, 286 A.2d 288 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In 1979, \u00a7 38-175c was amended to include subsection (b) (1), which requires an insurance carrier to provide underinsured motorist coverage \u201cafter the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds or insurance policies . . . have been exhausted . . . .\u201d The legislative history indicates that \u00a7 38-175e was amended solely for the purpose of providing underinsured motorist coverage. Public Acts 1979, No. 79-235; 22 S. Proc., Pt. 5,1979 Sess., p. 1354; 22 H.R. Proc., Pt. 16,1979 Sess., p. 5341.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The regulations that apply to uninsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>motorist coverage also apply to underinsured motorist coverage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In 1983, \u00a7 38-175c was amended further to require that underinsured motorist coverage equal liability coverage. Public Acts 1983, No. 83-461. Neither amendment, in 1979 or in 1983, prohibited the setoff of a tortfeasor\u2019s personal payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">With this background in mind, we approach the issue of whether the plaintiff is entitled to a credit for the tortfeasor\u2019s payment. First, as we noted above, the sole reason for amending \u00a7 38-175c to include subsection (b) (1) was to provide for underinsured motorist coverage and not to prohibit an insurance carrier from reducing underinsured motorist coverage when appropriate. The obvious purpose of the language of \u00a7 38-175c (b) (1) on which the defendant relies\u2014namely, that the insurer must pay its insured \u201cafter the limits of liability . . . have been exhausted\u201d\u2014is to trigger the point at which the underinsured motorist policy takes effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Second, although this is a question of first impression, our conclusion that an underinsured motorist carrier may limit its liability by taking credit for a tortfeasor\u2019s personal payment to the insured is supported by our previous analysis and interpretation of both General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c and \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) of the regulations. In <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 532, 538-39, 569 A.2d 40, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 814, 111 S. Ct. 52, 112 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1990),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>mined that \u00a7 38-175a-6 of the regulations, which also allows setoffs for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, is consistent with the coverage requirements of \u00a7 38-175c, the statute at issue in the present case. We also observed that General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c \u201cdoes not require that uninsured motorist coverage be made available when the insured has been otherwise protected ... or when the uninsured motorist has other resources available to protect the insured. Nor does the statute provide that the uninsured motorist coverage shall stand as an independent source of recovery for the insured, <em>or that the coverage limits shall not be reduced under appropriate circumstances. . . . Roy </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>171 Conn. 463, 472-73, 370 A.2d 1011 (1976).\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>supra, 538. We further noted that \u201c[s]ection 38-175c does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>specifically prohibit the adoption of a regulation permitting the reduction of uninsured motorist coverage, whereas \u00a7 38-175a explicitly authorizes the commission to adopt regulations relating to the insuring agreements, exclusions, conditions and other terms applicable to . . . uninsured motorists coverages.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Here, as in <em>Wilson, </em>we conclude that \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) (1) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which allows the setoff of a tortfeasor\u2019s personal payment, is consistent with the coverage requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Furthermore, the legislature is presumed to be aware of the judicial construction placed upon its enactments. <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>187 Conn. 386, 395 n.7, 446 A.2d 1059 (1982).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since 1979, when underinsured motorist coverage was mandated, \u00a7 38-175c has been amended five times, yet, the legislature has never taken action to prohibit an underinsured motorist carrier from reducing payment to its insured in accordance with the regulations. We can find nothing to support the claim that the legislature intended a contrary construction of the statute. We hold that an uninsured motorist carrier may limit its liability by taking credit for a payment made by a tortfeasor to the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with the direction to grant the application to vacate the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-8\"> The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b46-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175c, now reorganized and recodified as General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (b) and (d), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADV\">\u201c(a) Every [automobile liability insurance] policy shall provide insurance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>herein called uninsured motorist coverage ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apr\">\u201c(b) (1) An insurance company shall be obligated to make payment to its insured up to the limits of the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage after the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds or insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident have been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements, but in no event shall the total amount of recovery from all policies, including any amount recovered under the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage, exceed the limits of the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP8\">\u201c(2) For the purposes of this section, an \u2018underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 means a motor vehicle with respect to which the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident is less than the applicable limits of liability under the uninsured motorist portion of the policy against which claim is made under subdivision (1) of this subsection.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b47-10\"> Section 38-175a-6 (d) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides in pertinent part that an insurance policy \u201cmay provide for the reduction of limits to the extent that damages have been (1) paid by or on behalf of any person responsible for the injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b47-11\"> See footnote 10, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b48-7\"> The defendant also claims that if the plaintiff is entitled to reduce its payment to her by the amount of the tortfeasor\u2019s payment, the plaintiff should be allowed credit for the tortfeasor\u2019s cash payment of $31,000 only, and not for his promissory note of $19,000. The record clearly indicates, however, that both parties stipulated to the fact that the tortfeasor had <em>paid </em>the sum of $50,000 to the defendant. Having never submitted this issue of fact for arbitration, the defendant cannot raise the issue for the first time on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b49-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175a, now reorganized and recodified as General Statutes \u00a7 38a-334, provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe insurance commissioner shall adopt regulations with respect to minimum provisions to be included in automobile liability insurance policies ....

Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>187 Conn. 386, 399-400, 446 A.2d 1059 (1982).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>General Accident Ins.

Co. v. DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 530 A.2d 171 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>(1987). There, we held that General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c and \u00a7 38-175a-6 (d) (1) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies did not allow an insurer credit for payments to its insured pursuant to a dram shop policy. Id., 199. We explained in <em>DelGreco </em>that General Statutes \u00a7 30-102 \u201cestablishes a cause of action that did not exist at common law.\u201d <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>supra, 198, quoting <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Officers Club of Connecticut, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 341, 348-49, 493 A.2d 184 (1985). General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 30-102 provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf any person, by himself or his agent, sells any alcoholic liquor to an intoxicated person, and such purchaser, in consequence of such intoxication, thereafter injures the person or property of another, such seller shall pay just damages to the person injured . . . .\u201d Under \u00a7 30-102, which creates a form of strict tort liability, there is no need to establish a causal relation between the sale of liquor and the injury. <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>supra, 199; <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Officers Club of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 349. A dram shop payment is \u201cmade on behalf of a liquor establishment which serves alcohol to an intoxicated person who thereafter causes injury to a third party.\u201d <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>supra. Because \u00a7 30-102 does not require proof of causation, we concluded in <em>DelGreco </em>that a payment by a dram shop policy is not a payment made \u201cby or on behalf of any person responsible for the injury\u201d as is required by the regulation in order to invoke the setoff. Id. In contrast, the issue in this case is whether setoff exists when the payment is made <em>by a responsible party. </em>\u201cResponsible party,\u201d as used in the regulations, clearly refers to the tortfeasor who caused the injury to the insured. Thus, our holding in <em>DelGreco </em>is inapposite to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b52-8\"> \u201cRegulations issued by the insurance commissioner to implement the statutes governing uninsured motorist coverage are presumed valid and have the force and effect of a statute.\u201d <em>Dugas </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>217 Conn. 631, 641, 587 A.2d 415 (1991); <em>Travelers Ins.
