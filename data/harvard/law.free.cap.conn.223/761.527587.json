The plaintiff, Success Centers, Inc., commenced this action in the Superior Court against the named defendant, Huntington Learning Centers, Inc., and others,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and seeking damages and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>temporary injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of certain franchise agreements between the parties. Upon motion of the defendants pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-409,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the trial court ordered the parties to proceed with arbitration, as provided in their franchise agreements. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, which, upon motion of the defendants, dismissed the appeal for lack of a final judgment. We granted certification of the plaintiffs appeal and now affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">The facts relevant to the disposition of this appeal are as follows. The plaintiff alleged in its complaint that, in 1988, it entered into franchise agreements with the defendants for the purchase of franchised learning centers in Glastonbury and Farmington. The plaintiff alleged further that, \u201c[subsequent to entering into said franchise agreements, [it] ascertained that the methods employed by the defendants are invalid and improper in that inter alia they prescribe remedial reading services for each and every student who is administered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>the diagnostic tests irrespective of whether such student actually requires such remedial reading.\u201d The plaintiff asserted that the alleged practices violate CUTPA and Connecticut public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag41\">Prior to the commencement of this action, the defendants had demanded arbitration pursuant to the provisions of the franchise agreements in order to collect royalties that they claimed the plaintiff owed them for the operation of the franchises. The parties had selected an arbitrator and had scheduled an arbitration hearing. The defendants, in their answer and special defense to the plaintiffs complaint, requested that the trial court enter an order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-410,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> directing the plaintiff to proceed with arbitration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>The defendants separately moved the trial court, pursuant to \u00a7 52-409, for an order to stay the pending action and to proceed with arbitration. The trial court held a hearing on the defendants\u2019 motion and, thereafter, ordered the parties to proceed with arbitration, as provided in their contract. In its ruling on the defendants\u2019 \u00a7 52-409 motion, the trial court also denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a temporary injunction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. The defendants moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of a final judgment, claiming that the trial court\u2019s order merely postponed the disposition of the underlying action. The Appellate Court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following question: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly dismiss for lack of a final judgment the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the trial court\u2019s order compelling arbitration?\u201d <em>Success Centers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Huntington Learning Centers, Inc., </em>220 Conn. 930, 599 A.2d 382 (1991). We conclude that the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court improperly dismissed its appeal for lack of a final judgment. Although the plaintiff concedes that the trial court\u2019s \u00a7 52-409 order was interlocutory, the plaintiff urges this court to analyze the appealability of a \u00a7 52-409 order under the test set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). The plaintiff contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>the trial court\u2019s interlocutory order under \u00a7 52-409 terminates a separate and distinct proceeding and, thus, is immediately appealable. Id. Alternatively, the plaintiff argues that the trial court\u2019s order meets the second test under <em>Curcio, </em>in that it \u201cso concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d Id. We are persuaded that the trial court\u2019s order does not meet either exception set forth in <em>Curcio, </em>and, therefore, that the plaintiff must await completion of the arbitration proceedings before it is entitled to appellate review of its claim that the issues raised in its complaint are not arbitrable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The plaintiff asserts at the outset that the case law regarding the appealability of orders under \u00a7\u00a7 52-409 and 52-410 is inconsistent, despite the fact that, under either statute, the trial court must decide the issue of arbitrability. The plaintiff criticizes this court\u2019s divergent treatment of \u00a7 52-409 and \u00a7 52-410 orders, claiming that it \u201chas evolved on-its own, leaving litigants and lower courts to guess at the distinguishing elements.\u201d In support of its criticism, the plaintiff refers to the conclusion of certain commentators that \u201c[i]t is difficult to see why these statutes should be treated differently.\u201d W. Moller &amp; W. Horton, Connecticut Practice, Practice Book Annotated, Supreme Court and Appellate Court Rules and Forms (1992) \u00a7 4000, p. 58.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>We disagree with the plaintiff\u2019s premise that the disparate treatment of orders under the two statutes is without logical foundation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Under \u00a7 52-409, when an action is brought in the trial court by a party to a written agreement that includes provisions for arbitration, and the trial court is satisfied that an issue involved in the action is arbitrable, the court, on motion of any party to the agreement, shall stay the action until arbitration has been had in compliance with the agreement. See footnote 3, supra. As a condition precedent to the issuance of a stay order by the trial court, the moving party must be ready and willing to proceed with arbitration. The authority of the court to stay a pending action under \u00a7 52-409 thus provides an incentive to participate to the party reluc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>tant to engage in arbitration. On the other hand, the trial court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 52-409 motion leaves the parties where the court found them, requiring them to proceed with the pending litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">The trial court\u2019s authority under \u00a7 52-410 is quite different from its authority under \u00a7 52-409. Section 52-410 creates an independent action that can be instituted only by a properly served writ of summons and complaint. See footnote 4, supra. No civil action need be pending between the parties for a \u00a7 52-410 action to be commenced. Cf. <em>KND Corporation </em>v. <em>Hartcom, Inc., </em>5 Conn. App. 333, 336-37, 497 A.2d 1038 (1985) (\u201c[i]t would make little sense to require a party being sued to initiate [a \u00a7 52-410] action\u201d). Pursuant to \u00a7 52-410, a party to a written agreement for arbitration claiming the neglect or refusal of another to proceed with arbitration can apply to the trial court for an \u201corder directing the parties to proceed with the arbitration in compliance with their agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">We are persuaded that \u00a7\u00a7 52-409 and 52-410 serve distinct functions. Section 52-409 provides relief when a party to a contract that contains an arbitration clause desires arbitration of a dispute, and the other party, instead of proceeding with arbitration, institutes a civil action to resolve the dispute. The party desiring arbitration can then seek a <em>stay </em>of the civil action. In contrast, \u00a7 52-410 comes into play when no action is pending between the parties, the parties have a contract providing for arbitration, and the parties are unable to agree about the arbitrability of the dispute. In that case, one of the parties may apply to the trial court, in accordance with the distinct statutory procedure provided by \u00a7 52-410, for an order <em>directing the parties to proceed </em>with arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">In either case, in granting or denying a stay under \u00a7 52-409, or in granting or denying an order directing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>the parties to proceed with arbitration under \u00a7 52-410, the trial court must determine whether the contract between the parties provides for arbitration. Because, however, a civil action must be pending for a \u00a7 52-409 order to be issued, we have held that such an order is interlocutory and, therefore, not appealable. <em>Schwarzschild </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>191 Conn. 316, 323-24, 464 A.2d 774 (1983); <em>Gores </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>148 Conn. 218, 169 A.2d 639 (1961); see also <em>KND Corporation </em>v. <em>Hartcom, Inc., </em>supra, 337. Section 52-410, on the other hand, allows a party to an arbitration agreement to commence an <em>independent </em>action in the Superior Court to compel arbitration when no civil action is pending between the parties. The trial court\u2019s decision in a \u00a7 52-410 action, therefore, terminates the action between the parties. Thus, we have construed a court order made pursuant to \u00a7 52-410 as a final order from which either party to the agreement may appeal. <em>Dewart </em>v. <em>Northeastern Gas Transmission Co., </em>139 Conn. 512, 514-15, 95 A.2d 381 (1953); see also <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>16 Conn. App. 209, 211, 547 A.2d 95, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 817, 550 A.2d 1085 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">The plaintiff properly treats the trial court\u2019s order in this case as having been issued pursuant to \u00a7 52-409 and concedes that, as such, it is an interlocutory order. The plaintiff argues, however, that the inquiry does not end there and that this court should analyze the trial court\u2019s \u00a7 52-409 order under the test established in <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). In <em>Curcio, </em>we stated that \u201c[a]n otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d Id. Therefore, we must determine whether the interlocutory order of the trial court in this case, made pursuant to \u00a7 52-409, fits either of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>two exceptions. Our application of the two exceptions set forth in <em>Curcio </em>to the trial court\u2019s order persuades us that the Appellate Court correctly concluded that the order was not immediately appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">We begin by examining the arbitration provisions of the franchise agreements between the parties to ascertain the scope of arbitration under the agreements.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Pursuant to the franchise agreements, the parties agreed that \u201c[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any breach thereof, including, without limitation, any claim that this Agreement, or any part thereof, is invalid, illegal or otherwise voidable or void, shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration . . . .\u201d See footnote 10. In bringing this action in the Superior Court, the plaintiff sought an adjudication of whether the franchise agreements violated CUTPA and Connecticut public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>The plaintiff correctly claims that in ruling on the defendants\u2019 \u00a7 52-409 motion, the trial court decided only whether an arbitrator should decide a dispute over the legality of the franchise agreements. The plaintiff contends, therefore, that \u201cthe trial court expressed no opinion on, and its ruling had no effect on, the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s action.\u201d The plaintiff argues that because the trial court\u2019s order did not address the merits, it was \u201can ancillary ruling, independent and severable from the actual lawsuit . . . [which] qualifies as a \u2018separate and distinct proceeding\u2019 under <em>Curcio, </em>and is therefore appealable.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">The fact that the trial court, in ruling on the \u00a7 52-409 motion, did not address the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit does not in itself qualify its order as terminating a \u201cseparate and distinct proceeding\u201d under <em>Curcio. </em>Cf. <em>Daginella </em>v. <em>Foremost Ins. Co., </em>197 Conn. 26, 31, 495 A.2d 709 (1985) (ruling that directly affects merits of controversy does not terminate \u201cseparate and distinct proceeding\u201d). As we have previously explained, a \u00a7 52-409 motion seeks a <em>stay </em>of the civil proceedings until arbitration has been completed in compliance with the parties\u2019 prior agreement. As we stated in <em>Gores </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>supra, 221: \u201cAn order staying proceedings does not terminate the action but merely postpones its disposition. It may be modified or vacated by the court whenever, in the exercise of a sound discretion, it is considered necessary or proper to do so.\u201d A stay order is thus an integral step in the underlying lawsuit, subject to the ongoing supervision of the trial court. Id., 220 (General Statutes \u00a7 52-409 order to stay action pending arbitration based on \u201cinherent power of the court to regulate proceedings before it\u201d). Accordingly, we are persuaded that a \u00a7 52-409 order does not meet the first test for appealability under <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>The plaintiff also claims that the trial court\u2019s \u00a7 52-409 order satisfies the second test for appealability of an interlocutory order under <em>Curcio. </em>Under that test, to be immediately reviewable, an interlocutory order must \u201cso [conclude] the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 31. The plaintiff, citing <em>Chrysler </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>209 Conn. 579, 593, 552 A.2d 1207 (1989), contends that CUTPA claims are enforceable only in civil actions and, therefore, are not properly arbitrable. The plaintiff argues that due to the limited reviewability of an arbitrator\u2019s decision on an application to vacate under General Statutes \u00a7 52-418; see footnote 14, infra; there is \u201can unacceptable possibility\u201d that the plaintiff\u2019s right to litigate its CUTPA claims may be irreparably lost. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">First, the plaintiff has pointed to no provision in the franchise agreements, and we have found none, that exempts CUTPA and public policy claims from arbitration under the agreements. As we have stated: \u201cArbitration is a creature of contract. It is the province of the parties to set the limits of the authority of the arbitrators, and the parties will be bound by the limits they have fixed. . . . The arbitration provision in an agreement is, in effect, a separate and distinct agreement. Courts of law can enforce only such agreements as the parties actually make. ... No one is under a duty to submit any question to arbitration except to the extent that he has signified his willingness.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>148 Conn. 192, 197, 169 A.2d 646 (1961). By agreeing to the arbitration clause of the franchise agreements; see footnote 10, supra; the plaintiff agreed to submit to arbitration <em>any </em>controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the agreements, or any breach thereof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>including any claim that the agreements are illegal or void as against public policy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">Nor has the plaintiff directed our attention to any authority that prohibits the arbitration of CUTPA or public policy claims. The plaintiff simply asserts that CUTPA claims must be decided in civil actions; see <em>Chrysler </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>supra; and since an arbitration is not a civil action; <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>4 Conn. App. 339, 344, 494 A.2d 606, cert. denied, 197 Conn. 806, 807, 499 A.2d 57 (1985), and cases cited therein; CUTPA claims are not properly arbitrable. Even if the plaintiffs assertion is correct, which we do not decide,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the plaintiff may raise the claim that the CUTPA claims are not arbitrable in a motion to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award. See <em>Schwarzschild </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra; cf. <em>Danbury </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Firefighters, I.A.F.F., Local 801, </em>221 Conn. 244, 603 A.2d 393 (1992) (trial court granted plaintiff\u2019s application to vacate arbitration award made on basis that issue was not arbitrable under General Statutes \u00a7 7-473c [a]).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>The statutory scheme for the appeal of an arbitration award permits a party to the arbitration to apply to the Superior Court to vacate the award on the basis, inter alia, that the arbitrators have exceeded their powers. General Statutes \u00a7 52-418.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> From the decision of the trial court on the application to vacate, an aggrieved party may appeal to the Appellate Court. General Statutes \u00a7 52-423.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">In <em>Schwarzschild </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, the trial court granted the plaintiffs \u00a7 52-409 motion to stay a pending civil action initiated by the defendants and ordered the parties to proceed with arbitration. After the arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>trator entered an award in favor of the plaintiff, the defendants applied to the trial court under \u00a7 52-418 to vacate the award. The trial court confirmed the award, pursuant to the plaintiff\u2019s application, and the estate of one of the defendants appealed. We addressed the question of whether that defendant, who had effectively been required to arbitrate by the entry of the \u00a7 52-409 order, could properly raise the issue of arbitrability in the Superior Court as a basis for vacating the arbitration award. We concluded: \u201cTo be consistent with the view that a \u00a7 52-409 order requiring arbitration is not a judgment from which an appeal lies . . . the issue of arbitrability necessarily must be reviewable upon application to the Superior Court. To hold otherwise would be to deny appellate review to a claim which we previously precluded from review on the grounds that it was premature.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 324. Thus, although we rejected that defendant\u2019s claim that it could otherwise raise the issue of arbitrability on a motion to vacate under \u00a7 52-418, we held that where a party has <em>involuntarily </em>submitted to arbitration pursuant to a \u00a7 52-409 order, he may later raise the question of arbitrability on an application to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Similarly, in the present case, on an application to vacate the plaintiff may seek review of the trial court\u2019s \u00a7 52-409 ruling that the plaintiff\u2019s CUTPA claims were arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s order, made pursuant to \u00a7 52-409, did not terminate a separate and distinct proceeding or so conclude the rights of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>that further proceedings cannot affect them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra. The trial court\u2019s order was thus not immediately appealable. This conclusion accords with the policies underlying arbitration. \u201c \u2018Arbitration affords a contractual remedy with a view toward expediting disputes.\u2019 . . . Arbitration is favored because it \u2018is intended to avoid the formalities, delay, expense and vexation of ordinary litigation.\u2019 . . . Prohibiting interlocutory appellate review limits disruption and delay and prevents the arbitration process from being overtaken by litigation.\u201d <em>Daginella </em>v. <em>Foremost Ins. Co., </em>supra, 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">In this opinion Callahan, Borden and F.X.

See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 4013 (a) (1) (A) and 4140.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b788-6\"> We note here the explanation offered by another commentator concerning the differential treatment of General Statutes \u00a7 52-409 and \u00a7 52-410 orders with respect to appealability. \u201cThere are two statutory procedures under which private arbitration can be compelled. Under one method [General Statutes \u00a7 52-410 (a)], a party to an arbitration agreement can apply to the court to direct the opposing party to proceed with arbitration. Because an application for an order to compel arbitration is a separate and distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>proceeding, an order directing a party to arbitrate terminates that proceeding and is deemed a final judgment and appealable. For the same reason, an order refusing to direct arbitration would also seem final and appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"A1bY\">\u201cThe other procedure is employed when a party to an arbitration agreement has initiated a lawsuit instead of arbitrating. In that situation, the defendant may move the court [under General Statutes \u00a7 52-409] to stay the lawsuit and to direct the plaintiff to arbitrate. Although such a proceeding looks like the mirror image of a direct application to compel arbitration, Connecticut has viewed it differently for purposes of appeal. The court has held that an order staying a proceeding and ordering arbitration is not a final judgment and not appealable.\u201d C. Tait, Connecticut Appellate Practice and Procedure (1989) \u00a7 2.25, pp. 96.1-97.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b789-13\"> We cannot, however, disclaim complete responsibility for augmenting the confusion about the distinction between the two statutes. Since General Statutes \u00a7 52-409 only provides for a litigant to seek an order from the trial court to \u201cstay the action or proceeding until an arbitration has been had in compliance with the agreement,\u201d our statements in <em>Schwarzschild </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>191 Conn. 316, 323-24, 464 A.2d 774 (1983), referring to a \u00a7 52-409 order <em>to compel </em>arbitration and a \u00a7 52-409 order <em>requiring </em>arbitration, are inaccurate. A \u00a7 52-409 order does not <em>compel </em>arbitration; rather, it merely stays the pending civil action until arbitration has been completed. We note that in the present case, the plaintiff has not challenged the wording of the trial court\u2019s ruling, made pursuant to \u00a7 52-409, that \u201c[t]he parties are <em>ordered </em>to proceed with arbitration under their contract.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b792-5\"> Section XXI of the parties\u2019 franchise agreements provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">\u201cXXI.

The arbitrator may not stay the effectiveness of any pending termination, assess punitive, speculative or exemplary damages or make an award which extends, modifies or suspends any provision of this Agreement. Judgment upon any award shall be binding, and shall be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however that this article shall not be construed to limit any rights which Franchisor may have to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive or similar provisional relief. The substantive law of the State of New Jersey shall be applied by the arbitrators, and this requirement shall be deemed jurisdictional and interpreted as an agreement by both parties to appear and submit to such jurisdiction. This arbitration provision shall be deemed self-executing, and in the event that either party fails to appear at any properly noticed arbitration proceeding, an award may be entered against such party notwithstanding said failure to appear.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b795-5\"> We note that pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-408, \u201c[a]n agreement in any written contract or in a separate writing executed by the parties to any written contract, to settle by arbitration <em>any </em>controversy thereafter arising out of such contract . . . shall be valid, irrevocable and enforceable, except when there exists sufficient cause at law or in equity for the avoidance of written contracts generally.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b795-6\"> In <em>Ebenstein &amp; Ebenstein, P.C. </em>v. <em>Smith Thibault Corporation, </em>20 Conn.

Thus, although not an issue in the appeal to the Appellate Court, the trial court\u2019s order submitting the CUTPA claims to arbitration was allowed to stand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b795-7\"> We note, moreover, that under General Statutes \u00a7 52-415, a party to an arbitration may seek judicial advice on complex questions of law during the course of arbitration proceedings.

Cf. <em>New Britain </em>v. <em>State Board of Mediation &amp; Arbitration, </em>178 Conn. 557, 561, 424 A.2d 263 (1979) (plaintiff waived any claim on application to vacate regarding arbitrability of underlying dispute where it did not raise issue until <em>after </em>underlying dispute resolved).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b798-6\">Berdon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASv\">dissenting. I believe that we do have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal under the first prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983)\u2014that is, \u201cwhere the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding.\u201d The grant or denial of a stay based upon an arbitration clause is a matter wholly separate from the merits of the party\u2019s cause. See <em>Association of Owners </em>v. <em>Swinerton &amp; Walberg Co., </em>705 P.2d 28, 34 (Hawaii 1985). To allow an appeal from an order compelling arbitration under General Statutes \u00a7 52-410; <em>Dewart </em>v. <em>Northwestern Gas Transmission Co., </em>139 Conn. 512, 514, 95 A.2d 381 (1953); but not from an order that either grants or denies a stay under General Statutes \u00a7 52-409 is, at the very least, difficult to reconcile. See W. Moller &amp; W. Horton, Connecticut Practice-Practice Book Annotated, Connecticut Supreme and Appellate Court Rules and Forms (1992) \u00a7 4000. Section 52-409 \u201clooks like a mirror image\u201d of \u00a7 52-410. C. Tait, Connecticut Appellate Practice and Procedure (1989) \u00a7 2.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Finally, there are practical reasons why orders under \u00a7 52-409 should be appealable. To compel parties to incur costly litigation expenses, either as a result of litigation before an arbitration panel or a court when that is not the required forum, would not make economic sense. If there is a dispute as to whether a matter is arbitrable, then that should be decided by a final and binding judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Accordingly, I would hold that the Appellate Court should not have dismissed the plaintiffs appeal. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
