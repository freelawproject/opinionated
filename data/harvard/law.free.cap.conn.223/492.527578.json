The respondent mother<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appeals, upon our grant of certification, from the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming the judgment of the trial court that granted the petition of the commissioner of children and youth services (petitioner) for termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights with respect to her daughter, Valerie D. (child).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court judgment rested on two alternative bases: (1) certain prenatal conduct of the respondent, namely, intravenous injection of cocaine, caused \u201cserious physical injury to [the] child\u201d that constituted \u201cacts of parental commission or omis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>sion sufficient for the termination of parental rights,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2); and (2) there was \u201cno ongoing parent child relationship\u201d between the respondent and the child, and \u201cto allow further time for the establishment . . . of [such] parent child relationship would be detrimental to the best interests of the child,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The respondent claims that the judgment of the Appellate Court should be reversed because: (1) \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2) does not permit termination of parental rights based upon the prenatal conduct of the mother; (2) if \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2) does permit such a termination of parental rights, it violates the respondent\u2019s right to due process of law and equal protection of the laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>under the federal and state constitutions; (3) under the facts of this case, the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights upon the basis of an absence of an ongoing parent-child relationship was unconstitutional because the state was responsible for the absence of such a relationship; (4) the record does not support the finding of the trial court that there was no ongoing parent-child relationship; and (5) the trial court used an improper standard in waiving the one year requirement provided by \u00a7 45a-717 (f)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and no such waiver was justified under the facts of this case. We agree with the respondent\u2019s first claim, namely, that \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2), properly construed, does not permit termination of parental rights based upon the mother\u2019s prenatal conduct. With respect to the respondent\u2019s third claim, we agree that \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (3), as applied to the facts of this case, does not permit the state to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights upon the basis that she had no ongoing parent-child relationship with her child, but we reach that conclusion by virtue of statutory interpretation rather than constitutional analysis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The child was born to the respondent on July 26, 1989, in Bristol Hospital. On August 1, 1989, while the child was still in the hospital, the petitioner filed in the Superior Court: (1) a petition for an order of temporary care and custody of the child, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> upon the basis of an affidavit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>child\u2019s pediatrician that the respondent\u2019s use of cocaine within hours prior to beginning labor put the child \u201cin great risk of life-threatening medical complications\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>and that this conduct constituted \u201cintentional and severe parental neglect\u201d; (2) a petition for commitment of custody of the child to the petitioner, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\u00a7 46b-129 (a); see footnote 6, supra; upon the bases that the child was neglected, uncared for and abused; and (3) a coterminous petition for termination of the respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>dent\u2019s parental rights with respect to the child, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (e),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> upon the basis that, due to the respondent\u2019s use of cocaine throughout the pregnancy resulting in the child having been born \u201cdrug addicted\u201d and \u201csuffering from with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>drawal,\u201d the child \u201chad been denied by reason of act or acts of commission or omission, the care, guidance or control necessary for [her] physical, educational, moral or emotional well being,\u201d and that she had \u201csustained a nonaccidental or inadequately explained serious injury.\u201d On the same date, the trial court granted, ex parte, the petition for temporary custody.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On October 4, 1989, the petitioner amended the petition to add, as grounds for termination of parental rights, abandonment and a lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The trial court heard evidence on the coterminous petitions for custody and termination of parental rights on November 8, 1989, December 13, 1989, January 17, 1990, and February 21, 1990. On March 28, 1990, the court rendered an oral decision from the bench granting the coterminous petitions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> With respect to the petition for termination of parental rights, the court found proven by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) by the respondent\u2019s intravenous use of cocaine in the last stages of pregnancy, the child had been denied by reason of acts of parental commission or omission the care, guidance or control necessary for her physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being; and (2) as of the adjudication date of November 8, 1989, there was no ongoing parent-child relationship between the respondent and the child, and it would be detrimental to the child\u2019s best interest to allow further time for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>such a relationship to be established.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Having considered the statutory factors listed in \u00a7 45a-717 (h); see footnote 1, supra; and all the circumstances leading up to the dispositional date of February 21, 1990, which was the last date of the evidentiary hearings, the court found by clear and convincing evidence that it was in the child\u2019s best interest to be placed forthwith in permanent adoption. Accordingly, the court terminated the respondent\u2019s parental rights and appointed the petitioner as the child\u2019s statutory parent for the purpose of placing her in adoption. On July 24, 1990, the trial court issued a written articulation of its oral decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>In re Valerie D., </em>25 Conn. App. 586, 595 A.2d 922 (1991). That court held that: (1) a judgment of \u201ctermination of parental rights can be supported solely by evidence of a mother\u2019s prenatal conduct\u201d; id., 593; and (2) there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings that there was no ongoing parent-child relationship between the child and the respondent, and that it would be detrimental to the child\u2019s best interest to allow further time for the establishment of such a relationship. Id., 594A-95. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The respondent claims first that \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2), properly construed, does not permit the termination of parental rights based upon the prenatal conduct of the mother. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The record discloses the following facts pertinent to this claim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The respondent, who was born August 4, 1969, began using drugs at age eleven. At age fifteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>she met the child\u2019s father, John M., and at age sixteen she left school and home and began living with him. Thereafter, they both began injecting cocaine intravenously. In 1987, the respondent became pregnant with her first child, Amanda. When, during the fourth month of pregnancy, she disclosed her history of drug abuse to her physician, he warned her of its impact on her unborn child and gave her literature on the subject. She was able to discontinue the use of cocaine almost completely during that pregnancy, and Amanda was born, symptom free, on May 12, 1988. Three months later, however, she resumed using cocaine, by smoking and intravenous injection, two to five times per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In October, 1988, the respondent became pregnant with Valerie, but did not visit her physician until March, 1989, when he again warned her of the problems that her substance abuse could cause to her unborn child. By this time, however, the respondent had become addicted to cocaine and was unable to stop using it. Although the respondent informed her physician that she would continue prenatal care at the Bristol Hospital clinic because she had no medical insurance, her physician learned in July, when the respondent returned to him, that she had not gone to the clinic until June 5, 1989. The court further noted that, under normal circumstances, a pregnant woman should be seen monthly for the first twenty-eight weeks, and more frequently for a high risk pregnancy posed by a drug-abusing woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">On June 19, 1989, John M.\u2019s probation officer visited the home, where he observed marijuana and drug paraphernalia. Both parents were arrested. Amanda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>was taken to Bristol Hospital, and the parents were advised to place her in foster care while they entered treatment for their admitted cocaine addiction. A hospital social worker advised the respondent of the risks to a fetus from intravenous cocaine use. After the parents refused voluntary placement of Amanda and drug treatment for themselves, the petitioner filed a neglect petition regarding Amanda and secured an order of temporary custody in order to remove her from the hospital and place her in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">On July 26, 1989, when the parents were scheduled for a continued hearing on the neglect petition regarding Amanda, they telephoned and informed the court that the respondent\u2019s water had broken, that she was about to deliver and that they were on their way to the hospital. Instead, at approximately 1 p.m., the respondent intravenously injected a quarter gram of cocaine and did not arrive at the hospital until approximately 9 p.m. The child was born approximately one hour later.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">During the birth process, the child had passed meconium;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> this was the result of stress to the child from a precipitous delivery that resulted, in turn, from the respondent\u2019s injection of cocaine while she was leaking amniotic fluid and expecting to go into labor. In such a case, there is a risk that the child can aspirate the meconium, causing life-threatening respiratory problems. An aggressive suctioning procedure was used to guard against that risk, and it was found that the child had not aspirated any meconium.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>At birth the child was pale, had poor muscle tone and required oxygen. While the child was in the hospital, cocaine metabolites were found in her urine, and she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>went through cocaine withdrawal. At times, she was extraordinarily jittery and shaky, had a piercing cry, was unable to make eye contact, and required special care, such as swaddling, vertical rocking and elimination of all stimuli.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The petitioner argues that \u201c[a]s a result of the mother\u2019s intravenous injection of cocaine when on the verge of labor, the child was born into this world under life-threatening circumstances.\u201d This argument is based on the testimony of the pediatrician that the passage of meconium prior to delivery posed a <em>risk </em>of aspiration that, had it occurred, would have caused life-threatening respiratory problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The petitioner also argues that \u201cthe child <em>was </em>seriously affected at birth by her mother\u2019s cocaine use.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The following evidence forms the basis of this argument. The presence of the meconium, the child\u2019s respiratory distress, and the precipitous delivery were caused by the respondent\u2019s cocaine use. The child\u2019s heart rate had fallen just prior to delivery, and she was born cyanotic, required oxygen, and had depressed Apgar scores, an \u201cevaluation of a newborn infant\u2019s physical status by assigning numerical values (0 to 2) to each of five criteria: heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, response to stimulation, and skin color; a score of 10 indicates the best possible condition.\u201d Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary (24th Ed.). The child\u2019s urine indicated the presence of cocaine metabolites, and she went through withdrawal. Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>thermore, there was evidence that cocaine restricts the blood vessels, and may interfere with mental development. There was also evidence that prenatal drug abuse may ultimately result in learning disability, central nervous system damage, lens deformities, hyperactivity, and an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">We need not decide in this case whether this evidence would support a finding of \u201cserious physical injury to a child\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2), if the parental conduct that yielded these conditions and risks had taken place immediately after, rather than before, delivery. We assume that it would support such a finding, particularly where the child is a newborn infant, and we treat this case accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Based upon this evidence, the trial court rendered an adjudication, as of November 8, 1989, the date that the petition had been last amended; see footnote 9, supra; that the child had been denied \u201cby acts of parental commission or omission the care, guidance or control necessary for physical, educational and emotional well-being.\u201d The court specifically found that there had been \u201c \u2018[n]onaccidental . . . serious physical injury to [the] child . . . constituting] . . . acts of parental commission or omission sufficient for the termination of parental rights.\u2019 \u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2). In support of this conclusion, the trial court reasoned: \u201cValerie suffered serious, life-threatening, physical injury at the instant of her birth because of her mother\u2019s intravenous injection of cocaine after beginning labor. This ground would apply without question to parents who., an instant <em>after </em>birth, injected cocaine into the bloodstream of a newborn. The injection of the drug into the bloodstream of a baby about to be born should have no different consequences.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) It is the validity of this conclusion that forms the core of the first issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>It is important to note at the outset what this case does not involve. It does not involve the propriety of the trial court\u2019s order committing custody of the child to the petitioner. The respondent has not challenged that order at any time during the entire course of this litigation. Moreover, \u201cquestions concerning the ultimate custodial placement of the child may not be intermingled with the issues of termination.\u201d <em>In re Jessica M., </em>217 Conn. 459, 466, 586 A.2d 597 (1991). Nor does this case involve a determination of whether it would be in the child\u2019s best interests to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights in order to substitute another, more suitable parent. Our statutes and caselaw make it crystal clear that the determination of the child\u2019s best interests comes into play only <em>after </em>statutory grounds for termination of parental rights have been established by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We also note that we do not endorse the moral quality of the conduct of the respondent in this case. Certainly no one approves of the intravenous injection of cocaine by a pregnant woman, who had been warned of the risks to her fetus, at any time during her pregnancy let alone just before the onset of labor. Nor, on the other hand, are we here to condemn her for succumbing to what may well have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>been the unyielding demands of her addiction; Our task, rather, is to determine whether the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2), intended it to apply in a case such as this. We do not believe that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Section 45a-717 (f) (2) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may approve a petition for termination of parental rights \u201cif it finds, upon clear and convincing evidence that . . . the child has been denied, by reason of an act or acts of parental commission or omission, the care, guidance or control necessary for [the child\u2019s] physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being. Nonaccidental or inadequately explained serious physical injury to a child shall constitute prima facie evidence of acts of parental commission or omission sufficient for the termination of parental rights . . . .\u201d See footnote 1, supra. It is axiomatic that the process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 459-60, 600 A.2d 310 (1991). The question posed by the facts of this case is whether the legislature intended this language to contemplate termination of parental rights based upon prenatal conduct\u2014even prenatal conduct committed shortly before the onset of labor\u2014that results in harm to the child upon its birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The scope of this statute is ambiguous when applied to the facts of this case. The statute rests on \u201ctwo distinct and often contradictory interests [of the child]. The first is a basic interest in safety; the second is the important interest ... in having a stable <em>family </em>environment.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>189 Conn. 276, 287, 455 A.2d 1313 (1983). Indeed, the petitioner concedes with appropriate candor that the \u201cstatute is silent as to when the [parental commission or omission] must occur.\u201d In light of this ambiguity, we must examine the constitutional background, the language and the structure of the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>ute, as well as the legislative history relevant to its meaning. <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 460. These well settled principles of statutory construction constrain us to conclude that the parental conduct justifying termination of parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2) must occur after birth and that the statute does not contemplate termination of parental rights upon the basis of prenatal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u201c[T]he termination of parental rights is defined, in General Statutes \u00a7 45-61b (g) [now \u00a7 45a-707 (g)], as the complete severance by court order of the legal relationship, with all its rights and responsibilities, between the child and his parent . . . . It is, accordingly, a most serious and sensitive judicial action. <em>Anonymous </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>168 Conn. 421, 430, 362 A.2d 532, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 935, 96 S. Ct. 294, 46 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1975). Although the severance of the parent-child relationship may be required under some circumstances, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the interest of parents in their children is a fundamental constitutional right that undeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection. <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 551 (1972); see also <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>[supra, 295] (noting that it is both a fundamental right and the policy of this state to maintain the integrity of the family). Termination of parental rights does not follow automatically from parental conduct justifying the removal of custody. The fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State. Even when blood relationships are strained, parents retain a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of their family life. <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S. Ct. 1388, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Jessica M., </em>supra, 464-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Thus, in construing \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2), which operates \u201cin the delicate realm of parent-child relationships, courts should prefer that construction which minimizes state intervention. ...\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous) </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Cildren &amp; Youth Services, </em>177 Conn. 648, 662, 420 A.2d 875 (1979). In this realm, therefore, \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2) should be read with a \u201cpreference for nonintrusion\u201d by the state. Id. Because of their \u201cfundamental nature,\u201d statutes \u201cauthorizing state intrusion into the area of parental rights\u201d require \u201cthe strictest level of judicial scrutiny.\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-BC), </em>194 Conn. 252, 257 n.9, 479 A.2d 1204 (1984); see also <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (88-CD), </em>supra, 284 (courts must keep in mind constitutional limitations imposed on state when it undertakes coercive intervention in family affairs).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Strict construction of a statute permitting the termination of parental rights is consistent with our traditional \u201c[insistence upon strict compliance with the statutory criteria before termination of parental rights and subsequent adoption can occur [and] is not inconsistent with concern for the best interests of the child.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Jessica M., </em>supra, 466.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In sum, in light of the ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the scope of \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2), as applied to the facts of this case, the statute must, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>sistent with its constitutional implications, be construed strictly and narrowly, rather than generously and broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">With this background in mind, we turn first to the language of the statute in order to determine whether the legislature intended it to encompass prenatal conduct. For purposes of \u00a7 45a-717, \u201c \u2018[p]arent\u2019 means a natural or adoptive parent.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 45a-707 (e). \u201c \u2018Child\u2019 means any person under sixteen years of age.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The ordinary usage of the term \u201cparent,\u201d insofar as it applies to the female, suggests that, unless the context requires otherwise, it means \u201cone [who] . . . brings forth offspring.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. Thus, in ordinary parlance, until the child in this case was born, or was \u201cbrought forth,\u201d the respondent was not her \u201cparent\u201d and the conduct of the respondent with respect to her was not \u201cparental\u201d conduct. Similarly, the definition of \u201cchild\u201d as a person \u201cunder sixteen years of age\u201d suggests a limitation on the applicability of that definition to a person who has been born, since that is the ordinary beginning point of one\u2019s \u201cage.\u201d Thus, until the moment of birth, Valerie was not a \u201cchild\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2) and, therefore, the \u201cact . . . of parental commission\u201d that took place before that moment cannot be considered to be parental conduct that \u201cdenied [her] . . . the care . . . necessary for [her] physical . . . well-being.\u201d Cf. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Alcala, </em>420 U.S. 575, 95 S. Ct. 1180, 43 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1975) (based on axiom that statutory words are to be given ordinary meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>absent persuasive reasons to contrary, \u201cchild\u201d as used in \u00a7 406 (a) of federal Social Security Act means individual already born, with existence separate from mother).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">It is true, of course, that one can be considered, semantically, to be the \u201cparent\u201d of a child yet to be born; in such a case, the word \u201cchild\u201d would be considered to include reference to an unborn child.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is also true that such a broad, rather than narrow, construction would favor the petitioner in this case. Faced with two plausible constructions of the statutory language, however, we are compelled by its constitutional backdrop to choose the narrow construction, and to limit the reach of the language accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">We took the opposite approach in <em>Crook </em>v. <em>Academy Drywall Co., </em>219 Conn. 28, 591 A.2d 429 (1991), where we held that, for purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, an employee was entitled to a dependency allowance for a child conceived before but born after the date of the employee\u2019s injury. Id., 28-30. In that case, we rested our holding that a child en ventre sa mere was a child \u201c \u2018under eighteen years of age,\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act; id., 29 n.l, quoting General Statutes \u00a7 31-308b (1); on the established principle that the act \u201cis remedial in nature and that it should be broadly construed . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 32. The established principles that govern construction of \u00a7 45a-717, however, require that it be read narrowly and strictly, and require further that, absent clear indication to the contrary from the legislature, it be read so as to apply only to postnatal parental conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">This conclusion is buttressed by the use of the terms \u201cparent\u201d and \u201cchild\u201d throughout \u00a7 45a-717. Ordinar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ily we read the same terms in the same statute to have the same meanings. <em>AirKaman </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>221 Conn. 751, 758, 607 A.2d 410 (1992). The terms \u201cparent\u201d and \u201cchild,\u201d as used throughout the other parts of \u00a7 45a-717 (f), clearly contemplate a child who has been born to his or her parents, and do riot contemplate prenatal conduct by a pregnant woman with respect to her fetus.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Section 45a-717 (f) (1), for example, permits termination of parental rights if \u201c[t]he child has been abandoned by the parent,\u201d and \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (3) permits termination if \u201cthere is no ongoing parent child relationship which is defined as the relationship that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met on a continuing, day-to-day basis the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the child . . . .\u201d Neither of these statutory uses of the terms \u201cparent\u201d and \u201cchild\u201d could conceivably involve prenatal conduct by a pregnant woman with respect to her fetus. It would, therefore, be inconsistent with the ordinary legislative use of the same or similar language within the same statutory section to permit that language to carry one meaning in one subsection but another meaning in the other two subsections. In the absence of a clear expression of an intention to do so, we will not ascribe such an intention to the legislature. Moreover, \u00a7 45a-717 (f) requires that the conduct of a parent justifying termination of her parental rights must continue \u201cover an extended period of time which . . . shall not be less than one year,\u201d unless the one year period is waived by the court pursuant to \u00a7 45a-717 (g). The legislature could not have intended that one year requirement, which applies uniformly to all three grounds for termination under \u00a7 45a-717 (f), to apply to grounds for termination that would be based upon prenatal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Finally, we obtain guidance to the intention of the legislature in its enactment in 1990 of certain legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>tion addressing the question of how best to deal with the issue of substance-abusing pregnant women, and in the simultaneous rejection by the responsible legislative committee of certain other proposed legislation addressing the same question.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Specifically, the 1990 legislature, by adopting Substitute Senate Bill No. 197 and rejecting House Bill No. 5205, evidenced an intent to approach that issue by a program of treatment and support, and an intent to eschew giving the petitioner the authority to seek termination of parental rights based upon prenatal drug abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The joint committee on public health considered and held simultaneous hearings on two bills: (1) House Bill No. 5205; and (2) Substitute Senate Bill No. 197. A principal thrust of House Bill No. 5205 was to couple mandatory testing and reporting requirements of pregnant, drug-dependent women with mandated investigations by the department of children and youth services (DCYS) so as to give DCYS explicit authority to petition for termination of parental rights based upon the prenatal drug abuse by the mother.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This bill, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>fore, would have specifically authorized what the petitioner seeks in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Substitute Senate Bill No. 197 took a different approach to the issue of substance-abusing pregnant women. The principal thrust of this bill was outreach services, treatment programs, and other appropriate forms of support for pregnant substance-abusing women and their families.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Conspicuously absent from this bill, when compared to House Bill No. 5205, were any provisions for mandatory testing and reporting, and any provisions regarding termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The joint committee on public health held a hearing on the two proposed bills. Much of the testimony in favor of House Bill No. 5205 pointed to the need for its mandatory reporting requirement, and on the consequent investigation by DCYS to be followed, where appropriate, by a petition for custody or termination of parental rights.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> On the other hand, much of the testimony opposed to House Bill No. 5205, and in favor of the contrary approach proposed by Substitute Senate Bill No. 197, focused on the perceived risk that the approach proposed by House Bill No. 5205 would drive pregnant women who have abused drugs during their pregnancies to avoid prenatal care and even hospital-based births.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>The joint standing committee reported Substitute Senate Bill No. 197 favorably, and House Bill No. 5205 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>died in committee. Substitute Senate Bill No. 197 was passed by the General Assembly with minor amendments, and is now codified in part at General Statutes \u00a7 17a-644.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In speaking in the House of Representatives on Substitute Senate Bill No. 197, Representative Robert Farr stated: <em>\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, we ought to change our laws and we ought to make it abuse for a mother to consume drugs while she\u2019s pregnant. That\u2019s what should be done. </em>That would be instant intervention. That would mean reporting. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done much with this bill. Representative Dandrow is right. We\u2019re not going to achieve anything further. Obviously with the lateness of the period, I think it\u2019s a tragedy [that] we haven\u2019t done more to change our laws. There\u2019s a real problem out there. There\u2019s a real epidemic. We haven\u2019t even begun to scratch the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>surface of the problem.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 33 H.R. Proc., Pt. 26, 1990 Sess., pp. 9408-9409.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Based upon this entire legislative history, we conclude that the 1990 legislature, in rejecting House Bill No. 5205 and enacting in its stead Substitute Senate Bill No. 197, was persuaded by the policy arguments of the proponents of Substitute Senate Bill No. 197 and the opponents of House Bill No. 5205 that the provisions of House Bill No. 5205 entailed significant risks that pregnant women who had used illegal drugs during their pregnancies would avoid prenatal care and substance abuse treatment. We also conclude that the same legislature was persuaded that such an approach would on balance be more socially harmful than beneficial, because it would lead to more, rather than fewer, babies being born either without adequate prenatal care or damaged by prenatal drug abuse, or both.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We are also persuaded that the 1990 legislature, in adopting the approach taken by Substitute Senate Bill No. 197, considered that it would require a change in the law in order to give DCYS the power to seek termination of parental rights on the basis of a mother\u2019s prenatal illegal drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">These conclusions, while far from determinative of the issue, cast light on the legislative intent underlying \u00a7 45a-717. They disclose the difficult and delicate policy choices that are inherent in the provisions of House Bill No. 5205 that parallel the position of the petitioner in this case regarding the meaning of \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2), policy choices that the legislature clearly rejected in 1990. These conclusions, therefore, counsel against reading \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2) so as to reflect a resolution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>those policy choices that would balance in favor of the petitioner\u2019s reading of that statute, at least without clear legislative indication of an intent to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Furthermore, the legislature in enacting statutes is presumed to be aware of the existence of other legislation on the same or related issues; <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>207 Conn. 412, 417, 540 A.2d 1054 (1988); and \u201c[statutes are to be interpreted with regard to other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Baybank Connecticut, N.A. </em>v. <em>Thumlert, </em>222 Conn. 784, 790, 610 A.2d 658 (1992). The approach .towards substance-abusing pregnant women that the legislature adopted by the enactment of Substitute Senate Bill No. 197, now General Statutes \u00a7 17a-644, coupled with the legislative rejection of the approach proposed by House Bill No. 5205, is inconsistent with the interpretation of \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2) advanced by the petitioner. We therefore infer from this legislative activity in 1990 an intent that \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2) does not contemplate a petition for termination of parental rights based upon the prenatal drug use by the mother. See <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992) (judicial consideration of subsequent enactments in order to illuminate legislative intent with respect to prior legislative action).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The petitioner argues, as did the trial court, that pursuant to \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2) \u201c[t]he fact [that] the mother\u2019s behavior occurred prior to Valerie\u2019s birth does not relieve the mother of responsibility for the injuries her child suffered at birth. Focusing on Valerie, it is difficult to discern any distinction between administering cocaine to Valerie nine hours before her birth or nine hours after her birth. The consequences to Valerie are the same. <em>The precise time of the injury should not be legally significant; the real issue is the injuries that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number><em>Valerie suffered. The statute requires the trial court to look back at the causes of the child\u2019s injury and, most importantly, to assess the risk of continued harm to the child. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Although on the admittedly egregious facts of this case this argument has emotional appeal, we disagree with it as the appropriate reading of \u00a7 45a-717.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In this case, the respondent\u2019s prenatal conduct took place but several hours before the onset of labor. There is no principled way, however, to confine the language of \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2) to prenatal maternal conduct that takes place only a short time before delivery of the baby, as opposed to maternal conduct that takes place early in the pregnancy. Indeed, the petitioner\u2019s argument recognizes this, and would have us read \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2) so as to \u201clook back\u201d throughout the entire period of the pregnancy for the causes of the child\u2019s postnatal \u201cinjuries.\u201d Nor, for that matter, is there any principled way, under the petitioner\u2019s proposed reading of the statute, to confine its language to prenatal maternal conduct that is illegal, as opposed to conduct that is merely unwise or unhealthy. Thus, as the petitioner conceded in oral argument in this court, the same reading of \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2) that the petitioner would have us adopt would permit the petitioner to seek termination of the parental rights of a mother who drank alcohol excessively during her pregnancy and delivered a baby suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome. We do not deny that a policy maker might want to grant the petitioner such a power. Nor do we deny that such prenatal conduct is harmful to the fetus in the womb and the child upon its birth. Our point is that, absent some fairly clear indication to the contrary, we do not believe that the legislature intended the statute as currently drafted to have such sweeping consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>We recognize, as the petitioner points out, that the intermediate appellate courts of some other jurisdictions have approved of custodial commitment petitions, and in at least one case a termination petition, based upon prenatal drug use by the mother. See, e.g., <em>In re Troy D., </em>215 Cal. App. 3d 889, 263 Cal. Rptr. 869 (1989) (commitment petition); <em>In re Solomon L., </em>190 Cal. App. 3d 1106, 236 Cal. Rptr. 2 (1987) (both commitment and termination petitions); <em>In re Nash, </em>165 Mich. App. 450, 419 N.W.2d 1 (1987) (commitment petition); <em>In the Matter of Baby X, </em>97 Mich. App. 111, 293 N.W.2d 736 (1980) (commitment petition); <em>Matter of Stefanel Tyesha C., </em>157 App. Div. 2d 322, 556 N.Y.S.2d 280 (1990) (commitment petition). We are unpersuaded by the reasoning of these decisions because they do not rely, as do we, on a close examination of the language, constitutional background and available legislative history of the statutory framework purporting to support a petition for termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Nor are we persuaded, as the Appellate Court was and as the petitioner advances here, by the analogy to principles of tort law that have permitted a child subsequently born to maintain a cause of action for the injurious postnatal consequences of prenatal conduct of a third party. See <em>Ochs </em>v. <em>Borrelli, </em>187 Conn. 253, 445 A.2d 883 (1982); W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 55, p. 368. We agree with the respondent that the compensatory purposes of those tort principles are inapposite to the delicate and sensitive policy choices that inform our search for the legislative intent underlying \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">We turn next to the trial court\u2019s second ground for termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights, namely, the absence of an ongoing parent-child relationship. The respondent claims that, under the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>of this case, the judgment terminating her parental rights on that ground was unconstitutional under the due process and equal protection of the laws clauses of the federal and state constitutions, because the state was responsible for the absence of that relationship. We agree with the respondent that, under the facts and circumstances of this case, the state cannot prevail on that ground for termination of parental rights, but we rest this conclusion on established principles of statutory construction and, therefore, need not determine whether constitutional principles would also require the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">We note first that the trial court found that there was no ongoing parent-child relationship between the respondent and the child <em>as of November 8, </em>1989,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the adjudication date as determined by the date of the last amendment of the petition. See footnote 9, supra. Our consideration of the respondent\u2019s claim, therefore, must proceed on the premise that the petitioner established, under the facts of this case, a lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship between the respondent and her child at a point in time approximately three and one-half months after the birth of the child, where the petitioner had secured and maintained custody of the child for virtually all of that period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The record discloses the following facts pertinent to this claim. The trial court found that while the respondent was in the hospital she \u201chad much contact with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>the [child].\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The respondent was discharged from the hospital on July 28, 1989, two days after the birth of the child. On August 3, 1989, the child was discharged from the hospital to the custody of the petitioner and placed in foster care in a home in Plantsville, a section of Southington approximately ten miles from where the respondent was living with her mother in Bristol.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">On August 24, 1989, the respondent telephoned the foster mother and arranged to visit the child on August 30, 1989. After the August 30 visit, she next visited the child on September 8 at Bristol Hospital, where the child had been admitted for treatment of pneumonia,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and visited her again in the hospital on September 12.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The child was discharged from the hospital on September 18, 1989. Because the respondent was a hepatitis carrier, however, upon the recommendation of the child\u2019s pediatrician DCYS requested the respondent not to visit the child until she produced a note from her physician that she was free of communicable diseases, including hepatitis. From approximately mid-September to October 4, when the respondent was able to produce the note, therefore, she was unable to visit the child. On October 10, the respondent telephoned the foster mother to inquire about the child, and visited the child at the foster home on October 19, October 23, October 25, October 30, and November 1, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The trial court found that on October 9, 1989, the respondent entered an outpatient drug treatment program at Bristol Hospital, but remained in that program only until October 18, 1989. Despite a letter to her on October 31, 1989, from James Archambault, of the hospital counseling center, she did not return to the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">On November 1 and 2, 1989, David M. Mantell, a licensed clinical psychologist, evaluated the respondent and the father, together with the child. The respondent admitted to Mantell that she was then incapable of caring for the child, and estimated that it would take at least one year before she would be sufficiently confident of recovering from her drug addiction to do so. In his report, dated November 5, 1989, he stated that there was no emotional connection between the respondent and the child.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Mantell also testified at the November 8, 1989 hearing that in his opinion there was no parent-child relationship between the respondent and the child.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The trial court found that \u201cDr. Mantell\u2019s observations confirmed what a lay trier of fact could conclude about the nature of the relationship existing between Valerie and [the respondent] on November 8, 1989. He saw no sign of bonding on November 1 and 2, and indeed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>[mother] of a newborn who had only seen the child a handful of times in the first three months of life could not have developed the kind of relationship that results from . . a parent having met on a continuing, day-to-day basis the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the child,\u2019 as described in [General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (3)].\u201d This finding, which was stated in the court\u2019s July 24, 1990 written articulation, was consistent with its earlier oral finding on March 28, 1990, that the court was \u201cnot holding the parents responsible for the fact that bonding was impossible. I think that both [counsel for the parents] stressed in [their] briefs that you can\u2019t develop a bond when you have to hitch a ride with your mother-in-law . . . and at most can visit a child infrequently .... [Y]ou can\u2019t bond with any child I think in foster care unless there is almost daily interaction for four to six hours a day . . . .\u201d It is clear from this record, therefore, that the lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship between the respondent and the child was the direct result of the fact that the child was in foster care apart from the respondent for almost the entire period of time between the birth and the adjudication date.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Section 45a-717 (f) (3) defines an \u201congoing parent child relationship\u201d as \u201cthe relationship that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met on a continuing, day-to-day basis the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the child.\u201d We have recognized that the statutory definition \u201cis inherently ambiguous when applied to noncustodial parents who must maintain their relationships with their children through visitation.\u201d <em>In re Jessica M., </em>supra, 467-68. In such a case, we held that \u201cthe ultimate question is whether <em>the child </em>has no present memories or feelings for the natural parent.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Until now, however, we have not been required to apply this definition to a case, like this, where the child involved is virtually a newborn infant whose present feelings can hardly be discerned with any reasonable degree of confidence. We agree with the implicit conclusion of the trial court in this case that, in such a case, the inquiry must focus, not on the feelings of the infant, but on the positive feelings of the natural parent.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Furthermore, until now we have not been required to consider a case in which coterminous petitions for custody and termination of parental rights have been filed virtually upon the birth of the child, and where, by virtue of the custody petition, the newborn child has been in foster care from the date of discharge from the hospital to the date of the adjudication of a lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Against this background, therefore, we consider the question of whether our statutory framework regarding commitment and termination, reasonably construed, permits termination of parental rights upon the basis of the lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship in the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>This consideration involves the intersection of two separate but closely related statutes: \u00a7 46b-129, which permits the petitioner, pursuant to court order, to obtain custody of a child under specified circumstances; and \u00a7 45a-717 <em>(f) </em>(3), which permits the court to terminate parental rights where the petitioner establishes the lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship. We do not read those two statutes to enable the petitioner to gain and maintain custody of a newborn infant pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 under circumstances, as in this case, that will lead almost inevitably to the ground for termination under \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (3). A contrary conclusion would violate well established principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Statutes are to be construed consistently with other relevant statutes, because we presume that the legislature intended to create a coherent body of law. <em>Baybank Connecticut, N.A. </em>v. <em>Thumlert, </em>supra. We therefore read \u00a7 46b-129 so as to be consistent with \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (3). Under \u00a7 46b-129 (b), the respondent may establish the grounds for temporary custody of the child by a \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard of proof, and under \u00a7 46b-129 (d) may establish the grounds for commitment for eighteen months by a preponderance of the evidence. By contrast, under \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (3), the petitioner must establish the ground for termination by clear and convincing evidence. As the facts of this case demonstrate, however, once the child had been placed in foster care pursuant to the determinations made under \u00a7 46b-129, a finding of a lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship three and one-half months later was inevitable under \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (3), because absent extraordinary and heroic efforts by the respondent, the petitioner was destined to have established the absence of such a relationship. Thus, a factual predicate for custody, established by the lesser standard of a preponderance of the evidence, led inexorably, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>all practical purposes, to the factual predicate for termination required to be established by the higher standard of clear and convincing evidence. We do not believe it would be consistent to read the two statutes together so as to contemplate such a scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Furthermore, statutes are to be read so as to avoid bizarre results. <em>State </em>v. <em>Uretek, Inc., </em>207 Conn. 706, 719, 543 A.2d 709 (1988). A parent, faced with a petition for custody under \u00a7 46b-129, may feel that she is unable to care properly for her newborn infant and, therefore, may acquiesce in that petition, as occurred in this case. That acquiescence, moreover, was in the child\u2019s best interests. To permit that acquiescence to ripen into a ground for termination of parental rights, however, simply by virtue of the practical impossibility of maintaining the kind of contact with the child required to establish an ongoing parent-child relationship, would turn the statutory promise of appropriate care for the child into a cruel statutory hoax of termination of parental rights. We do not believe that the two statutes contemplate such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Finally, statutes are to be read so as to avoid, rather than to create, constitutional questions. <em>French </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Local Union 376, </em>203 Conn. 624, 636-37, 526 A.2d 861 (1987). In <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 U.S. 422, 424, 102 S. Ct. 1148, 71 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1982), the United States Supreme Court held that a state may not \u201cterminate a complainant\u2019s cause of action because a state official, for reasons beyond the complainant\u2019s control, failed to comply with a statutorily mandated procedure.\u201d Although the bases of the decision varied among the various members of the court, the case is susceptible of the broad reading, advanced by the respondent in this case, that a state may not, consistent with due process of law, create the conditions that will strip an individual of an interest protected under the due process clause. Under the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>cumstances of this case, the petitioner\u2019s assertion and maintenance of custody of the child led directly to the conditions supporting the termination of parental rights. If we were to read \u00a7 46b-129 so as to create the conditions for termination under \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (3), the constitutionality of the statutory scheme, as applied to the facts of this case, would be in serious jeopardy under <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>supra. We therefore read the statutes so as to avoid such a question.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7\u00a7 46b-129 and 45a-717 (f) (3) cannot be read together so as to permit the custody determinations made under the first statute to lead directly to the termination determination made under the second statute. Under the facts of this case, this conclusion fatally undermines the finding of a lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship under \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court with direction to remand the case to the trial court with direction to render judgment for the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717 was formerly found at General Statutes \u00a7 45-61f, the statutory location in effect at the time of the trial court proceedings in this case. For purposes of clarity and simplicity, we refer herein to the current statutory sections.</p>\n<p id=\"Adq\">General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717, formerly \u00a7 45-61f, provides as follows: \u201ctermination OF PARENTAL RIGHTS. CONDUCT OF HEARING. INVESTIGATION AND REPORT, grounds FOR termination, (a) At the hearing held on any petition for the termination of parental rights filed in the court of probate under section 45a-715, or filed in the superior court under section 17a-112, or transferred to the superior court from the court of probate under section 45a-715, any party to whom notice was given shall have the right to appear and be heard with respect to the petition. If the parent who is consenting to the termination of his parental rights appears at the hearing on the petition for termination of parental rights, the court shall explain to the parent the meaning and consequences of termination of parental rights. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the appearance of a consenting parent at the hearing regarding the termination of his parental rights except as otherwise provided by court order.</p>\n<p id=\"ANT\">\u201c(b) If a party appears without counsel, the court shall inform him of his right thereto and upon request, if he is unable to pay for counsel, shall appoint counsel to represent him. No party may waive counsel unless the court has first explained the nature and meaning of a petition for the termination of parental rights. Unless the appointment of counsel is required under section 46b-136, the court may appoint counsel to represent or appear on behalf of any child in a hearing held under this section to speak on behalf of the best interests of the child. If the respondent parent is unable to pay for his own counsel or if the child or the parent or guardian of the child is unable to pay for the child\u2019s counsel, in the case of a superior court matter, the reasonable compensation of counsel appointed for the respondent parent or the child shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the judicial department and, in the case of a probate court matter, the reasonable compensation of counsel appointed for the respondent parent or the child shall be established by the probate court administrator and paid from the probate court administration fund.</p>\n<p id=\"Aum\">\u201c(c) The court shall, if a claim for paternity has been filed in accordance with section 46b-172a, continue the hearing under the provisions of this section until the claim for paternity is adjudicated, provided the court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>combine the hearing on the claim for paternity with the hearing on the termination of parental rights petition.</p>\n<p id=\"As7\">\u201c(d) Upon finding at the hearing or at any time during the pendency of the petition that reasonable cause exists to warrant an examination, the court, on its own motion or on motion by any party, may order the child to be examined at a suitable place by a physician, psychiatrist or licensed clinical psychologist appointed by the court. The court may also order examination of a parent or custodian whose competency or ability to care for a child before the court is at issue. The expenses of any examination if ordered by the court on its own motion shall be paid for by the petitioner or, if ordered on motion by a party, shall be paid for by the party moving for such an examination unless such party or petitioner is unable to pay such expenses in which case, in a superior court matter, they shall be paid for by funds appropriated to the judicial department and in a probate court matter, they shall be paid from the probate court administration fund. The court may consider the results of the examinations in ruling on the merits of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"ArtF\">\u201c(e) (1) The court may, and in any contested case shall, request the commissioner of children and youth services or any child-placing agency licensed by the commissioner to make an investigation and written report to it, within ninety days from the receipt of such request. The report shall indicate the physical, mental and emotional status of the child and shall contain such facts as may be relevant to determine whether the proposed termination of parental rights will be for the welfare of the child, including the physical, mental, social and financial condition of the natural parents, and any other factors which the commissioner or such agency finds relevant to determine whether the proposed termination will be for the welfare of the child. (2) If such a report has been requested, upon the expiration of such ninety-day period or upon receipt of the report, whichever is earlier, the court shall set a day for a hearing not more than thirty days thereafter. The court shall give reasonable notice of such adjourned hearing to all parties to the first hearing, including the child, if over fourteen years of age, and to such other persons as the court shall deem appropriate. (3) The report shall be admissible in evidence, subject to the right of any interested party to require that the person making it appear as a witness, if available, and subject himself to examination.</p>\n<p id=\"AB9\">\u201c(f) At the adjourned hearing or at the initial hearing where no investigation and report has been requested, the court may approve the petition terminating the parental rights and may appoint a guardian of the person of the child, or if the petitioner requests, the court may appoint a statutory parent, if it finds, upon clear and convincing evidence that the termination is in the best interest of the child and that, with respect to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>eonsenting parent, such parent has voluntarily and knowingly consented to termination of his parental rights with respect to such child or that, with respect to any nonconsenting parent, over an extended period of time which, except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, shall not be less than one year: (1) The child has been abandoned by the parent in the sense that the parent has failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility as to the welfare of the child; or (2) the child has been denied, by reason of an act or acts of parental commission or omission, the care, guidance or control necessary for his physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being. Nonaccidental or inadequately explained serious physical injury to a child shall constitute prima facie evidence of acts of parental commission or omission sufficient for the termination of parental rights; or (3) there is no ongoing parent child relationship which is defined as the relationship that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met on a continuing, day-to-day basis the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the child and to allow further time for the establishment or reestablishment of the parent child relationship would be detrimental to the best interests of the child. If the court denies a petition for consent termination of parental rights, it may refer the matter to an agency to assess the needs of the child, the care the child is receiving, and the plan of the parent for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"AGfa\">\u201c(g) The court may waive the requirement that one year expire prior to the termination of parental rights if it finds from the totality of the circumstances surrounding the child that such a waiver is necessary to promote the best interest of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"A0v\">\u201c(h) Except in the case where termination is based on consent, in determining whether to terminate parental rights under this section, the court shall consider and shall make written findings regarding: (1) The timeliness, nature and extent of services offered or provided to the parent and the child by an agency to facilitate the reunion of the child with the parent; (2) the terms of any applicable court order entered into and agreed upon by any individual or agency and the parent, and the extent to which all parties have fulfilled their obligations under such order; (3) the feelings and emotional ties of the child with respect to his parents, any guardian of his person and any person who has exercised physical care, custody or control of the child for at least one year and with whom the child has developed significant emotional ties; (4) the age of the child; (5) the efforts the parent has made to adjust his circumstances, conduct, or conditions to make it in the best interest of the child to return him to his home in the foreseeable future, including, but not limited to, (A) the extent to' which the parent has maintained contact with the child as part of an effort to reunite the child with the parent, provided the court may give weight to incidental visi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ations, communications or contributions and (B) the maintenance of regular contact or communication with the guardian or other custodian of the child; and (6) the extent to which a parent has been prevented from maintaining a meaningful relationship with the child by the unreasonable act or conduct of the other parent of the child, or the unreasonable act of any other person or by the economic circumstances of the parent.</p>\n<p id=\"AOW\">\u201c(i) If the parental rights of only one parent are being terminated, the remaining parent shall be sole parent and, unless otherwise provided by law, guardian of the person.</p>\n<p id=\"ATg\">\u201cO\u2019) Consent for termination of the parental rights of one parent does not diminish the parental rights of the other parent of the child, nor does it relieve the other parent of the duty to support the child.</p>\n<p id=\"A6j\">\u201c(k) In the case where termination of parental rights is granted based on consent, the guardian of the person or statutory parent shall report to the court within ninety days on a case plan, as defined by the Federal Child Welfare Act of 1980, for the child. At least every six months thereafter, a report shall be made to the court on the implementation of the plan. The court shall review the plan for the child no less than once a year until such time as any proposed adoption plan has become finalized.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b519-9\"> The father of the infant has not appealed from the judgment of the trial court terminating Ms parental rights with respect to the infant involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b519-10\"> Our grant of certification; see <em>In re Valerie D., </em>221 Conn. 901, 600 A.2d 1029 (1992); referred to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112, rather than General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717, for the statutory basis for termination of parental rights in this case. Section \u00a7 17a-112 governs such termination regarding a child previously committed to the custody of the commissioner of children and youth services. In this case, however, there were coterminous petitions for such a commitment and for termination of parental rights, a procedure authorized by \u00a7 17a-112 (e). Under that procedure, the court in terminating parental rights does so pursuant to \u00a7 45a-717. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (e). Although the petitioner in her pleadings relied on General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 17-43a, the statutory predecessor to \u00a7 17a-112, both the trial court and the Appellate Court relied on \u00a7 45a-717.

The most common cause for this condition is stress to the baby from a precipitous delivery which here most probably had resulted from the intravenous injection of cocaine during labor. . . . Only with vigorous and aggressive suctioning of her air passages before being fully delivered was Valerie able to start breathing and avoid . . . \u2018potential severe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>respiratory problems\u2019. . . . [T]he most medically probable explanation for this life-threatening condition [was] the mother\u2019s use of cocaine \u2018when she was leaking amniotic fluid and expecting to go into labor\u2019 . . . .\u201d Based upon its perception from the evidence that the child had aspirated the meconium, the court also found that, as a result of the respondent\u2019s injection of cocaine on the day of the child\u2019s birth, \u201c[s]tress from cocaine use at this stage precipitated the birth resulting in the baby\u2019s aspiration of meconium which only drastic and aggressive suctioning during the birth process prevented from fatality.\u201d The court also found that \u201cthe intravenous injection of cocaine into the bloodstream of the mother . . . after [the] initiation of labor, resulted in a tangible denial of proper care and attention physically . . .\u201d and that \u201cValerie almost died as a direct result of the mother\u2019s injection of cocaine after labor had begun.\u201d Finally, the court concluded that \u201cValerie suffered serious, life-threatening, physical injury at the instant of her birth because of her mother\u2019s deliberate intravenous injection of cocaine after beginning labor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A31\">These findings are flawed. First, the record is clear that the respondent injected the cocaine after her amniotic fluid had begun to leak, but several hours before the onset of labor. Thus, it was inaccurate to state that the respondent injected cocaine \u201cafter beginning labor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AU8\">More fundamentally, there was no evidence that the child had aspirated the meconium. Indeed, the evidence was clearly to the contrary. Although the child\u2019s pediatrician attributed the precipitous labor and the child\u2019s passage of meconium to the respondent\u2019s cocaine use, he also testified that the obstetrician suctioned the child\u2019s mouth before delivering the entire body and that when the child did breathe there had been no meconium aspirated. There was, therefore, no evidence from which the trial court could have inferred that the baby aspirated \u201cmeconium which only drastic and aggressive suctioning during the birth process prevented from fatality,\u201d or that the child \u201calmost died as a direct result of the mother\u2019s injection of cocaine after labor had begun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A82\">To the extent, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the child \u201csuffered serious, life-threatening, physical injury at the instant of her birth\u201d rested on the antecedent finding that the child had aspirated meconium, that conclusion is not supported by the record. The position of the petitioner on appeal does not, however, rest on those flawed findings.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayq\">Also flawed are the trial court\u2019s findings, and the petitioner\u2019s reliance thereon, regarding the child\u2019s need for two hospitalizations for pneumonia in September, 1989. There was no evidence connecting those hospitalizations with the respondent\u2019s cocaine use.</p>\n<p id=\"AqN\">In this connection, the trial court also concluded, not on the basis of any evidence but on the basis of its judicial notice of largely unspecified studies, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>that \u201c[c]ocaine babies are at risk for years of physical, neurological and intellectual problems, and need an extraordinarily sensitive degree of responsive, consistent, stable parenting,\u201d and that \u201c[c]urrent studies on \u2018cocaine babies\u2019 suggest neurological, intellectual and emotional deficits directly ascribable to maternal cocaine use during pregnancy may be anticipated as they grow older.\u201d On appeal, the respondent and the amici claim that these conclusions are not borne out by the medical literature to date. Since we have assumed that the evidence relied on by the petitioner would constitute serious physical injury, we need not resolve that debate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b533-5\"> \u201cAs a matter of statutory fiat, consideration of the best interests of the child cannot vitiate the necessity of compliance with the specified statutory standards for termination. <em>In re Barbara J., </em>215 Conn. 31, 45, 574 A.2d 203 (1990); <em>In re Luis C., </em>210 Conn. 157, 165, 554 A.2d 722 (1989); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous)[ </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Children &amp; Youth Services, </em>177 Conn. 648, 671-72, 420 A.2d 875 (1979)]; see also O.

Mandatory reporting of the birth of a drug addicted child is really an absolute must. There is no other way for the state to know which children and which mothers are at need for crucial state services without some sort of data. We propose that any physician who has a reasonable cause to believe that a mother used drugs during her pregnancy, based on a particular set of physical symptoms of the child or the mother, must report the birth of this child to DCYS.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u201cWhen DCYS receives this report, they must conduct an investigation to be sure that the child will be leaving the hospital and going into a safe environment.

The same grapevine warns women <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>who want to keep their babies, to conceal their drug use at all costs, even if it means foregoing prenatal care, or delivering their child at home. These myths and half-truths, must be countered with aggressive outreach education and treatment efforts.

We were less clear at that time about what needed to be done. Initially, there was some talk of universal testing, and possible mandatory referral to DC YS or the Department of Health Services. Six months later, and literally hundreds of conversations, meetings and consultations with experts, we are unequivocally opposed to such measures, some of which are included in [House Bill No. 5205]. A clear consensus has [e]merged regarding principles for developing legislation and programs for substance abusing women and their children. These principles have been endorsed by a coalition for the Coalition for Children\u2019s platform, an organization representing over 150 organizations throughout the state.</p>\n<p id=\"AXMq\">\u201cFirst and foremost, the focus of any legislation must be on the provision of appropriate comprehensive services to substance abusing women and their children. . . . The overarching principle, though, is that if we want to reach the children, we\u2019ve got to reach the moms.</p>\n<p id=\"ArC\">\u201cSecondly, any measures which discourage prenatal care, substance abuse treatment or early intervention services for children, should be opposed. This includes punitive measures, as well as measures which give even the appearance of threat or punishment. For this reason, mandatory referral toDCYS . . . [is] opposed. . . . Parents should only be reported to DCYS in those cases where the child is suspected to be at risk or abused according to the current statutory definition.\u201d Conn.

This is apparent from the date and entire context of the articulation, and from the facts that the court described the adjudication date of the coterminous neglect petition to be \u201c(as of 11/8/89),\u201d that November 8, 1989, was the date of the last amendment of the termination petition, and that the court specifically found that there was no parent-child \u201crelationship between Valerie and her parents on November 8, 1989.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\"> The respondent testified that she fed the child at each feeding, except the 1 a.m. feeding, and kept the child in the room at times and held her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\"> According to the testimony of Kathy Dayner, the DCYS treatment social worker for the child, there was no bus or taxi transportation available between Bristol and Plantsville.

The pattern of interaction with the child reported by the foster mother also corresponds to the one observed in the office. There it is the mother who takes a stronger interest in the child, in holding the child and in interacting with the child, the father doing so at the request of the mother and only for short times. One does not observe a sense of emotional connection between the parents and this child. In a mechanical sense, the behavior exhibited toward the child by the mother is satisfactory.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\"> Mantell testified that \u201cI don\u2019t think there is [such a relationship]\u2014I don\u2019t know to whom the child might be attached, and my impression was that the child was not able to relate to either parent. The child showed no responses to me that indicated that the child recognized either parent, or was responding selectively to either parent. As far as the parents themselves are concerned, the father spoke to me about his interest in the child, and the fact that he sees the child as being a part of himself. But when I had an opportunity to see him with the child, I did not see him show that kind of interest in the child. The mother did not make a comparably strong</p>\n<p id=\"Adl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>statement to me about her sense of connection to the child, and I saw a greater interest on her part in holding the child, but I did not sense that she felt bonded with this child, as one would sense ordinarily when a parent or a mother is holding her own child. . . . [M]y sense of it is, I saw a mother holding a baby. I did not have the sense, of, I am holding my baby. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"Akg\">Mantell defined \u201cbonding\u201d as a process that \u201cgenerally . . . begins at the time that a pregnancy begins, and reflects an ongoing sense of interest on the part of . . . the mother ... in that child and in that child\u2019s development .... It shows itself after the birth of the child by spending as much time as you can with the child, and holding and nurturing . . . and caring for the child. And it shows itself in the sense of intimacy that others can observe in the contacts that occur between the parent and the child.\u201d He testified that he did not observe that kind of intimacy between the respondent and the child.</p>\n<p id=\"A3h\">In contrast, Patricia Ann Pastor, the foster mother, described the respondent\u2019s interaction with the child as \u201c[g]reat.\u201d She expanded on this as follows: \u201cshe does well with her. I usually try to time [the respondent\u2019s visit] so it\u2019s feeding time for the baby, and she does very well with her. She\u2019s not afraid of her. She gets a little nervous once in a while, because the child is sick a lot . . . [S]he doesn\u2019t get all upset if . . . the least little thing happens. It\u2019s . . . like any normal mother and newborn, is the best that I know how to put it.\u201d Pastor also testified that, on her visits to the child, the respondent \u201cmostly interacts with the baby, or . . . she only asks questions about the baby.\u201d She testified further that the respondent brought presents for the child\u2014on October 19, a stuffed teddy bear, a rattle and \u201clittle play keys that . . . used to be her sister\u2019s\u201d; on December 8, a pair of dress shoes; and at Christmas, a stuffed musical lamb. Pastor also catalogued the respondent\u2019s visits to the child and telephone calls about her, after the adjudication date of November 8, 1989, as follows: telephone calls on November 28 and November 29, a visit on December 8, telephone calls on December 30 and 31, 1989, January 11, 1990, and a visit on January 13, 1990. Pastor also explained that no visits or calls were possible between December 21 and 27, 1989, when she and her family were on vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"A_b\">It is clear, however, that the trial court accepted Mantell\u2019s opinion regarding the relationship between the respondent and the child, and did not credit Pastor\u2019s testimony. We proceed, therefore, upon the assumption that the trial court\u2019s finding regarding a lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship between the respondent and the child is adequately supported by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b553-6\"> We also followed the lead of the Appellate Court; <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-6), </em>2 Conn.
