Tableman, to dissolve, modify or vacate prejudgment remedies of attachment and garnishment. The defendants appealed from the judgment of the trial court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The relevant facts are undisputed. The plaintiff and the named defendant, Linda Selby Tableman, dissolved their law partnership and agreed to split the fees to be recovered in two pending cases. In a dispute arising out of the settlement received in one of those cases, the plaintiff brought an action against Linda Tableman and her husband, Stephen D. Tableman.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-278e (a) (2) (D) and (E),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiff simultaneously secured an ex parte attachment on the defendants\u2019 home, a garnishment of funds, including earnings, owed to Stephen Tableman by his employer, and a garnishment of a bank account of the defendants. The defendants claimed insufficiency of process, insufficiency of service of process and want of personal jurisdiction, and filed a motion to dismiss the action pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 143.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>defendants also filed a motion to dissolve the prejudgment remedies pursuant to \u00a7 52-278e (c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After a hearing on April 8, 1991, the trial court dismissed the complaint for insufficiency of service and dissolved the attachment of the defendants\u2019 home as improperly served. The trial court also dissolved the garnishment as to Stephen Tableman\u2019s earnings. The court noted, however, in its memorandum of decision issued April 18, 1991, that the \u201cplaintiff may re-serve the process found to have been defectively served.\u201d The trial court found, further, on the basis of evidence presented at the April 8, 1991 hearing, that the plaintiff had established probable cause to sustain prejudgment remedies and, accordingly, authorized attachment of the defendants\u2019 home and the garnishment of funds other than earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The plaintiff served the defendants with a corrected summons and complaint on April 19, 1991, together with an order for the prejudgment remedies of attachment and garnishment, based on the previous probable cause finding. The trial court clerk neither assigned a new docket number nor collected a docketing fee from the plaintiff. Instead, above the return date on the order for prejudgment remedies, the clerk wrote in the docket number assigned to the original action. Counsel for both parties subsequently signed a stipulation for a temporary restraining order bearing the original docket number. Thereafter, on May 24, 1991, the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>filed an answer to the plaintiffs complaint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendants then, for the first time, challenged the use of the original docket number on the order for prejudgment remedies, claiming that the writ and summons on which the attachment and garnishment were based had never been properly returned. The defendants filed a second motion to dissolve the prejudgment remedies, and a motion to enter judgment in the April 8, 1991 proceeding. After a hearing on June 17, 1991, the trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motions and granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for supplemental prejudgment remedies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The plaintiff claims at the outset that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>cally, the plaintiff claims that because the defendants did not appeal the April 18, 1991 trial court rulings within seven days, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 <em>52-278l, </em>they waived their right to appeal those rulings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiff asserts, moreover, that the defendants\u2019 second motion to dissolve prejudgment remedies challenged an <em>existing </em>prejudgment remedy granted after a hearing and, therefore, was governed by General Statutes \u00a7 52-278k.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends, therefore, that the June 17, 1991 trial court ruling on the defendants\u2019 second motion to dissolve was not an appealable final judgment within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 <em>52-2781. </em>See <em>City National Bank </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>181 Conn. 42, 45-46, 434 A.2d 310 (1980). We agree with the plaintiff that the defendants waived their right to appeal the April 18, 1991 rulings. We conclude, however, that the trial court\u2019s June 17, 1991 ruling on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the defendants\u2019 second motion to dissolve prejudgment remedies was an appealable final judgment pursuant to \u00a7 52-278l.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s re-served summons and complaint included an application for prejudgment remedies identical to the application on which the trial court had based its April 18, 1991 decision. The trial court, in ruling on the defendants\u2019 second motion to dissolve prejudgment remedies, expressly incorporated the findings of the April 18, 1991 memorandum of decision. See footnote 7, supra. In addition, the defendants were given the opportunity, at the June 17, 1991 hearing, to present additional evidence as to the validity of the prejudgment remedies. Finally, the trial court, on June 17, 1991, granted the plaintiff\u2019s supplemental application for a prejudgment remedy garnishing another bank account owned by the defendants. The defendants have appealed the trial court\u2019s rulings on their second motion to dissolve prejudgment remedies and on the plaintiff\u2019s supplemental application for prejudgment garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">We are persuaded that the trial court\u2019s June 17, 1991 ruling on the defendant\u2019s second motion to dissolve prejudgment remedies is a final judgment within the meaning of \u00a7 <em>52-278l </em>(a) (2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial court, at the June 17, 1991 hearing, reviewed and ruled anew on the validity of the prejudgment remedies that it had considered at the April 8, 1991 hearing. The record thus reveals that the trial court treated the plaintiff\u2019s reserved application for prejudgment remedies as a newly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>filed application under \u00a7 52-278e. With respect to the June 17, 1991 rulings, moreover, the defendants complied with the time provisions of \u00a7 <em>52-278l </em>(b) and Practice Book \u00a7 4009. The defendants\u2019 appeal from the June 17, 1991 rulings of the trial court is, therefore, both jurisdictionally appropriate and timely. <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>177 Conn. 173, 176-78, 413 A.2d 819, appeal dismissed, 444 U.S. 801, 100 S. Ct. 20, 62 L. Ed. 2d 14 (1979); <em>Giordano Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>182 Conn. 577, 438 A.2d 772 (1980); see also Practice Book \u00a7 4000.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The defendants rely first upon General Statutes \u00a7 52-259 to support their claim that the trial court should have granted their motion to dissolve the prejudgment remedies order. The defendants argue that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to pay an entry fee pursuant to \u00a7 52-259 (a) deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over the re-served complaint. The defendants also assert that the continued use of the docket number assigned to the prejudgment remedy application that was originally filed was improper because the trial court had dismissed the original complaint on April 18, 1991. We have stated: \u201cPrejudgment attachment, although a useful and efficient remedy, can be harsh in its operation and liable to oppressive use because it is summary in its effects. Consequently, its application has been confined within the limits set by statute.\u201d <em>Ledgebrook Condominium Assn. </em>v. <em>Lusk Corporation, </em>172 Conn. 577, 584-85, 376 A.2d 60 (1977). We conclude, nonetheless, that the statutory procedural protections that are intended to benefit defendants in prejudgment remedy proceedings have been afforded the defendants in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Section 52-259 (a) provides that a fee shall be paid to the clerk \u201cfor entering . . . each civil cause in the superior court.\u201d The statute, however, does not pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>elude the trial court from assigning to a re-served process the docket number assigned to the original complaint. As the trial court observed, if it were otherwise, the court would have been forced to repeat the entire evidentiary hearing on the issue of probable cause that it had conducted on April 8, 1991. The purpose of a prejudgment remedy probable cause hearing is to satisfy the constitutional due process right of parties whose property rights are to be affected, to be heard \u201c \u2018at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ledgebrook Condominium Assn. </em>v. <em>Lusk, </em>supra, 583, quoting <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S. Ct. 1187, 14 L. Ed. 2d 62 (1965). The defendants concede the existence of probable cause and the lack of any substantive issue as to the validity of the prejudgment remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Assuming that the trial court clerk had a statutory duty to collect the entry fee pursuant to \u00a7 52-259 (a), we conclude, as did the trial court, that the plaintiff should not be penalized for the clerk\u2019s inaction, and that the clerk\u2019s inaction did not deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. \u201cIt is of course difficult to lay down a general rule to determine in all cases when the provisions of a statute are merely directory and when mandatory or inoperative, but, of all the rules mentioned, the test most satisfactory and conclusive is, whether the prescribed mode of action is of the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to matter material or immaterial\u2014to matter of convenience or of substance.\u201d <em>Gallup </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>59 Conn. 354, 358, 22 A. 334 (1890); see also <em>Hall Manor Owner\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>212 Conn. 147, 153, 561 A.2d 1373 (1989). Moreover, even if the assignment of a new docket number were necessary for the orderly maintenance of the trial court\u2019s computer files, as urged by the defendants, the plaintiff correctly observes that the administrative defect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>in this case could have been cured without dissolving the prejudgment remedies. For example, the trial court could have ordered the clerk to assign a new docket number to the re-served process and to collect the fee from the plaintiff. \u201cThe clerks of the court are merely recording officers; and if they make a mistake, the court may amend it. Their function is merely ministerial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>1 Conn. Cir. Ct. 427, 430, 186 A.2d 809, cert. denied, 150 Conn. 708, 204 A.2d 934 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The defendants also rely on <em>Van Mecklenberg </em>v. <em>Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 517, 494 A.2d 549 (1985), in support of their contention that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. In <em>Van Mecklenberg, </em>this court upheld the trial court\u2019s dismissal of an action where the plaintiff had failed to pay a filing fee with a motion to open the judgment of dismissal, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-259c.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trial court clerk had stamped the motion as \u201creceived\u201d but \u201cupon realizing that the required fee had not been paid, the clerk crossed out the . . . receipt date . . . and immediately returned it to the plaintiff.\u201d Id., 518. The plaintiff failed to refile the returned motion and pay the fee within the time period set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a and Practice Book \u00a7 326. The issue in <em>Van Mecklenberg, </em>therefore, was whether the relief sought by the plaintiff had been timely claimed, <em>not </em>whether the clerk\u2019s actions had deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. This court concluded that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the motion at issue was \u201cuntimely\u201d under the applicable statutory and Practice Book sections. Id., 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">In the present case, the clerk neither returned nor refused to accept the plaintiff\u2019s papers for nonpayment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>of the entry fee. The clerk simply accepted the papers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiffs actions, therefore, were governed by \u00a7 52-259 (a), which requires a fee \u201cfor entering . . . each civil cause.\u201d The civil cause had been entered. Accordingly, we reject the defendants\u2019 claim that \u00a7 52-259c applies in the present case. See footnote 12, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In <em>Bridgeport v. Debek, </em>210 Conn. 175, 178, 554 A.2d 728 (1989), the sheriff failed in timely fashion to serve certain defendants, who, in turn, failed to file a motion to dismiss in timely fashion. The trial court proceeded to grant various motions of the plaintiff, concluding that the sheriff\u2019s delay in service implicated personal jurisdiction but did not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction. We agreed with the trial court and stated: \u201cOur precedents make it abundantly clear that, except in the special circumstances of administrative appeals, defects in process do not deprive a court of subject matter jurisdiction. . . . The Superior Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction only if it has no competence to entertain the action before it.\u201d Id., 179-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The defendants in the present case do not claim that the trial court lacked \u201ccompetence to entertain\u201d the causes of action raised in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and to which the prejudgment remedies apply. Such causes of action are properly within the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court. Here, the trial court dismissed the original complaint and dissolved the real estate attachment because they were improperly served. The trial court issued its rulings with leave to the plaintiff to cure the defects and re-serve process. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 175 and 176; see 1 W. Moller &amp; W. Horton, Connecticut Practice, Practice Book Annotated (1992) \u00a7 174, authors\u2019 comments and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>The defendants, relying upon <em>Hillman </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>217 Conn. 520, 587 A.2d 99 (1991), assert that jurisdictional defects cannot be cured by re-service. In <em>Hillman, </em>this court concluded that the plaintiff \u201cfailed to comply in any fashion with [the] basic requirements\u201d of General Statutes \u00a7 52-45a when he served the original \u201cbare bones\u201d complaint <em>without </em>a writ of summons. Id., 524-26. Our decision in <em>Hillman, </em>however, did not turn on the lack of technical perfection or exacting conformity in the <em>form </em>of the plaintiffs filings. Id., 526. In <em>Hillman, </em>the plaintiff filed an \u201camended writ\u201d in an effort to avoid the statute of limitations. We did not suggest that the new, amended writ could not have had validity on its own. We held, rather, that the amended writ did not relate back to the defective writ, about which the defendant had complained in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">In the present case, the trial court concluded that although the filing of an \u201camended writ\u201d cured the insufficiencies in the process, it did not cure the defect in service of process on the defendants\u2019 counsel rather than directly on the defendants. After the second \u201camended writ\u201d was issued, supported by proper process, however, the trial court properly reinstated the attachment and garnishment, regardless of the payment of an entry fee or the assignment of a new docket number. Although the defendants had the right to another hearing, they waived that right when they filed an answer to the plaintiff\u2019s re-served complaint. See footnote 6, supra. We note, moreover, that the statute of limitations is not implicated in this case, as it was in <em>Hillman. </em>Accordingly, the trial court reasonably concluded that the matter continued as pending on the trial court docket and, therefore, required neither a new docket number nor payment of an entry fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">We conclude that the trial court in the present case was not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction by the plaintiffs failure to pay an entry fee with the re-served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>process and the clerk\u2019s failure to assign a new docket number. \u201c \u2018A court has subject matter jurisdiction if it has the authority to adjudicate a particular type of legal controversy. Such jurisdiction relates to the court\u2019s competency to exercise power, and not to the regularity of the court\u2019s exercise of that power. <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>[supra] . . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Malkowski, </em>189 Conn. 101, 105-106, 454 A.2d 275 (1983).\u201d <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 427, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988). The failure to collect an entry fee for the re-served complaint or to assign it a new docket number did not deprive the court of jurisdiction or presumptively prejudice the defendants. To strip the plaintiff of her prejudgment remedies would neither facilitate the business of the court nor advance justice, but rather would serve merely \u201c \u2018to exalt technicalities above substance.\u2019 \u201d <em>LaReau </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>158 Conn. 486, 494, 264 A.2d 576 (1969). Accordingly, we conclude that the defendants\u2019 appeal is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-259 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cThere shall be paid to the clerks for entering each appeal to the supreme court, or the appellate court, as the case may be, one hundred fifty dollars, and for each civil cause in the superior court, one hundred twenty-five dollars . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\"> In her complaint, the plaintiff set forth various claims, including larceny, fraud, unfair trade practices, breach of contract, conversion, and fraudulent conveyance.

An order shall be issued by the court setting forth the action it has taken.\u201d Section 52-278e (c) was amended by Public Acts 1991, No. 91 -315, \u00a7 1.

I find that the dismissal as to insufficiency of the prior process did not preclude the plaintiff from correctly serving the Complaint and returning it to court. I find that was <em>done.\u201d </em>The trial court also ruled: \u201cThe writ has now been returned to court and the defendants identify no deficiency in form or service upon them.
