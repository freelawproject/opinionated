After a jury trial, the defendant was found guilty of the crimes of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4), conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-134 (a) (4), burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2) and 53a-8, conspiracy to commit burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-101 (a) (2), and assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2) and SSa-8.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>him to concurrent sentences on the first four counts and a consecutive sentence on the fifth count for an effective term of sixteen years imprisonment. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The defendant and Everald Howard were charged as codefendants with the same crimes and were tried jointly. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>221 Conn. 447, 450-51, 604 A.2d 1294 (1992), affirming Howard\u2019s conviction, we noted the facts that the jury could reasonably have found.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u201cOn January 11, 1989, [the defendant], Charlyene Holmes, another person identified only as Jasper and [Everald Howard] agreed to steal $15,000 that Jasper and [Howard] believed was hidden in an apartment in a three-family house in Hartford.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They decided that Holmes would knock on the door to the apartment, in the hope that, because she was a woman, someone unsuspecting would open it and that they would then all enter the house and steal the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u201cThat evening, [the defendant], Holmes, Jasper and [Howard] drove to the house as agreed. Holmes checked the rear door of the first floor apartment and, finding it locked, returned to the car, where [Howard] handed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>her a loaded revolver. Approximately one-half hour later, Holmes, accompanied by [the defendant], who was wearing a mask, and [Howard], who was not, knocked on the door of the first floor apartment. Suzette Hutchinson came to the door and asked who was there. She opened the door after Holmes had falsely identified herself as \u2018Tuesday,\u2019<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hutchinson\u2019s sister. [The defendant], Holmes and [Howard] then pushed the door wide open and entered the kitchen of the apartment where Hutchinson had been watching television with Chesley Smith, her cousin, and Hilda Edwards, their grandmother. Holmes gave the revolver to [Howard], who pointed it at Hutchinson, Smith and Edwards and ordered them into the bedroom. Hutchinson and Smith complied, but Edwards remained in the kitchen because of her limited ability to walk. Already in the bedroom were several other relatives of Hutchinson: Roxanne Facey, her sister, Timothy Hester, her ten year old brother and Travalis Johnson, her four year old nephew. [Howard] pointed the revolver at the group in the bedroom and demanded money. Smith, Hutchinson and Facey gave [Howard] a total of $43.75. Meanwhile, Holmes searched the bedroom, overturning the bed, pulling off the mattress and tearing out dresser drawers, but failed to discover any money. [Howard] then threatened to shoot Smith if more money was not handed over. When Smith denied knowing about any other money in the apartment, [Howard] hit him on the head with the revolver. Smith knelt down and began crying. [Howard] then took him to another bedroom where he again hit him on the head with the revolver and punched him in the stomach and shoulders.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u201cWhile these events were unfolding, Edwards, the grandmother, was screaming from the kitchen. [Either Howard or the defendant] hit Edwards on the head to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>silence her, causing her to cry out louder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When Smith attempted to come to her aid, [Howard] prevented him from doing so. The search for money continued throughout the apartment until Holmes noticed a small basement room in which she discovered a pouch containing $15,000. Holmes, [the defendant] and [Howard] then ran from the house and later divided the money, [Howard] receiving $5000, Holmes receiving $4000, [the defendant] receiving $2000 and Jasper receiving $4000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The defendant has proffered numerous claims in support of his contention that his conviction must be overturned.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> First, he contends that the trial court should have granted his motion for acquittal, because of insufficiency of the evidence, on each of the charges of which he was convicted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, he maintains that the information charging him with burglary in the first degree was so defective that it either deprived the trial court of jurisdiction or misled the jury into convicting the defendant without a finding that the state had proven one essential element of the crime. Third, he argues that principles of double jeopardy forbid his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>viction of two conspiracies arising out of the same alleged agreement between the three conspirators. Fourth, he claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the trial court should have granted his motion to suppress, which challenged the reliability of his identification by Smith and Hutchinson. Fifth, he asserts that he is entitled to a new trial because the trial court abused its discretion in denying trial counsel access to Holmes\u2019 psychiatric records. We agree in part with the defendant\u2019s claims about the sufficiency of the evidence, but otherwise affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The defendant does not challenge the standard governing this court\u2019s review of claims relating to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a criminal conviction. \u201cWhether we review the findings of a trial court or the verdict of a jury, our underlying task is the same. . . . We first review the evidence presented at trial, construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the facts expressly found by the trial court or impliedly found by the jury. We then decide whether, upon the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the trial court or the jury could reasonably have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>218 Conn. 766, 770-71, 591 A.2d 1225 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roseboro, </em>221 Conn. 430, 434, 604 A.2d 1286 (1992). Applying that standard in this case, we conclude that the evidence presented by the state could reasonably have persuaded the jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant committed the first three crimes with which he was charged, robbery in the first degree, conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree and burglary in the first degree. There was, however, insufficient evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>dence to support the verdict on the fourth count, conspiracy to commit burglary in the first degree, or on the fifth count, assault in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">With respect to the charge of robbery in the first degree, the information charged the defendant with having \u201cused and/or threatened the immediate use of physical force upon another\u201d during the course of a larceny. The trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on this charge referred to the language of the statute without including any reference to the defendant\u2019s possible accessorial liability. In light of these instructions, the defendant maintains that he is entitled to an acquittal because there was no evidence that he personally threatened anyone or that his actions were taken in the course of committing a larceny. We disagree with both of these assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Under the governing statutes, \u201c[a] person commits robbery when, in the course of committing a larceny, he uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person for the purpose of: (1) Preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or to the retention thereof immediately after the taking; or (2) compelling the owner of such property or another person to deliver up the property or to engage in other conduct which aids in the commission of the larceny.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133. A person has committed robbery in the first degree if, \u201cin the course of the commission of the crime . . . he or another participant in the crime . . . uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\u201cThe use or threatened use of immediate physical force is the element which distinguishes larceny from robbery.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>189 Conn. 114, 123, 454 A.2d 1274 (1983). \u201c[I]f the use of force occurs during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the continuous sequence of events surrounding the taking . . . even though some time immediately before or after, it is considered to be \u2018in the course of the robbery . . . within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ghere, </em>201 Conn. 289, 297, 513 A.2d 1226 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The jury could reasonably have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant forced his way onto the premises, in the company of two other persons, one or another of whom was at all times brandishing a gun. By their words and conduct, acting in concert, all three made it clear that they would brook no interference in their search for the property they expected to find. The defendant personally, by his presence and his manner, intimidated Edwards, with whom he remained while the others were herded into another room. Hutchinson and Hester testified that they had heard Edwards cry out, and Smith testified that the defendant was in the kitchen with Edwards at that time and that after-wards Edwards had visible bruises on the side of her head. \u201c[T]he threat of immediate bodily injury or death need not be directed at the owner himself; it may be made to a member of his family, or other relative, or even to someone in his company, though there be no threat to do harm to the owner himself.\u201d 2 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law (1986) \u00a7 8.11, p. 448. If the jury found this evidence credible, it sufficed to establish that the defendant had himself participated in conduct that can fairly be considered intimidating.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The defendant next claims that there was no evidence that he participated in a larceny, because the state failed to establish: (1) the rightful ownership of the $15,000; (2) the defendant\u2019s personal role in the taking of the $43.75; or (3) the defendant\u2019s personal taking of any other personal property, such as jewelry from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the top of a dresser in the apartment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the state adduced sufficient evidence to allow the jury to find the defendant guilty of larceny with respect to the $15,000 taken from the apartment, we need not consider what other property the jury might have found to have been wrongfully appropriated.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The defendant maintains that the state cannot establish his participation in the commission of a larceny without proving who owned the $15,000 that Holmes, Howard and the defendant took from the premises. The defendant does not dispute, at this juncture, the sufficiency of the evidence to establish his participation in the taking of this money. He relies, however, on General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which defines the crime of larceny as the wrongful taking, obtaining or withholding of property \u201cfrom an owner.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-118 (5) defines the term \u201cowner\u201d as \u201cany person who has a right to possession superior to that of a taker, obtainer or withholder.\u201d The defendant contends that the state had to show not only that someone else had physical possession of the money but that that person had a \u201cright to possession superior\u201d to that of the defendant, and that the state failed to meet this statutory burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In order to assess who had a \u201cright to possession superior\u201d to that of the defendant, it is important to identify what the record shows about the defendant\u2019s interest in the $15,000. Holmes testified that she thought the money was drug money and that it was being held by a friend of Jasper\u2019s, with whom Jasper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>had had a misunderstanding. The defendant never claimed any ownership rights to the money except insofar as he was acting as agent for Jasper. The defendant\u2019s suggestion that he was acting on behalf of the rightful owner of the money is undermined by the evidence that the defendant gained entry by having Holmes misidentify herself as someone else, by the defendant\u2019s wearing a mask throughout the incident, and by the defendant\u2019s retention of a part of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Holmes\u2019 testimony established that the $15,000 was taken from the apartment. The occupants of the apartment, with the exception of \u201cTuesday,\u201d disclaimed knowledge of, or of interest in, the money. The jury could, however, have inferred that \u201cTuesday\u201d had possessory rights to the money at least superior to that of the defendant. Police Officer Katherine Perez testified about \u201cTuesday\u2019s\u201d conduct when she returned to the apartment after the robbery. \u201cTuesday\u201d did not inquire into the injuries sustained by any of her family members, but complained loudly about their improvidence in opening the door to strangers. Intent upon discovering whether she had lost anything, she immediately ran to her room and began looking for something there. The jury might, furthermore, have attached some significance to Holmes\u2019 use of \u201cTuesday\u2019s\u201d name to gain entry into the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">This court has not defined with specificity what the state must prove with regard to the victim\u2019s interest in the property, when that interest is arguably something less than full possessory ownership. Emphasizing actual possession, we have held that the statutory definition encompasses property held by someone who, although not its owner, was in lawful possession thereof. <em>State </em>v. Taylor, 196 Conn. 225, 229, 492 A.2d 155 (1985). Emphasizing constructive possession, we have held that lost property may be the subject of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>larceny. <em>State </em>v. <em>Courtsol, </em>89 Conn. 564, 567-68, 94 A. 973 (1915); <em>Ransom </em>v. <em>State, </em>22 Conn. 153, 160 (1852).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The state\u2019s evidence established, at a minimum, that someone other than the defendant and his confederates had custody or control of the money that they appropriated. In accordance with the view of courts in other jurisdictions that have considered this question, we hold that a showing that the victim had custody or control over the appropriated property is sufficient to support a charge of larceny. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>384 Mich. 71, 79-80, 179 N.W.2d 617 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carlos, 187 </em>N.J. Super. 406, 412, 455 A.2d 89 (1982); <em>People </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>56 N.Y.2d 868, 869, 438 N.E.2d 1109, 453 N.Y.S.2d 394 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Land, </em>681 S.W.2d 589, 591 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1984).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This position is sustained by Professors LaFave and Scott, who note: \u201cMany modern codes expressly provide, as does the Model Penal Code, that property may be the subject of theft even though the \u2018victim\u2019 is a person whose interest in the property is unlawful. This is as it should be. \u2018It is inconsistent with the objectives of the criminal law of theft to permit one who wrongfully appropriates wealth to escape from liability merely because the victim of the misappropriation has also incurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>criminal liability of forfeiture of his rights with respect to the property.\u2019 \u201d 2 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, supra, \u00a7 8.4, p. 356, quoting Model Penal Code (1980) \u00a7 223.2, comment 4, p. 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We agree with the state that the evidence adduced with respect to the $15,000 taken from the apartment was sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict on larceny as a component of the charge of robbery. The defendant was therefore not entitled to an acquittal on the charge of robbery in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">With respect to the charge of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, the information charged that the defendant, with the intent to commit a robbery in the first degree, had agreed with Howard and Holmes \u201cto use and/or threaten the immediate use of physical force upon another in the course of committing a larceny, that another participant in the crime displayed what was represented to be a firearm, and that an overt act was committed in pursuance of such conspiracy.\u201d As the defendant defines the scope of the conspiratorial agreement, only the events that were planned before the entry into the apartment have relevance. The defendant, therefore, renews his claim that the state has not proven the commission of a larceny in the taking of the $15,000, the only personal property whose taking could have been the object of a prior agreement. He also denies the existence of a prior agreement either that physical force be used or threatened or that another participant use a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">We have already concluded that the defendant cannot prevail on his argument that the taking of the $15,000 did not constitute a larceny. The defendant maintains, however, that proof of the larceny does not establish the remaining elements of the conspiracy with which he was charged. He denies the existence of a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>agreement either that physical force be used or threatened or that another participant use a firearm. The crucial issue to be resolved is, accordingly, the scope of a conspiratorial agreement. If two or more persons conspire to take particular property from someone who has a superior right of possession, and agree to do so peacefully, do subsequent changes in the modus operandi to accomplish the taking operate to discharge a willing participant from culpability?</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The applicable principle of the law of criminal conspiracy was delineated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ghere, </em>supra, 299, in which, relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>160 Conn. 140, 150, 274 A.2d 153 (1970), we held that the requisite agreement or confederation may be inferred from proof of the separate acts of the individuals accused as coconspirators and from the circumstances surrounding the commission of these acts. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 607, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991). The fact that the defendant stood by silently when a gun was displayed in order to gain entry and then to intimidate the occupants of the premises is evidence from which the jury might reasonably have inferred the defendant\u2019s acquiescence in this enlarged criminal enterprise. The fact that the defendant had available a mask to conceal his identity might reasonably have supported the jury\u2019s finding that he understood that he was engaged in an illegal endeavor and was prepared to see it through. Wherever the initial illegal conspiracy led the defendant and his confederates, \u201c[i]t was enough if they knowingly engaged in a mutual plan to do a forbidden act.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>supra, 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">With respect to the charge of being an accessory to burglary in the first degree, the defendant contends that the state failed to prove that he intended to commit a crime in the apartment, or that he acted reck<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>lessly. Under the accessorial liability statute, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8, the state was required to prove that the defendant was \u201cacting with the mental state required for commission of [that] offense.\u201d Under the first degree burglary statute, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a), the state was required to prove that the defendant \u201center[ed] or remain[ed] unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein and ... (2) in the course of committing the offense . . . intentionally, knowingly or recklessly inflict[ed] or attempted] to inflict bodily injury on anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the state failed to prove that he entered the apartment with the \u201cintent to commit a crime\u201d therein is fatally undermined, as his brief acknowledges, by our conclusion that the state adduced sufficient evidence to sustain the defendant\u2019s conviction for robbery. The defendant\u2019s masked entry, in the company of a confederate brandishing a gun, supports the jury\u2019s finding that he intended unlawfully and forcibly to enter the apartment in order to appropriate $15,000 to which someone else had a superior possessory interest. This evidence sufficed to prove his \u201cintent to commit a crime\u201d on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The defendant maintains that his conviction for accessory to burglary in the first degree also required proof of at least recklessness on his part with respect to Howard\u2019s infliction of bodily injury on the occupants of the apartment. It is disingenuous for the defendant to argue that he expected the $15,000 to be taken without violence once he became aware of the gun that was being wielded first by Holmes and then by Howard. He claims, however, that, even if he was aware that his accomplices had a gun, \u201cthere is simply no evidence on this record tending to show that he was aware of any risk, much less a substantial one, that it would be used to hit Chesley Smith.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The gist of the defendant\u2019s argument is that the charge of being an accessory to burglary in the first degree requires proof of the same mental state as is required to prove a charge of burglary in the first degree. The state responds by citing <em>State </em>v. <em>McCal</em>pine, 190 Conn. 822, 832, 463 A.2d 545 (1983), in which we interpreted our accessory statute to allow an accomplice to be found guilty even though he did not \u201cknow of or endorse every act of his co-participant[s] in crime.\u201d We stated, further, that the accessory was not required to \u201cpossess the intent to commit the specific degree\u201d of the crime charged. Id., 832-33. The issue before the court in <em>McCalpine </em>was not, however, the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction but the persuasiveness of a belated and unpreserved attack on the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury. Moreover, our statement about the intent of an accessory was dictum, in light of the elements of the crime at issue in <em>McCalpine. </em>Id., 831 n.7.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">To support its dictum, <em>the McCalpine </em>court cited <em>State </em>v. <em>Parham, </em>174 Conn. 500, 506-509, 391 A.2d 148 (1978). It is not clear, however, that <em>Parham </em>stands for that proposition. It is true that, in <em>Parham, </em>the trial court charged the jury \u201cthat when more than one person participates in a burglary in the course of which one participant commits an act which raises the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>to the more serious crime of burglary in the first degree by \u2018intentionally, knowingly or recklessly\u2019 inflicting or attempting to inflict bodily injury on anyone, each participant in the burglary is guilty of the aggravated offense and it is without significance that such other participant was without knowledge of the other\u2019s conduct which caused the physical injury or that he himself had no intention to cause such injury.\u201d Id., 506-507. This court found \u201cno error in this portion of the court\u2019s charge.\u201d Id., 507. The rule of law discussed in <em>McCalpine </em>was not, however, the basis of the defendant\u2019s challenge to the instruction in <em>Parham. </em>Rather, the defendant objected to this portion of the charge by \u201carguing that the statute required that to be found guilty of the aggravated offense the defendant\u2014as opposed to an accomplice or coparticipant\u2014must inflict or attempt to inflict bodily injury.\u201d Id. Although the defendant claimed error in the jury charge regarding intent, the opinion in <em>Parham </em>does not describe the gravamen of this claim. It may have been wedded to his claim, which the court found unpersuasive, that he personally would have to be proven to have at least attempted to inflict bodily injury. It therefore is not clear whether <em>Parham </em>supports the proposition stated in dictum in <em>McCalpine, </em>that an accessory need not be proved to possess the intent to commit the specific degree of the crime charged.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">When we revisited the intent question in <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>202 Conn. 520, 522 A.2d 277 (1987), the issue was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>as in this case, the sufficiency of the evidence of guilt. In this context, without expressly overruling our statements in <em>McCalpine or Parham, </em>we held that \u201caccessorial liability is predicated upon the actor\u2019s state of mind at the time of his actions, and whether that state of mind is commensurate to the state of mind required for the commission of the offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>supra, 532. Emphasizing that \u201caccessorial liability is not a distinct crime, but only an alternative means by which a substantive crime maybe committed\u201d; id.; we concluded that \u201ca person may be held liable as an accessory . . . if he has the requisite culpable mental state for the commission of the substantive offense . . . .\u201d Id., 533. Moreover, we observed that Connecticut\u2019s accessory statute represents \u201cthe same approach\u201d as that of the Model Penal Code, and quoted with approval the code\u2019s position on the requisite intent of an accessory: \u201c \u2018[C]omplicity in conduct causing a particular criminal result entails accountability for that result so long as the accomplice is personally culpable with respect to the result to the extent demanded by the definition of the crimes. Thus, if the accomplice recklessly endangers life by rendering assistance to another, he can be convicted of manslaughter if death results, even though the principal actor's liability is at a different level. In effect, therefore, the homicidal act is attributed to both participants, with the liability of each measured by his own degree of culpability toward the result.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>supra, 533-34 n.14, quoting Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.06, comment 7.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Taking a literal view of the plain language of the accessory statute, in effect we agreed with the position taken by Justice Shea, in his concurring opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>McCalpine, </em>supra. Noting that \u201cthe mental state required of an accomplice who is charged with a crime [cannot be] less than that which must be proved against a principal\u201d; id., 833; Justice Shea had argued that \u201c[t]his requirement must extend to those acts which enhance the degree of the crime as well as to those which constitute the basic crime itself. Otherwise an accomplice might be convicted of an offense although he did not entertain the same mental state required by statute for conviction of the principal.\u201d Id., 834.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">We need not decide today whether the holding of <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>supra, can be reconciled with all of the language in <em>State </em>v. <em>Parham </em>and <em>State </em>v. <em>McCalpine. </em>In this case, the trial court in its jury instructions did not adopt the <em>McCalpine </em>dictum or use the language that had been used in <em>Parham. </em>Rather, the jury was told that the statute\u2019s \u201creference to the mental state required means that the alleged accessory must have the same intent to commit the crime that is required of the actual perpetrators of the crime.\u201d Again: \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>third element is that while in the course of committing an offense, he intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly inflicted or attempted to inflict bodily injury on a person; and the allegation here is that that person was Chesley Smith.\u201d Other parts of the instruction clarified that the person alleged actually to have injured Smith was Howard and not the defendant, and that the defendant was alleged to have importuned or intentionally aided Howard. None of this language, however, was contrary to the more specific instruction concerning the defendant\u2019s mental state. The instruction that was given required that the defendant be proven to have been at least reckless with respect to Howard\u2019s infliction of bodily injury on Chesley Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The evidence was sufficient to support a conviction based on that instruction. The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. The defendant knew before he entered the house that a gun was being wielded by his accomplices. He knew that the purpose of the gun was to facilitate the robbery of the $15,000. He knew that there were people in the house against whom the gun might be used. The jury could reasonably have inferred that the danger to those people mattered less to him than the money that he might gain in the robbery. Although the evidence at trial showed that the defendant was elsewhere in the apartment when Howard assaulted Smith, the jury was entitled to find that the defendant consciously disregarded the substantial risk that the gun would be used to injure someone in the robbery. To prove his recklessness, it was no more necessary to show that he was aware of the risk to the specific person who was injured than it would have been to make such a showing had he fired a rifle into a crowd. We therefore affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction on this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">With respect to the charge of conspiracy to commit burglary in the first degree under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2) and 53a-48, the defendant maintains that the state failed to prove an agreement to inflict bodily injury on anyone. We agree. Although, as noted above, the evidence was sufficient to show that the defendant recklessly engaged in the course of conduct that led to Chesley Smith\u2019s injuries, the evidence does not show that those injuries were planned or intended. We held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>supra, that intent need not be shown in order to hold a person liable as an accessory to a criminally negligent act as long as he has the requisite mental state for the commission of the substantive offense and he intentionally aids another in the crime. We explained that this result was consistent with our earlier holdings, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Almeda, </em>189 Conn. 303, 455 A.2d 1326 (1983), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Beccia, </em>199 Conn. 1, 505 A.2d 683 (1986), that \u201cpersons cannot attempt or conspire to commit an offense that requires an unintended result.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>supra, 526-27. The defendant\u2019s conviction on this count must therefore be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">With respect to the final count, being an accessory to the offense of assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2) and 53a-8, the state was required to prove that the defendant intended \u201cto cause physical injury to another person\u201d and that he importuned or intentionally aided another in causing physical injury by \u201cmeans of a . . . dangerous instrument.\u201d The defendant maintains that there was no evidence that he intended to inflict physical injury on anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The state maintains that the defendant was an accomplice to Howard\u2019s assault on Smith. Although the defendant was not present at the time of this assault, and there was no evidence that such an assault had been planned, the state maintains that such an assault was an inherent risk that the defendant assumed when he actively participated with Howard and Holmes in the robbery and the burglary. The state relies on <em>State </em>v. Rossi, 132 Conn. 39, 44, 42 A.2d 354 (1945), in which this court opined, in construing a predecessor to our felony murder statute, that \u201ccrimes against the person like robbery . . . and burglary are, in common experience, likely to involve danger to life in the event of resistance by the victim or the attempt of the perpetrator to make good his escape and conceal his identity.\u201d <em>Rossi </em>is not, however, a persuasive precedent, because the statute there being construed and applied did not require a finding of wilful, deliberate or premeditated conduct. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The accessory statute required the state to prove that the defendant had the mental state necessary to commit assault in the second degree. Although General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3) provides that a person is guilty of assault in the second degree when \u201che recklessly causes serious physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument,\u201d the jury in this case was not instructed on this part of the statute, but only on those parts that require intent to cause injury. In the absence of any probative evidence showing such intent, the defendant\u2019s conviction on this count must be set aside and an acquittal entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The defendant also challenges the legal sufficiency of the count of the substitute information charging him with burglary in the first degree. He maintains that the information was so defectively drafted that it either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>(a) deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction to try him for this offense, or (b) misled the jury into convicting him of this offense without a finding about an essential element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The original information in this case charged the defendant in an eight count form that listed, for each crime, the statute or statutes that the defendant was alleged to have violated. At the request of counsel for Howard, the state substituted a long form information, in which the third count accused the defendant \u201cof the crime of Burglary in the First Degree in violation of Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2), 53a-8, and alleges that at the same approximate time, with intent that 397 Blue Hills Avenue, Hartford be unlawfully entered and/or remained in, the defendant unlawfully entered and/or remained therein, importuned and/or intentionally aided another to do so, and that in the course of the offense, Everald Howard inflicted or attempted to inflict injury upon Chesley Smith.\u201d Despite a specific inquiry from the court at the time that the state filed the substitute information, the defendant voiced no objection to its contents. He now maintains, however, that the substitute information was fatally defective because it did not expressly charge the defendant with having had the intent to commit a crime when he unlawfully entered and remained in the victims\u2019 home. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The defendant\u2019s jurisdictional claim attacks only the validity of the substitute information. It is settled law that the original information, because it set forth by name and statutory reference the crime with which the defendant was charged, was sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>171 Conn. 264, 270, 368 A.2d 222 (1976). The defendant does not explain in what manner the court could have lost jurisdiction by the filing of a substitute information in response to a request for a bill of particulars. Even the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>federal cases on which the defendant relies do not permit an attack on the jurisdictional sufficiency of an information to be mounted after trial. Compare <em>Kaneshiro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 F.2d 1266, 1269 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 992, 92 S. Ct. 537, 30 L. Ed. 2d 543 (1971) (rejecting objection raised for the first time on appeal), with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hooker, </em>841 F.2d 1225, 1229 (4th Cir. 1988) (vacating conviction where indictment was objected to before trial). We conclude, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s jurisdictional claim must fail. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 156, 460 A.2d 26 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>167 Conn. 260, 280-81, 355 A.2d 11 (1974) <em>(Bogdanski, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The defendant\u2019s alternate contention is that the terms of the substitute information might have misled the jury<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> into convicting him of burglary in the first degree without finding that he had the requisite intent to commit this crime. During its deliberations, the jury asked the trial court for further guidance about the specific elements of the numerous crimes that Howard and the defendant had been charged with committing. After a conference with counsel, at which Howard\u2019s counsel asked the court to remind the jury that the substitute information had no evidentiary role in its deliberations, the court summarized the elements of the eight crimes for the jury. The defendant concedes the accuracy of this supplemental charge. He maintains, however, that the jury might have disregarded this accurate instruction, and relied instead on the contents of the substitute information, because of the court\u2019s supplemental charge about this information. The court reminded the jury that the information was \u201cnot law . . . not even facts. . . . It\u2019s an allegation. It is not anything that you follow other than to read it in the light for which it is intended, essentially [describing] what the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>alleges happened at the time and place of these alleged crimes.\u201d The defendant did not take exception to any portion of the supplemental charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">On this record, the defendant has not made a credible showing that the jury was misled by the failure of the substitute information to state each element of the crime of burglary in the first degree. Read as a whole, the court\u2019s original charge and supplemental charge gave the jury constitutionally adequate guidance for its deliberations. At best, the defendant\u2019s belated dissection of the supplemental charge with regard to the jury\u2019s use of the substitute information raises an evidentiary rather than a constitutional issue. Since this issue was not distinctly raised in the trial court, we decline to address it further. See Practice Book \u00a7 4185.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The defendant was convicted of two conspiracies, a conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree and a conspiracy to commit burglary in the first degree. Since both of these conspiracy convictions arise out of the same alleged agreement, the defendant contends that these convictions violate the prohibition against double jeopardy contained in the fifth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8 of the Connecticut constitution. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>supra, 460-63. In light of our conclusion that the defendant is, for reasons of evidentiary insufficiency, entitled to acquittal on the second of these conspiracy counts, we need not pursue this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The defendant contends that he is entitled to a new trial because of the allegedly erroneous admission into evidence of identifications made by Smith and Hutchinson. He contends that their identifications of him, both pretrial and at trial, resulted from an impermis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>sibly suggestive photographic array and should have been suppressed as unreliable and violative of his due process rights under the state and federal constitutions. The trial court admitted these identifications into evidence, despite its finding that the photographic array had been unnecessarily suggestive, because it found the identifications reliable in light of the totality of the circumstances. See <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramsundar, </em>204 Conn. 4, 10-11, 526 A.2d 1311, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 955, 108 S. Ct. 348, 98 L. Ed. 2d 374 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>supra, 451-56, having examined in detail the applicable law and the testimony of the witnesses, we upheld the trial court\u2019s finding that the witnesses had reliably identified Howard. The defendant urges us to come to a different conclusion in his case because he wore a mask while he was at the apartment, while Howard was barefaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Although the witnesses had less of an opportunity to observe the defendant than to observe Howard, their identifications were nonetheless sufficiently reliable to pass constitutional muster. Both were able to see the defendant for several minutes, at a time when their attention was as much directed to him as to his confederates. Their descriptions of the perpetrators to the police, while somewhat general, matched Howard and the defendant, especially with regard to the distinctive hairstyle worn by both men. See id., 455 n.8. Their photographic identifications were positive once they had covered the lower part of the photograph to recreate what they had observed at the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The defendant bears the burden of proving the unreliability of his identification by Smith and Hutchinson. <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>219 Conn. 93, 108, 591 A.2d 1246 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayette, </em>204 Conn. 571, 581, 529 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>673 (1987). We concur with the trial court that the defendant has not met this burden and that the court, therefore, properly admitted these identifications into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The defendant\u2019s final claim arises out of the decision of the trial court denying him access to Holmes\u2019 psychiatric records. The defendant cross-examined Holmes extensively concerning her involvement with drugs, and sought the psychiatric information in order to impeach her credibility on this issue. The trial court, with Holmes\u2019 consent, undertook an in camera inspection of Holmes\u2019 records from the Cedarcrest Regional Hospital. As a result of its examination of the records, the trial court ruled that \u201cthere is nothing in these records that remotely relate[s] to the witness\u2019 capacity to testify, to her credibility, [or to] any facts bearing on her reliability or sense of perception, and in short, they have no probative value . . . as to her ability to relate the truth or to observe or recollect and narrate relevant occurrences.\u201d The trial court sealed the psychiatric records to enable appellate review of its ruling, but did not permit the defendant to undertake his own inspection. The defendant properly reserved his objection to the court\u2019s ruling. He now renews his claim that the trial court\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of its discretion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">This issue also was fully explored in <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>supra, 456-58. The applicable legal principles have often been stated. If a witness consents to an inspection of his or her psychiatric records in camera, the trial court must determine, in its discretion, \u201cwhether the records are especially probative of the witness\u2019 capacity to relate the truth or to observe, recollect and narrate relevant occurrences.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>D Ambrosio, </em>212 Conn. 50, 58, 561 A.2d 422 (1989), cert. denied, 493 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>U.S. 1063, 110 S. Ct. 880, 107 L. Ed. 2d 963 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>McMurray, </em>217 Conn. 243, 257, 585 A.2d 677 (1991). The findings of the trial court correctly addressed not only Holmes\u2019 testimonial capacity but also her credibility. Our independent review of the psychiatric records confirms the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling. \u201cWe are convinced that nothing in the [psychiatric] records would have added weight to the defendant\u2019s thorough cross-examination of Holmes and that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying the defendant access to those privileged records.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>supra, 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to modify the judgment to reflect an acquittal of the crime of conspiracy to commit burglary in the first degree and an acquittal of the crime of assault in the second degree, and to resentence the defendant in accordance with the modified judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In this opinion Glass and Berdon, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime . . . displays or threatens the use of what he represents by his words or conduct to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm; except that in any prosecution under this subdivision, it is an affirmative defense that such pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm was not a weapon from which a shot could be discharged.

The accessory statute\u2019s requirement that the defendant act \u201cwith the mental state required for commission of an offense\u201d drops out of the calculation when the aggravating circumstance does not require proof of any particular mental state.

The court did not tell the jury that it would not be necessary for it to find the defendant to have been at least reckless, but only that the defendant need not have <em>known of </em>or <em>intended </em>bodily injury.

The accompanying comment states: \u201c[I]t is submitted that the liability of an accomplice ought not to be extended beyond the purposes that he shares. Probabilities have an important evidential bearing on these issues; to make them independently sufficient is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>predicate the liability on negligence when, for good reason, more is normally required before liability is found. More extensive liability for consequences may be defensible in special situations; if so, the liability should be created by the section dealing with the special situation, not comprehended in a principle designed for application throughout the Code.\u201d Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.06, comment 6 (b), pp. 312-13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b283-6\"> Nothing in <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>202 Conn. 520, 522 A.2d 277 (1987), however, conflicts with the holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>McCalpine, </em>190 Conn. 822, 463 A.2d 545 (1983), that when a defendant is charged with robbery in the first degree on the basis that \u201che or another participant in the crime ... is armed with a deadly weapon\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2); the defendant need not be proven to have intended to possess a deadly weapon.

I decline to join part of the discussion in part I C of the majority opinion regarding the conviction of the defendant of burglary in the first degree, as an accessory. Furthermore, I disagree with the conclusion in part I D, reversing the conviction of the defendant of conspiracy to commit burglary in the first degree, and with the conclusion in part IE, reversing the conviction of the defendant of assault in the second degree, as an accessory.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">I decline to join that part of the discussion in part I C regarding the scope and meaning of <em>State </em>v. <em>Parham, </em>174 Conn. 500, 391 A.2d 148 (1978). Although I agree with the majority that the defendant\u2019s conviction as an accessory to burglary in the first degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>should be affirmed, I do not think that it is necessary to consider or to cast doubt on the viability or scope of <em>Parham. </em>As the majority points out, the trial court did not charge on the <em>Parham </em>principle in this case. I see no need, therefore, for the majority\u2019s exegesis calling it into question. Moreover, in contrast to the majority\u2019s cramped reading of that case, I read <em>Parham, </em>on its facts and reasoning, to stand squarely for the principle that \u201cwhen more than one person participates in a burglary in the course of which one participant commits an act which raises the offense to the more serious crime of burglary in the first degree by \u2018intentionally, knowingly or recklessly\u2019 inflicting or attempting to inflict bodily injury on anyone, each participant in the burglary is guilty of the aggravated offense and it is without significance that such other participant was without knowledge of the other\u2019s conduct which caused the physical injury or that he himself had no intention to cause such injury.\u201d Id., 507. Indeed, on the facts <em>of Parham, </em>where the victim could not identify which of the two burglars actually inflicted the bodily injury on her, that principle is the only way in which Parham\u2019s conviction of burglary in the first degree could have been upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In part I D, the majority reverses the defendant\u2019s conviction of conspiracy to commit burglary in the first degree because \u201cthe evidence does not show that [bodily] injuries were planned or intended.\u201d I disagree, for two reasons. First, purely as a matter of drawing reasonable inferences, it seems to me quite evident that where, as in this case, the defendant agreed with his coconspirators to steal $15,000 from a house which he knew to be inhabited by a group of people, and thus to be guilty of robbery, and where he knew that one of his cohorts was armed with a revolver, it was reasonable for the jury to infer that he intended that the revolver be used in a manner involving bodily injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>if necessary to accomplish the robbery. Surely, it was reasonable for the jury to infer that his state of mind went beyond recklessness, and beyond a recognition that the revolver would be used only to intimidate his intended victims, and included an intent that, as actually happened, it be used to cause injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Second, the conviction on this count is for conspiracy to commit burglary in the first degree. It was necessary that the state establish only the requisite agreement and overt act. I can see no difference between the validity of this conviction and the conviction of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree that the majority sustains in part I B of the opinion. In both, to quote from the majority opinion, \u201c[t]he applicable principle of the law of criminal conspiracy was delineated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ghere, </em>[201 Conn. 289, 299, 513 A.2d 1226 (1986)], in which, relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>160 Conn. 140, 150, 274 A.2d 153 (1970), we held that the requisite agreement or confederation may be inferred from proof of the separate acts of the individuals accused as coconspirators and from the circumstances surrounding the commission of these acts.\u201d Furthermore, we have long held that \u201cthe existence of [a] conspiracy for [an] original felony renders [one] responsible for the natural and probable results of the execution of that original felony.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cots, </em>126 Conn. 48, 59, 9 A.2d 138 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Finally, in part IE, the majority reverses the defendant's conviction of assault in the second degree, as an accessory, because, as the majority sees the evidence, he had no intent to cause injury. The accessory statute does not require, however, that he had the intent that he himself cause the injury, only that he acted \u201cwith the mental state required for commission of an offense\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8; which, in this case, was the intent that injury be caused by the principal. Under all the circumstances, it was reasonable for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>jury to infer that, when the defendant entered this inhabited home with the intent to rob the inhabitants, and when he knew that one of his cohorts was armed with a revolver, he had the intent that the revolver would be used to cause injury to someone if necessary to carry out the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">I therefore dissent from part I D and E of the majority opinion, and would affirm the judgment of conviction on those counts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
