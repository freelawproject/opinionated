During the seven years of litigation involving these cases, this is the second time the parties have been before this court regarding the board\u2019s action on this amendment to the regulations. <em>See Stamford Ridgeway Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>214 Conn. 407, 572 A.2d 951 (1990).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The president of the board, Sandra Gold-stein, after a vote by the board, ruled that the zoning amendment concerning the properties of the plaintiffs, Bull\u2019s Head Medical Associates (Bull\u2019s Head) and Edward Benenson, was approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The plaintiffs and others took an appeal from the board\u2019s approval of the zoning amendment to the Superior Court. The court, <em>Gerety, J., </em>sustained the appeal on grounds that are not relevant to this appeal. Upon appeal to this court, we reversed and remanded the cases to the trial court for further proceedings. Id., 443. The plaintiffs, Bull\u2019s Head and Benenson, on remand, pursued the issues presented in this appeal before the Superior Court. The court, <em>Mottolese, J., </em>dismissed the appeals. The Appellate Court granted certification for the plaintiffs to appeal, and we transferred their appeals to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The plaintiffs are owners of separate parcels of real property in Stamford. On March 11, 1985, the zoning board of the city of Stamford (zoning board), as part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>of a comprehensive rezoning plan for the central business district, voted to rezone the areas in which the plaintiffs\u2019 properties were located from zone C-L (limited business district) to the more restrictive zone C-N (neighborhood business district).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs and others filed petitions with the zoning board pursuant to \u00a7 C-552.2 of the Stamford charter<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> objecting to the change of zone, all of which were referred to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The charter gives to the zoning board the power to adopt zoning regulations and to amend the zoning map, but not in such a way as to permit a use \u201cwhich is contrary to the general land use established for [the] area by the master plan.\u201d Stamford Charter \u00a7 C-552; <em>Burke </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>148 Conn. 33, 35, 166 A.2d 849 (1961). \u201cWhen the zoning map is amended, the owners of 20 per cent or more of the privately owned land in the area changed or the owners of 20 per cent or more of the privately owned land within 500 feet of the borders of the area may file a petition with the zoning board objecting to the amendment. \u00a7 [C-552.2]; 26 Spec. Laws 1235.\u201d <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>supra. Upon the filing of such a petition, the zoning amendment is without effect and the zoning board must refer the matter to the board, along with the zoning board\u2019s \u201cwritten findings, recommendations and reasons\u201d for the change. Stamford Charter \u00a7 C-552.2; <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>supra. The board of representatives, which is composed of two members elected from each of the city\u2019s twenty voting districts, acts to approve or reject the amendment. The charter states that any decision on the matter by the board must be by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire membership of the board. Stamford Charter \u00a7 C-556.1;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>supra, 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The board received a total of sixteen petitions, all of which were filed by property owners who were adversely affected by the proposed rezoning. On May 6, 1985, the board acted on thirteen of the sixteen petitions, which included the plaintiffs\u2019 petition. <em>Stamford Ridgeway Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>supra, 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">On each vote, the following procedure was used. A motion was made that the proposed amendment, which was the subject of the petition, be approved. Upon the motion being seconded, the president of the board announced the voting procedure as follows: \u201cThe vot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>ing procedure is according to [\u00a7\u00a7 C-556.1 and C-552.2] of the Charter, as well as Judge Novack\u2019s decision of September [9], 1980,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 21 votes, either Yes or No to the Motion are needed in order for the Board to take an action. In the absence of 21 votes for or against the Motion, it is deemed that the Board has taken no decision. According to [\u00a7 C-552.2], failure to approve or reject shall be deemed approval of the Zoning Board or approval of the Motion, because our motions are all going to be framed in that manner. If you vote for this Motion, you are supporting the Zoning Board\u2019s decision. If you vote No to this Motion, you are not supporting the Zoning Board, you are voting against the Zoning Board\u2019s decision and for the appeal. All those in favor, vote up for Yes; all those opposed to the Motion vote down for No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The vote on the zoning amendment concerning the plaintiffs\u2019 properties was fifteen votes in favor of the motion approving the amendment, twenty opposed to the amendment, one abstention and two not voting. \u201cThe board took no action on [the plaintiffs\u2019 petition] because of the lack of majority votes of the entire membership of the board needed on each petition to reject the proposed zone changes. . . . The effect of \u2018no action\u2019 by the board constituted an affirmance of the changes proposed by the zoning board.\u201d <em>Stamford Ridgeway Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The plaintiffs first argue that the questions before the board were improperly framed in that the votes should have been on the petition objecting to the proposed amendment, and not on the zoning amendment itself. They point to \u00a7 C-556.1 of the charter that requires an \u201caffirmative vote of a majority of the entire membership\u201d of the board in order to decide all matters referred to the board by the zoning board under \u00a7 C-552.2 of the charter. Because what was referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>to the board was the petition, they claim the board president never allowed the petitions to receive an affirmative vote \u201csince those who supported the petitions had to vote in the negative.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The plaintiffs misconstrue the plain language of \u00a7 C-552.2. The question before the board was not the petition, which indicated the property owners\u2019 objection to the zone change, but whether the zone change should be approved. The petition was merely the vehicle that brought the issue before the board. This is made clear in \u00a7 C-552.2, which provides that after the petition is referred to the board the \u201cboard of representatives shall <em>approve or reject such proposed amendment . . . </em>.\u201d The charter does not provide for the approval or rejection of the \u201cpetition\u201d itself. \u201cThe manifest legislative intent expressed in the Stamford charter is that the board of representatives, in considering an amendment to the zoning map, shall review the legislative action of the zoning board on that board\u2019s written findings, recommendations and reasons. <em>The question before the board, of representatives is whether to approve or to reject the amendment. </em>That board, in reviewing the action of the zoning board, is called upon to perform a legislative function.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>supra, 39. The plain language of \u00a7 C-552.2 leaves no room for any other construction. <em>Stamford Ridgeway Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>supra, 423-24; see <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Norwalk Wilbert Vault Co., </em>208 Conn. 1, 9, 544 A.2d 152 (1988) (common sense must be used in construction of a charter); <em>Cilley </em>v. <em>Lamphere, </em>206 Conn. 6, 12, 535 A.2d 1305 (1988).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>The actions of public officials\u2014such as the president and members of the board\u2014are entitled to a presumption in favor of their legality. \u201cCourts will interfere with legislative decisions made by municipalities only where the party seeking review can characterize the legislative act as illegal, fraudulent, or corrupt. . . . When such bodies are acting within the limits of the powers conferred upon them, and in due form of law, the right of courts to supervise, review or restrain is exceedingly limited.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Northeast Electronics Corporation </em>v. <em>Royal Associates, </em>184 Conn. 589, 592, 440 A.2d 239 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The board members knew the meaning of their vote. The president of the board made the effect of each vote perfectly clear before each vote. Before the vote on the proposed zoning amendment that concerned the plaintiffs, the board had the benefit of earlier explanations by the president on other amendments. Indeed, through those prior votes, they had the opportunity to observe how their vote, one way or the other, would affect the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The plaintiffs also argue, under a strained interpretation of a trial court\u2019s opinion,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the twenty \u201cno\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>votes of the forty votes of the board, was enough to overturn the zoning board on the amendment. There is no basis for this claim. Section C-556.1 of the charter requires \u201cthe affirmative vote of a majority of the entire membership of said Board . . .\u201d which was twenty-one votes. Section C-552.2 provides that \u201cfailure of the board of representatives either to approve or reject said amendment . . . shall be deemed as approval of the zoning board\u2019s decision.\u201d Read together, as they must be; <em>Arminio </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>183 Conn. 211, 218, 440 A.2d 757 (1981); these charter provisions clearly provide that twenty-one \u201cyes\u201d votes operates as approval of the amendment; twenty-one \u201cno\u201d votes operates as defeat of the amendment; and failure to obtain twenty-one \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d votes, as in the present case, operates as approval of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\"> This issue, although raised in <em>Stamford Ridgeway Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>214 Conn. 407, 422-23, 572 A.2d 951 (1990), was never reached. The dispositive issue in that case was whether the Stamford charter permitted the board of representatives to vote on separate zone changes contained in one zoning application or whether the board had to act on the entire application. The majority of this court held that the charter permitted the board to vote on each separate zone change encompassed in the application. Id., 432-33.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-6\"> Bull\u2019s Head \u201cowns property located at 22 Long Ridge Road. The property was zoned C-L [limited business district]. As part of [the zoning amendments], however, the property was rezoned to C-N (neighborhood business district).

The board of representatives shall approve or reject such proposed amendment at or before its second regularly scheduled meeting following such referral. When acting upon such matters the board of representatives shall be guided by the same standards as are prescribed for the zoning board in section 550 of this act.

[or] that which establishes . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.). In other words, an affirmative vote of the majority simply means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>that which is necessary to establish the vote of the majority of the entire membership of the board. That was exactly the manner in which the president framed the issue. The president made it clear that: (1) a vote \u201cyes\u201d on the motion is a vote in favor of the amendment; (2) a vote \u201cno\u201d on the motion is a vote against the amendment; and (3) the failure to obtain twenty-one \u201cyes\u201d votes (approval of the zoning amendment) or twenty-one \u201cno\u201d votes (rejection of the zoning amendment) would result in the approval of the amendment because of the provision in \u00a7 C-552.2 of the Stamford charter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b806-13\"> Judge Novack\u2019s decision in <em>Schlesinger </em>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield at Stamford, Docket No. CV-77-0019744-L (September 9, 1980), is entirely consistent with the procedure and decision of the president of the board, the trial court, <em>Mottolese, J., </em>and this court.
