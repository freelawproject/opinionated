In 2002, Holmes was convicted of attempted first degree murder, attempted robbery, and attempted burglary with an assault; and the jury further found that a firearm was discharged and caused great bodily harm during the commission of these crimes. The trial court sentenced Holmes to life imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This sentence was affirmed in\n   <em>\n    Holmes v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9154376\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/883/350/\">\n    883 So.2d 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 3d DCA 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Thereafter, Holmes has filed ten post-conviction motions or petitions in this Court, including the instant petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He has attacked his sentence unsuccessfully by arguing that his sentence under a firearm enhancement was unlawful because there was insufficient evidence at trial that he possessed or discharged a firearm during the alleged crimes (an argument he again makes in pending case 3D16-2076). In the instant appeal, Holmes alleges that his life sentence is unconstitutionally impermissible because it is indefinite. As the trial court noted in its written order below, this issue has been resolved by the Florida Supreme Court adverse to Holmes's position.\n   <em>\n    Ratliff v.
