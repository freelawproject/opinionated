For the reasons discussed herein, we affirm defendant's conviction and multiple offender adjudication, but we vacate defendant's sentence and remand this case to the trial court for a hearing on defendant's motion for downward departure and for resentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 22, 2014, defendant was charged by grand jury indictment with (Count 1) attempted first degree murder, (Count 2) aggravated rape,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (Count 3) second degree kidnapping of K.H.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At his arraignment on August 27, 2015, defendant pled not guilty to all charges. On January 5, 2016, the State amended Count 1 of the indictment from attempted first degree murder, a violation of La. R.S. 14:(29)30, to second degree battery, a violation of La. R.S. 14:34.1, and dismissed Count 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following a three-day jury trial, on January 27, 2016, defendant was found guilty of second degree battery and not guilty of aggravated rape. Defendant filed motions for new trial and for post-verdict judgment of acquittal. On February 24, 2016, the trial court denied defendant's motions and sentenced defendant to five years at hard labor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On that same date, the State filed a\n   multiple offender bill charging defendant as a fourth offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 19, 2016, the trial court held a multiple bill hearing. Following the presentation of evidence and arguments, the trial court denied defendant's motion to quash the multiple bill and adjudicated defendant a fourth offender. The trial court vacated defendant's original sentence for the second degree battery conviction and re-sentenced him to thirty-five years at hard labor. Following sentencing, defense counsel filed a motion for downward departure and requested an evidentiary hearing pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State v. Dorthey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7490196\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/623/1276/\">\n    623 So.2d 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1993). The trial court denied the request for a hearing but set a date for ruling on the motion for downward departure. The trial court also granted defendant's motion for appeal. Subsequently, on July 8, 2016, the trial court denied the defense motion for downward departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   K.H., the victim in this case, testified that she and defendant had been in a relationship for several years prior to the incident on July 13, 2014. K.H. stated that she and defendant were \"very much in love\" but \"the relationship was very toxic.\" She also described defendant as an angry, volatile person, who had been violent with her in the past and had been arrested for domestic violence against her in 2012 and 2013. For several weeks prior to July 13, 2014, K.H. had been living at her daughter's house in Algiers and caring for a dying relative; during that time, K.H. had not seen or spoken to defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 13, 2014, at approximately 4:00 p.m., defendant unexpectedly arrived at K.H.'s daughter's house and rang the doorbell several times. K.H. stepped outside to greet defendant. She testified that she was afraid to let him inside the house with her daughter and mother present, because she \"didn't know what state of mind he was in.\" In order to get him away from the house, K.H. agreed to go with defendant to his house. Before leaving with defendant, K.H. went back inside the house to bathe and dress. When she came outside to go with him, she noticed defendant's demeanor had changed; he began berating her for not coming to see him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   K.H. and defendant travelled by bus and streetcar to his house in Mid-City. Upon exiting the streetcar, defendant became angry and threatening towards K.H. But, when they arrived at defendant's house, K.H. and defendant engaged in consensual sex. Afterwards, defendant left the house while K.H. lay down to rest on a mattress on the floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When defendant returned, he noticed empty cups on the floor and angrily accused K.H. of having other men at the house in his absence. K.H. attempted to stand up from the mattress, but defendant kicked her in her face; she fell backwards onto the floor and felt blood pouring from her mouth. Weak and dazed from the kick to her face, K.H. laid on her stomach to prevent defendant from hitting her in the face again. Defendant then flipped K.H. over on her back, stood over her, and repeatedly punched her in her stomach. As K.H. began to drift \"in and out\" of consciousness, defendant pulled off her clothes, grabbed her by the head, and forcibly pushed her head into his groin to have her perform oral sex upon him. In response, K.H. bit defendant on his inner thigh. Defendant then grabbed a large piece of plastic that was separating two rooms in the house, he laid the plastic out on the floor, and he grabbed a rope. Defendant ordered K.H. to put the rope around her neck and lay face down on the plastic. Fearing that defendant was going\n   to kill her, K.H. attempted to get up and move towards the door of the house; but defendant kicked her down and tied her legs with the rope. As K.H. laid there, defendant's demeanor changed again; he started \"laughing like it's a joke.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant then told K.H. that she should get to a hospital but that he could not take her. K.H. convinced defendant to take her to the hospital by promising to tell hospital staff and police that a stranger robbed and beat her. When he agreed to go with her, K.H. managed to get up and walk with defendant a few blocks to Broad Street, where he walked ahead of her to a gas station to call an ambulance. When defendant walked ahead, K.H. flagged down a police car pulling up to the gas station. K.H. told the police officer that defendant beat her up, that he had walked to the gas station to use the phone, and that he was going to say someone else beat her up. She explained to the officer that she told defendant she would lie to police about a stranger beating her so he would agree to bring her to the hospital. Soon after, an ambulance arrived to take K.H. to the hospital. K.H. did not remember much of what happened when she was taken to the hospital; but she knew she had surgery to remove her spleen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Officer Joseph Betcher testified that, in the early morning hours of July 14, 2014, he responded to a domestic violence complaint reported by another officer at the city gas pump facility on Broad Street. When Ofc. Betcher arrived on the scene, K.H. was speaking with the reporting officer, Sergeant Shaw, and defendant was detained by other officers on scene. Ofc. Betcher activated his body camera before speaking with K.H., whom he observed to be badly, physically beaten, with injuries to her face, lips, and eyes. Ofc. Betcher took an initial statement from K.H., who stated that defendant was her ex-boyfriend and he had kicked and beat her. Ofc. Betcher attended to K.H. until the ambulance arrived and transported her to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At that time, defendant was arrested on a charge of domestic abuse battery and placed in the back seat of Ofc. Betcher's patrol vehicle. While Ofc. Betcher filled out paperwork in his patrol vehicle, defendant made several statements that were recorded on Ofc. Betcher's body camera.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant stated that he had dated K.H. in the past; and, earlier that night, she showed up at his house, told him that she was robbed and beaten, and needed defendant to bring her to the hospital. Defendant repeatedly denied hitting K.H. and said he did not know how she was injured. Defendant also made threatening statements, saying he would kill K.H. and Ofc. Betcher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After transporting defendant to the First District Station, Ofc. Betcher relocated to Tulane Hospital, where K.H. was being treated for her injuries. Ofc. Betcher recorded a full statement from K.H. on his body camera. From her statement, Ofc. Betcher learned that defendant had repeatedly beat and kicked K.H., tied her up with a rope, strangled her, threatened to kill her, and forced her to have sex with him. Based on K.H.'s statement and injuries, Ofc. Betcher determined that the investigation should be turned over to the N.O.P.D. Sex Crimes Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Ofc. Betcher also testified that he was familiar with defendant and K.H. from a previous domestic violence complaint. In January 2013, Ofc. Betcher responded to a\n   call from the same victim. Ofc. Betcher learned that K.H. had locked defendant out of their apartment; as a result, defendant became violently angry and broke a window to try to get inside. Ofc. Betcher recalled defendant's demeanor as threatening and \"crazy with anger\" towards K.H. Ultimately, Ofc. Betcher arrested defendant for disturbing the peace, criminal trespass, and criminal damage to property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Detective Stephanie Taillon testified that, on July 14, 2014, she was assigned to the Sex Crimes Division of the Special Victim Section of N.O.P.D. On that date, she was called to investigate a sexual assault. She met with Ofc. Betcher at Tulane Hospital; he provided her with an overview of the case and introduced her to K.H. At that time, Det. Taillon was unable to interview K.H. due to her traumatic condition. But, based on the statements made to Ofc. Betcher, Det. Taillon requested that K.H. be transferred to University Hospital for sexual assault nurse examiner (\"SANE\") services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the following week, Det. Taillon made two attempts to visit K.H. in the hospital for an interview. On her first attempt, Det. Taillon learned K.H. was in the intensive care unit (\"I.C.U.\"), recovering from surgery to remove her spleen, and was unable to complete an interview. Once K.H. was transferred out of I.C.U., on July 25, 2014, Det. Taillon conducted a full, recorded interview with K.H. and took photographs of her injuries. Based on that interview, Det. Taillon applied for a buccal swab search warrant for defendant and a search warrant for defendant's residence, located at 705 North Gayoso Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Det. Taillon identified and described photographs taken during the execution of the search warrant for defendant's house. Det. Taillon noted that the interior of the house was in a \"deplorable condition,\" but that there was a mattress and other items inside the house indicating someone had been staying there. Det. Taillon found a large piece of industrial-type plastic, a rope, several cups, and a bundle of bloody napkins, all of which K.H. had described in her interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Regarding the execution of the buccal swab search warrant, Det. Taillon testified that she met with defendant at the Orleans Parish Prison, where he was in custody. Det. Taillon identified herself to defendant as the investigating detective in this case. She told defendant she had a search warrant to collect two buccal swabs from him, and she explained the procedure to him. As she was conducting the procedure, defendant made several unprompted statements to her. Det. Taillon testified that defendant asked about K.H.'s condition, he stated he was \"sorry this had to happen\" and \"I did this because I love her,\" and he said he felt bad about hitting K.H. and kicking her a few times. Det. Taillon repeatedly advised defendant to stop speaking to her and reminded him of his right to remain silent; nonetheless, he talked throughout the procedure. Det. Taillon documented defendant's statements in her report. She testified that she did not have any audio or visual recording of defendant's statements, because recording devices are prohibited at Orleans Parish Prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Eileen Smith, a sexual assault nurse examiner (\"SANE nurse\") for University Hospital, testified that she conducted a sexual assault interview and examination of K.H. on July 14, 2014. Ms. Smith recorded notes of her interview and examination of K.H., and she compiled her findings in a report that was introduced into\n   evidence at trial. Ms. Smith documented and photographed the following injuries on K.H.: periorbital swelling and bruising to her right eye; swelling to both lips; internal lacerations on her bottom lip; horizontal marks on the proximal portion of her neck; bruising to her left elbow and forearm; and swelling to the proximal area of her left knee. Ms. Smith also performed a pelvic exam and collected swabs for the sexual assault forensic evidence kit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Smith noted that K.H. was in a great deal of pain and trauma and, subsequently, underwent surgery to remove her spleen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dr. Peter Meade testified as an expert in critical care and as a member of the surgical team who treated K.H.'s injuries. Dr. Meade identified and reviewed K.H.'s medical records from her admission to the hospital on July 14, 2014. Dr. Meade listed nine discernible injuries to K.H., with the most severe being a grade 4 splenic laceration that required surgical intervention to remove her spleen, \"to save her life.\" He also listed the injuries to her left elbow, left knee, thighs, lips, right eye, and neck. Dr. Meade stated that K.H.'s level of trauma was acute when she was admitted to the hospital. Further, he noted that \"the injury to the spleen was life-threatening\" and falls within the definition of serious bodily injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In this appeal, defendant raises eight assignments of error-two of which were raised in a counseled brief and six within his supplemental\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief. In his final,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   assignment of error, defendant argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction for second degree battery. We address this assignment of error first, in accordance with our jurisprudence that \"[w]hen issues are raised on appeal as to the sufficiency of the evidence and as to one or more trial errors, the reviewing court should first determine the sufficiency of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Under the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   standard, an appellate court must determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could be convinced that all of the elements of the crime had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Second degree battery, a violation of La. R.S. 14:34.1, is defined as \"a battery when the offender intentionally inflicts serious bodily injury.\" \"Serious bodily injury\" is further defined as \"bodily injury which involves unconsciousness, extreme physical pain or protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty, or a substantial risk of death.\" La. R.S. 14:34.1(B)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At trial, K.H. testified that defendant repeatedly kicked and punched her in the face and body to an extent that she was drifting in and out of consciousness. She stated that she could barely move to defend herself or escape due to the injuries defendant had inflicted upon her. She also testified that she believed defendant \"had to be plotting this\" and intended to kill her, which is what she always feared during their volatile relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Ofc. Betcher testified that K.H. appeared badly, physically beaten when he first spoke with her and that K.H. identified defendant as the person who beat her. In addition, the jury viewed Ofc. Betcher's body camera footage of K.H.'s statements to him-both on the scene and at the hospital. Moreover, the video footage and photographs of K.H. taken at the hospital, admitted into evidence at trial, depict the numerous physical injuries to K.H.'s face and body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Det. Taillon testified that defendant made several unprompted, self-incriminating statements to her during the buccal swab search warrant procedure. When he learned that K.H. was still in the hospital, defendant told Det. Taillon that he \"kicked [K.H.] a few times in the butt\" and he \"felt bad about hitting her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Dr. Meade testified regarding the serious, life-threatening extent of K.H.'s injuries, most significantly the grade 4 splenic laceration that required surgical intervention \"to save her life.\" Dr. Meade opined that the near-fatal injury to K.H.'s spleen could have been caused by a fall, kick, or a punch. Dr. Meade also discussed the continuing health effects and complications that K.H. may experience due to the removal of her spleen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, the testimony and evidence presented at trial included the victim's testimony that defendant repeatedly, intentionally beat and kicked her; medical testimony regarding the serious, life-threatening extent of the injuries inflicted\n   upon the victim; and video and photographic evidence of the victim's injuries. Based on the totality of the testimony and evidence presented at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that any rational trier of fact could find that the elements of the offense of second degree battery had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sufficiency of Amended Indictment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In another\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in allowing the State to amend Count 1 of the grand jury indictment from attempted first degree murder to second degree battery. Defendant argues that the amendment to the indictment violated his constitutional rights to be informed of the nature of the charges against him and to have his prosecution initiated by grand jury indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"The time for testing the sufficiency of an indictment is before trial by way of a motion to quash or an application for a bill of particulars.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

During the State's rebuttal argument, the prosecutor responded to the defense argument that Det. Taillon's investigation was \"reckless, negligent, careless,\" based, in part, on the fact that she did not request DNA testing on the rope or bloody\n   napkins recovered at defendant's house. The prosecutor stated, \"[l]adies and gentlemen, that rope and that napkin has been sitting downstairs in this building, in evidence, for a year and a half. You know who equally could have had that tested?\" At that point, defense counsel objected on the ground of \"burden shifting,\" and the trial court overruled the objection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendant argues that this comment improperly shifted the burden of proof onto the defendant and misled the jury to believe that defense counsel had the burden to conduct its own testing on the evidence to prove defendant's innocence. However, a review of the arguments reveals that the prosecutor's comment was permissible rebuttal argument to defense counsel's criticism of Det. Taillon's investigation. In consideration of defense counsel's argument that Det. Taillon was negligent for failing to submit the rope and bloody napkins for DNA testing, the prosecutor merely pointed out to the jury that the defendant had access to the physical evidence if he wanted to challenge the findings from the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Even assuming the prosecutor's comments exceeded the scope of proper closing or rebuttal argument, we are not convinced that the comments influenced the jury and contributed to the verdict. The jury heard testimony from the victim, K.H., and investigating officers, and viewed photographic evidence of K.H.'s injuries and the crime scene at defendant's house that corroborated details of K.H.'s testimony. In consideration of all the testimony and evidence presented, and giving credit to the good sense and fair-mindedness of the jurors who heard the evidence and arguments, it is unlikely that any of the objected-to remarks by the prosecutor contributed to the jury's verdict finding defendant guilty of second degree battery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Stanfield\n   </em>\n   , this Court summarized the scheme adopted by the Louisiana Supreme Court for allocating burdens of proof in habitual offender proceedings as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   If the defendant denies the multiple offender allegations then the burden is on the State to prove (1) the existence of a prior guilty plea, and (2) that defendant was represented by counsel when the plea was taken. Once the State proves those two things, the burden then shifts to the defendant to produce affirmative evidence showing (1) an infringement of his rights, or (2) a procedural irregularity in the taking of the plea. Only if the defendant meets that burden of proof does the burden shift back to the State to prove the constitutionality of the guilty plea. In doing so, the State must produce either a 'perfect' transcript of the Boykin colloquy between the defendant and the judge or any combination of (1) a guilty plea form, (2) a minute entry, or (3) an \"imperfect\" transcript. If anything less than a \"perfect\" transcript is presented, the trial court must weigh the evidence submitted by the defendant and the State to determine whether the State met its burden of proof that defendant's prior guilty plea was informed and voluntary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   13-1193, p. 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6968599\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/137/788/#p797\">\n    137 So.3d at 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Pollard testified that, prior to the hearing that day, he fingerprinted defendant in court; he identified the fingerprints he took from defendant as State's exhibit 1. The State subsequently offered and introduced the\n   certified packet from the State of Florida for defendant's 2005 conviction for possession of a controlled substance (to wit: morphine). The packet contained certified copies of the following documents: charging affidavit; an arrest warrant affidavit; fingerprint card; and court minutes/order and judgment reflecting his guilty plea on March 10, 2005.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ofc. Pollard testified that he examined the fingerprints contained in the 2005 conviction packet, he compared them to the fingerprints he took from defendant prior to the hearing, and he concluded that all of the fingerprints examined came from the same individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In further support of the 2005 conviction, the State introduced the guilty plea form, dated March 10, 2005, and signed by defendant, his attorney, and the judge, in which defendant acknowledged and agreed to the following: he understood that he was waiving his rights to a trial by jury, to confront his accusers, to testify or to remain silent, and to appeal; he understood the charges to which he was pleading guilty; he understood the elements of the crime, possible defenses thereto, and maximum penalties; he was pleading because he was in fact guilty of the crime; and he was not pressured or promised anything to enter the plea. Finally, defendant attested that he read every word in the plea, discussed it with his attorney, and fully understood his plea of guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Based on the evidence and testimony presented at the multiple bill hearing, we find the State met the requisite burden to prove that defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered a guilty plea on March 10, 2005, to a felony charge of possession of controlled substances, in the State of Florida. Thus, we find no merit in defendant's argument that the trial court erred in using an invalid guilty plea as a sentence-enhancing predicate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Next, defendant argues that his defense counsel was ineffective during the multiple bill proceedings for failing to adequately pursue a mitigating investigation of the predicate offenses to challenge any infringement of his rights or procedural irregularity in the taking of his 2010 guilty plea in Jefferson Parish and 2011 guilty plea in Orleans Parish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Generally, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are more properly addressed in an application for post-conviction relief, filed in the trial court where a full evidentiary hearing can be conducted.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Then, after being denied the opportunity to present evidence in support of a downward\n   departure, defense counsel argued that the sentence imposed was seven times the maximum sentence for the second degree battery conviction in this case and that, given defendant's age of 40 years old, the sentence was the functional equivalent of a life sentence. In denying defendant's motion for downward departure, the trial court noted only that the sentence imposed was within the statutory range for a fourth offender and the victim in this case suffered extreme injury. Based on this record, particularly in the absence of any reasons or considerations for the sentence imposed or the denial of the motion for downward departure, we cannot adequately review defendant's claim of excessiveness. Further, in light of this Court's recent jurisprudence, we find that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for downward departure without allowing him an opportunity to present evidence and adduce testimony to rebut the presumption of constitutionality and to substantiate his claim of being an exceptional case in which a downward departure is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Accordingly, we vacate defendant's thirty-five year sentence as a fourth offender and we remand to the trial court for a meaningful sentencing hearing at which defendant shall be afforded the opportunity to present mitigating evidence and testimony in support of his motion for downward departure from the statutory minimum. After properly considering whether a downward departure from the statutory minimum is warranted in this case, in light of applicable jurisprudence, the trial court is instructed to state for the record the considerations for its ruling on the motion and for the sentence imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, we affirm defendant's conviction for second degree battery and his adjudication as a fourth offender. We also vacate defendant's sentence and remand this case for a meaningful, evidentiary hearing on defendant's motion for downward departure from the statutory minimum and for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   BARTHOLOMEW-WOODS, J., CONCURS IN THE RESULT\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    Our review for errors patent on the face of the record reveals one. In sentencing defendant as a fourth offender, the trial court failed to stipulate that the sentence be served without the benefit of probation or suspension of sentence in accordance with La. R.S. 15:529.1(G). However, based on our decision to vacate defendant's sentence and remand for resentencing, we need not take any action to correct such error. Moreover, La. R.S. 15:301.1(A) provides, in pertinent part, that \"[t]he failure of a sentencing court to specifically state that all or a portion of the sentence is to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence shall not in any way affect the statutory requirement\" that those restrictions apply. Our jurisprudence recognizes that \"this paragraph self-activates the correction and eliminates the need to remand for a ministerial correction of an illegally lenient sentence which may result from the failure of the sentencing court to impose punishment in conformity with that provided in the statute.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.
