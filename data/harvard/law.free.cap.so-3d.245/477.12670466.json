B &amp; B Management Company, LLC (\"B &amp; B\") and Terence McGee (\"McGee\") appeal the circuit court's denial of their Motion to Dismiss and Transfer Venue. Finding that the trial court erred in denying the relief sought, we reverse the court's order and remand this case with instructions to dismiss Terence McGee and transfer venue to the Circuit Court of Madison County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Y.X. first filed a premises-liability case in Madison County against B &amp; B and five John Does, alleging she was injured on a treadmill in the fitness room of an apartment complex located in Madison County. Prior to B &amp; B making an appearance, Y.X. voluntarily dismissed that case and refiled essentially an identical case in Hinds County, adding McGee, a former employee of B &amp; B and resident of Hinds County, as a defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. There is no dispute that the alleged incident occurred on Saturday,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   July 18, 2015. On that Saturday, a special event was held at the complex, where free back-to-school supplies and food were given away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Within their answer, B &amp; B and McGee included a Motion to Dismiss and Transfer, averring that McGee was \"fraudulently joined ... in an attempt to fix venue in Hinds County, when the only proper venue for this matter is Madison County.\" B &amp; B and McGee submitted that \"[u]nder Mississippi law, there is no viable cause of action against [McGee]-the employee of a premises manager. [McGee] should be dismissed with prejudice, and this matter should be transferred to Madison County, Mississippi.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Later B &amp; B and McGee renewed their pleas by filing a separate Motion to Dismiss and Transfer Venue, attaching affidavits of McGee and Brent Yurtkuran, a managing member of B &amp; B. McGee swore that he was not responsible for creating or enforcing any safety procedures, placing or installing the equipment in the fitness room, inspecting or maintaining the exercise equipment or vending machines in the fitness room, or supervising or monitoring the equipment. McGee further swore that he was not working or present at the complex on July 18, 2015. Yurtkuran swore that McGee was not working on July 18, 2015, and corroborated McGee's testimony as to his lack of responsibility for the fitness room and equipment. B &amp; B and McGee again averred no viable action existed against McGee and that McGee was added as a defendant for the sole purpose of attempting to fix venue in Hinds County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Y.X. replied with affidavits. She and her mother swore that they previously had seen McGee in uniform working in and around the fitness room and that they\n   <em>\n    believed\n   </em>\n   McGee was responsible for supervising the fitness room, keeping the door to the fitness room locked, and cleaning the fitness room. Both swore that it was their understanding that the door to the fitness room was supposed to be unlocked during the day. Y.X. swore that, on the occasions when she previously had seen McGee working at the complex, she had never seen McGee doing anything in the fitness room other than cleaning or possibly checking something. Y.X. swore that she had seen McGee working at the property July 18, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Y.X. argued that she \"had established a reasonable possibility of recovery against McGee, based on their [affidavit] testimony that McGee worked in, cleaned, and inspected the fitness room and locked\n   and unlocked the door to the fitness room in order to allow residents such as the Plaintiff to access the vending machine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. B &amp; B and McGee replied that Y.X.'s and her mother's affidavits were insufficient to demonstrate a viable cause of action against McGee. B &amp; B and McGee averred that any actions described by Y.X. related to McGee on that Saturday did not include acts of negligence for which he could be held independently liable, even if true. B &amp; B and McGee reurged that McGee was not a manager or a \"person in charge of the premises\" and was not in charge of making or enforcing any apartment policies. McGee further testified that he was responsible only for emptying trash cans and changing filters in the fitness room. McGee maintained that he was not on the property that Saturday. B &amp; B and McGee further argued that, even if one assumed McGee was at the complex on that Saturday, such a fact alone did not establish a viable cause of action. All parties agreed an event at which school supplies and food were given away took place at the complex on Saturday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Yurtkuran submitted a second affidavit, stating that B &amp; B had no policy requiring the door to the fitness room be locked at all times, nor was McGee responsible for keeping the fitness-room door locked. \"Any negligence associated with the decision to unlock the fitness room door-which is denied-would have been negligence of the company, not its maintenance employee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. During the hearing on the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Transfer Venue, Y.X. moved,\n   <em>\n    ore tenus,\n   </em>\n   to expand the proceedings further by conducting limited discovery \"on the issue of the viability of a claim for independent liability against Defendant Terrence McGee prior to the Court issuing [its] ruling on the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Transfer Venue....\" The trial court granted Y.X.'s\n   <em>\n    ore tenus\n   </em>\n   motion, finding that limited discovery would aid in deciding the issues.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [T]he parties are permitted to engage in discovery strictly limited in scope to the specific issue of the viability of a claim of independent liability against Terence McGee. The discovery permitted shall be limited to requests for production and depositions of the Plaintiffs, the manager for Defendant B &amp; B Management Group, LLC, B &amp; B member Brent Yurtkuran, and Defendant Terence McGee....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court authorized the parties to submit supplemental briefs \"to apprise the Court of any new information gained during this limited phase of discovery relevant to the issues raised by the Defendants [in] their Motion to Dismiss and Transfer Venue....\" The trial court ordered that discovery was to be completed by October 28, 2016. The trial court granted the parties an additional month to file supplemental briefs (by November 30, 2016). The order provided notice to all parties that the trial court would not rule on the \"Motion to Dismiss and Transfer Venue until such time as the parties' time for submitting supplemental briefs as permitted herein has expired.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11. During discovery, Y.X. testified that she had seen McGee in street clothes on Saturday, July 18, 2016, \"hanging out there, and I don't know what he was doing.... I just saw him pass by. I didn't really pay attention.\" She testified McGee was near the front of the complex and appeared to be leaving. She further testified that she and her friends \"got something to eat first, and we were waiting for the supplies. That's why we went to the fitness room.... [W]e went there because we wanted to buy some drinks, but we ended up playing.\" The door to the fitness room was open, and other children were in\n   the fitness room but left when Y.X. and her friends entered. Y.X. also testified that she never saw McGee in the fitness room, opening the door to the fitness room, or locking or unlocking the door to the fitness room on Saturday, July 18, 2015. Y.X. also testified that her mother, He Shao, was at work at the time of the incident. Y.X.'s deposition testimony contradicted her affidavit in which she said she saw McGee working at the property on Saturday, July 18, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12. All parties filed supplemental briefs on November 30, 2016, as directed by the trial court's order. In support of their Motion to Dismiss and Transfer Venue, B &amp; B and McGee averred that discovery had not revealed any facts to support an independent claim against McGee, or that McGee was a \"person in charge\" or a manager of the complex, such that he owed a legal duty separate from the premises-liability claim urged by Y.X. against B &amp; B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13. In her supplemental brief, Y.X. acknowledged that she had not seen McGee working that Saturday. She admitted that she neither saw McGee the day she claimed injury nor offered any independent evidence that McGee was in, near, or about the fitness room that day. Y.X. maintained that she had seen McGee that Saturday, but\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   in or at the fitness room that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14. Without addressing any facts or applicable law, the trial court denied Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Transfer Venue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Having reviewed the submissions of the parties, heard oral arguments and reviewed supplemental discovery, the Court is of the opinion that there are genuine issues regarding Terence McGee's liability, both individually and in the course of his employment which must be resolved by a jury, rather than by this Court, as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 15. B &amp; B and McGee filed a petition for interlocutory appeal. This Court granted the petition and stayed all trial-court proceedings pending the resolution of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16. The issue as presented by B &amp; B and McGee is stated\n   <em>\n    verbatim et literatim\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Whether the trial court erred in denying defendants' motion to dismiss Terence McGee and transfer the case to Madison County where there is no reasonable claim of liability against McGee, and no other basis exists to establish venue in Hinds County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Y.X. contends the issue is \"[w]hether the trial court erred in denying Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Terence McGee and Transfer the Case to Madison County.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 17. Two defendants seek relief. McGee was seeking dismissal, for no evidence was presented to support any individual liability claim against him. B &amp; B was seeking a transfer of venue based on McGee being dismissed. B &amp; B argued McGee was fraudulently joined to fix venue in Hinds County, depriving B &amp; B of its right to be sued in a proper venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 18. The separate issues require separate standards of review. For motions to dismiss, the standard is de novo.\n   <em>\n    Park on Lakeland Drive, Inc. v.

Our caselaw on motions to dismiss based on fraudulent joinder reveals that this trial court erred in failing to apply our body of law to the facts developed and presented. A detailed review of the record before us uncovers no evidence to support an independent claim of liability against McGee. The trial court further erred by denying B &amp; B's motion to transfer venue. The trial court abused its discretion by not transferring the case to Madison County, the proper venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 19. In this premises-liability\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   case, the trial court was tasked with determining whether Y.X. had a claim for liability based on a foundation of facts against B &amp; B's former employee, McGee. Although a plaintiff may chose the forum when more than one may exist, the rights of defendants also are to be fairly respected.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The right of a citizen to be sued in the county of his residence is a valuable right; it is a right of importance to him-it is not a technical right. Where an action is brought in a county where any one of several defendants resides, the county must be one where a material defendant resides; he must be a proper party-he must not be joined for the sole purpose of giving the court of that county jurisdiction. If he is not a material defendant, and is joined as such by the plaintiff for the fraudulent purpose of giving the court jurisdiction, the cause will be dismissed or transferred to the proper county.... This is too valuable a right to permit the allegations of the plaintiff's declaration to be conclusive. Such a rule would furnish a convenient means for the plaintiff to fraudulently fix the venue of the action to suit his purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Trolio v.

In support of this motion Jefferson testified that he was familiar with the highway and its intersection by the railroad as he was reared in the town of Inverness which is about a mile and a half from this crossing; and that for the last eleven years he has traversed the railroad crossing on an average of four times a week in his business, even though he now lives in Washington County somewhat farther away. He testified that signs reading \"Mississippi Law Stop\" were maintained on each side of the railroad crossing.

The question thus arises as to whether the evidence of the movant was sufficient to negate the allegations of the declaration against the railroad company.

In her affidavit, White states that Douglas was not present at the skating rink when the accident took place; that Douglas was not responsible for supervising public sessions; that Douglas's only connection with The Park related to private skating lessons; and, that Douglas had no duty to discourage high speed skating, or to hire floor guards or rink attendants, nor did Douglas decide the rules of the rink.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Spence was unable to sufficiently respond to The Park's motion and show that Douglas was in any way even remotely responsible for Spence's accident. Initially, Spence responded to The Park's motion by seeking discovery to compile factual support for Spence's allegation. The trial judge never ruled on The Park's motion; and therefore, discovery ensued. However, we find that even upon completion of discovery, there was nothing offered by Spence to assert a reasonable claim of liability against Douglas. Spence's main theory relies on Douglas's expertise in skating. Douglas cannot be responsible based solely on his knowledge of skating. In order to prevail against Douglas, Spence must show some duty on the part of Douglas, and that Douglas breached that duty. Stated differently, in order to recover against Douglas, Spence is required to prove the conventional tort elements of (1) duty, (2) breach of duty, (3) proximate causation, and (4) damages.\n   <em>\n    City of Greenville v.

Today's case requires the same disposition. B &amp; B submitted sworn affidavits that McGee was merely a maintenance man, with no managerial or supervisory duties. He emptied the trash, changed light bulbs, and serviced the HVAC system in the fitness room. No evidence has been presented that McGee was responsible for monitoring residents' use of the fitness room or enforcing fitness-room rules. Although Y.X. and her mother initially provided affidavits swearing that they each had seen McGee working at the property that Saturday, Y.X. testified she only saw McGee, sans uniform, leaving the complex. Moreover, Y.X. testified that her mother was at work that Saturday. In her deposition and affidavit, Y.X. never made any claim of seeing McGee working in or about the fitness room. Their affidavits were not only conclusory and contradictory, but the facts were wholly insufficient to support a premises-liability claim against McGee. Y.X. failed to establish facts upon\n   which any duty arose, and furthermore that McGee had breached any duty.

This well-reasoned, well-researched, and well-written opinion is eminently\n   correct in its summary of Mississippi's principles, which are no less applicable today.

Accepting Y.X.'s testimony that she saw McGee leaving the complex, despite McGee's denial of being there that Saturday, does not change the fact that no evidence was presented which established that McGee owed an individual, legal duty to Y.X., or that he personally breached any legal duty that day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spence\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8455055\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/941/203/#p207\">\n    941 So.2d at 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2006).

Applying principles set forth in\n   <em>\n    Spence\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Frazier\n   </em>\n   , we find that McGee was joined fraudulently and/or frivolously with the intention of depriving B &amp; B of its right to be sued in Madison County and that no reasonable claim of liability was established against McGee.
