This appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was filed more than 30 days after rendition of the orders asserted by appellant as being appealed and is, therefore, untimely. Appellant's motion for clarification of sentence is dismissed as moot.\n  </p>\n  <judges id=\"p-7\">\n   BLACK, SALARIO, and ROTHSTEIN-YOUAKIM, JJ., Concur.\n  </judges>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
