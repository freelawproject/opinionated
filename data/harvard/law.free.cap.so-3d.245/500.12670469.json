Edith Davis Elmore appeals the exclusion of her expert witness and the entry of summary judgment on all asserted\n   claims. Upon review, we find no error and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Dixie Pipeline Company (\"Dixie\") operates a buried pipeline through which liquid propane is transported. The pipeline, which was constructed in 1961, extends approximately 1,100 miles from Texas to North Carolina, and includes various sizes of pipe. The particular segment at issue consists of a 395-mile stretch of 12-inch-diameter pipe, which runs from the west side of the Mississippi River near Erwinville, Louisiana, eastward to Opelika, Alabama, and passes through Clarke County, Mississippi. Lone Star Steel Company manufactured the pipe using a low-frequency electric resistance welding (ERW) process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. In 1988 and 1989, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) issued an alert notice to all hazardous-liquid-propane operators who had in place ERW pipe manufactured before 1970. The notices advised of operational failures of pipeline constructed with ERW pipe manufactured prior to 1970. The notices included certain recommendations by the PHMSA. Neither notice required pipeline operators to cease operating pre-1970 manufactured ERW pipe, or remove and replace the pipe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. On November 1, 2007, the pipeline ruptured near Carmichael, Mississippi. As a result of the rupture, liquid propane was released, some of which vaporized and exploded. At the time of the explosion, Elmore owned a house located approximately 1.1 miles from the accident site. Elmore claims her house suffered structural damage as a result of the shockwaves from the explosion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the pipeline rupture. The NTSB noted that the pipeline segment at issue was hydrostatically pressure tested in 1961, and again in 1984.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, in-line inspections were subsequently performed in 1998, 2005, and 2006. Based on the inspections, the NTSB determined that no defects or anomalies in the subject pipe joint could be correlated with the 2007 rupture. The NTSB ultimately concluded that \"the probable cause\" of the subject pipeline rupture \"was the failure of a weld that caused the pipe to fracture along the longitudinal seam weld, a portion of the upstream girth weld, and portions of the adjacent pipe joints.\" Importantly, the NTSB concluded that the following were not factors in the rupture: corrosion, excavation damage, the controller's actions, or the operating conditions of the pipeline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. In her amended complaint, Elmore asserted claims of negligence, strict liability, and punitive damages against Dixie, as the operator of the pipeline. Following the agreed-upon discovery deadline, Elmore filed a motion to direct Dixie to produce the transcript of the corporate deposition taken in a case that involved the same pipeline rupture, but was litigated in Texas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court denied the untimely motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Dixie subsequently filed motions for summary judgment on all claims asserted by Elmore. The circuit court granted summary\n   judgment in favor of Dixie on the strict-liability and punitive-damages claims, but denied the motion as to Elmore's negligence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Dixie further filed a motion to exclude the opinions and testimony of Elmore's expert witness, Dr. Kendall Clarke. Following a hearing, the circuit court granted the motion, in part, and excluded Dr. Clarke from offering opinion testimony regarding the standard of care for pipeline operators, or any violation of that standard of care by Dixie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Prior to trial, Dixie filed a renewed motion for summary judgment on Elmore's negligence claim. On reconsideration, and in light of the partial exclusion of Dr. Clarke's testimony, the circuit court granted summary judgment as to Elmore's negligence claim. Elmore now appeals and argues the circuit court erroneously: (1) denied her motion to produce the transcript of the corporate deposition taken in the Texas litigation, (2) excluded Dr. Clarke, (3) granted summary judgment on her strict-liability claim, (4) granted summary judgment as to her negligence claim, and (5) granted summary judgment on her punitive-damages claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    I. The Denial of the Production of the Corporate-Deposition Transcript\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10. Elmore first argues the circuit court erroneously denied her \"motion to direct [Dixie] to produce the corporate deposition taken in the Texas litigation.\" \"[Circuit] courts are afforded broad discretion in discovery matters, and this Court will not overturn a [circuit] court's decision unless there is an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashmore v.

On February 27, 2014, an agreed order extending case-scheduling deadlines was entered by the circuit court, which extended the discovery-completion date to March 28, 2014. This was the second extension entered by the circuit court to allow the parties to complete discovery. On April 15, 2014, almost three weeks after the expiration of the agreed-upon discovery deadline, Elmore filed the subject motion and sought the production of \"a true and correct copy of the deposition [transcript], with all exhibits, given by representatives of Dixie in the referenced Texas litigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12. Prior to the agreed-upon discovery deadline, Elmore propounded written discovery to Dixie and deposed two corporate representatives of Dixie. At no time before the close of discovery did Elmore request Dixie to produce prior corporate depositions taken in Texas. In fact, Elmore acknowledged that a formal request was not made until the filing of the motion at issue, which was after the expiration of the discovery deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13. The circuit court \"has the authority and indeed the duty to maintain control of the docket and ensure the efficient disposal of court business.\"\n   <em>\n    Douglas v.

The circuit court excluded Dr. Clarke's opinion testimony regarding the standard of care of pipeline operators, and the alleged breach of that standard by Dixie.

Elmore retained Dr. Clarke, a metallurgical engineer, to offer expert opinions and testimony regarding Dixie's alleged negligence in its operation of the pipeline. In formulating his opinions, Dr. Clarke relied upon the NTSB report, the American Petroleum Institute (API) Standards, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Standards. Dr. Clarke did not rely upon the federal safety regulations, including\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20195\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), \"Transportation of Hazardous Liquids by Pipeline.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17. Elmore acknowledges that Dr. Clarke's opinions did not include a violation of the federal regulations. However, Elmore asserts that Dr. Clarke was not required to base his opinions upon the federal regulations and to opine whether or not the federal regulations had been violated since her case was \"based on common-law tort claims\" and not on the federal statute. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18. The Dixie pipeline became subject to the federal safety regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines, codified in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20195\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , upon enactment in 1969 by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Under these regulations, propane is classified as a highly volatile liquid. In his deposition, Dr. Clarke admitted that he had no familiarity with the federal regulations that govern integrity management for the pipeline. Additionally, Dr. Clarke admitted that he did not apply or consider those applicable federal regulations and standards in rendering his opinions in this matter. Instead, Dr. Clarke used \"the API code because that applies in [his] business.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19. While the record indicates the pipeline was made of API-grade steel pipe and manufactured according to API standards, the pipe was not manufactured by Dixie. Instead, Dixie was the operator of the pipeline. The record shows the operation and maintenance of transmission pipelines is governed by federal safety regulations\n   and standards. Indeed, the NTSB relied upon and cited\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20195\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in its accident report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 20. Dr. Clarke, unlike the NTSB, never inspected the ruptured pipe joint, nor did he perform any testing or analysis on the ruptured pipeline segment. During his deposition, Dr. Clarke acknowledged that he had never been retained in any other case that involved a rupture in an interstate piping system that carried a highly volatile liquid. Dr. Clarke admitted that he had not \"looked at a pipeline involving this type of stuff before\" and further admitted that he had not \"looked at a transportation pipeline governed by [the] DOT before this case.\" Moreover, Dr. Clarke testified that he had never before opined that a company failed to follow applicable standards or regulations for the integrity of its product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21. Dr. Clarke opined the pipeline was running at too high a pressure, particularly given its age. However, the NTSB specifically determined that the operating conditions of the pipeline was not a factor in the rupture. Moreover, Dr. Clarke acknowledged that the pipeline can run up to maximum operating pressure 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Although Dr. Clarke stated it was not a \"good practice,\" he admitted that such a practice was allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 22. Additionally, Dr. Clarke opined that Dixie should have either removed from service every anomaly identified in the in-line inspections and replaced it with new pipe, or de-rated the pressure in the pipeline to a lower maximum operating pressure. When asked the basis of his opinions, Dr. Clarke did not cite to any federal regulation or standard. Instead, Dr. Clarke stated, \"I believe it's fair to say this is my opinion at this point based on all of my training from my doctorate on up.\" However, the NTSB, which spent nearly two years investigating this accident, did not reach the same conclusions. In fact, the NTSB determined that no defects or anomalies in the subject pipe joint could be correlated with the 2007 rupture. Moreover, the corrective measures suggested by Dr. Clarke were not required under the federal regulations, nor would such measures have been warranted, as there was no evidence a rupture was imminent on November 1, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 23. The circuit court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The people [who are] using the pipe, they have got to use it according to the government reg[ulation]s because they are transporting interstate liquefied propane .... And there are government regulations that are in place to say this is what you have got to do to do it safely in accordance with the regulatory guidelines. And I'm not hearing ... Dr. Clarke or anybody else to say that Dixie violated any of those standards. What you are saying is, well, he said that-API standards say that whoever manufactured the pipe should do something different. Well, the people that are telling Dixie how to safely manage their facility that transports interstate-items interstate, I'm not hearing them say that they violated any standard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Dr. Clarke, however, it doesn't seem to me that he can-I mean, unless he-unless he states an opinion that relates to a violation of the applicable government regulatory standards, then I don't see how that applies to what you are dealing with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   I think [Dr. Clarke] is a qualified metallurgist, and he can be qualified to make an opinion or render an opinion as to what happened there that resulted in an explosion .... I would allow him to testify about what happened in the pipeline that allowed the gas to escape .... He can testify to that .... As to violations of API standards[,] ... I don't\n   think that has any relevance. I think the relevant issue is whether Dixie was operating their pipeline in accordance with regulatory guidelines, and he has not expressed any opinion about that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 24. Since Dr. Clarke lacked familiarity with or understanding of the federal regulations and standards, the circuit court properly excluded his ability to opine as to the standard of care for pipeline operators or any violation of that standard of care by Dixie. As the circuit court noted, testimony regarding the violations of API standards would be irrelevant and would not assist the trier of fact. We find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    III. The Dismissal of Elmore's Strict-Liability Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 25. In her amended complaint, Elmore alleged that \"[b]ecause of the inherently dangerous product being transported through its pipeline by [Dixie] with the potential for a devastating loss of property and/or life in the event of an explosion[,] [Dixie] is strictly liable for [Elmore's] damages.\" Elmore's strict-liability claim is based on her assertion that the transportation of liquid propane is an ultrahazardous activity. The circuit court noted that Mississippi has not declared such an activity ultrahazardous, and therefore found strict liability inapplicable. Elmore now argues the circuit court erroneously granted summary judgment on her strict-liability claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 26. \"We employ a de novo standard of review of a [circuit] court's grant or denial of summary judgment and examine all the evidentiary matters before it.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court found that the plaintiff's strict-liability claim could be addressed without having to determine whether oil-waste disposal was an ultrahazardous activity since the plaintiff's nuisance, trespass, and strict-liability claims \"[were] not separate theories of liability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11659364\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/735/161/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11659364\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/735/161/\">\n    at 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 33).

Since the\n   plaintiff \"ha[d] alleged such a physical invasion for which the [o]il [d]efendants were responsible,\" the Court reversed the circuit court's dismissal of the plaintiff's strict-liability claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11659364\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/735/161/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11659364\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/735/161/\">\n    at 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 29. We find Elmore's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Donald\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. Here, Elmore does not allege a physical invasion of her property, nor does she allege nuisance or trespass. Instead, Elmore's strict-liability claim is based solely on the fact that the transportation of liquid propane is an ultrahazardous activity.

Regarding factor (c), Dr. Clarke opined Dixie's utilization of repeated pressure cycles and operating pressures caused the cracks to grow to critical length and depth. However, Dr. Clarke did not opine that the reduction of pressure cycles and operating pressures would reduce or eliminate the risk of a rupture. Importantly,\n   the NTSB found that controller actions and operating conditions of the Dixie pipeline were not factors in the rupture. Moreover, the transportation of liquid propane is a regulated commercial activity, subject to state and federal regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 41. Additionally, factors (d), (e), and (f) weigh against the imposition of strict liability. The Dixie pipeline is a major pipeline through which liquid propane is transported from refineries in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to customers all throughout the southeastern United States. The pipeline was built in 1961 and extends about 1,100 miles through multiple states from Texas to North Carolina. There is no evidence to suggest the placement of the pipeline was inappropriate. Moreover, the transportation of liquid propane is of great value to commerce and local, regional, and nationwide communities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 42.

Elmore asserts \"this is a proper case for [the] application of the negligence doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\" \"Res ipsa loquitur, literally translated 'the thing speaks for itself,' is simply one form of circumstantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Gray v.

The record shows Dixie complied with the\n   governing federal regulations for the operation and management of interstate pipeline. The NTSB found no substantive violations by Dixie and specifically found that controller actions and operating conditions were not factors in the rupture. Thus, Elmore's claim that the pipeline ordinarily would not have ruptured had Dixie \"used reasonable care and caution in the operation of the pipeline\" is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 48.
