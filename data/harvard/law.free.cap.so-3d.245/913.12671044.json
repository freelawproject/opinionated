For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On December 5, 1996, a warrant was issued for the arrest of the defendant for the murder of Erica Cano (\"the victim\"), a homicide committed that day. On March 4, 2009, a new arrest warrant was issued, along with a felony information, charging the defendant with the second degree murder of the victim. On July 21, 2009, the arrest warrant was served on the defendant when he returned to this country. The evidence established that the victim was found lying in the bathtub in a motel room with a wire hanger wrapped around her neck. The medical examiner determined that the cause of death was strangulation and the manner of death was a homicide. Upon his arrest, the defendant gave a taped statement wherein he admitted to becoming angry with the victim, or as he described it, he was \"full of anger, of madness\" when he realized the victim intended to leave him. The defendant explained that he and the victim argued and, at some point, he grabbed the victim by the neck, dragged her into the bathroom, reached for something (which turned out to be a wire hanger), grabbed the victim by the neck again, wrapped the wire hanger around the victim's neck, and threw the victim into the bathtub. When she did not move anymore, he left the motel. The defendant told the detective that he realized that he should have simply ended the relationship, and now he had to pay for his guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 7, 2011, the defendant pled guilty to second degree murder, and pursuant to his negotiated plea, he was sentenced to twenty years in state prison with credit for time served. Since his plea, the defendant has attacked below, and continues to attack here, his sentence on the ground that the sentence imposed is illegal because he was sentenced under the 1995 sentencing guidelines scoresheet which was invalidated by the Florida Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Heggs v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7555469\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/759/620/\">\n    759 So.2d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 23, 2012, the defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief under rule 3.850 claiming ineffective assistance of\n   counsel, alleging, in part, that his trial counsel should have objected to the guidelines scoresheet used to calculate the permissible sentencing range in his case. In his motion, the defendant cited to\n   <em>\n    Heggs\n   </em>\n   and claimed that, had the correct scoresheet been used, he would not have been sentenced to more than 12.5 years in prison. Following the State's response, the trial court denied the motion, and the defendant did not appeal the denial of his 2012 rule 3.850 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 7, 2014, the defendant raised the same challenge, but this time he claimed his sentence was illegal under rule 3.800(a). However, the defendant withdrew his motion after the State advised the defendant that if the trial court set aside the plea, the State was prepared to try the defendant for second degree murder, and if convicted, he could receive a life sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 25, 2015, the defendant raised his scoresheet claim again in a subsequent rule 3.800(a) motion, claiming that his sentence was an illegal sentence because the guidelines scoresheet invalidated by\n   <em>\n    Heggs\n   </em>\n   was used to compute the permissible sentencing range relied on by the State when it negotiated the plea with the defendant and by the trial court when it accepted the negotiated plea. The trial court denied the motion, and this Court affirmed that ruling on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Torres v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=199%20So.%203d%20274\">\n    199 So.3d 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 3d DCA 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Undaunted, the defendant returned to the trial court in 2017 and filed another rule 3.800(a) motion attacking the legality of his sentence on the same grounds and additionally claiming that the amount of gain time he has received is incorrect and that he should be resentenced under a 1994 sentencing guidelines scoresheet. The trial court concluded that the defendant's sentence does not violate\n   <em>\n    Heggs\n   </em>\n   , is not illegal, and is successive, and therefore denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   An illegal sentence for purposes of a rule 3.800(a) motion is one that involves\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    a kind of punishment that no judge under the entire body of sentencing statutes could possibly inflict under any set of factual circumstances.\n   </em>\n   On the other hand, if it is possible under all the sentencing statutes-given a specific set of facts-to impose a particular sentence, then the sentence will not be illegal within rule 3.800(a) even though the judge erred in imposing it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Carter v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11110642\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/786/1173/#p1178\">\n    786 So.2d 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1178 (Fla. 2001) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Blakley v.

However, in 2000, the Florida Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Heggs\n   </em>\n   that the 1995 amendment to the sentencing guidelines was unconstitutional because the Legislature's enactment of Chapter 95-184, Laws of Florida, violated the single subject provision of Article III, section 6, of the Florida Constitution, and thus, persons affected by the amendment were entitled to be resentenced under the 1994 sentencing guidelines. The\n   <em>\n    Heggs\n   </em>\n   decision is, however, tempered by two requirements: (1) the\n   <em>\n    Heggs\n   </em>\n   claim must be raised within two years after the defendant's conviction and sentence became final,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11427577,11427538\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/829/321/\">\n    829 So.2d 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322 (Fla. 5th DCA 2002) ; and (2) the length of the sentence must have been adversely affected by\n   <em>\n    Heggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v.

And, of course, the rules regarding sentencing scoresheet errors also apply. The defendant's\n   <em>\n    Heggs\n   </em>\n   claim fails to meet any of the legal requirements of either a general sentencing scoresheet challenge or a\n   <em>\n    Heggs\n   </em>\n   sentencing scoresheet challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Scoresheet errors generally\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Florida Supreme Court has clarified that when addressing scoresheet errors, the \"could-have-been-imposed,\" \"would-have-been-imposed\" standards apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brooks v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362295\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/969/238/#p241\">\n    969 So.2d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 241-44 (Fla. 2007). Under the \"could-have-been-imposed\" standard, if the trial court\n   <strong>\n    could\n   </strong>\n   have imposed the same sentence using the correct scoresheet, any error from reliance upon the incorrect scoresheet is harmless.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362295\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/969/238/#p241\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362295\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/969/238/#p241\">\n    at 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, if, as the defendant claims in this case, the argument is over whether the trial court\n   <strong>\n    would\n   </strong>\n   have imposed the sentence if it had the benefit of the corrected scoresheet, the defendant must file his postconviction motion within the two-year limitation imposed by rule 3.850(b).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362295\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/969/238/#p241\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362295\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/969/238/#p241\">\n    at 242-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   the class of errors that constitute an \"illegal\" sentence that can be raised for the first time in a post-conviction motion decades after a sentence becomes final is a narrower class of errors than those termed \"fundamental\" errors that can be raised on direct appeal even though unpreserved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Under the 1995 sentencing guidelines, the trial court was required to impose a sentence between 20.5 and 34.16 years in state prison unless there existed a valid reason for the imposition of a departure (upward or downward) sentence. If the defendant's conviction was rescored under the 1994 sentencing guidelines, the trial court could impose a sentence anywhere from 17.16 to 21.67 years in state prison without being required to submit valid reasons to impose a departure sentence. Because the defendant was sentenced to twenty years in prison, his sentence falls within the permissible sentencing range under both sentencing schemes. Thus, any error in the use of the 1995 sentencing scoresheet constitutes harmless error.\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362295\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/969/238/#p241\">\n    969 So.2d at 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Application of the \"would-have-been-imposed\" standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Would-have-been-imposed\" challenges to scoresheet errors fall outside of the rule 3.800 illegal sentence rubric.
