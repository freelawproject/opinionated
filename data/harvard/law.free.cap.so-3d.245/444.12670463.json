Joe and Dianne McGinty sued Grand Casinos of Mississippi Inc.-Biloxi alleging negligence and breach of implied warranty of merchantability for serving unfit food. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Grand Casinos\n   of Mississippi Inc.-Biloxi as to both claims. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment as to the negligence claims, but reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment as to the breach-of-implied-warranty claims. We granted certiorari. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2. According to their depositions, on September 20, 2004, Joe and Dianne\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   McGinty ate breakfast and a snack at their home in Brandon, Mississippi. That evening, they ate dinner at LB's Steakhouse\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in Gulfport, Mississippi. They each had prime rib and a glass of wine with dinner. They then drove to the Grand Casinos of Mississippi, Inc.-Biloxi (Grand Casinos) in Biloxi, Mississippi. They gambled for several hours and drank more wine; however, they did not eat any more food. They went to bed between 10:00 p.m. and midnight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. The McGintys awoke early the next morning and ate breakfast at 5:30 a.m. at the Island View Caf\u00e9 inside the Grand Casinos. Mr. McGinty ordered \"Mama's Eggs and Chops,\" which included two grilled pork chops. Mr. McGinty took a bite of the pork chop and \"didn't like it.\" Therefore, Mrs. McGinty finished the remainder from his plate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4. Mr. McGinty testified that \"somebody dropped the ball with ... that meat that we had.\" Counsel then asked, \"Why do you think it was the meat? And when I'm talking about the meat, I'm talking about the pork chop.\" Mr. McGinty stated, \"Because it tasted bad.\" On the other hand, Mrs. McGinty did not remember the pork chops \"tasting funny.\" Mr. McGinty also was asked: \"Do you think it's possible that you could have eaten somewhere-something else that did not-was not at Grand Casinos that caused you and [Dianne] to get sick?\" Mr. McGinty replied, \"No.\" When asked why he thought that, he stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Because of the length of time that-it was the only thing I had eaten was up at the other Grand. So it was either-that prime rib, they-they're famous for-they were famous for prime rib. And the only thing that we had eaten was the next morning, and it tasted bad. You know, when you-it looked good, but it just tasted bad.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5. After breakfast, the McGintys rode in a limousine provided by the Grand Casinos to New Orleans, Louisiana. They each drank only water in the limousine. However, in the limousine, Mrs. McGinty began to feel nauseated, and she experienced diarrhea at the airport. They then caught a flight to Los Angeles, California. About an hour into the flight, Ms. McGinty began vomiting. Mr. McGinty also fell ill. He began to sweat profusely, feel nauseous, and become incontinent. The flight attendants gave him oxygen and moved the couple to the back of the plane. Mr. McGinty vomited and had diarrhea as well. The McGintys did not eat or drink anything on the airplane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6. When the plane landed in Los Angeles, Mr. McGinty was carried off the airplane on a stretcher by emergency medical technicians. The McGintys were transported to a local hospital by ambulance. On the way to the hospital, Mrs. McGinty began\n   to vomit a large amount of blood. At the hospital, she received two blood transfusions and was treated for an esophageal tear. Mr. McGinty was discharged from the hospital the same day, but Mrs. McGinty stayed in the hospital for three days. Mrs. McGinty stated no tests were conducted for food poisoning at the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7. Upon returning home, Mrs. McGinty saw her general doctor. Prior medical records from her general doctor show Mrs. McGinty had a history of digestive problems. Two months before the alleged food poisoning, her medical records noted that she suffered from \"abdominal pain within 30 minutes after eating which is chronic/recurring frequently, ... [c]rampy/colicky abdominal pain, diarrhea 15-30 minutes after eating which is chronic.\" Further, Mrs. McGinty's medical records show that she had vomited blood in March 2003, which also occurred prior to the alleged food poisoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8. On October 18, 2004, Dr. Jerome Helman, Mrs. McGinty's treating physician from the California hospital, wrote a letter to Mrs. McGinty and enclosed her medical reports. In the letter, Dr. Helman stated Mrs. McGinty's \"upper gastrointestinal bleeding was caused by the severe vomiting, which related to food and drink [she] had prior to the event.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9. On September 13, 2007, the McGintys filed suit in Harrison County Circuit Court against Grand Casinos for negligence and breach of the implied warranty of merchantability. In January 2012, Grand Casinos filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing the McGintys could not meet their burden of proof to establish a food-poisoning claim under Mississippi law. Grand Casinos argued the McGintys had failed to present lab analyses proving their illnesses were caused by tainted food eaten at Grand Casinos, and they had failed to offer sufficient medical-expert testimony on causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10. The trial court granted Grand Casinos' motion for summary judgment. The McGintys appealed. The Court of Appeals held the trial court's judgment, as it pertained to the McGintys' negligence claims, was proper because there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Grand Casinos had breached its duty of care. The Court of Appeals then reversed the trial court's judgment with respect to the breach-of-implied-warranty claims, holding sufficient evidence was presented to allow a jury reasonably to infer the food consumed by the McGintys at the Island View Caf\u00e9 caused their illnesses. Grand Casinos filed a petition for certiorari, and we granted it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) Whether summary judgment was properly granted on the McGintys' negligence claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) Whether summary judgment was properly granted on the McGintys' breach-of-implied-warranty-of-merchantability claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 11. With a summary-judgment motion, the mover bears the initial burden of supporting the motion for summary judgment. Miss. R. Civ. P. 56. \"When a motion for\n   summary judgment is made and supported ... an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings, but his response ... must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Miss. R. Civ. P. 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 12. Summary judgment is proper \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Miss. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In other words, summary judgment is appropriate where the nonmoving party fails to \"make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to the party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Buckel v.

On appeal, the\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   Court considered what reasonable inferences could be drawn based on the proof presented.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1916768\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/207/361/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1916768\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/207/361/\">\n    at 400-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   Court stated, \"[N]o such inference upon inference will be permitted to prevail when the fact sought to be established by such inference upon inference is capable of more satisfactory proof by direct, or positive or demonstrative, evidence, within the reasonable power of the party holding the burden to produce.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1916768\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/207/361/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1916768\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/207/361/\">\n    at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   Court then analyzed the proof presented and what reasonable inferences could be drawn. It stated, \"From the proof the jury could reasonably find: (1) That Mr. Goodwin ate the corned beef; (2) in one and one-half hours he became ill; and (3) from these two proven facts the jury could reasonably infer there was a germ in the corned beef that made him sick.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1916768\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/207/361/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1916768\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/207/361/\">\n    at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   Court then concluded what could not be reasonably inferred: \" We cannot from this inference draw another inference that the bacteria got into the food or drink as a result of the negligence of the restaurateur.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1916768\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/207/361/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1916768\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/207/361/\">\n    at 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   Court affirmed the trial court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1916768\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/207/361/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 16. Here, the McGintys presented proof of the following: (1) they ate a pork chop at a Grand Casinos' restaurant, and Mr. McGinty testified it tasted bad; (2) hours after tasting the pork chop, they\n   experienced vomiting and diarrhea; and (3) more than three weeks after they experienced these symptoms, a physician wrote Mrs. McGinty a letter, stating her prior symptoms were \"related to food and drink [she] had prior to the event.\" The McGintys maintain that the instant proof establishes the causal connection required in a negligence suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17. However, based on the proof presented, the connection between the alleged contaminated pork chop and the illness and that the alleged contaminated pork chop was\n   <em>\n    the result of\n   </em>\n   Grand Casinos' action cannot be reasonably inferred. In other words, as in\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   , the McGintys have failed to make a prima facie case for negligence.\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1916768\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/207/361/\">\n    42 So.2d at 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 18. Thus, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the evidence presented was insufficient to support the McGintys' claim of negligence. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Grand Casinos on the McGintys' negligence claim(s).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) Whether summary judgment was properly granted on the McGintys' breach-of-implied-warranty-of-merchantability claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 19.

In\n   <em>\n    Shultz\n   </em>\n   , at trial, there was no testimony that the potted meat tasted or smelled strangely. Further, here there is also the added element that both the McGintys became ill after eating from the same pork chop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 26.

The main issue on appeal in\n   <em>\n    McMillain\n   </em>\n   was whether the manufacturer or the grocer (who opened the can and served it to customers) was at fault.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1866750\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/171/199/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1866750\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/171/199/\">\n    at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus,\n   <em>\n    McMillain\n   </em>\n   too is distinguishable from the instant case. Stated differently, the issue was not whether fault could be established for the allegedly defective sausage, but who-of two possible defendants-was at fault. While the question of who was at fault would not have been presented without first establishing that food poisoning\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff's illness,\n   <em>\n    McMillain\n   </em>\n   did not address cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, because causation was never an issue, judicial notice could have been taken of the contamination, and\n   <em>\n    McMillain\n   </em>\n   is unclear from where causation did arise,\n   <em>\n    McMillain\n   </em>\n   is materially distinguishable from the instant case and is not instructive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 27. Third, although not binding, we consider how Mississippi district courts have treated alleged food-poisoning cases. In\n   <em>\n    Doss v.

Like in\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   , the theory of negligence automatically distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Doss\n   </em>\n   from the instant issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the plaintiffs suffered differing and inconsistent symptoms.\n   <em>\n    Doss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20754891\">\n    2011 WL 754891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , **2-3. Additionally, as in\n   <em>\n    Shultz\n   </em>\n   , the whole case turned on the plaintiffs' bald claims regarding the food poisoning and the doctors' opinions; opinions which were based on the history related by the plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20754891\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Shultz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9821400\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/208/906/\">\n    208 So.2d 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1968).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Forehand v.

More on point with the instant case is a Southern District case,\n   <em>\n    L.W. ex rel. Ware v.

Another family member who consumed the meat became ill but did not seek medical attention.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203476574\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff sought medical attention, and his stool sample tested positive for bacteria.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203476574\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Considering\n   <em>\n    McMillain\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Shultz\n   </em>\n   , the fact that more than one family member became ill, and the test from the doctor, the\n   <em>\n    Tyson Foods\n   </em>\n   Court denied the summary judgment motion, despite the plaintiff's past stomach problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. G i v e n t h e guidance in\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   and the additional caselaw outlined above, we hold that the McGintys presented enough evidence to survive summary judgment on their breach-of-implied-warranty claim. The evidence did not come in the form of a test, as in\n   <em>\n    Tyson Foods\n   </em>\n   , but a test is not necessarily required where there is\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   evidence. Here,\n   evidence was presented that the pork chop \"tasted funny,\" a doctor's opinion that \"the illness was related to food or drink,\" the fact that the McGintys drank only water between eating the pork chop and becoming ill and the fact that both of the McGintys became ill shortly after both eating from the same pork chop at the same time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 29. The dissent argues that the instant holding places Mississippi more in line with Tennessee's summary judgment standard. Further, the dissent continually interchanges their argument as to the form (in which the McGintys presented the medical opinion) and the substance of the medical opinion. We disagree on both points. The form of the medical opinion was never objected to, and is therefore waived. Further, the substance of the medical opinion is sufficient to withstand summary judgment. Thus, the decision reached today is not based on what \"will, or might be developed later in discovery-or at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Glover v. Jackson State Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8377552\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/968/1267/#p1274\">\n    968 So.2d 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1274 (Miss. 2007). It is based on the evidence before the court, and the collective effect of the evidence presented is enough for a jury reasonably to infer that the McGintys became ill from a defective pork chop. Therefore, while the evidence presented is not enough for a negligence claim, there is a line between a negligence claim and a breach of implied warranty claim, and this case, in the words of Johnny Cash, walks the line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 30.

The majority finds\n   <em>\n    Doss\n   </em>\n   distinguishable because there, the plaintiffs sued under negligence, not breach of implied warranty. But as the majority implicitly recognizes, the only practical difference between the two theories is the duty-of-care element required for negligence, which is not required for implied warranty. The causation requirement, however, is the same for both theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 41. Clearly, based upon the aforementioned finding(s) by the federal district court, the district court would have reached the same conclusion in favor of the defendant even if the plaintiffs had sued under implied warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 42. Conversely, the same can be said with\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   , which-respectfully-both the majority and the Court of Appeals have completely misconstrued in this instance. Having thoroughly read and considered\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   , there remains no question in my mind that had there not been expert evidence in the case affirmatively establishing that the consumer's illness was caused by food poisoning, the\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   Court would not have included any of\n   its dicta in the opinion with regard to implied warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 43. Here, similar to\n   <em>\n    Doss\n   </em>\n   , and unlike in\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McMillain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Baskin\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    L.W.\n   </em>\n   , neither of the McGintys was medically diagnosed with food poisoning. For Joe, no medical information whatsoever relating to his alleged visit to the emergency room in California has been provided. For Dianne, all we have is an unsworn letter from her treating physician saying she suffered from \"upper gastrointestinal bleeding\" that \"was caused by the severe vomiting, ... related to food and drink [she] had prior to the event.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 44. Even if the letter was admissible as evidence (which it is not), no reasonable inference beyond speculation can be drawn from it that Dianne's illness was the result of food poisoning. And in turn, no inference can be drawn from Dianne's illness that the pork chop she ate contained harmful bacteria which rendered the food unfit for human consumption. Furthermore, the letter actually confirms (rather than excludes) what Dianne's prior medical records show, that she has experienced similar episodes in the past due to other ongoing medical conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 45. The majority, however, declines to address or consider this because it finds that: (1) Grand Casinos did not object to the \"form\" of the California physician's letter; and (2) \"the content of the evidence-the treating physician's opinion could be admissible at trial, if properly presented.\" Respectfully, the majority is incorrect on each point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 46. Contrary to the majority's finding, Grand Casinos did object to the California physician's letter. Grand Casinos moved for summary judgment on the ground there is no sufficient medical expert evidence that the McGintys' alleged illnesses were caused by a tainted pork chop. In response, the McGintys offered the above-mentioned, unsworn letter from Dianne's treating physician in California. Grand Casinos replied, claiming the letter \"is not even close to sufficient to establish that the pork chop 'was infected by poisonous bacteria[.]' \" I completely agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 47. While Grand Casinos bears the initial burden of supporting its motion for summary judgment, the McGintys retain the burden of proof throughout their implied-warranty cause of action. When the moving party does not bear the burden of proof at trial, the moving party may satisfy its burden of production for Rule 56 purposes, by either (1) affirmatively negating an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim or (2) demonstrating the nonmoving party's evidence at the summary-judgment stage is insufficient to establish the nonmoving party's claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galloway v.

Grand Casinos fully met Rule 56's second alternative (the\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   standard), by demonstrating the California physician's letter is insufficient to establish the pork chop Dianne ate was infected with poisonous bacteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 49. The majority, however, treats the deficiencies of the California physician's letter as a matter of form that should not yet be considered for summary-judgment purposes. Ostensibly-and I truly hope this is the case, for the sake of restauranteurs and the like in Mississippi-the majority finds so on the expectation that more is to come from the treating physician in California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 50. But while I hope this is the majority's ultimate position, the majority nevertheless\n   departs from this Court's precedent in so holding. In\n   <em>\n    Glover v.

Yet the majority finds this appropriate in this instance based upon language it reads from\n   <em>\n    Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6841274\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/179/1037/#p1043\">\n    179 So.3d 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1043 (Miss. 2015) : \"To be exact, the content of summary-judgment evidence must be admissible at trial although the evidence may be in a form, such as an affidavit, that would not be admissible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 52. But this statement from\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   is actually a\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   illustration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6841274\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/179/1037/#p1043\">\n    179 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1043 (citing Jeffrey Jackson, Mississippi Civil Procedure \u00a7 11:22 (2009) ).

But soon thereafter, Tennessee realized it had fallen into a\n   <em>\n    burning ring of fire\n   </em>\n   with its newly held standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   And in\n   <em>\n    Rye v.

Here, whether the California physician's letter was sworn to or not was inconsequential and superfluous to Grand Casinos' actual objection to it.

The only mention of bacteria in this case comes from Joe's deposition, in which Joe said he was familiar with the incubation time of certain bacteria, having previously worked in the food industry as a senior vice-president and general manager of operations for McCarty Farms. But Joe-as he admitted-is not a qualified expert in the field of bacteriology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 60. I also refuse to take any sort of judicial notice, as the majority and the Court of Appeals appear to do in this case, with regard to the alleged fact the McGintys both became ill\n   <em>\n    soon\n   </em>\n   after eating the same pork chop. In addition to the pork chop the McGintys said they ate, the McGintys said they both ate \"prime rib\" the night before at another casino. And at one point in Joe's deposition, Joe indicated that the prime rib could have caused their illness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 61. I point out the case\n   <em>\n    Hairston v.

Her treating physician testified that none of the tests he conducted revealed any bacteria that could have caused food poisoning; however, he could not rule it out.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236581\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/764/176/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236581\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/764/176/\">\n    at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, the physician also testified that \"the incubation for different types of bacteria which can cause food poisoning is anywhere from an hour to a week.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236581\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/764/176/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 62. Here, besides the alleged fact that Joe and Dianne became ill at some point after eating the pork chop, the only other evidence presented in support of their claim the pork chop was unfit for human consumption, is Joe's recollection that it \"tasted bad.\" While evidence that food \"tasted bad\" has been held in some cases to constitute a factor for consideration in determining whether food was unfit for consumption, all of the cases I have reviewed where this was held also contained evidence of medically diagnosed food poisoning by a treating physician.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

In my firm opinion, to reach the conclusion reached by the majority and the Court of Appeals in this case that the collective effect of the evidence presented is enough for a jury reasonably to infer that the McGintys became ill from an infected pork chop, requires bootstrapping inference upon inference from the alleged fact both the McGintys became ill some time after eating the porkchop.
