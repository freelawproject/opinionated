The written sentence designated the defendant both a prison releasee reoffender and a habitual felony offender. The oral pronouncement, however, reflects that the trial court designated the defendant a prison releasee reoffender only. The oral pronouncement of sentence prevails over a subsequent and conflicting written sentencing order.\"). Montoya's sentence is affirmed in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Reversed and remanded with instructions.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
