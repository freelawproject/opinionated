On appeal, Ostane argues that the trial court erred when it modified his sentence without holding a resentencing hearing. We agree and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2001, Ostane pled guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to thirty years in prison, which we affirmed on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ostane v.

Ostane was seventeen years old at the time of the offense. Based on recent decisions, Ostane is entitled to receive \"an opportunity for\n   <em>\n    early\n   </em>\n   release that is meaningful, based on a demonstration of maturity and rehabilitation, and during his or her natural life.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.
