Holmes's petition for writ of habeas corpus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our January 24, 2018 opinion contained an order to show cause why Holmes should not be prohibited from filing with this Court any further pro se appeals, petitions, motions or other pleadings related to his life sentence for attempted first degree murder, attempted robbery, and attempted burglary with an assault (the charges enhanced due to the use of a firearm) in lower tribunal case number 01-18524A. The record indicated that Holmes had filed ten post-conviction motions, petitions or appeals in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Our order to show cause provided Holmes with a response period of forty-five days. Holmes has not filed a response. Accordingly, we conclude that Holmes has not demonstrated good cause to justify further pro se filings of appeals, petitions, motions or other pleadings with this Court in lower tribunal case number 01-18524A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After notice in the form of an order to show cause and an opportunity for the incarcerated person to respond, a court may prevent further filings.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We recognize that the access to courts provision of the Florida Constitution-Article I, section 21 -provides an avenue for an incarcerated person to challenge the legal basis for his or her incarceration; however, this constitutional right may be forfeited if he or she abuses the judicial process.\n   <em>\n    Jimenez v.
