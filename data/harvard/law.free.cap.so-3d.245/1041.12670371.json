Prior to the filing of formal charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for consent discipline in which respondent admitted that his conduct violated Rules 8.4(a) and 8.4(b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Having reviewed the petition,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that Timothy John Henry, Jr., Louisiana Bar Roll number 35490, be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year. It is further ordered that the entirety of the suspension shall be deferred, subject to a one-year period of unsupervised probation. The probationary period shall commence from the date respondent and the ODC execute a formal probation plan. Any failure of respondent to comply with the conditions of probation, or any misconduct during the probationary period, may be grounds for making the deferred portion of the suspension executory, or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, \u00a7 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
