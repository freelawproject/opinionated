The trial court is ordered to strike the husband's notice for trial and to remove the case from the trial docket, as the wife's motion to strike the husband's reply, a motion directed to the last pleading served, has not yet been disposed of. See Fla. Fam. L. R. P. 12.440 ; Gawker Media, LLC v. Bollea,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6858858\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/170/125/\">\n    170 So. 3d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2d DCA2015). Because we are confident that the circuit court will promptly comply with this ruling, we withhold formal issuance of the writ. The wife's motion to strike is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <judges id=\"p-7\">\n   VILLANTI, MORRIS, and ROTHSTEIN-YOUAKIM, JJ., Concur.\n  </judges>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
