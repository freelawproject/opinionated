The written order of revocation of probation, however, included this as one of the grounds for revoking Martin's probation. We agree with the state's confession of error and remand for correction of the order of revocation of probation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7419001,7418989\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/686/701/\">\n    686 So.2d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 3d DCA 1996) (\"The trial court's written order revoking appellant's probation does not conform to the court's oral pronouncements. At the revocation hearing the court orally dismissed the allegations of paragraphs two, four, and five of the affidavit of probation violation. The written revocation order, however, finds appellant guilty of the probation violations alleged in those paragraphs. We remand this case so that the order may be corrected to conform to the trial court's oral pronouncements.\"). Martin need not be present for this purpose.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7419001,7418989\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/686/701/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Appellant need not be present for this purpose.\").
