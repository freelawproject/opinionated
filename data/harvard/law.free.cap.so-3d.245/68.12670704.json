(\"Jazz Casino\"). For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 26, 2016, Ms. Lewis filed suit against Jazz Casino, the owner and operator of Harrah's casino (\"Harrah's\") in New Orleans. In her petition, Ms. Lewis alleges that on August 1, 2015, she was walking through Harrah's when she slipped and fell on some food on the floor. The petition asserts that Ms. Lewis sustained personal injuries caused by the negligent acts of Jazz Casino, which include,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   : (1) failure to properly maintain the casino premises; (2) failure to provide a reasonably safe surface for customers to walk on; (3) failure to provide any warnings of the dangerous condition; and (4) failure to inspect the area of the casino in which Ms. Lewis was injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 8, 2016, Jazz Casino filed an answer. Thereafter, the parties propounded interrogatories and requests for production of documents, and Ms. Lewis's deposition was taken. The record does not show that the trial court set a discovery cut-off date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 2, 2017, Jazz Casino filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that there was an absence of factual support for several elements essential to Ms. Lewis's claim under Louisiana's Merchant\n   Liability Statute, La. R.S. 9:2800.6, including whether: (1) the food on the floor presented an unreasonable risk of harm that was reasonably foreseeable; (2) Jazz Casino created the risk of harm or had actual or constructive notice of the condition prior to Ms. Lewis's fall; and (3) Jazz Casino failed to exercise reasonable care to keep the aisles and walkways free of hazardous conditions. Jazz Casino contends that it is entitled to summary judgment because Ms. Lewis cannot prove all of the elements of her cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Lewis filed an opposition memorandum arguing that she has sufficient direct and circumstantial evidence to satisfy her burden of proving the elements of La. R.S. 9:2800.6 and, at a minimum, to establish numerous genuine issues of material fact to preclude summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In support of its motion for summary judgment, Jazz Casino submitted excerpts from the deposition of Ms. Lewis, affidavits of Harrah's employees, safety manuals and an employee handbook, and Ms. Lewis's answers to interrogatories. In opposition to the motion, Ms. Lewis submitted excerpts from her deposition, affidavits from her husband and son, statements from Harrah's employees, and Ms. Lewis's discovery responses. The record and these exhibits establish the following facts concerning the incident:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ms. Lewis testified in her deposition that, prior to the accident, she, her son, her husband, and her mother were leaving the slot machine area of the casino, and heading to the exit through the walkway between Harrah's buffet restaurant and the Masquerade lounge. She recalled that there \"wasn't a whole lot of light\" in the area. She said that while she stopped to look for her keys in her purse, her mother and husband continued walking 10 to 15 feet in front of her and her son. She noticed a Harrah's employee walking near her. She said that she slipped on the floor, and her son caught her as she fell. Ms. Lewis stated that she did not see any substance on the ground before she fell. She said that, after her fall, she saw \"little white stuff\" on the floor. According to Ms. Lewis, the nearby Harrah's employee, who stopped to help her, told her that she had slipped on a \"smushed grape.\" She said that the Harrah's employee called his supervisor over, who told Ms. Lewis to step onto the nearby carpet to wipe off her feet. Ms. Lewis testified that she did not know how the grape got on the floor, did not know how long the grape was on the floor, and did not know if a Harrah's employee put the grape on the floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Lewis's son, Huebert Lewis II (\"Huebert II\"), submitted an affidavit in which he corroborated Ms. Lewis's testimony, including her statement that the Harrah's employee said that she had slipped on a \"smushed grape.\" He further stated that after his mother slipped, he looked down and saw \"some type of smashed food\" on the floor. He also testified that after his mother wiped off her shoe on the carpet, he again saw \"some type of food on the carpet and on her shoe.\" According to Huebert II, his mother \"pointed to the food substance on the floor to show the supervisor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. Lewis's husband, Huebert Lewis Sr. (\"Huebert Sr.\"), also submitted an affidavit in which he corroborated the testimony of his wife and son that the Harrah's employee said the substance on the floor looked like a \"smushed grape.\" He also stated that, after his wife fell, he \"looked down and saw some type of food substance on the marble floor\" and the carpet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Standford Parkman, a beverage employee at Harrah's who saw Ms. Lewis slip and fall, completed an Employee Statement in which he stated that when he went over to help Ms. Lewis, he did not observe \"any\n   fruit on the ground\" or \"any other condition that would cause the slip.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Tori Mayshack, a beverage supervisor at Harrah's, completed a Voluntary Statement in which she stated that, at 3:00 a.m. on August 1, 2015, Mr. Parkman called her on the radio. She said that when she arrived between the Harrah's buffet and the Masquerade lounge, Mr. Parkman told her that a guest had slipped and fallen. Ms. Mayshack stated that Ms. Lewis told her that she had slipped on \"something\" on the floor, and pointed to a substance. Ms. Mayshack described the substance as \"like melted cheese.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In discovery, Jazz Casino produced a surveillance videotape of the incident which starts one minute prior to Ms. Lewis's slip and fall, and ends four minutes after the incident. The videotape starts at the 2:49:00 a.m. mark and shows Ms. Lewis slipping and falling on the tile floor in front of Harrah's buffet around the 2:50:03 a.m. mark. The video also shows Mr. Parkman stopping to help Ms. Lewis, at which time her son, Huebert II, and Mr. Parkman huddle around an area of the floor to see what caused her accident. The video further shows Ms. Lewis's husband and mother walking back to Ms. Lewis to examine the floor. In the video, no foreign substance is visible on the casino floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court originally set the motion for summary judgment for hearing on April 28, 2017. On April 12, 2017, Ms. Lewis propounded a second set of requests for production of documents in which she requested additional surveillance video between 10:30 p.m. on July 31, 2015 through 7:00 a.m. on August 1, 2015. Ms. Lewis also requested cleaning, maintenance, and inspection logs of the area between Harrah's buffet and the Masquerade lounge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The trial court continued the hearing on the motion for summary judgment without date pending Jazz Casino's responses to Ms. Lewis's second set of document requests. In response to the second discovery requests, Jazz Casino stated that it had no other videotape, and had no such logs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 4, 2017, the trial court held a hearing on Jazz Casino's motion for summary judgment, and on August 15, 2017, the trial court signed a judgment granting Jazz Casino's motion, and dismissing Ms. Lewis's cause of action. Ms. Lewis then sought a timely devolutive appeal of the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We apply a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review in examining a trial court's ruling on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Hare v.

Her action, therefore, is controlled by La.

In a negligence claim brought against a merchant by a person lawfully on the merchant's premises for damages as a result of an injury, death, or loss sustained because of a fall due to a condition existing in or on a merchant's premises, the claimant shall have the burden of proving, in addition to all other elements of his cause of action, all of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (1) The condition presented an unreasonable risk of harm to the claimant and that risk of harm was reasonably foreseeable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (2) The merchant either created or had actual or constructive notice of the condition which caused the damage, prior to the occurrence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (3) The merchant failed to exercise reasonable care. In determining reasonable care, the absence of a written or verbal uniform cleanup or safety procedure is insufficient, alone, to prove failure to exercise reasonable care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The trial court, in granting summary judgment, concluded that Ms. Lewis failed to prove the second element, i.e., that Jazz Casino had \"constructive notice of the condition which caused the damage, prior to the occurrence.\" Because the\n   plaintiff has the burden of proving all three elements of the Merchant Liability Statute, \"the failure to prove any is fatal to the claimant's cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    White v.

A claimant who simply shows that the condition existed without an additional showing the condition existed for some time before the fall has not carried the burden of proving constructive notice as mandated by the statute. Though the time period need not be specific in minutes or hours, constructive notice requires that the claimant prove the condition existed for some time period prior to the fall.

All that is required is that the substance be present for \"some period of time\" prior to Ms. Lewis's accident. The surveillance video shows that, one minute after Ms. Lewis entered the tiled walkway in front of Harrah's buffet, her leg slipped out from under her and she fell. The video shows that within seconds of the accident, Ms. Lewis's son and husband rushed over to help her, and both testified that they saw the foreign substance on the floor and her shoe. Ms. Lewis testified that she saw \"little white stuff\" on the floor. She also said that when Mr. Parkman came over immediately to help her, he told her that she had slipped on a \"smushed grape.\" Ms. Mayshack, the Harrah's supervisor stated that she was called over by Mr. Parkman after the fall, and she saw a substance like \"melted cheese\" on the floor. And because Ms. Lewis's slip and fall, and the witnesses' observations of the foreign substance, occurred within seconds of each other, we disagree with Jazz Casino's contention that post-accident evidence is insufficient to establish that the substance was on the floor for \"some period of time\" before the accident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

For example, although Ms. Lewis proved that the substance was on the floor for \"some period of time,\" the length of time the substance was present is clearly in dispute and can only be determined by the fact finder at trial. Ms. Lewis has established that the surveillance videotape only shows the condition of the floor one minute prior to the accident. Ms. Lewis asserts that Jazz Casino selectively chose to only preserve video for one minute before her fall, which raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Jazz Casino intentionally, and without reasonable explanation, failed to preserve videotape evidence that was detrimental to its case and would have enabled Ms. Lewis to prove her case. Finally, although Harrah's buffet closed at 10:00 p.m., Jazz Casino has no logs or other records showing whether the walkway floor was cleaned between 10:00 p.m. and the time of her slip and fall, which establishes another genuine issue of material fact for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Because Ms. Lewis presented circumstantial evidence that satisfied her burden of showing that the substance was on the floor for \"some period of time\" before her slip and fall, and because this evidence established the existence of genuine issues of material fact, the trial court erred in granting Jazz Casino's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For all these reasons, we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand this matter for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED; REMANDED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   LOBRANO, J., CONCURS IN THE RESULTS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   BAGNERIS, J., DISSENTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   BAGNERIS, J., DISSENTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   I respectfully dissent from the majority ruling, because I find that the plaintiff cannot make the required showing of constructive notice on the part of defendant-appellee, Jazz Casino.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.

Instead, the principal issue in this case is whether Jazz Casino had constructive notice of the condition. \" 'Constructive notice' means the claimant has proven that the condition existed for such a period of time that it would have been discovered if the merchant had exercised reasonable care.\" La.

Moreover, the majority's emphasis on the fact that videotape was only preserved for the minute leading up to the fall is misplaced.
