Dysart\n   In this medical malpractice action, plaintiff-appellant, Dorothy Pennington, appeals a judgment granting motions for directed verdicts in favor of defendants, Dr. Andrew Todd (\"Dr. Todd\"), Ochsner Clinic Foundation (\"Ochsner\"), Fadi Hawawini, D.O. (\"Dr. Hawawini\"), Brent Thibodeaux, Jim Aubry Jones, M.D. (\"Dr. Jones\"), and Gretchen Ulfers, M.D. (\"Dr. Ulfers\") (collectively, \"defendants\"), and dismissing all claims with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, as is required for a directed verdict, we do not find that the evidence points so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the defendants, with the exception of Dr. Hawawini, or that reasonable minds could not arrive at a contrary verdict. Thus, we find that the trial court erred in granting directed verdict as to the defendants, with the exception of Dr. Hawawini, for whom plaintiff failed to establish both the standard of care and a breach thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the trial court's judgment in part, reverse it in part and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the Petition for Damages,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on February 17, 2011, Richard Smallwood fell at his home and sustained \"bilateral patella tendon ruptures,\" for which he was admitted to the Ochsner-Baptist facility. After undergoing surgery by Dr. Todd to repair the ruptures, Mr. Smallwood \"experienced a slightly complicated post-operative course\" and was discharged on February 23, 2017 to the Ochsner Skilled Nursing Unit in Jefferson Parish. On February 26, 2017, Mr. Smallwood died at the skilled nursing unit, and an autopsy revealed that he had suffered a pulmonary embolism, secondary to deep vein thrombosis [DVT], which, according to the Petition, was \"secondary to [his] bilateral knee surgery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Petition alleges that Mr. Smallwood had been in \"generally good health\" prior to his injury, but while a patient at Ochsner-Baptist, \"he was not administered appropriate prophylactic anti-coagulant medication, in violation of the standard of care.\" More specifically, it alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-14\">\n   At Ochsner-Baptist, Jim Aubry Jones, M.D. and Gretchen Ulfers, M.D. were consulted for post-surgical medical management purposes, but failed to recognize the lack of, or direct initiation of, appropriate prophylactic anti-coagulant medication. Dr.Todd failed to order appropriate prophylactic anti-coagulant medication at Ochsner-Baptist and in connection with the patient's transfer to and admission at the Ochsner Skilled Nursing Unit facility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Named as defendants are Drs. Todd, Jones and Ulfers, as well as Dr. Hawawini, D.O., the director of Ochsner's skilled nursing unit, and nurse Thibodeaux, to whom Mr. Smallwood is alleged to have made complaints which were neglected. The Petition further alleges that, at the skilled nursing unit, Mr. \"Smallwood was not assessed by Dr. Hawawini or any other physician.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A jury trial commenced on April 3, 2017. At the conclusion of the plaintiff's\n   case in chief, the defendants moved for directed verdicts on the ground that the plaintiff failed to meet her burden of proof of medical malpractice. The motions for directed verdicts were verbally granted by the trial court, which found as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ... based on the testimony that's been adduced as to Dr. Todd that there was a failure to establish the standard of care or a breach thereof. The Court is hereby granting a directed verdict as to Dr. Todd....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   It's [this] Court's finding that there has been a failure to establish the standard of care as to Dr. Jones, Dr. Ulfers, Dr. Hawawini. And certainly we had no testimony as to the standard of care of a nurse practitioner or how that was breached. The Court has to grant the motion for a directed verdict as to each defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court further explained its finding by stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ... the problem is you can't just do a broad brush against everybody unless you can show that that person breached the standard of care. You can't just say well, everybody messed up. No. You have to show that that person breached the standard of care if you're going to hold them liable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A written judgment was rendered, memorializing the trial court's verbal judgment on April 11, 2017. The plaintiff timely filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Dr. Todd answered the appeal, seeking relief only in the event that this Court reverses the trial court's judgment. In that event, Dr. Todd seeks a finding from this Court that the plaintiff failed to properly qualify her expert physician who, thus, lacked the specific capacity to render opinions in this case. An answer to the appeal was also filed by Ochsner, Dr. Hawawini, Mr. Thibodeaux, Dr. Jones, and Dr. Ulfers, who seek similar relief as that sought by Dr. Todd; namely, a finding that the trial court erred in accepting, as expert testimony, the opinions of a general surgeon in this matter. They contend that the plaintiff's expert was not qualified to offer opinions as to specialists in hospital medicine or as to treatment received in a rehabilitation hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Motions for Directed Verdict, Generally\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   La.

The question to be asked by the appellate court is not whether a plaintiff proved his case by a preponderance of the evidence, but rather, whether upon reviewing the evidence submitted, the court could conclude that reasonable persons could not have reached a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The appellate court must also determine if the record supports the granting of a directed verdict, based not on a credibility determination (a factual issue), but on a sufficiency-of-evidence determination (a question of law). A directed verdict must be sustained on appeal where the reviewing court would find a jury verdict in favor of the party opposing the motion to be manifestly erroneous had the trial judge allowed the case to go to the jury. The court of appeal considers the evidence under the substantive law applicable to the nonmoving party's claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7510590\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/556/276/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 07-0981, pp. 13-14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8399888\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/978/1036/#p1047\">\n    978 So.2d at 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We have conducted a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the record before us and find that it does not support the trial court's grant of the motions for directed verdicts, with the exception of the directed verdict in favor of Dr. Hawawini.

Those include the use of a TED stocking after surgery, SCD's (sequential compression devices, which Dr. Frangipane testified are \"a kind of stocking that gently milks the leg back in which the venous circulation returns guided by the SCD ... back to the heart\"), and the use of aspirin. However, Dr. Frangipane opined that the defendants failed to take further appropriate measures to avoid DVT. According to Dr. Frangipane, these measures were not sufficient. To the contrary, Dr. Frangipane testified that Mr. Smallwood had an increasing risk of developing a post-surgical DVT, but he did not receive pharmacologic prophylaxis, such as blood thinners. According to Dr. Frangipane, \"the risks of giving prophylaxis are far less than the risks of not giving prophylaxis.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Similar to the testimony of the physicians at issue in\n    <em>\n     Soteropulos\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    , and\n    <em>\n     Kieffer\n    </em>\n    , according to Dr. Frangipane, the standard of care with respect to the diagnosis and treatment of DVT is the same for all specialties; he testified as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    Q. With respect to post-surgical treatment of a patient regarding DVT prophylaxis and detention, is there any difference in standard of care whether you're a surgeon or hospitalist or a medical director?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n    A. The difference is the same for all of us. We look at DVT, or should anyway, the same way. We're all trying to create prevention.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    According to Dr. Frangipane, the failure of the defendants, individually and collectively, to undertake the additional measure of administering pharmacologic prophylaxis to Mr. Smallwood equated to breaches of the standards of care for each of the defendants.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Dr. Frangipane's criticism of Dr. Hawawini, however, was imprecise and he did not indicate that Dr. Hawawini had any direct involvement in Mr. Smallwood's\n    care, nor that, as a medical director, he should have been involved in the care of individual patients. To the contrary, Dr. Frangipane simply testified as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    I\n    <em>\n     suspect\n    </em>\n    that even though I am not a medical director, one of the things that I have seen in patients in whom I have given the care over to a physician such as this while they're recovering from surgery, every one [sic] should know the treatment and the ability to care for patients at higher risk for DVT.
