In August 2014, Dianne and Reggie Harkins filed suit in the Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, alleging that the direct and proximate negligence of multiple healthcare providers located in Leake County and Hinds County resulted in, among other problems, the amputation of Dianne Harkins's hands and feet. In January 2015, Madden Medical Clinic, PLLC (Madden Medical) and David Moody, M.D. (Dr. Moody) filed a motion to dismiss or, alternatively, for severance and transfer of venue to the Circuit Court of Leake County. Shortly thereafter, Baptist Medical Center-Leake, Inc. (BMC-Leake) and Mississippi Baptist Health Systems, Inc. (Baptist Health) filed a motion also to dismiss or transfer venue to the Circuit\n   Court of Leake County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A hearing was held on April 16, 2016. On February 26, 2016, the Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County entered an order denying the motions of Dr. Moody, Madden Medical, BMC-Leake, and Baptist Health to dismiss or, in the alternative, to transfer venue. The parties appealed, collectively filing two interlocutory appeals, and both appeals were granted and consolidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. The Court holds Section 11-11-3(3) to be clear and unambiguous. Under the plain language of Section 11-11-3(3), venue is proper for the properly joined defendants in Hinds County or Leake County, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. On March 11, 2013, Dianne Harkins arrived at the BMC-Leake emergency room at approximately 3:50 p.m. and complained of right flank pain. From 3:51 p.m. until 7:00 p.m., Harkins's blood pressure declined and her heart rate increased. That evening, a CT scan showed moderate to severe hydronephrosis, a dilated ureter, and the probable presence of calcifications in the right ureter. The emergency-room physician then admitted Harkins to the hospital to the care and service of Dr. Moody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4. Dr. Moody evaluated Harkins at approximately 7:15 a.m. on March 12, 2013. After Harkins's vital signs were taken and noted at 7:48 a.m., Dr. Moody was notified of Harkins's declining condition, and he ordered medications to be administered. By 10:30 a.m., Harkins's blood pressure had dropped to 67/31. After being notified of Harkins's condition, Dr. Moody saw Harkins at approximately 10:50 a.m. At 11:15 a.m., Dr. Moody ordered Harkins to be transferred via air ambulance to Mississippi Baptist Medical Center in Jackson. Harkins was transferred at approximately 12:25 p.m. Dr. Moody's discharge summary reflected that Harkins was transferred with hydronephrosis and shock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5. Harkins arrived at Mississippi Baptist Medical Center in Jackson at approximately 1:10 p.m., and she was admitted to the emergency room. Harkins was prescribed antibiotics at 2:13 p.m. The complaint alleges that Harkins was not given antibiotics until 3:00 and/or 3:45 p.m. Harkins was then admitted to Baptist Medical Center's critical care unit with acute respiratory failure, hypotension, sepsis, septic shock, acidemia, pneumonia, renal failure syndrome, and urethral stone with urosepsis. Harkins developed more complications during her stay in the critical care unit which culminated in the development of gangrene in Harkins's hands and feet. Due to the development of gangrene, both Harkins's hands and feet were amputated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. On August 29, 2014, based on the events described above, Harkins filed a medical-malpractice suit. Harkins's husband, Reggie Harkins, also brought a claim for loss of consortium. In January 2015, Madden Medical and Dr. Moody filed a motion to dismiss or, alternatively, to sever and transfer venue to Leake County. Thereafter, BMC-Leake and Baptist Health also filed a motion to dismiss or transfer to Leake County. In their respective motions, each party cited Mississippi Code Section 11-11-3(3), arguing that Leake County is the only proper venue for each of them based on the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. On February 26, 2016, the Hinds County Circuit Court entered an order denying the motions of Dr. Moody, Madden\n   Medical, BMC-Leake, and Baptist Health (collectively, \"Leake County Appellants\") to dismiss or, in the alternative, to transfer venue. Aggrieved by the denied motions to dismiss or transfer, the Leake County Appellants filed interlocutory appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court granted each appeal and consolidated the appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8. The briefs that the parties and friends of the Court have filed each set forth their rendition of the issue or issues. For clarity and conciseness, the Court has consolidated the issues into one issue with two subsections. Because the Court holds the single issue and two subsections to be case-dispositive of all additional issues brought before the Court and aptly argued during oral argument, the additional issues are not addressed.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Whether, under Mississippi Code Section 11-11-3(3), the malpractice allegations against all the medical defendants may be brought in Hinds County, when the alleged malpractice occurred in Hinds County and in Leake County.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Whether Mississippi Code Section 11-11-3(3) is plain and unambiguous.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Whether Mississippi Code Section 11-11-3(3) prevents joinder.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 9. The Court reviews \"a trial court's grant or denial of a motion for change of venue for an abuse of discretion, but questions of law, such as interpretation of the general venue statute, are reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Laurel Ford Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. v.

The Harkinses do not dispute that all the alleged malpractice on the part of the Leake County Appellants occurred in Leake County, not in Hinds County. The issue of venue, however, arises under Section 11-11-3(3) because additional alleged malpractice occurred in Hinds County by Mississippi Baptist Medical Center. The Harkinses argue that the malpractice in both counties created one injury that prevents the separate alleged acts of malpractice from being severable. The Leake County Appellants argue the alleged medical negligence in Hinds County should be severed, and venue as to them is appropriate in Leake County alone. Our analysis rests on Section 11-11-3(3), and for the below-detailed reasons, we affirm the trial court judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Whether Mississippi Code Section 11-11-3(3) is plain and unambiguous.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 11. The Leake County Appellants argue that the language of the statute is\n   plain and unambiguous, providing that the only proper venue for a suit against a medical provider is the county in which the alleged act or omission occurred. Without stating whether the statute is clear or ambiguous, the Harkinses argue that Section 11-11-3(3) limits the plaintiffs' venue choices to a county in which the alleged acts or omissions of medical malpractice occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 12.

Subsection one provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (1)(a)(i) Civil actions of which the circuit court has original jurisdiction shall be commenced\n   <em>\n    in the county\n   </em>\n   where the defendant resides, or, if a corporation,\n   <em>\n    in the county\n   </em>\n   of its principal place of business, or\n   <em>\n    in the county\n   </em>\n   where a substantial alleged\n   <em>\n    act\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    omission\n   </em>\n   occurred or where a substantial\n   <em>\n    event\n   </em>\n   that caused the injury occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (ii) Civil actions alleging a defective product may also be commenced\n   <em>\n    in the county\n   </em>\n   where the plaintiff obtained the product.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (b) If venue in a civil action against a nonresident defendant cannot be asserted under paragraph (a) of this subsection (1), a civil action against a nonresident may be commenced\n   <em>\n    in the county\n   </em>\n   where the plaintiff resides or is domiciled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-11-1\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-11-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The language illustrates that subsection one similarly contains words in the singular form when referring to \"the county\" in which suit may be filed and the \"act or omission\" or \"event\" that occurred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-11-1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, as stated above, for each category, plaintiffs falling under subsection one may choose from more than one county for proper venue.\n   <em>\n    Sumlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8454823\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/942/766/#p769\">\n    942 So.2d at 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Of right, the plaintiff selects among the permissible venues, and his choice must be sustained unless in the end there is no factual basis for the claim of venue.\"). Therefore, the Court holds there is no manifest contrary intention to keep the language singular in Section 11-11-3(3), and under case-specific facts, subsection three may take the plural form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 22. It is foreseeable that the Court could be faced with a scenario in which the same doctor committed malpractice on the same defendant in more than one county. Under the instant reading of the statute, all the counties would satisfy the single category defined in Section 11-11-3(3). However, if the Court were to adopt the Leake County Appellants' and the dissent's reading of the statute, the plaintiff would have to file a suit against the same doctor in each and every county where the doctor committed malpractice. This simply does not comport with any plain or logical reading of the language of Section 11-11-3(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 23. Thus, considering that our role is to determine what a statute does provide, Section 11-11-3(3) plainly and unambiguously provides that where both defendants are private medical defendants and where an act or omission occurred in both counties forming an indivisible injury, both counties satisfy the single category defined within Section 11-11-3(3). The issue now becomes whether\n   Section 11-11-3(3) prevents joinder of the two medical defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Whether Mississippi Code Section 11-11-3(3) prevents joinder.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 24. The Leake County Appellants argue that joinder under Rule 20 does not cure improper venue because if joinder was allowed, a Leake County Appellant-who committed all its alleged acts or omissions in Leake County-would be brought into court in Hinds County. Dr. Moody and Madden Medical specifically point to\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8351899\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/965/652/\">\n    965 So.2d at 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to argue that cases involving \"a medical malpractice defendant and another defendant\" are \"only appropriate in the county where the alleged malpractice occurred.\" Further, they argue that difficulty in splitting up fault and damages is not a reason to allow joinder and disregard venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 25. On the other hand, the Harkinses argue that, because both defendants are medical providers, there is no mandated legislative priority of venue; both defendants fall equally under Section 11-11-3(3), and the joinder provisions of Rule 20 and Rule 82 should be similarly read to fix venue in either county that satisfies the priority-venue requirements of Section 11-11-3(3). Further, the Harkinses state that if the case is severed, complete relief cannot be accorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 26. Section 11-11-3(1) has not been construed to prevent permissive joinder under Rule 20 of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure or application of Rule 82(c) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure. It is an issue of first impression\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the Court whether Section 11-11-3(3) allows permissive joinder under Rule 20 of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure and application of Rule 82(c) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure where both defendants are medical providers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 27. Rule 20(a) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure allows permissive joinder. It states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   All persons may be joined in one action as defendants if there is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative, any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences, and if any question of law or fact common to all defendants will arise in the action. A plaintiff or defendant need not be interested in obtaining or defending against all the relief demanded. Judgment may be given for one or more of the plaintiffs according to their respective rights to relief, and against one or more defendants according to their respective liabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Miss. R. Civ. P. 20(a). Rule 82(c) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure states: \"Where several claims or parties have been properly joined, the suit may be brought in any county in which any one of the claims could properly have been brought.\" Miss. R. Civ. P. 82(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 28. As explained above, the existence of one\n   <em>\n    category\n   </em>\n   for venue is different from the existence of one\n   <em>\n    county\n   </em>\n   for venue, and two counties may satisfy the only category for determining venue. Therefore, where two medical defendants fall within the same category, the Court holds that Section 11-11-3(3) does not contain any language preventing permissive joinder under Rule 20. Further, the plain language does not prevent the application of Rule 82(c). Turning to the instant case, the Leake County Appellants and Baptist Medical Center in Hinds County satisfy\n   the only category for venue, albeit in different counties. Therefore, they have been joined properly, and due to the proper joinder of the Leake County Appellants and Baptist Medical Center, the claim can be brought in either of the two counties, under Rule 82(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 29. It is worth noting that, unlike here, in the Mississippi Tort Claims Act, the Legislature specifically noted that joinder of nongovernmental entities should not change the venue of a party falling under the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-13\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-46-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (Rev. 2012). Section 11-46-13 states in pertinent part, \"The venue specified in this subsection shall control in all actions filed against governmental entities,\n   <em>\n    notwithstanding that other defendants which are not governmental entities may be joined in the suit\n   </em>\n   , and notwithstanding the provisions of any other venue statute that otherwise would apply.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, despite joinder, if the Legislature wanted to limit the defendants in the instant suit to the county in which each respective alleged act or omission took place, the Legislature could have done so as it did in Section 11-46-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 30. In summation, the Court reads Section 11-11-3(3) in harmony with Rules 20 and 82(c)of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure. Due to the permissive joinder of the Leake County Appellants and Baptist Medical Center, the claim can be brought in either of the two counties. Further, because the Court holds that the plain language allows permissive joinder, the Court will not address the additional arguments put forth by the parties regarding compulsory joinder, including claim and issue preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 31. The Court affirms the judgment of the trial court and holds Section 11-11-3(3) to be plain and unambiguous. Under the instant facts, the Harkinses are allowed to choose between the two counties, as both counties satisfy the categorical requirement contained in Section 11-11-3(3) and both defendants are properly joined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 32.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED AND REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   WALLER, C.J., RANDOLPH AND KITCHENS, P.JJ., KING, BEAM AND ISHEE, JJ., CONCUR.

The Legislature sets venue for civil actions in Mississippi. Whether the Supreme Court sees wisdom or folly in the statute passed by the Legislature, we are constrained by the Constitution to follow it unless it is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. In Mississippi Code Section 11-11-3(3), the law of Mississippi requires venue in medical malpractice actions against a given caregiver to be set in the county in which the negligence alleged against the caregiver occurred. Because the majority's holding today departs from the law as set by the Legislature, I, with respect, dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 34.

The statute governing the venue issue in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, any action against a licensed physician, osteopath, dentist, nurse, nurse-practitioner, physician assistant, psychologist, pharmacist, podiatrist, optometrist, chiropractor, institution for the aged or infirm, hospital or licensed pharmacy, including any legal entity which may be liable for their acts or\n   omissions, for malpractice, negligence, error, omission, mistake, breach of standard of care or the unauthorized rendering of professional services shall be brought only in the county in which the alleged act or omission occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-11-3\">\n    Miss.

To determine the plain meaning, \"we must look at the words of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams v. Baptist Mem'l Hosp.-DeSoto, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8351899\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/965/652/\">\n    965 So.2d 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 656 (\u00b6 21) (Miss. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 35. The effect of the above-quoted statute is straightforward and clear. An action sounding in medical negligence against a given caregiver may be brought\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   in the county in which the alleged negligent act or omission occurred. When the Hinds County Circuit Court denied the Leake County defendants' motion to transfer venue of the claims against them, it allowed the claim for negligent acts alleged to have occurred in Leake County to proceed in a county\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   than the one where the alleged acts or omissions took place,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Hinds County. The court's denial of the motion contradicted Section 11-11-3(3)'s clear directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 36. It is a \"fundamental rule of our sovereignty\" that \"the legislature has the power to enact any law it sees fit, be it sincere or hypocritical, moral or immoral, wise or foolish, beneficial or harmful, provided it does not violate the prohibitions of the State or Federal Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Wood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9849413\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/187/820/#p827\">\n    187 So.2d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 827 (Miss. 1966). I share many of the concerns raised by the plaintiffs that arise from a statute that requires plaintiffs to split their causes of action, which if they sounded in another area of law would be tried together, between two different venues. However, those policy concerns and the ill effects, if any, of poor policy decisions that fall within the legislative prerogative cannot be our concern when the effect of the statute in question is clear and no questions regarding its constitutionality are raised. In effect, if the Legislature has spoken, the nine lawyers sitting on the Mississippi Supreme Court, pursuant to our constitutional separation of powers, must listen absent a concern over the constitutional validity of a statute. \"The function of the Court is not to decide what a statute should provide, but to determine what it does provide.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawson v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7037847\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/75/1024/#p1027\">\n    75 So.3d 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1027 (\u00b6 7) (Miss. 2011). Again, no party to the instant case has challenged the constitutionality of Section 11-11-3(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 37. The majority reaches its holding,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the venue statute allows plaintiffs to bring suit in Hinds County against the defendants whose alleged negligence occurred in Leake County, in part by interpreting it in light of Section 11-11-3(1). (Maj. Op. at \u00b6\u00b6 15-19). However, the Legislature explicitly included in Subsection 3 that it applies \"[n]otwithstanding\" subsection 1. The majority also relies on Mississippi Code Section 1-3-33 for the proposition that the Legislature itself has authorized courts to construe singular nouns as plural and plural as singular \"as long as there is no contrary intention.\" (Maj. Op. at \u00b6 20). As applied to Section 11-11-3(3), the Legislature made its contrary intent crystal clear when it added the word \"only.\" An action against a physician \"shall be brought\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   in the county in which the alleged act or omission occurred.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-11-3\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-11-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) (Rev. 2004) (emphasis added). In my opinion, the word \"only\" manifests the intention that the word \"county\" hold its singular form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 38. For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse and remand with instructions for the trial court to sever the claims against\n   the Leake County defendants and transfer them to Leake County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   MAXWELL, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
