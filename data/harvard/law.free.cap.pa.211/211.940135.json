Kirk, 68 Pa. 200; Chambers v. Union Nat. Bank, 78 Pa. 205; Iron City Nat. Bank v. Fort Pitt Nat. Bank, 159 Pa. 46; Onondaga County Savings Bank v. U. S., 64 Fed. Repr. 703; Turnbull v. Bowyer, 40 N.

That is, that the physical person who stood before the drawer bank and with whom it meant to deal is the person to whom it intended the check to be delivered and to whom payment by the appellee bank should be made thereon: Emporia Nat. Bank v. Shotwell, 35 Kan. 360 (11 Pac. Repr. 141); Robertson v. Coleman, 141 Mass. 231 (4 N. E. Repr. 619); U. S. v. Nat. Exchange Bank, 45 Fed. Repr. 163; Meyer v. Indiana Nat. Bank, 61 N. E.

Bank of the Metropolis, 7 Daly (N. Y.), 137.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-7\">The drawer, appellant company, by delivering the check into the hands of a person thereby held out such person as the person named therein as payee and is consequently estopped as against a bank which acts upon such representation to deny that the drawer intended to make such person, impostor though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>he be, the payee of such check: Forbes v. Espy, 21 Ohio St. 474.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-5\">It may be argued as a sound proposition that the real payee named in the check haying known nothing of the transaction and having given no consideration for the check is in the law a fictitious payee, and consequently the check, in so far as the bank is concerned, is to be considered as a check drawn to bearer: Phillips v. Mercantile Nat. Bank, 140 N. Y. 556 (35 N. E. Repr. 982) ; Bank of England v. Vagliano Bros., L. R. (1891) App; Cases, 107.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-6\">The appellee\u2019s position in this cas\u00e9 is that the appellant company is liable, not because it negligently trusted a stranger: who proved to be an impostor, but rather because the physical and visible person who stood before the drawer bank, with whom. it dealt and to whom it delivered its check, is the person to. whom it intended the appellee bank should pay: Smith v. Mechanics, etc., Bank, 6 La. Ann. 610 ; Levy v. Bank of America, 24 La. Ann. 220 ; Iron City Nat. Bank v. Fort Pitt Nat. Bank, 159 Pa. 46.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-7\">As between two innocent parties the.loss must rest upon him who by his carelessness or negligence first gave credence to the artifice and thus makes possible the perpetration of the fraud: States v. First Nat. Bank, 203 Pa. 69; First Nat. Bank v. American Exchange Nat. Bank, 49 App. Div. 349 (63 N. Y. Supp. 58).</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Am4\">March, 20, 1905:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Avk\">Mb. Justice Bbown,</author>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">This judgment cannot be disturbed unless we overrule Land Title and Trust Co. v. Northwestern Nat. Bank, 196 Pa. 230. When the opinion in that- case was delivered by our Brother Fell it expressed the view of the majority of the court, as then constituted, after a most careful consideration- of the question involved; and it is approved by a majority of the court as now composed, who have also duly considered the question on what is really a reargument of it on this appeal. We do not feel called upon to say more of the opinion of Justice Fell, which, in a manner satisfactory to us, clearly expresses our views. In the note to the report of the case in 50 L. It. A. 75, there will be found numerous cases sustaining and vindicating it, the justified comment of the annotator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>being, \u201c It is apparent from the foregoing cases that the drawer of a check, draft or bill of exchange, who delivers it to an impostor, supposing him to be the person whose name he has assumed, must, as against the drawee or a bona fide holder, bear the loss where the impostor obtains payment of, or negotiates, the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">' The only fact not developed on the first trial, which was proved on the second, was that the check was taken to the banking department of the institution by the person to whom it had been delivered and payment demanded. The paying teller refused to pay it unless the person presenting it was identified, whereupon the latter said he would deposit it in his own bank. This was the person to whom the settlement clerk of the appellant had handed the check, intending to designate him as the payee, and the appellee, which had no knowledge of the teller\u2019s refusal to pay unless the holder of the check was identified, is not to be affected by such refusal, any more than if the check had been presented at another bank and payment had been refused for the same reason; for the banking department of the trust company must be regarded as separate and distinct from that which issued the check. It was what the appellant did at the time it handed the check to the impersonator of Bissey that stands in the way of its recovery from the appellee, which paid the check to the indorsee of the person to whom the appellant had issued it as its payee. It is not seriously argued that the refusal of the paying teller to pay without identification materially changes the situation,</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The 'judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b246-6\">Dean and Potter, J. J., dissenting.</judges>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">We dissent from the judgment of the majority of the court in this case on the grounds set out in the dissenting opinion filed when the case was first before us.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
