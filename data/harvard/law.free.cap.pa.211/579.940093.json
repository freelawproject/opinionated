S. Diehl, Esq., called as a witness by the defendant. It is claimed that Mr. Diehl was the attorney for the plaintiff at the time he had the conversation with him which he was allowed to testify to, and that, therefore, it was a privileged communication, and as such inadmissible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>A careful examination of Mr. Diehl\u2019s testimony fails to convince us that it was a privileged communication between attorney and client which Mr Diehl testified to. True, Mr. Diehl was the attorney for Mr. Brown at the time, in a limited and technical sense, but under all of the circumstances it seems clear that he was acting in his capacity as attorney for the defendant and that the plaintiff knew it when they had the talk about the settlement of the case. Or, if not acting exclusively for the defendant, then it is certainly clear that he acted in behalf of both, in making settlement with the common adversary, Mr. Stanton. The general rule is that when two or more persons employ the same attorney in the same business, communications made by them in relation to such business, while privileged as to their common adversary, are not privileged inter sese: Probst\u2019s Appeal, 163 Pa., 423; Jackson v. French, 3 Wendell, 337 ; 23 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (2ed.), 65 and notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-4\">It might be further said in regard to the matter that the offer did not disclose that a privileged communication was sought to be introduced in evidence, nor did the preliminary examination of the witness disclose any such proposition. So the objection to the offer was properly overruled, and if the testimony of the witness subsequently disclosed that it was incompetent it was the duty of counsel to move to strike it out, and not for the trial judge to order it stricken out on his own motion : Aitkin v. Young, 12 Pa. 15.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-5\">We think the case was on the whole fairly presented to the jury on its merits, and can see no good reason for disturbing the verdict. The rule for a new trial is, therefore, discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>among others was in admitting the evidence of W.
