Upon lot No 6 in block 3 he erected a hotel and it is known in this proceeding as the hotel property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-5\">Patrick McMahon in his last will and testament gave and bequeathed absolutely to his son, Michael McMahon, the house and lot which was occupied and used for hotel purposes. All the balance and residue of his property, real, personal and mixed, he gave, devised and bequeathed to his wife, Mary McMahon, she to have entire control of it as long as she lived and at her death he directed it to be divided as follows : \u201c To my oldest daughter Bridget, wife of Joseph Swartzfisher, or her survivors, I will and bequeath fifty <em>dollars; </em>to my daughters Maria, Susan and Nancy McMahon, I will and bequeath <em>tq </em>each four hundred dollars,\u201d and the balance, after the above amounts were paid to his daughters, he willed and bequeathed to his son, Michael McMahon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\">Michael McMahon died intestate in 1891, and Mary McMahon, the widow, died in 1901, having previously made a will dated November, 5, 1898, which was duly probated on January 13, 1902. By her last will and testament Mary McMahon made the following devise and bequest to her daughter Susan : \u201c I give, devise and bequeath to my daughter Susan, all that lot or parcel of land situated in the borough of Renovo, in said county, bounded and described as follows, viz.: Northwardly by Erie avenue; eastwardly by lot No. 4; southwardly by St. Clair avenue. Having a front on Erie avenue of twenty-five feet, and extending in depth one hundred and thirty feet. And known and \u2018 designated \u2019 on the general \u2018 plan \u2019 of said borough as lot No. 4 in block 6. To be her property absolutely and \u2018forever.\u2019 Provided, however, and I do hereby direct that the said Susan shall furnish a home and maintenance to and for her sister \u2018 Misia \u2019 so long as she be willing to live with her, and in case they shall not agree, or my said daughter Maria shall live elsewhere \u2018 then \u2019 with her sister Susan, that she, the \u2018 said \u2019 Susan, shall pay for and toward the maintenance of my'daughter Maria not exceeding ten dollars per moirth. This provision to continue so long as my said daughter Maria shall live.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>2. It is entirely clear that Mary McMahon, by her last will and testament, did not devise to her daughter, Susan McMahon, any real estate to which she had title. The property devised to her by the last will and testament of her husband, Patrick McMahon, was lot 4 in block 6, on which was erected a dwelling house, but in this she had only a life estate and she had no authority to make a devise, of this property so as to vest any title in Susan McMahon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-5\">8. Even if Mary McMahon did own the hotel property, she died intestate as to that, as it is not mentioned or referred to in her will, and having died so intestate, the property would vest in Bridget Swartzfisher, Susan McMahon and Nancy McMahon in equal shares and proportions. Susan McMahon, therefore, did not have such an adverse interest in the real estate proposed to be divided as would prevent the court from acquiring jurisdiction and awarding an inquest of partition. An action of ejectment is, therefore, unnecessary to determine the title of Susan McMahon in the hotel property, and there is no reason why partition should not be proceeded with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-6\">That the orphans\u2019 court is right in this proceeding to hear evidence upon the claim asserted by Susan McMahon, and, if it is shown to be insufficient, to decline submitting it to a jury in an action of ejectment, is fully sustained by the decisions in the case of the Appeal of Welch, 126 Pa. 297, in which- it was held that \u201c the denial of the tenancy in common by an heir of the decedent on the return of the writ of partition, with an assertion of title in himself by adverse possession, will not be sufficient to require a suspension of the proceedings, but the court may hear evidence upon the claim asserted and if it be insufficient to justify submission to a jury, may confirm the inquest and proceed with the partition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-7\">The other exceptions to the proceedings in partition were not pressed on the argument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-8\">All the exceptions to the confirmation of the proceedings in partition are dismissed and the inquest of partition confirmed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-9\"><em>C.
