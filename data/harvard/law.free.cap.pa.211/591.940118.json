Before Little, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-8\">The court found among other facts the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-9\">The railroad, in passing through Danville, crosses Mill street at grade. This street is the principal business street of the borough and a large number of vehicles and pedestrians pass hourly where the railroad crosses the street. Over and across this street eight regular passenger trains and six regular freight trains pass daily, beside extra trains. The street is about thirty-six feet in width between the curb lines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-10\">Mill street, both north and south of the crossing, is closely built up on both sides of the street, so that those approaching from either north or south are unable to obtain a full view of the track east and west of Mill street until they have reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the track. A watchman is kept at this point, who lowers the gates at the crossing upon the approach of trains. A person standing in the middle of the crossing can see trains at a distance of 588 feet looking eastwardly, and at a distance of 680 feet looking westwardly. A short distance east of the crossing at Mill street is a switch operated by said railroad company, frequently used, which requires a large amount of shifting across the street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-4\">The court found from conflicting testimony that an overhead crossing was not practicable at the point in question, and dissolved the preliminary injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-5\">A decree was entered giving the street railway company permission to construct a grade crossing and prescribing certain precautions to be taken in the use of the crossing by the defendant company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b624-7\"><em>H.
