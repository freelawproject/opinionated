After the widow\u2019s death if A survived, a different disposition of the income was directed, and after the death of the wife and A, the principal was given one half to a daughter M and one fourth to each of two sons. The residue of the estate was also given to the two sons. The daughter A died before the widow.

He gives to them and the survivor of them his homestead in Germantown and his household furniture, etc., with the adjacent properties, for life and the life of the survivor, and directs the payment to each of them, \u201c out of the first moneys \u201d received by the executors, of $2,500, for the <em>\u201c </em>maintenance of herself and to defray the expenses of maintaining our homestead .... while my estate is in the course of administration and settlement,\u201d with the provision that if the wife should die in the meantime the whole should be paid to the daughter, if living. The wife and unmarried daughter lived together, and they are treated in the will, while the wife lives, as a single party or joint class. Thus, it is directed that until his interest in the real estate, 1012-14 Chestnut street, is sold, the rents, issues and profits shall be collected by the trustee, who shall \u201c pay over two third parts of the same to my said wife and daughter in equal parts, during their lives, and one half part to the survivor of them during her life ; and to pay over the other third part, during the lives of my wife and daughter Annie, to my daughter Mary W. Leaman, and upon the decease of either of my wife or daughter Annie, then to pay over to the said Mary W. Leaman one equal half part of said rents .... and after the decease of the survivor .... to pay over such rents \u201d to the two sons and Mary, the married daughter, in equal shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-5\">Doubtless from an apprehension that at the current rate of interest on legal securities the income of the proceeds of sale of his Chestnut street property would be considerably less than the rents prior to the sale, and that the whole of it would not be more than sufficient to enable his wife to continue in the homestead, he excluded the married daughter, so long as his wife lived, from any participation in its distribution, the provision of the will in that event being as follows : \u201c If the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>trustees shall sell my share and interest of and in the said store property in the lifetime of my wife and daughter Annie or in the lifetime of either of them, he shall receive and hold the proceeds of the sale in trust to invest the same in good izztez-est bearing securities, first mortgages of real estate to be preferred whezi obtaiziable, and keep the same izxvested during the lives of my wife and daughter Annie and during the life of the survivor of them and to pay over the income derived therefrom in quarterly paymezrts during the life of my wife to her and my daughter Annie equally; but after the decease of my wife then to pay over one equal half part of said income to zny daughter Mary W. Leaman duz'ing the life of my daughter Annie and the other half part thereof to my daughter Azzzrie during her life. And upon the decease of my said wife and daughter Annie and of the survivor of them if ... . zny share of azid interest in the said store property has been sold or when it shall be sold, thez*z the trustee shall distribute and pay over the proceeds of sale and all investments thereof, ozie equal half part to my daughter Mary W. Leaman, azzd to my sozi Irving . . . . and to the said William .... to each ozze equal fourth part \u201d\u2014the issue of any of them then dead to take the parents\u2019 share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-5\">That this exclusion of the znarried daughter and of the sons so long as his wife lived, if she should survive Annie, was not unintentional or because he failed to consider the possibility of Annie\u2019s death in her lifetizne, is znade clear by the fact that a provision precisely similar izr this respect is made in a subsequent part of the will with reference to the proceeds of sale of lands in Germazitown, the incozne of which is to be paid to the wife and Annie \u201c in equal parts \u201d during the life of the wife, and after her death, \u201c if she leave my daughter Annie her surviving \u201d (spoken of hypothetically), two thirds to Annie and one third to Mary, but with no distribution of income or principal to Mary or the sons \u201c during the life \u201d of the wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-6\">The married daughter died in the lifetime of the testator, leaving a child to whozn her share passed. The testator\u2019s interest in the Chestnut street property has been sold azzd the proceeds duly invested, but Annie, the uzzmarried daughter, had previously died, still unmarried, leaving a will which gives her estate to the wife, her mother, who is still living, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>question is presented as to the rights of the latter in the income of these proceeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\">Even if she be entitled to but one half of such income, it is clear that the trust must be continued as to the entire principal, the gift of half the income of a fund being regarded as more desirable than the income of half of the principal (Wilen\u2019s Appeal, 105 Pa. 121; Aubert\u2019s Appeal, 119 Pa. 48; Comly\u2019s Estate, 136 Pa. 153); but we are of opinion, from a careful consideration of the whole will, -that the testator intended his wife to have the entire income of the proceeds of sale of this property for life, if she survived the unmarried daughter, of whose share she would, practically, have the benefit so long as the daughter lived. This is fairly to be implied from his deliberate postponement of distribution until her death (see Jones v. Cable, 114 Pa. 586), and the failure to direct any other than the original distribution of income so long as she lived, especially when coupled with the principle which resolves doubts in favor of a widow accepting the provisions of a will in lieu of her rights under the intestate laws. The Act of March 31, 1812, 5 Sm. L. 395 (Purd. 1089), merely takes away survivorship as an incident of joint tenancy. It makes no change where the estate is created by will (Kerr v. Verner, 66 Pa. 326), or where it is expressly provided for by deed (Redemptorist Fathers v. Lawler, 205 Pa. 24) ; and whether or not survivorship was intended depends not upon the precise language of the instrument or the form of expression, but upon the meaning to be gathered from the will or deed in its entirety : Lentz v. Lentz, 2 Phil a. 117 ; Kerr v. Verner, 66 Pa. 326 ; Jones v. Cable, 114 Pa. 586. The question, however, is one which only concerns the right of the wife as against the estate of Annie; for if she does not become entitled to the whole income at Annie\u2019s death, it is because Annie had an estate pur autre vie, viz.: during the wife\u2019s life, under the direction that the income shall be paid \u201c during the life of my wife to her and my daughter Annie equally,\u201d and this estate the wife now has under Annie\u2019s will. If the sale is in \u201c the lifetime of either of them,\u201d the income is thus given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\">The only other question is as to commissions on the income of the Chesnut street property prior to its sale. The testator was only one of three owners, and after his death it was rented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>for a sum which, with taxes, etc., which the tenants were required to pay, amounted to $20,000 per annum. The arrangement was obviously for the protection of the .lessors as between themselves ; and the obligation of the tenants, who in this respect simply bound themselves to act as agents for the lessors in paying part of what was, practically, their rent, in discharge of the joint liability of the lessors, was quite as great as their liability to pay the balance, enforceable by action on the lease, at least, if not by distress. It was quite as beneficial to the estate of the testator as if the whole of its share of the $20,000. had been required to be paid in cash and one third of the taxes afterwards paid from it. Under these circumstances it is not easy to see why the accountants who secured the benefit of this lease for the estate' of which they had the- care should not receive the usual compensation of five per cent upon the gross amount required to be paid by the tenants; and as this was expressly conceded by the owners of two-thirds of the income, we think the objection on behalf of the minor owning the other third should have been overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-4\">The exceptions are sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-5\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in sustaining exceptions to adjudication.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-6\"><em>William E. </em>Shoemaker, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADf\">In a will <em>\u201c </em>any words which showed an intention, that the estate should be divided\u00bf as \u2018 equally to be divided,\u2019 or \u2018 share and share alike,\u2019 or \u2018 equally,\u2019 a tenancy in common has always been inferred: \u201d Mitchell on Real Estate, 246; Tripp\u2019s Estate, 202 .Pa. 260. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-7\">While survivorship may be created by deed or will it is clear from all the authorities that an intent to do so will not be inferred in the absence of any words indicating that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-8\">The devise to Mary of the principal gave her a vested interest : Manderson v. Lukens, 23 Pa. 31; Carstensen\u2019s Est., 196 Pa. 325; Safe Deposit, etc., Co. v. Wood, 201 Pa. 420; King v.

To give them compensation for services, care and responsibility as to a sum of money they never even saw is certainly unjust to the cestui que trust.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-5\"><em>Preston </em>AT. <em>JErdmom, </em>for Mahala McCallum, appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_E\">The right by survivorship will be implied, even where not directly conferred, if it appears to be the testator\u2019s intention.
