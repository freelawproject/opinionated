On the 17th of January, 1838, the complainants gave written notice to the defendant of their intention to apply for an injunction on the 31st of January; hut tho hill was filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>and the injunction issued on the 25th of that month, previous tc the time specified in the notice. The material facts contained in the bill, were, that the complainants were the owners of a lot in the town of Belvidere, \"Warren county, adjoining a lot of the defendant. The lots (marked in the town plot as lots No. 9 and No. 10) were each fifty-two feet in front on Water-street, and above one hundred feet deep. In the year 1797, one Benjamin Sexton became seized of both lots; and about the year 1801 or 1802, he erected a dwelling-house upon one of the lots, marked No. 10, where he continued to reside until the day of his death, which occured in 1806. This house (now the property of the complainant) was built immediately on the line of the defendant\u2019s lot, marked No. 9, and had six windows, besides two cellar windows, which opened upon and received light and ah\u2019 from lot No. 9, and which had remained open and unobstructed from the erection of the house until the'filing of the bill, a period of more than thirty years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-5\">Benjamin Sexton having died intestate, both the lots descended to his children, who remained seized as tenants in common, until the 28th day of April, 1828, when two of the heirs joined in a conveyance of lot No. 9 to Thomas P. Sexton, who was also an heir. Upon this lot, at the time of the deed to Thomas P. Sexton, there stood a cabinet-maker\u2019s shop, forty feet back from the street, and the front of it eighteen feet from the nearest corner of the complainants\u2019 dwelling-house; which shop was afterwards converted by Sexton into a dwelling-house. Thomas P. Sexton remained the owner of lot No. 9, until the 20 th day of January, 1831, when he sold and conveyed it to one Barnet Matthews ; who, by deed dated the 31st day of March, 1835, conveyed it to ' Hugh H. Abernethy, by whom it was conveyed to the defendant on the 26th day of March, 1836.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-6\">On the 11th day of March, 1829, lot No. 10 was conveyed by all the heirs of the said Benjamin Sexton, to Johm Smith; by whom it was conveyed to the complainants, by deed dated the 1st day of May, 1831.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-7\">The bill further charges, that Pittenger, the defendant, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>purchased lot No. 9 with a full knowledge of its situation, had lately commenced digging, and was then engaged in laying the foundation of a building immediately adjoining the lot No. 10; and that he purposed erecting a building immediately adjoining, or so close to the complainants\u2019 dwelling-house, as to impede and stop the ancient lights of at least three windows in the dwelling-house, and one cellar window under the same, and that the defendant threatened to obstruct the others also.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-5\">The defendant, without answering the bill, gave notice of a motion to dissolve the injunction, accompanied by a copy of the defendant\u2019s affidavit, intended to be used on the hearing. The affidavit did not materially vary the caso made by the bill, and disclosed no new fact, except that he was about to erect his building about three feet from the complainants\u2019 dwelling, and not immediately adjoining it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-6\">The case was submitted to the chancellor on the motion to dissolve the injunction, upon the written briefs of counsel</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-7\"><em>I.

Although twenty years\u2019 <em>adverse </em>enjoyment of lights <em>ispresumptive </em>evidence of a grant, yet there can be no such presumption from length of time, unless the lights have been enjoyed <em>adversely </em>to the rights of others; and as there can be no <em>adverse </em>enjoyment whilst the title to the house and to the contiguous ground continues vested in the same person, no <em>grant </em>in such a case can <em>be presumed. </em>2 <em>Saund. </em>Rep, 1756; 11 East, 373; 2 Swanston, 340-1; 6 <em>Eng.

The affidavit of the defendant is competent evidence. If the argument had come on upon the notice which was given, it appears from all the boots that it is the constant practice to receive affidavits on the part of the defendant on answer, to show on what the injunction was obtained; and if it would have been received then, I can perceive no-reason why it should not be received now, as no answer has been filed; and why the parties are not to be considered as standing before the court precisely in the same situation as if they were now before the court -on the application for the injunction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b74-8\"><em>H. </em>IT. <em>Green, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-9\">I.

I am now furnished with the briefs of the counsel of the respective parties, on a motion to dissolve the injunction upon the case made by the bill, and shall consider the same without prejudice, as if the propriety of the interference of the court wras now for the first time considered. I am not aware that this question has ever been decided in Kew- Jersey, and it has caused me some anxiety to determine, not so much what views have been taken by other judges and in other countries, of the q uestion, but what.should be the course of decision in this state, and particularly in a country under a rapidly increasing state of improve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ment. It would seem unreasonable, that in those places where land is cheap, and the country thinly settled, a party, after being permitted to build his house and place his windows on the side adjoining the open field of another man, and especially after so long a possession as to presume a grant for that purpose, should have them obstructed by the erection of a wall or another building, when perhaps a little accommodation, by placing the new building a few feet further off, might work no injury to any body; and yet in populous cities, where land is very valuable, and it is the constant practice to place buildings side by side, the enforcement of the same rule might work great inconvenience and injustice. The difficulty, therefore, is to lay down one rule for all cases. Nor will it do to leave all parties to their remedy at law. That would be shutting up the doors of a cotu-t of equity, when the exercise of its legitimate powers is most needed. Cases might arise where damages would be no adequate compensation for the injury sustained, and the party unable to respond in damages at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The cases in the English courts are numerous, in which damages at law have been recovered for obstructing lights, and where injunctions have been issued to prevent such obstructions. The law is there well settled, and of long standing. In 1 <em>Levinz' Rep. </em>122, the case of <em>Palmer </em>v. Fletcher, there is an early and important decision on this subject. This was a case at law. A man built a house on his own lands, and then sold the house to one man, and the land adjoining to another, who obstructed the t windows of the house by piles of timber. This house had been recently built, yet the action was sustained. The judges differed as to what would have been the result had the man sold the vacant lot first, seeing the building had been recently erected; but all agreed, that if' a stranger had owned the adjoining lands, he might obstruct the lights of a newly erected building, but not of an ancient building so that he has gained a right in the lights by prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In 1 <em>Comyn\u2019s </em>Digest, title, <em>\u201cAction on the Case for a Nui</em>sance,\u201d <em>A., </em>the cases are cited in which actions on the case for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>nuisance have been allowed. If a man erect a house or mill to the nuisance of another, every occupier afterwards is subject to an action for the nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In the case of <em>Rosewell </em>v. Pryor, 6 <em>Modern, </em>116, the question was, whether in a declaration for stopping the plaintiff\u2019s lights, it -was necessary to state the lights and the messuage as being ' <em>ancient, </em>and it was held not to be necessary. In that case, Holt, chief justice, says: \u201c If a man have a vacent piece of ground, and build thereupon, and that house has very good lights, and he lets tiffs house to another, and after he builds upon a contiguous piece of ground, or lets the ground contiguous to another, who builds thereupon to the nuisance of the lights of the first house, the lessees of the first house shall have an action upon the case against such builder, for the first house was granted to him with all the easements and the lights then belonging to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">This general principle is also stated in 3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>217, where it is declared to be essential to the maintenance of the action, that the windows be <em>ancient. </em>The English cases are uniform on this subject; and chancellor Kent, in 3 <em>Kent's Com. </em>445, declares in general terms, \u201c according to the English law, the owner of a house will be restrained by injunction, and he will be liable to an action on the case, if he makes any erections or improvements, so as to obstruct the ancient lights of an adjoining house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">In our own country, too, the same doctrines have been maintained ; and I do not perceive that chancellor Kent, in his Commentaries above referred to, denies any where that the same rules of law on this subject apply in this country, except in a note, where he declares, that this common law prescription does not reasonably or equitably apply to buildings on narrow lots in the rapidly growing cities in this country, and upon the ground, that such was not the presumed intention of the owners of such lots. From all he says, I infer that he recognized the general principles before stated as in force in this country, but exempts the case of city lots, from the necessity and reason of the thing, as necessary for their advancement and continued improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>The case of <em>Story </em>v. <em>Odin, </em>in 12 <em>Mass. </em>157, is a very clear and plain decision in our own courts. The property was situated in the town of Boston. The building was purchased of the town in 1795, and stood adjoining other lands of the town, with lights looking out directly upon this vacant land. In 1812, the town sold this vacant lot, and the purchaser built directly adjoining the plaintiff\u2019s building, and obstructed his lights. The court decided, that as the purchaser of the first building bought without reserving to the grantors any right to build on the adjoining ground so as- to interfere with lfis lights, they could not, nor could their grantees, bMld so as to interfere with this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">As to the proper cases for the interference of this court to prevent private nuisance, the true rale, as it appears to me, is laid down .in the case of <em>Van Bergen </em>v. <em>Van </em>Bergen, in 3 <em>John Ch. Rep. </em>287. The chancellor says: <em>\u201c </em>The cases in which chancery has interfered by injunction to prevent or remove a private nuisance, are those in wMch the nuisance has been erected to the prejudice or annoyance of a right which the other party had <em>long previously enjoyed. </em>It must be a strong and mischeivous case of pressing necessity, or the right must have been previously established at law, to entitle the party to call to his aid the jurisdiction of tMs court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Erom a careful examination of the cases, and the principles on which they are decided, I have come to the conclusion, that the same rules which have been established in the English courts, and in other states of the union, upon this subject, apply with the same force to us, and that there is nothing in our condition wMch can prevent their wholesome application: that, as a general rule, in a case of ancient lights, where they have existed for upwards of twenty years undisturbed, the owner of the adjoining lot has no right to obstruct those lights, and particularly so, if the adjoimng lot was owned by the man who built the house at the time, and subsequently sold by him: and that, whether this court will interfere by injunction, or. leave the party to establish his right at law, must depend on the particular circumstances of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>It remains to be considered, what is the case of the present complainants, and whether the injunction should be continued or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The property is situated in Belvidere, in the county of Warren, in this, state, and was owned in fee, and possessed (as well the lot on which the house is built, as the adjoining one on which the obstruction is about to be erected) as far back as the year 1797, by one Benjamin Sexton. The premises consisted of two lots numbered 9 and 10, and adjoined each other. Sexton owning both these lots, which were each fifty-two feet in front and rising one hundred feet deep, in the year 1801 or 1802 erected the house in question, on lot Ho. 10, for his own residence, and placed the same on the line between said lots Hos. 9 and 10, and built on the end towards lot Ho. 9, six -windows besides two in the cellar. These windows have continued, <em>tmmolestecl, </em>to receive light and air from across this lot Ho. 9, until the recent attempt of the defendant to build his wall for a new house directly against the same. Benjamin Sexton died intestate, in the year 1806 ; and his lieirs at law sold lot Ho. 10, with the aforesaid house, on the lltli of March, 1829, to one Smith, who afterwards sold the same to the complainants. The lot Ho. 9, was conveyed by two of the heirs of Benjamin Sexton to a third heir, on the 28th of April, 1828; and that heir again conveyed the same, on the 20th of January, 1831, to one Matthews; which lot has since been convoyed to, and is now the property of, the defendant. On lot Ho. 9 there was also a building, standing back from the street about forty feet, and the front about eighteen feet from the nearest corner of the dwelling-house on lot Ho. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Under these circumstances the defendant has commenced building the foundation of a house or shop, directly adjoining the house on lot Ho. 10, and so as to shut up the windows of that house. He is injoined by this court from so doing, and the question is, -whether that injunction should be dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">I am very clear the injunction ought not to be dissolved^ and that upon all the authorities cited. The case is a very/strong one. The builder of this house owned <em>both </em>lots at tlie time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>erecting the bnilding. The lights are <em>cmeient, </em>having continued unmolested for thirty-five years. Lot USTo. 10, on which the honse stands, passed out of the hands of the heirs at law of the original owner first; and there is no pressing necessity for this interference with the established rights of the complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that the injunction was rightly issued in this case, and ought not to be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Motion denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Cited <em>in Tompkins v.
