That they have not only entered upon the said tract of land devised to the children of the said John Eoss, and assigned to the said Martha Eoss for her life, (and which in the bill of complaint is particularly described,) for the purposes of exploring, surveying, levelling and laying out the route of the said railroad and of locating the same, but under pretence of considering the said Martha Eoss as the owner of said lands, on the 30th day of November, 1840, the said company applied to Joseph O. Uornblower, chief justice of the state of New-Jersey, as the complainants have since understood, for the appointment of commissioners to examine and appraise the said lands, or so much thereof as the said company may require for the construction of their road, and that upon such application the following was alleged to be a particular description of the lands thereby declared to be owned and possessed by the widow Martha Eoss, of the township of Bridgewater, in the county of Somerset, where the said lands axe situate required for the use of the said company, for the construction of their said railroad, over the lands of the said Martha Eoss, who now occupies the same, and for which the company cannot agree with the said Martha Eoss for the purchase thereof, to wit: [description by metes and bounds]. That it appears by reference to said proceedings, that the 30th day of December then next, was assigned by the chief justice for the appointment of commissioners to examine and appraise said lands so required and to assess the damages, and the said company were by the order of the said chief justice directed to give notice thereof in writing to the said Martha Eoss, and such notice was accordingly given, and such commissioners were appointed, and authorized by such appointment to examine and appraise the lands so required,as aforesaid, and to assess the damages to be paid by the company therefor, upon notice to be given to the said Martha Eoss. And the said commissioners, upon proof being made of the service of notice upon the said Martha Eoss only of the time of making such-examination, appraisement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>assessment, did, on the 24th day of February, 1841, report that the sum of thirteen hundred dollars should be paid by said company for the said lands and damages, and that a receipt of the said Martha Ross for the said sum of thirteen hundred dollars is endorsed upon the said proceedings. That no notice having been giv\u00bbu to the complainants, or either of them, of the institution and prosecution of the proceedings aforesaid,the same, with the appraisement and estimate of damages, could have been intended to apply only to the life estate of the said Martha Ross. That express notice was given by the said Martha Ross to the agents and officers of the EHzabeth-Town and Somerville railroad company, before the institution of the said proceedings, that she had only a life estate in the premises, and that the fee was in her children; that no notice was given to the complainants, or either of them, in conformity with the provisions of the said act, of the application to the chief justice for the appointment of commissioners ; and that some of the complainants, for themselves and on the behalf of the others, protested before the said commissioners, against their proceeding to malee any valuation or assessment in the premises; and that the said commissioners were informed by one of the complainants, that the said Martha Ross was not the owner in fee of the said premises. That the injury which will be sustained by the said premises by reason of the construction of the railroad, will be great, permanent and irreparable; that the house will be rendered untenantable, that all communication between the house and the other part of the premises will be intercepted by the depth of the cut and excavation, that the facihties for entering the barn and stable will be destroyed, and that the buildings will be constantly exposed to the danger of being burnt by firefrom passing locomotive engines; and that it has been generally reported and believed that the defendants are insolvent and unable to respond in damages. The bill prays that an injunction may issue to restrain the defendants from removing fences or buildings, or breaking ground, or making any excavation upon the premises for the purpose of constructing their railroad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Upon filing the bill an injunction was allowed by one of the masters of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-5\">On the 8th day of May, 1841, on the application of the defendants, an order was made requiring the complainants to show cause, on the 21st day. of May instant, why the injunction should not be dissolved, and that both parties should be at liberty to take affidavits to be used on the hearing. In pursuance of the rule, affidavits were taken by both parties, and the hearing having been postponed by consent, on the 14th of June the defendants filed their answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-6\">The answer admits that John Eoss died seized of the premises, having duly executed his will to pass real estate, and that he died about the year 1808, leaving him surviving his widow and eight children, as set forth in the complainants\u2019 bill; that the widow was in possession at and after the death of her husband, and has ever since continued in possession. States that on the 9th day of February, 1831, the council and general assembly of the state of Yew-Jersey passed an act, incorporating the Elizabeth-Town and Somerville railroad company, and that the said company have at very great expense constructed and put in ope-, ration the railroad from Elizabeth-Town to Bound-Brook, a distance of twenty miles and a half, and that in order to finish the road from Bound-Brook to Somerville, as the defendants are by their charter enjoined to do, they by their agents called on Martha Eoss, who was in possession of the premises, the road having previously been located and staked out through the same, to whom the said Martha Eoss stated that she was the sole owner of the said premises, and entitled to receive compensation for the land and damages; that John Eoss, one of the complainants, and who acts as the agent of the others, expressly stated that the premises belonged to his mother; that it was well know n to the complainants, before the application to the chief justice for the appointment of commissioners, that the l-oad would cross the premises in possession of the said Martha Eoss; that before making said application, the company endeavored to make an agreement with the said Martha Eoss for the said land and dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>ages, and for this purpose two officers of the company called upon her, and in the presence of two of her children, the complainants John and William Eoss, and with their knowledge, endeavored to agree with her for the same; and that John Eoss, one of the complainants, then represented that the land was his mother\u2019s, and manifested much anxiety that the amount to be paid to her by the company should be amicably agreed upon: that all the complainants well knew that the company were en deavoring to agree with the said Martha Eoss for the said land and damages, without informing the company, or in any way intimating to them, or to their agents, that they had any right ' in the premises. Admits that the company are engaged in the construction of the road, and that it is located, as set forth in the . bill of complaint; and that the defendants are about to enter for the purpose of constructing their road, and that they made application to Joseph C. Hornblower, chief justice, for the appointment of commissioners, as set forth in the bill of complaint. States that the said chief justice appointed James Parker, Gideon Eoss and William Stites commissioners, who met upon the premises on the 24th day of Eebruary, 1841; that one of the complainants appeared before the chief justice on behalf of the said Martha Eoss; that several of them appeared before the commissioners, and endeavored to prevail on them to allow the said Martha Eoss a larger sum for the land and damages. That the said commissioners awarded to the said Martha Eoss, as .the owner of the said land, thirteen hundred dollars for the land and all damages; and that the said sum is a large and full price for the fee simple of the land taken by the company and for all damages. That before the defendants attempted to enter on the land, they paid to the said Martha Eoss the said sum of thirteen hundred dollars, and took her receipt for the same; that the said sum was paid to the said Martha with the knowledge of several of the complainants, and without any objection on their part, or any claim of right by them in the premises. That the defendants had no knowledge of any person having any interest in the said premises except the said Martha Eoss,' and that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>led to the belief that she was the sole owner by the representations of some of the complainants, and that no notice to the contrary was at any time given by the complainants or any of them. Denies that either of the complainants protested before the commissioners against any proceeding towards a valuation, appraisement or assessment, but admits that one of the complainants objected, without stating his reasons for so doing. Denies that the commissioners were informed by either of the complainants that the premises did not belong to the said Martha Ross. Denies that the injury to the premises will be great or irreparable, and also that the defendants are insolvent, or unable to respond in damages. The answer, as well as the bill, was accompanied by numerous affidavits, verifying the facts therein stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">The cause came to hearing on the 28th of June, 1841, at a special term held at Newark, upon the rule to show cause why the injunction should not be dissolved.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-6\"><em>Scott </em>and <em>H.

For this purpose, liberty is given to them, their agents and others in their employ, at all times to enter upon any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>lands in their route, for the purpose of exploring, surveying and laying out the road; but they are forbid, in express terms, from proceeding to excavate, to lay their rails, or in any way to take permanent possession of any lands (except by consent of the owners) until they pay or make a tender of payment to such owner, all damages which such occupancy shall occasion. And in cases where the company cannot agree with landholders, a further provision is made for the appointment of commissioners, by one of the justices of the supreme court, to assess the damages. The complainants, in this bill, state themselves to be the devisees in remainder of John Ross, of a lot of land on the route of this road, of which their mother, Martha Ross, is in possession as tenant for life, under an assignment of dower. The will of their father is set out in the bill, and the provisions thereof are plain and according to the complainant\u2019s statement. It is then charged, that the defendants have actually entered upon the said lot, and are proceeding to remove the fences and to make the necessary excavations, and thus to commit an irreparable injury to their property, without first paying or tendering payment of damages, according to the provisions of their charter. Upon this case, the master to whom application was made granted an injunction, restraining the defendants from taking possession of this land until the court should otherwise order. - The case presented by this bill was a plain one for the interference of this court, nor, indeed, has any thing to the contrary been urged by the defendants on the argument, except that they feel themselves aggrieved at being thus stopped in their operations, without being notified of the application for the injunction. I agree that it is the dictate of propriety, in cases like the present, to direct notice of an application for an injunction to be given, whenever it can be done and save the complainant from the injury which he seeks to avert; but there are a great many cases continually arising, where to take this course would defeat the great end in view, that of preventing an injury. In this very case, the bill charges that the company had actually entered upon the land, and were proceeding to excavate. Had notice been given, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the injury might have been inflicted before the day for hearing arrived. \"While, therefore, it is to be carefully looked to, that the operations of a company in the construction of a great work of public convenience be not suddenly stopped without a case presented of an urgent and pressing necessity, yet I do not see how the master could, in the present instance, have secured the complainants in their rights, without making the <em>exprnte </em>order. If the doctrine so strongly urged, that notice upon every application for an injunction must be given, is to prevail, it would be better to go farther, and put an end to the whole power of the court in granting them at all. It is admitted to he a delicate power, which calls for great firmness and discretion in its exercise ; but it is at the same time, as all must agree, an indispensable power to reside somewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The defendants have answered this bill, and have further obtained an order allowing both parties to take affidavits, and the motion to dissolve the injunction has been fully heard upon the answer and affidav;ts. The case made by the defendants may he thus shortly stated. Martha Eoss, the widow, being in possession, the company supposed she alone had the right to the property, and they went on under their charter, got commission- ( rs appointed, who awarded to her thirteen hundred dollars, the entire damages to the property, and which they have paid to her and taken her reeeipt. That the commissioners have assessed the damages under the belief that Mrs. Eoss had a fee in the lands, and that the officers and directors acted under that impression, cannot he doubted, for they all so positively swear. The company, then, have gone on in good faith, and obtained, as they supposed, in legal form, the right to lay their road on the land in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">It is not contended thatthe company have aright totakeland for the road upon a settlement with the party holding the present interest. Such a construction would be opposed to the intent and object of the provision, which designs-nothing more nor less than that the land to be occupied by the line of the road shall first be paid for, and to those who have rights in the same. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Those in remainder have therefore as strong, and in many eases a much stronger claim for damages than the present occupant. The words of the act also favor this construction; for in the seventh section, upon the application to a justice of the supreme court for the appointment of commissioners, a description of the property is required to be given to such justice, with <em>\u201c </em>the name of the occupant <em>and owner or </em>ownersThe claims of all persons having rights in the land are clearly to be satisfied, as well those who have the reversionary interest as those having the present estate. ISTor is there any pretence that any proceedings have been had directly with the complainants, and for the reason that the defendants do not appear to have understood how the title to the property stood, or that any other person than the widow had a claim to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The only serious question raised by the defendants, is, that these complainants, who are the children of Martha Boss, and several of whom have acted for her in obtaining damages from the company, stood by and saw the company go on blindfold, under a conviction that their mother had the estate in fee, and that after having thus acted and concealed their title, they have forfeited all claim to the equitable interference of the court. A number of cases were cited, establishing beyond, question the doctrine, not merely that the court will refuse its aid to a party who fraudulently misrepresents his title, but if he observes a silence when duty and candor and fair dealing require him to speak out. The case in 2 <em>Atkyns, 49, </em>was of this character. There the mortgagee stood by and saw the lands agreed to be settled by the mortgagor to secure the terms of a marriage contract, and fraudulently concealed his mortgage: it was held that the land should be held against the mortgagee and his heirs; So in 2 <em>Atkyns </em>83, where a person having title to land suffered another to go on and erect buildings upon it under a mistake, without informing him of his error, and when he knew he was doing so under a mistake, it was decided that the land should be held without disturbance from this title. The doctrine is fairly stated, and the cases referred to, in 1 <em>John. Chan. </em>355. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>chancellor, in that ease, says, \u201c There is no principle better es tablished in this court, nor one founded on more solid considerations of equity and public utility, than that which declares, that if one man knowingly, though he does it passively by looking on, suffers another to purchase and expend money on land, under an erroneous opinion of title, without making known his claim, he shall not afterwards be permitted to exercise his legal right against such person. It would be an act of fraud and injustice, and his conscience is bound by this equitable estoppel.\u201d In 1 <em>Story\u2019s Equity, </em>379, the same principle is recognized, and it is said to proceed on the ground of its being a constructive fraud. There is something in this doctrine which must meet the approbation of every intelligent man, and its application to the case before us is striking. If, therefore, these complainants have stood by, concealing their title, and have seen the defendants taking steps to ascertain the damages to be paid their mother, under a mistaken idea that she was the sole owner, and have not undeceived them, even though they may never have been inquired of respecting it; they cannot, under the authority of the cases referred to, and should not, have the aid of this court now to enforce a further payment to them, or to embarrass the progress of the company. This being the true principle which must govern this case, the decision must turn entirely upon the state of the facts. Did the complainants conceal their title from the defendants, or not ?</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">On the part of the defendants, as well by the answer as by the affidavits of the officers and directors, it is manifest that the company have acted under a total misapprehension as to the true state of things respecting this land. They supposed Martha Eoss was the owner in fee, and accordingly treated with her in that right. The commissioners certainly made their award under that idea, and the complainants, or some of them, acted as the agent of their mother, and advised in all her proceedings. The affidavits of those who acted on the part of the company, are explicit that they acted throughout under this mistake, and they deny having received any information to the contrary. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the evidence stopped here, there could he no hesitation in putting an end to this injunction; hut we are to look to the affidavits presented on the other side, and I must say, if those affidavits are correct, there has been the most unaccountable blindness on the part of the managers of this company that 1 have ever witnessed. \u25a0 They must have shut their eyes fatally to their own interest, or they surely would never have gone against knowledge to their own injury. I can reconcile the affidavits on the part of the complainants, with the course of the defendants, in no other way than by supposing, if the information was ever communicated to them, it passed fi*om their memory. The affidavits on the part of the complainants, show that the situation of the title to this property was no secret; everyperson in the neighborhood knew it had belonged to John Ross, and was assigned to-Mrs. Ross as her dower right. All the witnesses concur in this. They show that John <em>W. </em>Bray, who at one time acted for the company, and in one case, as testified to, obtained an agreement for land under which they have entered, was informed, of the true condition of the title to this property, and made full inquiry into .the situation of the family. This evidence is not contradicted. They show, and by several witnesses, that at the time the commissioners were appointed by the chief justice, the subject of the title not being in Mrs. Ross was spoken of, and the witnesses say it was assigned as a reason why a settlement could not be made at that time, as only one of the heirs was present; that it was stated publicly in the room where a number of those interested in the company were, and was spoken of as a thing well understood by all. They show, that when the commissioners met, judge Stites, one of the commissioners, asked John Ross, one of the sons, if the title of the lot was in Mrs, Ross, and he answered that it was not; that Mr. Parker, one of the commissioners, then said, it was not their business to try titles, but to ascertain the amount of the damages. Judge Stites, in his deposition, admits that he did make the inquiry about the title, and was informed that it was not in Mrs, Ross, but that something was said which gave a check to further explanation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>and lie did not press tlie inquiry, supposing it might involve a question of delicacy between Mrs. Boss and her children. O. Morton, in his affidavit, says, that in the month of April he had a conversation on this subject with judge Taylor, (who is admitted to have been among those authorized to act on the part of the company,) who said he was aware that Mrs. Boss could not make a valid title to the property, the fee simple not being in her, and therefore they had taken another course and obtained possession through commissioners. John II. Yoorhies, another witness, says, that at the time the commissioners met he had a conversation with William Thompson and John J. Bryant, who were acting for the company, or one of them, and he thinks with both, and told them that the fee simple of the land was not in Mrs. Boss, that she had only a life right, and that they manifested no surprise at the information, hut seemed to be aware of it; and he thinks lie Has on other occasions mentioned the same fact to them. Another witness also states that he communicated (he same information to Mr. Kellogg, who was acting in behalf of the company; and Mrs. Boss swears, that she on more occasions than one, gave the agents of this company notice, that she did not own the fee of this land, but that it belonged to her children ; and several of the complainants have also sworn, that they never have asserted to any person that their mother had the title, or concealed the true state of facts respecting the property. This is the outline of the complainant\u2019s affidavits. Opposed to all this, the agents of the'company declare they never aid receive the information that the title wss not in Mrs. Boss, hut always acted under the belief that she had the entire right. There is a most palpable contradiction in the affidavits, and which I confess I am wholly unable to reconcile.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Without being able to harmonize this evidence, and without meaning to say which is right and which is wrong, I cannot feel myself at liberty to reject all this testimony, and to declare that the complainants have concealed the situation in which this property stands, so as to forfeit their claim to the aid of this court. There is too much' affirmative evidence to justify me in such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>course. That the complainants have not acted with that becoming .frankness which they should have done, is impressed forcibly upon my mind ; but still, if the subject was talked of at the time the commissioners were appointed, and at the time they met, was repeatedly stated by Mrs. R\u00f3ss, and more especially if there be any truth in the repeated instances named in which the information is said to have been communicated to the agents of the company, then, certainly, it is going too far to say that there has been such a concealment as to defeat the complainants on the ground of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The complainants, then, in my view of this case, are entitled to have their damages paid or tendered, before the defendants .can lawfully take possession of the land, unless it be shown that. they have been guilty of a fraud in concealing their title; the evidence not being satisfactory on that point, I do not feel myself at liberty to dissolve the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">There is one fact that should be referred to, and that is, that the complainants delayed giving a written notice of their claim until their mother had been paid, and then promptly served one. This has a bad appearance, and can only be excused on the \u2022ground that, until that took place, they were in no danger that the company would enter upon the land. This part of the case must still depend on the question already decided, whether the complainants practised a fraud by concealing their title.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Motion to dissolve the injunction denied.
