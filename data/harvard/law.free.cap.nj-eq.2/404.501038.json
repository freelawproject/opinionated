Lowmason, the other defendant, for the recovery of a promissory note given by them to the said Thomas Lowmason, and which it was insisted in the bill that the payee was not entitled in equity to recover against the complainant. The defendant Thomas Lowmason, by his answer, denied the whole equity of the bill. No answer was filed by George K. Lowmason, the other defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-8\">The cause was heard upon motion to dissolve the injunction, on bill and answer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-9\"><em>Wilson, </em>for complainant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-X\">insisted that, although one of the defendants, by his answer, denied the whole equity of the bill, the injunction could not be dissolved unless an answer w\u2019as filed by all the defendants.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-10\"><em>Vroom, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b412-11\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"A8q\">Thomas Lowmason, whose rights\u00b0alone are affected by the injunction, has fully answered, denying the equity of the complainant\u2019s bill. The other defendant is one of the makers of the note upon which the action is brought, to restrain which the injunction issued. He can have no interest in answering the bill, nor can his answer avail the complainant. The general rule is, that where there are several defendants, all must answer before the injunction will be dissolved ; but to this there are exceptions.
