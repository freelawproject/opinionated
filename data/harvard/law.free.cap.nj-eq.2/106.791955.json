The report was filed June 9th, 1838. Exceptions tc the report were filed on Monday, June 18th, nine days after filing the report.

The notice was dated on <em>Sv/ndo/y, </em>though served on Monday.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b120-10\"><em>W.

The exceptions to the master\u2019s report are filed too late; nevertheless, if I were satisfied of merit on the part of the defendants, and that the exceptions were not intended for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>delay, I would let them stand. As it is, the exceptions mus\u00ed be overruled, and the hearing come on.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">By consent, the cause was heard upon exceptions to the report, and upon final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">At this term the chancellor adopted the following Genebai Rule:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">No other causes will be heard at a special term, except such as are set down by consent of parties, unless ortherwis especially ordered by the court.
