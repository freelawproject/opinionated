The bill charges, that one William Green had recovered a judgment in the circuit court of the county of Essex, which remained a lien on the mortgaged premises, and that the said judgment had been assigned to one Daniel Price. The assignee of the judgment was made a party to the suit, but the assignor was not,. A demurrer was filed to the bill on behalf of Lemuel M. Crane and others, defendants, assigning for cause of demurrer, that William Green, the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>signor of the judgment, was not made a party. The cause was heard upon the demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-5\"><em>W. M. </em>Scudder, in support of the demurrer,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQQ\">insisted, that the assignor as well as the assignee of a judgment must be made a party, for the legal right of action remains in the assignor; the equitable interest only is transferred to the assignee. He cited <em>Mitford\u2019s Pl. by </em>Jeremy, 179 ; <em>1 Vesey, jr. </em>463 ; <em>Calvert on Parties, 240; Edwards on </em>Parties, 175.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-6\"><em>O.

I am aware that the cases cited in support of the demurrer, do indeed require the assignor to be made a party in all cases, but the whole subject will be found reviewed in <em>Story\u2019s Equity Pleading, </em>149, and the above distinction taken. Where the assignment is absolute and unconditional, there is no reason for making the assignor a party. It has been decided in this court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that a mortgagor, who has parted with the equity of redemption, is not a necessaiy party ; and I can see no stronger reason for making the assignor of a judgment a party, than the mortgagor who has parted with all his interest in the lands. The multiplication of parties should be avoided whenever they have no interest at stake in the cause; it can only tend to create expense and embarrassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The demurrer must be overruled, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-9\"> Vreeland v.
