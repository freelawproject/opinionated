The bill charges, that one \"William Green had recovered a judgment in the circuit court of the county of Essex, which remained a lien on the mortgaged premises, and that the said judgment had been assigned to one Daniel Price. The assignee of the judgment was made a party to the suit, butthe assignor was not. A demurrer was filed to the bill on behalf of Lemuel M. Crane and others, defendants, assigning for cause of demurrer, that William Green, the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>signor of the judgment, was not made a party. The cause was heard upon the demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-5\">\n<em>W. M. Scudder,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9q\">in support of the demurrer, insisted, that the assignor as well as the assignee of a judgment must be made a party, for the legal right of action remains in the assignor; the equitable interest only is transferred to the assignee. He cited <em>Mitford's Pl. by </em>Jeremy, 179; 1 <em>Vesey,jr. </em>463; <em>Calvert on Parties, </em>240; <em>Edwards on Parties, </em>175.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-6\"><em>O.

I am aware that the cases cited in support of the demurrer, do indeed require the assignor to be made a party in all cases, but the whole subject will be found reviewed in <em>Story\u2019s Equity Pleading, </em>149, and the above distinction taken. Where the assignment is absolute and unconditional, there is no reason for making the assignor a party. It has been decided in this court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that a mortgagor, who has parted with the equity of redemption, is not a necessary party ; and I can see no stronger reason for making the assignor of a judgment a party, than the mortgagor who has parted with all his interests in the lands. The multipication of parties should be avoided whenever they have no interest at stake in the canse; it can only tend to create expense and embarrassment. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The demurrer must be overruled, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Vreeland v.
