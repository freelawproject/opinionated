The bill was filed on the 9th day of November, 1839, and an injunction pursuant, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>prayer of the bill allowed and served. At the same time a subpoena was issued, -returnable to January term, 1840, which was never served. Prior to the April term, and before notice was given of the present motion, a new subpoena issued, returnable to April term, 1840, which was returned served.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-5\"><em>Wilson, </em>for defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARE\">now moved to dissolve the injunction, for the neglect of the complainant in proceeding with his suit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-6\"><em>Lanning, </em>for complainant, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhYN\">stated that on filing the bill a subpoena was issued and delivered to the complainant to be served, but that the writ was against the sheriff, and there were no coroners in .the county, so that the subpoena could not be served.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b318-7\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"A5Y\">The injunction must be dissolved, The complainant has not proceeded with his suit as he ought to have \u2022done. A subpoena in chancery need not necessarily be served by a sheriff or coroner. It may be served by any other competent person ; but in such case there must be an affidavit of the manner and time of service, and upon the return.of the writ a rule must be taken upon the defendant to plead, answer or demur at or before -the next, stated term of the court. It is certainly proper, in all ordinary cases, that the process of the court should be served by the sheriff or-other officer known to the law, but the court has repeatedly sanctioned the service of its process <em>by </em>a private person.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\"><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Injunction dissolved, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-9\"> See dase of <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Voorhies et al., </em>ante, page 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
