Visanska, one of the defendants, mortgaged to H. K. Thurber &amp; Co. a tract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>of. land in the County and State aforesaid, containing 1,050 acres, known as the Belcher plantation, as security for a debt of $2,000 which he owed them. The mortgage was subsequently duly assigned by H. K. Thurber &amp; Co. to David Lewi.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-5\">David Lewi commenced his action to foreclose the mortgage against Garrison A. Visanska on the 8th of April, 1874, and on the same day filed a notice of the pendency of the action in the office of the Clerk of the Court of Abbeville County. The summons and complaint were served on Garrison A. Visanska by the Sheriff on the 13th day of April, 1874. The complaint of David Lewi was answered by Garrison A. Visanska and several defenses were pleaded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-6\">The cause was heard before his Honor Judge Carpenter, sitting for Judge Cooke, and a judgment of foreclosure was signed and entered on the 23d day of April, 1875, ascertaining the debt secured by the mortgage to be $2,037.94, besides costs, and the mortgaged premises ordered to be sold for cash on sale day in November, 1875, and the debt paid out of the proceeds. The equity of redemption of the said Garrison A. Visanska and of all persons claiming under him was foreclosed and the mortgaged premises advertised for sale under the judgment. On the 14th day of April, 1874, the day next after the personal service of the summons and complaint on Garrison A. Visanska, he made a deed of conveyance of the Belcher plantation and a tract of land on Little River iu said County, but of no other property, to the respondent, Wolf Rosenberg, for his creditors. The tract on Little River had been mortgaged by Garrison A. Visanska to Morris Israel as security for a debt due to him. After the execution of the mortgages several judgments had been obtained against Garrison A. Visanska, some of them before and some after the conveyance. In the deed of conveyance to Wolf Rosenberg, Garrison A. Visanska claimed a home-; stead in the- Little River tract of land, if he should be entitled by law to the same, but made no claim of homestead in Belcher plantation. On the 19th day of April, 1875, Wolf Rosenberg filed in the office of the Clerk of Abbeville County his complaint against the appellants, David Lewi, Morris Israel, certain judgment creditors, Anna R. Visanska and Garrison A. Visanska, setting forth the conveyance of Garrison A. Visanska to him; that the Belcher plantation had been mortgaged by Garrison A. Visanska to H. K. Thurber &amp; Co., and by them assigned to David Lewi; that the Little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>River tract of land had been mortgaged to Morris Israel, aDd that judgments against Garrisou A. Yisanska had been obtained after the making of the mortgages by him; and further alleging that Anna R. Yisanska preferred a claim arising out of an alleged marriage contract between her and her husband, Garrison A. Visanska. The complaint of Wolf Rosenberg admits the validity and priority to the judgments of the mortgage held by David Uewi, but alleges that the amount of the debt secured by it is unknown to him; alleges that Garrison A. Visanska claims a homestead in the Little River tract, and that plaintiff is in doubt and perplexity as to the claim of Anna R. Visanska, that of Garrison A. Visanska to homestead and the alleged mortgage to Morris Israel. The complaint demands an injunction restraining the appellant from selling the land to foreclose his mortgage and judgment creditors from selling the lands until these claims last mentioned shall be decided. On the 15th day of October, 1875, the order for injunction was made. The cause came to a hearing before his Honor Judge Cooke, January Term, 1876. The complaint was answered by David Lewi, 13th November, 1875; Garrison A. Visanska failed to answer. On the hearing there was no evidence that Garrison A. Visanska had ever resided on the Belcher plantation, and he admitted that he had never done so. And in reply to a question by the Court, Visanska said he would take his homestead in the Belcher plantation, and was told by Judge Cooke that he must act upon his own judgment. It was proved that the Belcher plantation was ten miles from any residence of Garrison A. Visanska. The Belcher plantation and the tract on Little River are both mentioned in the judgment of the Circuit Court, which decides that Garrison A. Visanska is entitled to homestead, and, further, \u201cthat he is at liberty to select his homestead and have it taken from the lands above named,\u201d and directed the Sheriff to lay it off according to law in said lands. The judgment dissolved the injunction and ordered that the Belcher plantation should be sold for one-half of the purchase money in cash, and the other half on a credit until the 1st of January next, and did not exact of the purchaser any security or bond for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-5\">David Lewi appealed from so much of the judgment of the Circuit Court, entered February 4, 1876, as adjudges that the co-defendant, Garrison A. Visanska, is entitled to a homestead in the Belcher tract of land and in the tract on Little River, mentioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>in said judgment, and is at liberty to select his homestead in them and to have it laid off from them, and orders the Sheriff to lay off his homestead in said tracts of land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-5\">Also, from so much of said judgment as orders the Belcher tract of land to be sold for one-half of the purchase money in cash and the other half on a credit until the first day of January, 1867, without requiring security for the same, whereas the judgment of foreclosure entered on the 23d day of April, 1875, in the action of David Lewi against Garrison A. Visanska directed that the Belcher tract be sold for cash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-6\">Also, from so much of said judgment .as requires the Referee therein appointed to report out of what fund the counsel fee of the attorney of Wolf Rosenberg, the plaintiff, shall be paid, and will move to reverse the said judgment in these particulars.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-7\"><em>Burt, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A16\">submitted the following points and authorities :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-8\">That a homestead is the residence of a family \u2014 the place where the home is, where the family permanently reside. \u2014 Smythe on Homestead and Exemptions, \u00a7 68, and authorities cited; Article II, Section 32, Constitution of 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-9\">That occupancy, use as a homestead, actual residence, define and constitute a homestead, and are required by the homestead laws of all the States. \u2014 Smythe, \u00a7\u00a7 169, 170; <em>House </em>vs. <em>House, </em>S.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUI\">While it may be true that a Circuit Judge may on motion after notice change the terms of a mere administrative order which he has made, he cannot interfere with his pronounced judgment in a cause except as provided by the Code of Procedure. The time fixed by the two orders for the sale of the mortgaged land having passed, it is now of no practical importance to consider which of them is to be recognized as effective so far as they express the conditions on which the sale was to be made. A new order must be made which will necessarily supersede them both.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">It is not material to inquire whether Visanska had such a residence on either of the tracts of land which would have entitled him to the exemption claimed under the provisions of the Constitution and the Acts of the Legislature if both parcels had been subject to judicial sale by any proceeding other than one arising under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>mortgage. If he ever had any claim of homestead in the Belcher plantation or the Little River tract, he had divested himself of it by the mortgage, for as to such an instrument there can be no right of homestead as against the claim of the <em>mortgagee. </em>\u2014 Homestead <em>Building and Loan Association </em>vs. <em>J. A. Enslow, </em>(ante, p. \u2014.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">If, after satisfaction of the mortgages and the costs consequent upon their foreclosure, there should be a surplus when he makes the application in due form, it will be time enough to consider whether his right by way of homestead in such surplus may entitle him to receive it in bar of the claims of his other creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">So much of the order as looks to the payment of the counsel of Rosenberg, the respondent, out of the mortgaged property by requiring the Referee to be appointed to report out of what fund it should be paid must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">No reason or cause appears why the debt due on the mortgage held by Lewi, the appellant, should be subjected to the chance of not being fully paid by application of any portion of the proceeds of the sale to the fees which Rosenberg has incurred by his intervention in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The debt established by the decree of the 23d of April, 1S75, and the order then made for the foreclosure by sale must be recognized as valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">It is accordingly ordered that the sale, after due advertisement, may be fixed for any sale-day to be named by the appellant or counsel, on the following terms: One-fourth cash and the balance payable in six months, secured by bond bearing interest from date, together with personal security and mortgage of the premises.</p>\n<judges id=\"b358-10\"><em>Moses, </em>C.
