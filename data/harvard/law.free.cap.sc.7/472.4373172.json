Featherston, Emma E. Young, Helen H. Williams and Ella L. Latimer, plaintiffs, against J. C. 0. Featherston, Frances C. McDavid and Ezekiel Norris, defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-13\">The plaintiffs are the children and legatees of J. W. Featherston, deceased. The defendant J. C. 0. Featherston is a legatee and executor, and the defendant Ezekiel S. Norris is a surety on the official bond of A. 0. Norris, deceased, late Commissioner in Equity for the County of Anderson, given in December, 1861.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-14\">The object of the action was to recover from the defendant Ezekiel S. Norris a sum of money which A. 0. Norris had received as Commissioner in Equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-15\">The case was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-16\">I. A. 0. Norris, late of Anderson County, was Commissioner in Equity for said County prior to December, 1861, and then gave a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>new bond as Commissioner for four years, upon which Ezekiel S. Norris was one of the sureties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-5\">II. In 1859, the executors of J. Wesley Featherston had filed a bill in equity, under which the estate was ordered by .the Court to be sold by the Commissioner, and it was sold by A. O. Norris, January, 1860, upon a credit of one, two and three years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-6\">III. In July, 1861, the Chancellor ordered that, \u201c as fast as the proceeds of sale should come into the hands of the Commissioner he should apply the same in payment of outstanding demands against the said estate,\u201d &amp;c.; but beyond the payment of debts, no order was made as to the distribution of the proceeds of sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-7\">IV. The books of the Commissioner show that the bonds were paid as they fell due, and that in 1861, 1862 and 1863, and January, 1864, so much of the fund as was necessary to pay debts was so paid under the aforesaid order of Court. After the payment of debts, there was left in the hands of A. O. Norris the sum of $12,059.42, which there was no order to pay out, and as to which this litigation arises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-8\">V. A. 0. Norris remained Commissioner until his successor, W. W. Humphreys, went into office in 1866, when he turned over to .such successor the books and papers of his office, and among them his bank book, purporting to contain evidence that, as Commissioner, he had deposited in the Branch Bank of the State, at Columbia, (as was his duty under the A.ct of 1840,) the aggregate sum of $63,913.23, which, as alleged, included the funds of the Feathers-ton estate, $12,059.42.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-10\">VI. In his final report on estates, June, 1866, sworn to and filed, A. O. Norris also reported that the said money of the Featherston estate ($12,059.42) had been deposited as aforesaid. His successor then took charge of the office and of said bank book, and nothing has been recovered upon the said deposit, the Bank of the State and its branches having ceased to exist.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-11\">VII. A. O. Norris died in the Spring of 1873 intestate and insolvent, and in August, 1873, the Featherston legatees, under the will of J. Wesley Featherston, commenced this action on the official bond of 1861, against Ezekiel S. Norris, one of the sureties, alleging that said surety was liable for the official default of A. O-Norris, \u201cwho wholly failed to keep and deposit the said money as required by law,\u201d which is the only breach assigned in the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>VIII. His Honor Judge Cooke, against objection by defendant, heard the ease without a jury, and \u201c adjudged and ordered that the surviving executor of the will of J. Wesley Featherston have leave to enter judgment for the penalty of the bond, and to issue an execution thereon for $12,299.42 and his costs and disbursements, etc. The surviving executor, J. C. C. Featherston, was a defendant in the action and prayed no relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-5\">IX. From this decision Ezekiel S. Norris appealed, and urged in this Court the following objections :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-6\">1st. That the trial was ordered prematurely, before defendant\u2019s evidence was taken and without notice of trial or the case being docketed as required by law. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-7\">2d. That the action on the bond was for money only, and the \u25a0 defendant was entitled to a jury, which was denied him, and the Judge tried the case against his objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-8\">3d. That a nonsuit should have been granted upon the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-9\"><em>(a) </em>Because the plaintiffs failed to prove the only breach of bond assigned, offering no evidence at all upon the subject of deposit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-10\"><em>(5) </em>Because the action was brought upon an official bond without leave to sue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-11\">(e) Because the action was not brought in the name of the State, the payee, but by all the legatees united, in their own names.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-12\"><em>(d) </em>Because the action was brought without any order declaring the right of these parties to the fund or demand for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-13\">4th. That the appellant, Ezekiel S. Norris, offered affirmative proof that the fund had been deposited according to law, and that, supporting the presumption of law that \u201che had done his whole duty,\u201d the decision should have been in his favor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-14\">5th. That the excess of receipts over payments must have been in Confederate currency, and, in any event, the value of such currency should limit the recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-15\">That in any possible view it was error to adjudge the penalty of the bond in favor of one who was a defendant in the case and prayed no affirmative relief.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-16\"><em>McGowan, </em>with whom was <em>Whitner, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIX\">upon the questions whether the action should not have been brought in the name of the State, the payee of the bond, and whether the deposit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>book of the Bank of the State of South Carolina contained sufficient evidence to relieve the defendant Norris from liability, submitted the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-5\">The exceptions insist that the Circuit Judge should have granted a nonsuit, and it was error to refuse it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-6\">I.The action was for the penalty of an official bond of a deceased Commissioner in Equity, against a\u2019 surety on the bond, and the action should have been in the name of \u201c the State,\u201d the payee and custodian of the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-7\">1. Section 134 of the Code, requiring \u201cactions to be brought in the name of the real party in interest,\u201d does not include actions on official bonds. \u201cBonds taken in the name of the people should be prosecuted in the name of the people and not in the name of the party in interest.\u201d \u2014 Waite\u2019s Code, p. 126; Voorhies\u2019 Code, 97; <em>Annel </em>vs. <em>Kerr, </em>28 How., 324; <em>People </em>vs. <em>Ciarle, </em>21 Barb., 264; <em>People </em>vs. <em>Norton, </em>9 N. Y., 176.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-8\">2. This bond was given to a trustee for the benefit of many, like an administration bond, which must always be brought in the name of the Judge of Probate.\u2014 <em>Thomas Jordan </em>vs. <em>Searle, </em>2 Mass., 152; <em>Clover </em>vs. <em>Heath, </em>3 Mass., 252; 4 Mass., 74; <em>Bobbins </em>vs. <em>Heywood, </em>16 Mass., 524.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-9\">3. Before the Code that was the law of South Carolina, for the good reason that no one could sue for penalty but the payee; and when <em>one judgment </em>was given for the penalty, that stood for the benefit of all claimants under the <em>bond.- </em>\u2014 Treasurer vs. <em>Bates, </em>2 Bail., 362; <em>Treasurer </em>vs. <em>Clowney, </em>2 McM., 512; <em>State </em>vs. <em>Bird, </em>2 Rich., 100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-10\">4. The law of 1866, relied upon, does not touch the point at all. That -was simply a provision that a certified copy should be evidence of the bond. \u201c If any person be aggrieved by the default of the said District officers, and desire to sue upon the bond, it shall not be necessary for such person to obtain a certified copy of the bond from the Treasurer of the State; but such certified copy from the Clerk of the Court shall be sufficient,\u201d &amp;c. \u2014 13 Stat., 382.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-11\">5. <em>The law of </em>1840 bad substantially the same provision in regard to the copy; but in 1866 the law had been changed making one State Treasurer instead of two, and it was necessary to make a corresponding change as to <em>who </em>should give the certified copy. This is all that Section of Act of 1866 does.- \u2014 -11 Stat., 109.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-12\">6. But both those Acts are repealed, and substantially the same provision is inserted in the General Statutes in these words: \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>bond of any public officer may at all times be sued on by the public, any corporation or private person, for which purpose the officer with whom such hon(d shall be filed shall deliver a certified copy,\u201d &amp;c. \u2014 Gen. Stat., 215.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-5\">7. But it is said the objection comes too late at the trial, as, under the Code, \u201cobjection to parties must be made by demurrer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-6\">This defect is radical and cannot be waived. \u2014 -Waite\u2019s Code, 241; <em>Burnham </em>vs. <em>DeBevorse, </em>8 How., 160.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-7\">\u201cIf the wrong plaintiff sue, or, in other words, if the facts stated in the complaint show no cause of action against the defendant in <em>favor of the plaintiff, </em>the defendant may demur under the sixth head. If the objection is not raised by demurrer it may be raised upon the trial and the complaint will be dismissed as to plaintiff in whose favor no cause of action is shown.\u201d \u2014 1 Waite\u2019s Prac., 120; <em>Palmer vs. Davis, </em>28 N.

Although a party, upon payment of the fees, is entitled to a certified copy of the bond, he .cannot sue on an official bond without leave granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-9\">\u201cWhen a bond is given to the people of this State the action must be in the name of the obligee, and an assignee cannot sue on the bond in his own name unless the assignment is authorized by statute.\u201d \u2014 Waite\u2019s Code, 126; 1 Waite\u2019s .Prac., 196; <em>Coachman </em>vs. <em>Sunt, </em>2 Rich., 452; <em>Cuddeback </em>vs. <em>Kent, </em>5 Paige, 92.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-10\">III. The nonsuit should have beeen granted <em>for want of proof. </em>The only breach charged was \u201c that Norris wholly failed to keep and deposit the sum (money) as is required by law in such cases,\u201d and there was absolutely no evidence whatever of the fact charged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-11\">1. What is the law referred to ? In the Act of 1840, then of force, it is required as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-12\">\u201c The Commissioners in those Districts where no branch of the said bank (of the State) is or may be established shall likewise annually, within one month after their respective Courts, deposit in the said bank, or in some of its branches, all moneys officially in their hands as aforesaid, and which have remained in their hands unclaimed for twelve months; and all moneys shall be deposited by the said .Commissioner, not in his private name, but in his official name, and the same shall be transmissible to his successors in office in trust for the said persons or estate. And every Commissioner shall exhibit his bank book containing the entries of all deposits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>as aforesaid when required ; but it shall not be necessary to make monthly returns,\u201d &amp;c. \u2014 11 Statutes, 113..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-5\">There is no proof that Norris did not conform to the law. The plaintiff offered no proof whatever upon the subject of depositing, the only breach alleged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-6\">2. The only proof offered by the plaintiff was that Norris received the money (his office book) and then rested, claiming that, having charged Norris with the receipt of the money, it was incumbent on the defendant to discharge him, and that the plaintiff could presume that <em>he had not deposited it.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-7\">Two things must not be forgotten; <em>first, </em>that this money was received by <em>Norris officially; </em>and, <em>second, </em>that he being dead this is an action against <em>his surety. </em>If A. O. Norris was sued, proof that he received the money might make it necessary that he should discharge himself,- but not so as to <em>the surety. </em>As to him the breach must be proved as alleged. It is no breach for a Commissioner to receive money under the order of Court; it must further appear that he did not pay it out <em>or deptosit it, </em>and until the plaintiff proves that <em>he did neither </em>no breach is shown and surety is not liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-8\">\u201c The breach must be proved as it is alleged.\u201d- \u2014 2 Starkie\u2019s Evidence, 344, and authorities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-9\">3. But it is said it is not incumbent on the plaintiff to prove a negative, although he alleges it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-10\">The general rule is that the burden of proof rests on the party pleading the affirmative. \u2014 2 Waite\u2019s Pr., 117.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-11\">\u201c But there are some exceptions, one of which includes these cases, in which the plaintiff <em>grounds his right of action upon a negative allegation, </em>and where, of course, the establishment of this negative is an essential element in his case.\u201d \u2014 1 Greenleaf on Evideuce, \u00a7 78, and authorities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-12\">\u201cWhenever the law presumes in favor of the affirmative, it lies on the party who denies the fact to prove it, although it may be a negative. Eor instance, on a note the law presumes consideration ; if the defendant denies that there is any consideration, he must prove it.\u201d \u2014 2 Waite\u2019s Pr., 109; 1 Starkie Ev.; Gilbert\u2019s Ev., 148; <em>Willlidmsws.

P. 298.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-7\">\u201cIn a suit for tithes, the defendant pleaded that the plaintiff had <em>not read </em>the 39 Articles, and the Court put the defendant to prove it though a negative, for in this case the law will presume that the parson had read the articles, and when the law presumes the affirmative then the negative has to be <em>proved.\u201d </em>\u2014 Monk vs. <em>Butler.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-8\">It being necessary to prove breach as alleged, it must be proved by the best evidence which the nature of the case will admit.\u2014 3 East., 200.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-9\">5. The decision admits the presumption. It says: \u201cThis, however, is a bare presumption and only holds as to third parties.\u201d (29.) What is meant by third parties? As to the official acts of an officer, is not his surety a third party ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-10\">But it is denied that this is a true construction of the law. In the case of the Exchequer roll, Lord Plalifax himself was sued. And in the case of the 39 Articles the parson himself sued for tithes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-11\">This is most emphatically a case for the application of the rule. Norris was a public officer. It was his duty under the law to deposit. He is dead and not here to speak, and the bank in which it was his duty to deposit has ceased to exist, and its officers dead or scattered we know not where. It is not a case where the subject matter of a negative averment lies peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-12\">IY. The 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 exceptions allege error in the decision, finding as matter of fact that the money was not deposited in the Branch Bank of the State, the evidence that it was iso deposited being competent and entirely uneontradicted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>1. \u201cWhere the Judge finds a material fact <em>which is wholly </em>loith<em>out evidence to sustain it, </em>it is an error of law, and, upon due exception thereto, may be reviewed in the Court of Appeals.\u201d \u2014 Waite\u2019s Code, 517 ; <em>Webster </em>vs. <em>DeWitt, </em>36 N.

Norris dead, the Bank of the State and its branches no longer in existence and its officers scattered, under the peremptory order for trial we were not able to prove the handwriting of the Cashier. But there is no allegation of forgery, and the book had been turned over to Humphreys, the successor of Norris, and is now in his possession. (23.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-13\"><em>Fifth. </em>The perfect agreement of the account of Norris, the bank book and \u201c the report on estates.\u201d The latter says: \u201c Balance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>$12,059.42 on deposit in the Branch Bank of the State at Columbia, included in the sum of $63,913.\u201d (25.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-5\">The bank book purports to contain evidence of deposits to the precise amount of $63,913.

This was the best proof attainable under the circumstances, not conclusive, but certainly \u201c <em>prima fade.\u201d </em>Like the returns of an executor or administrator, good until disproved. No one believes that Norris forged receipts of deposit. The Cashier receipts are not in his handwriting. They are in a business hand in the usual bank book. How did he get the book ? Who wrote the receipts ? Is not this proof uncontradicted, enough to satisfy any reasonable mind that the book is genuine and that'the deposits were made as stated ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-7\">4. The argument of this decision is palpable error. It states \u201cif the bank book be competent evidence, it is impossible from these facts taken from it that these deposits were legally made on behalf of the Featherston estate.\u201d (30.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-8\">What facts? Look it them: \u201cNo money was received for the Featherston estate after January 20, 1864, whilst in 1865 the sum of $2,392.50 was paid out.\u201d (30.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-9\">What does that signify ? This could not be paid until called for and was then paid under the order of the Court to creditors. That was rightly paid and is not claimed in this suit. But further: \u201c From 30th October, 1863, to January 17, 1864, $64,813.23 were deposited.\u201d In this argumentation the decision makes a <em>mistake of one month. </em>The date of the deposit, according to the bank book, <em>is February </em>17 and not January. (23.) As it stands, it is precisely right. Received in January, 1864, $7,278.11, and deposited <em>in February, </em>1864, $12,537.43. The deposit manifestly includes the Featherston money as stated in the report. The argument built on the mistake of a month utterly fails!</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-10\">5. But it is said the deposits were not legally made because not <em>at precisely the right time. </em>That the Equity Court, by law, sat at Anderson in July of each year, and that these deposits should have been made \u201cwithin one month of the adjournment of their respective Courts.\u201d That is to say, should have been deposited in the month of <em>August, </em>1864, instead of the October and February previous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-11\">This is error for at least three reasons :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-12\"><em>First. </em>The words of the Act (1840) <em>as to time </em>are not of the essence of the matter, but are declaratory merely. Even if there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>had not'been an exact compliance to the day, the irregularity would not be fatal unless injury resulted from the variation, which is not pretended. \u2014 2 Story S.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-5\"><em>Second. </em>But Norris was strictly within the law, which only fixed a limit \u201cwithin which\u201d the money should be deposited. He was not required to deposit until he had the money \u201c unclaimed for twelve months.\u201d Within that time he might deposit without regard to the \u201c adjournment of the Court.\u201d Norris committed no offense except to <em>anticipate </em>the limit. He received in October, 1863, and January, 1864, and deposited immediately February, 1864! This is the head and front of his offending. \u2014 See receipts and deposits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-6\"><em>Third. </em>If we are to construe the Act so as to limit deposits exclusively to \u201cone month after the adjournment of the Court,\u201d there was no necessity for Norris to deposit in 1863, \u201964 or \u201965, for in these years no Court of Equity sat for Anderson, and, of course, there could be no \u201cadjournments.\u201d But Norris did right not to rely upon any such quibble of words, and, construing the Act according to its sense and purpose, deposited the money soon after it was received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-7\">What was he to do? The money was all due. He was the payee. The Court assumed that the money would be collected \u2014 impliedly at least directed it \u2014 ordered so much as was necessary to be paid to creditors. What remained was \u201cunclaimed.\u201d The Court did not meet to make orders, and, as a good officer, Norris could do no more than deposit it, which he did! It was not his fault that the bank no longer exists. Is it possible that justice can be so twisted as to make his surety pay that money? It surely cannot be.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b489-8\"><em>Murray, </em>contra:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-9\">An appeal from an order dissolving an injunction does not operate as a <em>supersedeas </em>and continue the injunction in force.\u2014 ' <em>Hoyt </em>vs. <em>Garter, </em>7 Howard, 140; <em>Stone </em>vs. <em>Garlan, </em>3 Code Rep., 103; 1 Van Santvoord\u2019s Equity Practice, 374; same, p. 663.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-10\">That ignorance of law furnishes no excuse for the breach of a contract or for an omission of duty. \u2014 Story\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence. \u00a7 111, <em>et </em>seq.; <em>Storrs </em>vs. <em>Baker, </em>6 Johns.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG-\">The main question is whether there was evidence sufficient in law\u2019 to support the judgment below. It was contended that the action is to be regarded as one of law,\u2019the proper mode of trial being that by jury, and this Court limited to reviewing errors at law. The plaintiffs cannot maintain this position, for the judgment which they seek to uphold was given in form in favor of a party made a defendant by them as representing their rights for that purpose. This fact stamps the right of the plaintiffs with the character of an equitable claim. It follows that in considering the sufficiency of the ground on which such judgment rests, this Court cannot be excluded from looking into the determinations of fact as well as law.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">We think that the Circuit Judge erred, as it regards the nature of the presumptions arising out of the character of the proofs, considered with reference to the nature of the issues, and such error prejudicially affected his conclusions of law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">It appeared that A. 0. Norris, now deceased, as Commissioner in Equity, sold real estate belonging to the Featherstone estate, under an order of the Court for partition, and received the proceeds of sale, and made disbursements thereupon from time to time. It further appears that at the end of his term of office he delivered to his successor in office a book, purporting to be a bank book of the Branch Bank of the State of South Carolina, Columbia, containing what purported to be an account with A. 0. Norris, Commissioner in Equity, Anderson District. That by such account there appeared to be on deposit in that bank a sum of money, more than sufficient to cover the balance, in the Commissioner\u2019s hands from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the Featherston estate. Both sides argue that it was the duty of the Commissioner to deposit the moneys claimed in this action in the bank in question. A bank book containing proper credits was the proper evidence of such a deposit, to be ^delivered by the outgoing Commissioner in Equity to his successor. From this state of facts it is very clear that a presumption arises in favor of the regularity, of the proceedings of the Commissioner that must be removed by plaintiffs before they can establish a breach of the official bond in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">When a public officer, who is ordinarily presumed to have done his duty, delivers to his successors in office vouchers in the customary form, expressing on their face a compliance with the requirements of his office, while it does not follow that such vouchers may not be impeached, yet it must be assumed that they show a due discharge of official duty until the contrary appears on the part of those alleging against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In applying this proposition it will be hardly necessary to say that if the book was other than what it purported to be, or the balance standing to the credit of the Commissioner at the time of the transfer to his successor was not sufficient to cover all the demands against it that would exist, on the assumption that the proceeds of the Featherston estate were included in it, such facts could hardly fail to become disclosed to his successor. It certainly could not be required of one retiring .from office to search the records and memory of his successor for evidence to avert suspicion that his official proceedings, correct in form, were false in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">After a failure to demur to the complaint or to take \u00a7uch objection by answer, an objection comes too late that a proper plaintiff is improperly omitted from the complaint, nor is that failure to object cured when a cause of action is subsequently established in which the plaintiff has an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The conclusions arrived at render it unnecessary to consider the subordinate questions discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">The judgment and conclusions of fact and law must be set aside and the cause remanded for such proceedings as may be rendered proper in order to conform to the foregoing conclusions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b493-10\"><em>Moses, </em>C.
