This case was heard by me at the York Court, April Term, 1875. The hearing was\u2019on the report of the Referee and exceptions thereto by the plaintiff.' In arriving at a decision, I do not think it necessary to consider the first two grounds, strongly maintained by the learned counsel for the plaintiff, to wit, that the defendants have taken credit for debts of the firm, which were covered by drafts on B. R. Smith &amp; Co., for which drafts they also take credit; and that no allowance has been made by the Referee for the large'sum drawn out of the assets of the firm by J. M. Ivy over and above his proportionate share. The determination of the case does not require that I should consider these grounds; and, moreover, they are not consistent with the main position taken by the plaintiff, viz., that all parties are concluded by the adjustment made January 1st, 1871, and their long acquiescence therein. If this position were not tenable, then it would be important to inquire into the alleged errors in the statement of the account between the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>It appears from the evidence that Ivy, May and Roach entered into a copartnership, in August, 1869, with the firm style of J. M. Ivy &amp; Co. That these copartners had an accounting, January 1st, 1871, of the assets and liabilities of the firm, for the purpose of forming a new partnership, into which the defendant, Allen Jones,' was to be admitted. This accounting was had by Ivy, May, Jones and the plaintiff, they taking an inventory of the stock ; by Ivy furnishing a statement of the cotton business, and by a schedule of liabilities, which appears in the handwriting of Allen Jones. The defendant, Ivy, testifies that the plaintiff \u201c had nothing to do with the books \u2014 that they were entirely under defendant\u2019s control.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">At the settlement under consideration, therefore, Ivy and Jones being the best versed in the art of book-keeping, attended to the statement of the accounts, notes and liabilities. All engaged in this accounting were pecuniarily interested therein \u2014 the members of the old firm and Allen Jones \u2014 the latter because he was about to become a member of the new firm, composed of members of the old firm and himself. During the year 1871, Allen Jones attended to the keeping of the books and was an expert book-keeper. On this accounting, a balance was struck and the net assets of the firm were stated to be $25,864.38. Thereupon, the defendant, Ivy, stated the proportionate share of the plaintiff at $5,118.66, and the plaintiff was accordingly given credit for that amount by an entry on the books of the firm. The plaintiff testifies that he was induced to enter the new firm by the statement of the result of the accounting above set forth. The new partnership, under the firm title of J. M. Ivy &amp; Co., continued during the year 1871, and was dissolved January 1st, 1872, by the retirement of Roach and May, the remaining partners, Ivy and Jones, continuing the business on their own account. On retiring from the firm, Roach demanded a final settlement, and was then informed for the first time that an enormous error had occurred in the accounting of January 1st, 1871, and instead of the firm having been worth then $25,864.38, as the stated result of that accounting, it was, in fact, worth nothing at that date, but, on the contrary was insolvent, its liabilities exceeding its assets by the sum of $85.86. Roach had been kept in ignorance of the discovery of this alleged error during the entire year 1871. It appears from the evidence that the entry in the books whereby Roach was credited with the sum of $5,118.66 as his proportionate share of the profits was erased therefrom with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>out his knowledge or consent by Ivy and Jones, after January 1st, 1872. Ivy and Jones both had ample opportunity during 1871 to discover any error in the statement of the accounts, especially one of so great a magnitude as that now alleged by them, involving as it did the solvency of a firm of high commercial standing and engaged in large and widely-extended business operations. The defendants, Ivy and Jones, allege, however, that the accounting had on the 1st January, 1871, and the statement based thereon were not intended as a final settlement between the members of the firm, and that the result as stated was only \u201c an estimate.\u201d It does not appear to me that this view is supported by the evidence. The entry of a new member into a firm is <em>ipso facto </em>a dissolution of the old firm, and the former partnership as between its members ceased to exist from that instant. \u2014 Parsons on Partnership, \u00a7 407. The legal relations of the parties, as well as their mutual interests, required a final settlement on the formation of the new firm ; and I must therefore conclude, in the absence of positive evidence to the contrary, that they intended to do what was necessary to be done in the premises. Any accounting not intended to strike a settled balance, as between the firm and its respective members, was superfluous and meaningless. The plaintiff does not allege fraud on the part of the defendants; yet the entire transaction on the part of the latter bears many of the indices of fraud and wears upon its face features that usually express bad faith. I am of the opinion that while the defendants would have been allowed to correct mistakes in the accounting of January 1, 1871, within a reasonable time, they cannot be allowed after more than a year has elapsed to set up such mistakes, \u2014 they having been, during that period, the special custodians of the books and papers of the firm, having every facility for the quick discovery of any error in the settlement and accounting. Their claim of exemption from liability is divested of all force in law or equity when it appears that the plaintiff was induced to continue in a profitless business upon the assumption that the accounting of January 1, 1871, was correct. This'view is amply sustained by the authorities, among which I refer to the following adjudicated cases: <em>Brown </em>vs. <em>Howe, </em>2 Barb., 594-5; <em>Taylor </em>vs. <em>Fleet, </em>4 Bart., 96; <em>Bowes </em>vs. <em>Burfee, 10 </em>Bart., 215 ; <em>Boakwood </em>vs. <em>Thom, </em>11 <em>N. </em>Y., 173-4; <em>Thomas </em>vs. <em>Barton, </em>48 N.

C., 105, and post.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-5\">In support of my view herein, I also refer to 1 Story, Eq., 159 ; <em>Penny </em>vs. <em>Martin, </em>1 Johns.

This would leave a balance of $3,069.66 due the plaintiff on the first day of January, 1872. I have not considered the questions as to the plaintiff\u2019s share of the profits for the year 1871, for that question is excluded from the present case by the plaintiff having brought another action against J. M. Ivy, individually, to recover a stipulated sum on Ivy\u2019s guaranty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-7\">The defendant, May, has retired from the firm, and all his liabilities have been assumed by the other defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-8\">I do, therefore, adjudge and decree that the plaintiff do recover of the defendants, J. M. Ivy and Allen Jones, the sum of three thousand and sixty-nine dollars and sixty-six cents, ($3,069.66,) with interest thereon from January 1, 1872, and the costs of this action, to be taxed by the Clerk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-9\">The defendants appealed on the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-10\">1.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcG\">This being an action by a partner against his copartners, upon the copartnership agreement, the usual course was the statement of the copartnership account, either at large or to the extent demanded by the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. It does not appear by the record that either party specifically demanded the taking of such an account. It seems to have been assumed that the right of the plaintiff to recover anything depended upon the construction proper to be put upon a statement made between the parties in January, 1871, by which the assets of the firm at that time are stated at \u00a720,474.64. If this statement is to be regarded as a final accounting between the parties, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover something, to be ascertained. If, \u25a0 on the other hand, it was intended as merely a rough estimate subject to correction, then the right of the plaintiff to recover must fail altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The occasion of making the statement in question was a change of copartnership theretofore existing between the parties to this suit by the admission of a new member, who is not a party. It is evident in the face of the statement that it was intended as an estimate alone. Two of the most important items, viz., the stock and liabilities, are put in round numbers. The stock is stated at $20,000 and the liabilities at $17,000. In addition, the accounts due to the firm appear to be stated without deduction for bad or doubtful. The evidence does not contradict this inference, apparent on the face of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>The Circuit Judge in stating that errors appearing in the partnership accounts could not be corrected after the lapse of a year has stated too broad a proposition, and one wholly inapplicable to the case. It does not appear to be a question of error in the statement in question. That statement appears to have been merely an approximate estimate made for the purpose of representing on the books of the new copartnership the assets of the old firm as capital stock to the new one. It was a matter of course that as these assets were realized by the new firm they should go on the books at the amount realized, and that the members of the old firm should be debited with any deficiency or credited with any excess of value realized over the estimated value. There was, therefore, no correction to be made of the amount credited to the old firm as capital stock on the books until the stock and accounts were finally disposed of, or until their actual value was ascertained in some other way. This does not appear to have been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The judgment of the Circuit Court must be set aside and an account taken, if either party demands it, to be conformed to this judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b450-6\"><em>Moses, </em>C.
