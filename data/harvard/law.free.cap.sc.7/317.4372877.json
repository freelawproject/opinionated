Seigler against William K. Seigler, for account as guardian of the estate of the petitioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-12\">On the 5th of November, 1856, the defendant was appointed by the Court of Equity for Edgefield District and gave bond for the discharge of his duties. The estate of the ward at that time consisted of his distributive share of his father\u2019s estate, amounting to some two thousand eight hundred dollars in the notes of two individuals, one of them ITezekiah Edwards, whose note amounted to about $1,200, and the other Robert Cheatham, whose two notes (one for about $900, the other for about $700,) amounted to $1,600. In January, 1857, the defendant received said notes from the administrators of the petitioner\u2019s father, and in his return to the Ordinary charged himself with $2,812.24, the aggregate amount of said notes. In 1859, Edwards paid $200 on his note, and the defendant loaned it to L. B. Cochran upon his note, taking no surety, and in 1863 the defendant collected the balance due on the note.of Edwards and invested $600 thereof in Confederate seven-thirty notes. In February, 1863, he took from Robert Cheatham a new note, with one S. B. Storm as surety thereon. This note was for $2,335.27, and included both of the previous notes, interest being added.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-13\">In 1862, 1863 and 1864, the defendant made payments for the petitioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-14\">The Probate Judge held that jhe defendant was liable for the full amounts of the notes of Edwards and Cheatham, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>payments made in 1862, 1863 and 1864 be scaled under the Acts of the Legislature.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-5\">The defendant appealed on the grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-6\">1. Because His Honor Judge Boney erred in not allowing the defendant credit for the amount of the notes of Hezekiah Edwards, Little Berry Cockran and Robert Cheatham, when the evidence clearly established the facts that the defendant received said notes as the distributive share of his ward, the plaintiff, in his father\u2019s estate, and that the makers of said notes were perfectly solvent at the time the defendant received said notes for his ward.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-7\">2. Because the Probate Judge erred in not allowing the defendant credits for his investments of so much of the proceeds of the notes mentioned in the first ground of appeal as was collected by him in seven-thirty Treasury notes of the Confederate States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-8\">3. Because the Probate Judge erred in scaling the payments made by the defendant for his ward, the plaintiff, during the years 1862, 1863 and 1864, under the Act of the Legislature commonly called the \u201c Corbin Bill.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-9\">4.

The bulk of said estate consisted of notes given to John D. Seigler, of whom petitioner was a distributee, and not of money. The receipts in Confederate money and investments in Confederate securities were transactions in good faith on the part of the guardian. The returns and testimony, it is submitted, show not only that the Probate and Circuit Courts are in error in their conclusion that the guardian kept no separate account of the funds of his ward and thus committed a legal breach of trust, but that the loss to the ward is one which should not fall on the guardian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>An executor may show that an item in his return was charged by mistake.\u2014 <em>Wright </em>vs. <em>Wright, </em>2 McC.

The estate then consisted of choses in action arising on notes of individuals. It was the clear duty of the guardian to collect demands of this nature and to put the estate in the condition of investment. The principles applicable to this duty are stated by us in <em>Nance </em>vs. <em>Nance, </em>1 S. C., 209. It is stated that it was not practicable at the place of residence of the guardian and his ward to make investments conformable to the general principles settled in that case. That fact does not appear in evidence and cannot be assumed. The guardian neglected this important duty until the disturbed condition of business resulting from the war rendered it impracticable to place the estate in a condition of proper security. The subsequent inability of the guardian to make judicious investments must be referred to his neglect to place the estate in proper condition at an earlier day.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The guardian was properly held accountable for the nominal value of the debts which it was his duty to collect, he not having made it to appear that such debts were not collectible at the time when they should have been collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The decree was clearly wrong in not allowing to the guardian the full amount advanced for his ward in Confederate currency. The evidence afforded no proper data for reducing the amounts thus paid to any other standard than that of the current value of Confederate money.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">The counsel for appellant urges that he was deprived of a full hearing before the Circuit Court on the appeal from the Probate Court. It will not be necessary to consider whether such fact could affect the validity of the decree of the Circuit Court, for it appears that, subsequently to the decree being made, the appellant\u2019s counsel was heard, and the Court, on such hearing, refused to disturb the decree. The counsel for appellant has received a full hearing in this Court, and all matters are open before us as completely as they were in the Circuit Court, and we see no good reason for sending the case back for further argument there.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The decree of the Circuit Court should be modified to conform to the principles of this decree, and the cause remanded for the correction of the account accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b333-5\">Moses, C.
