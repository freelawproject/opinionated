J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF_u\">The principal issue in this case is whether the Connecticut statute that prohibits tampering with witnesses is unconstitutionally vague. After a jury trial, the defendant, John Cavallo, was convicted of tampering with a witness in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151. He appeals from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On several occasions during the early months of 1984, the defendant, a Watertown police officer, allowed a seventeen year old woman to accompany him in his police cruiser. The couple often drank alcohol while together in the cruiser. On April 17, 1984, the chief of the Watertown police department, after learning of the defendant\u2019s activities, discharged the defendant from the police force for violating department policies against carrying civilians and using intoxicating liquors in police vehicles. The defendant denied the police chief\u2019s allegations and, through his union representative, notified the department that he intended to bring the matter to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">On April 18, the defendant met with the woman he had entertained in the cruiser and informed her of his dismissal. He told her that if investigators questioned her about their relationship, she should tell them that she had never been in the defendant\u2019s police cruiser and should deny any knowledge of the defendant\u2019s social use of the vehicle. On April 24, the defendant called the woman in Florida, where she was vacationing, and reiterated these instructions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 1, after the woman had returned to Connecticut, the defendant again implored her to tell investigators nothing. During the conversation, he informed her that he was going to sue the town and promised her that he would \u201creimburse\u201d from the proceeds of the suit anyone who \u201cstuck by him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>When police investigators questioned the woman on May 2, she claimed that she had never been in the defendant\u2019s police cruiser and that the defendant was guilty of no misconduct. After the session had ended, the defendant called the woman to determine whether she had divulged any incriminating information and to request that she continue to remain silent about their use of the police cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The defendant initiated arbitration proceedings on May 14,1984. On July 10,1984, the woman gave police investigators a full account of her visits with the defendant in his cruiser and informed them of the defendant\u2019s attempts to persuade her to deny that these activities had ever occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">On appeal, the defendant raises three claims of error. He argues that: (1) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151 is void for vagueness; (2) the state produced insufficient evidence at trial to support his conviction; and (3) the sentence imposed by the trial court is excessive. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">In his first claim of error, the defendant mounts a twofold attack on the validity of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under the United States constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He initially contends that the statute is impermissibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>vague in its application to the facts of this case. He then argues that, even if the statute is valid as applied in this case, it is unconstitutionally vague on its face and should not be enforced. We are persuaded by neither of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The defendant claims that, because General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151 does not clearly define as illegal his conduct in this case, the statute is void for vagueness as applied to him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The standard that we use to determine whether a statute is void for vagueness under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution is well established. \u201c \u2018A statute . . . [that] forbids or requires conduct in terms so vague that persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process. <em>Baggett </em>v. <em>Bullitt, </em>377 U.S. 360, 367, 84 S. Ct. 1316, 12 L. Ed. 2d 377 [1964]; <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Construction Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S. Ct. 126, 70 L. Ed. 322 [1926]. Laws must give a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited so that he may act accordingly.\u2019 <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>King, </em>169 Conn. 140, 142-43, 363 A.2d 68 [1975]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hurliman, </em>143 Conn. 502, 509, 123 A.2d 767 [1956].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chetcuti, </em>173 Conn. 165, 167, 377 A.2d 263 (1977); see <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357-58, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 75 L. Ed. 2d 903 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>192 Conn. 154, 158, 471 A.2d 632, appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 801, 105 S. Ct. 55, 83 L. Ed. 2d 6 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>180 Conn. 54, 60, 428 A.2d 322 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">As applied to the defendant in this case, the language of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151 satisfies this test. According to the statute, \u201c[a] person is guilty of tampering with a witness if, believing that an official proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>is pending or about to be instituted, he induces or attempts to induce a witness to testify falsely, withhold testimony, elude legal process summoning him to testify or absent himself from any official proceeding.\u201d The defendant does not challenge the precision of the terms \u201cwitness\u201d and \u201cofficial proceeding,\u201d which are defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-146.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, he claims that the statute\u2019s flaw lies in its failure to define the term \u201cinduces or attempts to induce.\u201d Ambiguity in this phrase, he argues, made it impossible for him to have known in advance whether the statute proscribed his conduct in this case. We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The language of \u00a7 53a-151 plainly warns potential perpetrators that the statute applies to any conduct that is intended to prompt a witness to testify falsely or to refrain from testifying in an official proceeding that the perpetrator believes to be pending or imminent. The legislature\u2019s unqualified use of the word \u201cinduce\u201d clearly informs persons of ordinary intelligence that any conduct, whether it be physical or verbal, can potentially give rise to criminal liability. Although the statute does not expressly mandate that the perpetrator intend to cause the witness to alter or withhold his testimony, this implicit requirement is apparent when the statute is read as a whole. See <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Silverberg, </em>200 Conn. 367, 371, 511 A.2d 336 (1986); <em>Grodis </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>190 Conn. 39, 44, 459 A.2d 994 (1983); <em>P. X. Restaurant, Inc. </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>189 Conn. 153, 159-60, 454 A.2d 1258 (1983). By limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the statute\u2019s application to situations where the perpetrator believes that an official proceeding is pending or about to be instituted, the legislature indicated that it did not envisage outlawing conduct that inadvertently convinces a witness to testify falsely or to refuse to testify. The legislature\u2019s choice of the verb \u201cinduce\u201d connotes a volitional component of the crime of tampering that would have been absent had it employed a more neutral verb such as \u201ccause.\u201d Furthermore, the statute\u2019s application to unsuccessful, as well as successful, attempts to induce a witness to render false testimony supports our conclusion that the statute focuses on the mental state of the perpetrator to distinguish culpable conduct from innocent conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See II A.L.I., Model Penal Code and Commentaries (1980) \u00a7 241.6, comment, pp. 166-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The defendant in this case repeatedly instructed a potential witness to fabricate her account of their relationship. He also apparently promised her a possible pecuniary reward for protecting him. In light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>statute\u2019s plain language, we cannot say that \u00a7 53a-151 did not give the defendant fair warning that this course of conduct was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The defendant next claims that, even if his conduct clearly falls within the proscriptions of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151, the statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face and should not be enforced.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Before reaching the merits on this issue, we must, as a preliminary matter, determine whether the defendant has standing to raise this claim. Ordinarily, when a litigant challenges a statute as void for vagueness under the United States constitution, we confine our inquiry to the statute\u2019s applicability to the facts of the case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>supra, 158; <em>State </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>192 Conn. 37, 46, 470 A.2d 688 (1984). Where, however, a challenged statute, if vague, could intrude on fundamental constitutional guarantees such as first amendment rights, we will refuse to enforce the statute if we find that it is unconstitutionally vague on its face.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>supra, 57, 57 n.3; see <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 573, 573 n.10, 94 S. Ct. 1242, 39 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1974); <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108-109, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1972); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>California, </em>361 U.S. 147, 151, 80 S. Ct. 215, 4 L. Ed. 2d 205 (1959). In this case, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151 applies to inducement, which is a communica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>tive form of conduct. Because such a statute could, if drafted ambiguously, impinge upon rights of expression protected by the first amendment, we will review the defendant\u2019s claim that the statute is facially invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Our inquiry into the facial validity of a statute focuses on whether indefiniteness in the meaning of the statute could reasonably create uncertainty over whether the statute prohibits expression that is protected by the first amendment. Such ambiguity is unconstitutional for two reasons: (1) it may deter individuals from exercising their first amendment freedoms for fear of incurring criminal liability; and (2) it vests enforcement officials with undue discretion to interfere with the right to freedom of speech. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>supra, 573-76; <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 109; <em>Baggett </em>v. <em>Bullitt, </em>supra, 372; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>supra, 57-58 n.3. Consequently, we carefully scrutinize a statute that is under attack to determine whether its language, as we have construed it, reasonably warrants such uncertainty among members of the public. We will not enforce a statute that could exert such a chilling effect on first amendment liberties. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>supra; <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra; <em>Baggett </em>v. <em>Bullitt, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The defendant in this case claims that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151 is facially void for vagueness because it furnishes the public no guidance in determining the scope of its application to protected speech. He reasons that, since the expression of one person\u2019s ideas may readily influence the conduct of others, a person could be exposed to criminal liability under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151 any time something he says inadvertently causes a witness to testify falsely or refuse to testify. This threat, he claims, can reasonably be expected to inhibit members of the public in exercising their first amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>The defendant\u2019s argument, however, assumes that tampering with a witness is a strict liability offense. We have held today that a defendant is guilty of tampering with a witness only if he intends that his conduct directly cause a particular witness to testify falsely or to refrain from testifying at all. So interpreted, \u00a7 53a-151 warns the public that it applies only to conduct intentionally undertaken to undermine the veracity of the testimony given by a witness. Members of the public therefore have no basis for concern that they might be subject to prosecution when their statements unwittingly cause a witness to testify falsely. As long as intent is a necessary element of the crime under \u00a7 53a-151, which penalizes only verbal acts relating to a specific pending prosecution, the statute casts no chilling effect on general exhortations concerning cooperation with judicial proceedings. See <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>385 U.S. 116, 134, 87 S. Ct. 339, 17 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1966). Accordingly, it is not unconstitutionally vague on its face. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carlsen, </em>638 P.2d 512, 515 (Utah), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 958, 102 S. Ct. 1469, 71 L. Ed. 2d 676 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stroh, </em>91 Wash. 2d 580, 583-86, 588 P.2d 1182 (1979); see also <em>Kilgus </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>602 F. Sup. 735, 738-39, aff'd without opinion, 782 F.2d 1025 (1st Cir. 1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>716 P.2d 624, 627-28 (Mont. 1986); <em>People </em>v. <em>Esteves, </em>85 Misc. 2d 217, 219-20, 378 N.Y.S.2d 920 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The defendant next contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for acquittal because the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to permit the jury to reach a verdict of guilty. Apparently conceding that the state presented evidence that was probative of each element of the crime of tampering with a witness, he claims that the jury could not reasonably have found him guilty because the evidence against him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>lacked the credibility and weight necessary to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument reflects a misunderstanding of the scope of our review of the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a conviction. On appeal, we do not attempt to weigh the credibility of evidence offered at trial, nor do we purport to substitute our judgment for that of the jury. Instead, our review consists of a two-step process in which we construe the evidence presented at trial in a light most favorable to sustaining the verdict; <em>State </em>v. <em>Vinal, </em>198 Conn. 644, 657-58, 504 A.2d 1364 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>197 Conn. 574, 576, 500 A.2d 539 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cimino, </em>194 Conn. 210, 211, 478 A.2d 1005 (1984); and then determine whether the jury could reasonably have found, \u201c \u2018upon the facts established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Braxton, </em>196 Conn. 685, 691, 495 A.2d 273 (1985), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 255, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772, reh. denied, 466 U.S. 954, 104 S. Ct. 2163, 80 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">A review of the record in this case reveals that the state presented substantial evidence to satisfy its burden of proving each element of the offense charged. The state introduced testimony that the defendant had repeatedly instructed a woman to give a false account of her activities with the defendant in his police cruiser. It also introduced ample evidence to convince a reasonable finder of fact that, at the time of his attempts to so induce the woman, the defendant had known that an arbitration proceeding would soon be pending and that, during the hearing, the woman would probably be called to testify about her meetings with the defendant in the cruiser. From this evidence, the jury could reasonably have inferred that the defendant intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>to induce the woman to testify falsely. Because the jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt if it found the state\u2019s evidence credible, the trial court correctly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the sentence imposed by the trial court is excessive. The trial court sentenced the defendant to a term of five years imprisonment with execution to be suspended after eighteen months served and five years probation. The defendant concedes that this sentence falls within the sentencing parameters set by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151 (b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He argues only that, in light of his record as a police officer, the nature of his offense, and the recommendation of leniency given by the author of his presentence investigation report, the trial court abused its discretion by ordering the defendant to serve a sentence of this length. We do not review this claim because the defendant has not followed the proper procedure for seeking reduction of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 934<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> require that convicted offenders who receive definite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>sentences of three years imprisonment or less, and who seek to have their sentences reduced, must direct their requests for relief to the sentencing court.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The record in this case contains no indication that the defendant filed such a motion with the trial court and the defendant has made no such claim. Consequently, because the defendant has failed to comply with a prerequisite to appellate review of the length of his sentence, we do not decide whether the trial court abused its discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-7\"> The defendant also informed the woman that he had just been arrested for tampering with another young woman who was also a potential witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-151. tampering with a witness: class d felony, (a) A person is guilty of tampering with a witness if, believing that an official proceeding is pending or about to be instituted, he induces or attempts to induce a witness to testify falsely, withhold testimony, elude legal process summoning him to testify or absent himself from any official proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">\u201c(b) Tampering with a witness is a class D felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b678-11\"> At oral argument, the defendant claimed that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151 is also invalid under the Connecticut constitution.
