Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACz\">The dispositive issue<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on this appeal is whether the enforcement of an oral contract for home improvements is barred by the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 20-429<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requiring that home improvement contracts be in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">In April, 1981, the defendants, John P. Petrillo and Angelina Petrillo, entered into a signed<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ****8written agreement with the plaintiff, Richard C. Caulkins, whereby the plaintiff was to furnish materials and render services in connection with the remodeling and renovation of the defendants\u2019 East Lyme home. The document outlined the work to be done, the materials to be provided, and estimated the cost of completion to be $84,687.41. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>The plaintiff undertook to provide services pursuant to this contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">On August 1, 1981, the plaintiff submitted to the defendants a revised proposal which indicated that the actual cost of the work would exceed the original price. The revised proposal calculated the total cost to be $117,470.57. The plaintiff alleged that the higher cost resulted from oral requests by the defendants for extra items. He further claims that the defendants had orally consented to the revised proposal and had agreed to pay this higher amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">After the defendants had paid in excess of $107,000 to the plaintiff, a dispute arose over the scope, quality, and cost of the plaintiffs work. On December 1, 1981, the plaintiff filed a mechanic\u2019s lien on the defendants\u2019 property claiming that, under the contract, the defendants still owed him $10,057.80. In November, 1982, the plaintiff filed a complaint requesting foreclosure of the lien, possession of the defendants\u2019 premises, and damages. Later, the plaintiff filed a revised amended complaint. Thereafter, the defendants moved to strike the plaintiff\u2019s revised amended complaint for failure to state a cause of action because, inter alia, to be valid, home improvement contracts under General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 must be in writing. On November 6, 1984, the trial court, <em>Conway, J., </em>granted the defendants\u2019 motion on this ground. The court ruled that the August 1, 1981 document was not a valid contract because there was no written indication that the defendants had agreed to its submission by the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not thereafter amend his revised amended complaint and judgment was entered against him. The plaintiff filed this appeal from the judgment. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the enforcement of an oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>home improvement contract that has been fully performed by the contractor and partially performed by the homeowner is barred by the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 20-429. The plaintiff argues that \u00a7 20-429 is a special statute of frauds provision for home improvement contracts similar to the statute of frauds embodied in General Statutes \u00a7 52-550.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims that, because of this similarity, \u00a7 20-429 should be construed to apply the doctrine of full performance,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which operates to take a contract out of the provisions of \u00a7 52-550.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">\u201c Tt is a fundamental principle of statutory construction that statutes are to be construed so that they carry out the intent of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>DeFonce Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>State, </em>198 Conn. 185, 187, 501 A.2d 745 (1985), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>180 Conn. 557, 561, 429 A.2d 960 (1980); 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 45.05. \u201c \u2018 \u201cIt has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>often been said that the legislative intent is to be found not in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 57-58, 480 A.2d 425 (1984); <em>Wiegand </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>170 Conn. 567, 581, 368 A.2d 103 (1976); <em>Colli </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>169 Conn. 445, 452, 364 A.2d 167 (1975); <em>Sillman </em>v. <em>Sillman, </em>168 Conn. 144, 148, 358 A.2d 150 (1975). \u201cWhere the language used is clear and unambiguous, we will not speculate as to some supposed intention.\u201d <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 158. \u201cIn the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The language of \u00a7 20-429 (a) is clear and unambiguous: \u201cNo home improvement contract shall be valid unless it is in writing . . . . \u201d The use of the word \u201cno\u201d in the statute is self-explanatory. The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d by the legislature connotes that the performance of the statutory requirements is mandatory rather than permissive. See, e.g., <em>Hossan </em>v. <em>Hudiakoff, </em>178 Conn. 381, 383, 423 A.2d 108 (1979); <em>Akin </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>163 Conn. 68, 74, 301 A.2d 258 (1972). We note that \u00a7 20-429 uses the terms \u201cshall\u201d in subsection (a) and \u201cmay\u201d in subsection (c). \u201cThe words \u2018shall\u2019 and \u2018may\u2019 must then be assumed to have been used with discrimination and a full awareness of the difference in their ordinary meanings. <em>Shulman </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>154 Conn. 426, 428-29, 226 A.2d 380 [1967]; <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>145 Conn. 612, 616, 145 A.2d 584 [1958].\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>175 Conn. 504, 509, 400 A.2d 721 (1978); <em>Zoning Board of Appeals </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>198 Conn. 498, 505, 503 A.2d 1161 (1986). \u201cValid\u201d is defined by Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary as, \u201chaving legal strength or force. . . . \u201d Read literally, then, it is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>that the plain language of the statute does not provide an exception to the requirement that home improvement contracts be in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The plaintiff claims that this court should imply an exception to \u00a7 20-429 for agreements that have been fully performed by the contractor, arguing that this statute is a special statute of frauds provision for home improvement contracts. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The legislature is presumed to act in view of existing relevant statutes and with the intention of creating one consistent body of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>192 Conn. 488, 494, 472 A.2d 775 (1984); <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 362, 472 A.2d 336 (1984); <em>Thornton Real Estate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lobdell, </em>184 Conn. 228, 230, 439 A.2d 946 (1981). The full and part performance doctrines of the statute of frauds are principles of common law liability well settled long before the enactment of \u00a7 20-429. See <em>Harmonie Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Smirnow, </em>106 Conn. 243, 249, 137 A. 769 (1927); <em>Haussman </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>59 Conn. 117, 133, 22 A. 1065 (1890). The legislature is presumed to have been mindful of these interpretations of the statute of frauds when it enacted \u00a7 20-429. See <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">It is true that, in some instances, a statute, general in its terms, may be construed to admit implied exceptions. <em>New Haven Savings Bank v. Warner, </em>128 Conn. 662, 669, 25 A.2d 50 (1942). However, \u201cthis interpretation is made only when the intent of the legislature is clear notwithstanding the literal sense and precise letter of the statute.\u201d <em>Sienkiewicz </em>v. <em>Sienkiewicz, </em>178 Conn. 675, 687, 425 A.2d 116 (1979) <em>(Loiselle, J., </em>dissenting); <em>Busko </em>v. <em>DeFelippo, </em>162 Conn. 462, 471, 294 A.2d 510 (1972). \u201c \u2018[I]n the absence of ambiguity, courts cannot read into statutes, by construction, provisions which are not clearly stated . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra; <em>Point O\u2019Woods Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number><em>Appeals, </em>178 Conn. 364, 366, 423 A.2d 90 (1979). Moreover, courts should not imply exceptions to a statute which the legislature did not prescribe by word or implication. <em>Sienkiewicz </em>v. <em>Sienkiewicz, </em>supra, 687-88. If the legislature had wanted the writing requirement for home improvement contracts to be subject to the same doctrines that apply to the statute of frauds, it could easily have added the appropriate provision to \u00a7 52-550 instead of enacting \u00a7 20-429, or, in the alternative, the legislature could have expressed an intent to apply these doctrines to \u00a7 20-429. That the legislature did neither supports our conclusion that it intended no exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The plaintiff argues that the legislature could not have intended the statute to create a bar to the enforcement of an oral home improvement contract which has been fully performed by the contractor. Even though the statute is unambiguous, we briefly will address the plaintiffs claim. The plaintiff, without referring us to any specific legislative comment, claims that the legislative history of General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 supports his position. The legislative history of the statute, however, does not reveal any intention on the part of the legislature to qualify or limit the effect of the statute as the plaintiff suggests. Quite the contrary, the legislator reporting the bill stated that \u201cthe act <em>requires </em>that <em>every </em>home improvement contracts [sic] as defined in this piece of legislation be in <em>writing </em>[and] contain the <em>entire </em>agreement between the owner and contractor . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 22 H. R. Proc., Pt. 33,1979 Sess., p. 11, 621, remarks of Representative William P. Candelori. Additionally, the same legislator, in commenting on the purposes of the bill, stated: \u201cThe purpose of the bill is to provide minimal, and I stress minimal, safeguards for the consumer who contracts for home improvement work to be done on or in the home.\u201d Id., 11, 613. The problems the bill addresses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>include contractors\u2019 workmanship, diligence, substitution of inferior materials, high costs, and <em>extra charges. </em>Id., 11, 614. The legislative history does not avail the plaintiff; it makes no express or implied mention of an exception to the writing requirement for contracts which have been partly or fully performed by the contractor. Consequently, in the absence of any legislative intent to qualify or limit the effect of the statute, this court will not \u201cspeculate upon any supposed intention not appropriately expressed in the act itself.\u201d <em>Colli </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">It is apparent that this law was passed for the protection of the public and that the remedial purposes of the statute would be undermined if this court were to permit a contractor to enforce an oral contract on the grounds claimed. For example, if a home improvement contractor could, without a written contract, perform certain work and then allege an oral agreement for precisely the same work alleged to have been fully performed, the purpose and clear intent of \u00a7 20-429 would be thwarted. We must presume, in the absence of any indication to the contrary, that the legislature intended the statute to be interpreted exactly as it is written; that is, \u201c[n]o home improvement contract shall be valid unless it is in writing . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not err in granting the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\"> Because of our disposition of this appeal, we need not address the plaintiff\u2019s second claim that his revised amended complaint alleges full performance of the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 provides: \u201ccontract to be in writing, owner to receive copy, required provisions, (a) No home improvement contract shall be valid unless it is in writing and unless it contains the entire agreement between the owner and the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">\u201c(b) The contractor shall provide and deliver to the owner, without charge, a completed copy of the home improvement contract at the time such contract is executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">\u201c(c) The commissioner may, by regulation, require the inclusion of additional contractual provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 took effect July 1, 1980, nine months before the written contract between the plaintiff and the defendants.
