The appeals arise out of an employment dispute between Frank Redin, represented by Local 1506, Council 4, of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (the union), and the plaintiff, the city of Milford. Redin filed a grievance with the union alleging that the plaintiff unfairly discharged him. In accordance with the procedures established in the collective bargaining agreement between the plaintiff and the union, the grievance was submitted to arbitration before the state board of mediation and arbitration (the board). A panel of three board members heard the case and found that Redin had been discharged in violation of his rights under the bargaining agreement. The award provided that Redin be reinstated and that he be compensated for lost wages. The plaintiff thereafter applied to the Superior Court to have the award vacated, arguing, inter alia, that the award was invalid because the arbitrators did not take the oath required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-414 (d) before hearing the grievance. The board moved to intervene in order to defend the validity of its arbitration procedures. The court allowed the board to intervene, but agreed with the plaintiff that the award should be vacated on the ground that the arbitrators did not take the oath under the statute. The court then ordered that the case be reheard by another panel of arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The board appeals from the trial court\u2019s order vacating the award.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It argues that the court erred in holding that before the members of the board can arbitrate a dispute, they must take the oath required by \u00a7 52-414 (d). The plaintiff responds that the board has no standing to appeal the court\u2019s decision and that the court properly vacated the award. The plaintiff also cross appeals, arguing that the court erred in permitting the board to intervene and that the court should not have ordered a rehearing. We find the issues in favor of the board and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">We address first those issues which question the board\u2019s interest in this action: whether the court erred in granting the board permission to intervene in the application to vacate the arbitration award and whether the board has standing to appeal the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The plaintiff filed its application to vacate the arbitration award on February 2, 1982. In the application it argued that the arbitrators did not take the oath required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-414, that the award was contrary to the evidence, and that the award was vague, \u201cagainst the law\u201d and \u201ccontrary to public policy.\u201d Redin and the union defended the action and applied for an order confirming the award. On February 25,1982, the board moved to intervene because its general practice at the time did not require its members to take the oath in question before hearing grievances, and an adverse ruling on the issue would affect all cases heard by the board. In the motion, the board did not specify whether it was moving to intervene as of right or was seeking permissive intervention. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 99 and 100. It argued that \u201c[t]he integrity of the Board is being attacked, and the legality of Board proceedings and awards rendered by the Board is being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>questioned by the Plaintiff in this action.\u201d The court thereafter granted the motion without comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The plaintiff claims in its cross appeal that the board has no intrinsic interest in the outcome of the arbitration proceedings; and that, as a result, the trial court should not have permitted intervention. Because the court did not state the theory on which it allowed intervention, the plaintiff argues both that the board has no right to intervene under Practice Book \u00a7 99 and that the court abused its discretion in granting permissive intervention. It is unnecessary to consider the board\u2019s right to intervene, however, because we find that the court\u2019s action was fully supported under the law governing permissive intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u201cThe consideration of permissive intervention involves numerous factors including the timeliness of the intervention, the proposed intervenor\u2019s interests in the controversy, the adequacy of representation of such interests by existing parties, the delay in the proceedings or other prejudice to the existing parties the intervention may cause, and the necessity for or value of the intervention in terms of resolving the controversy before the court. See Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 24 (b). A ruling on a motion for permissiye intervention would be erroneous only in the rare case where such factors weigh so heavily against the ruling that it would amount to an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>187 Conn. 187, 197, 445 A.2d 579 (1982); see also <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Docket No. 10718), </em>188 Conn. 259, 266, 449 A.2d 165 (1982) <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Applying the factors set forth above, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the board\u2019s request to intervene. The board\u2019s intervention, coming two weeks after the city\u2019s application, was timely under the circumstances. Intervention before that date would not have been practical. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>board does not have an interest in whether the award is ultimately vacated or confirmed, it has a significant interest in protecting the validity of the procedures used to determine the award. To vacate the award on the basis that the arbitrators were not sworn as required by law calls into question the legality of the board\u2019s proceedings and, by implication, jeopardizes the validity of almost all of its arbitration decisions. Concerning the factor of delay or prejudice, the city argues that the board\u2019s appeal caused a three year delay in the resolution of the grievance. The possibility of an intervenor\u2019s appeal is present every time intervention is requested, however, and that possibility should not, standing alone, be grounds for denying permission to intervene. Finally, while it is true that the union and Redin would have been able to argue the board\u2019s position concerning the oath, the court could reasonably have assumed that the board was in a better position to defend its own procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The city also contends that even if the board were properly allowed to intervene, the board does not have standing to appeal the court\u2019s order vacating the award. The gravamen of the claim is that the board was not \u201caggrieved\u201d by the trial court\u2019s ruling and therefore does not have sufficient interest in the matter to pursue an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u201c \u2018It is settled law that the right to appeal is purely statutory and is allowed only if the conditions fixed by statute are met. <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>171 Conn. 387, 394, 370 A.2d 984 [1976]; <em>Prevedini </em>v. <em>Mobil Oil Corporation, </em>164 Conn. 287, 293, 320 A.2d 797 [1973].\u2019 <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>181 Conn. 292, 293, 435 A.2d 345 (1980).\u201d <em>Local 1303 &amp; Local 1378 </em>v. <em>FOIC, </em>191 Conn. 173, 175, 463 A.2d 613 (1983). General Statutes \u00a7 52-423 provides that \u201c[a]n appeal may be taken from an order confirming, vacating, modifying or correcting an award, or from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>judgment or decree upon an award, as in ordinary civil actions.\u201d In all civil actions a requisite element of appealability is that the party claiming error be \u201caggrieved\u201d by the decision of the trial court. General Statutes \u00a7 52-263; Practice Book \u00a7 3000; <em>Local 1303 &amp; Local 1378 </em>v. <em>FOIC, </em>supra, 175-76; <em>Kulmacz </em>v. <em>Kulmacz, </em>177 Conn. 410, 412, 418 A.2d 76 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The plaintiff argues that the board is not aggrieved because it has no personal interest in whether this particular arbitration award is vacated or confirmed. The board responds that its interest springs from the fact that the validity of its procedures are challenged and the court\u2019s ruling interferes with the discharge of its statutory responsibilities. The test for determining aggrievement encompasses a well settled twofold determination: first, the party claiming aggrievement must demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest shared by the community as a whole; second, the party claiming aggrievement must establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>198 Conn. 498, 502, 503 A.2d 1161 (1986); <em>Cannavo Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>194 Conn. 43, 47, 478 A.2d 601 (1984); <em>Local 1303 &amp; Local 1378 </em>v. <em>FOIC, </em>supra, 176; <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>175 Conn. 483, 493, 400 A.2d 726 (1978). Mere status as a party or a participant in the proceedings below \u201cdoes not in and of itself constitute aggrievement for the purposes of appellate <em>review.\u201d Hartford Distributors, Inc. v. Liquor Control Commission, </em>177 Conn. 616, 620, 419 A.2d 346 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">We have never specifically addressed the issue of whether a state agency is \u201caggrieved\u201d by a ruling which questions the validity of its administrative procedures. The plaintiff relies on our decision in <em>Local 1303 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number><em>&amp; Local 1378 </em>v. <em>FOIC, </em>supra, where we held that under the governing statutes and the circumstances of the case, the freedom of information commission had no \u201cspecific personal or legal interest\u201d in the dispute and, as a result, could not appeal the decision of the Superior Court overturning the commission\u2019s decision. <em>Local 1303 &amp; Local 1378, </em>is inapposite, however, because the trial court\u2019s decision in that case did not challenge the validity of the commission\u2019s procedures. Id., 177. Our research reveals that other courts have found that governmental agencies would have standing in similar circumstances where the lower court\u2019s ruling impaired the agency\u2019s ability to discharge effectively the obligations imposed on it by law. See <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Federal Power Commission, </em>345 U.S. 153, 155-56, 73 S. Ct. 609, 97 L. Ed. 918 (1953); <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>307 U.S. 433, 441-42, 59 S. Ct. 972, 83 L. Ed. 1385 (1939); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Federal Maritime Commission, </em>694 F.2d 793, 801-802 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <em>Koniag, Inc., Village of Uyak </em>v. <em>Andrus, </em>580 F.2d 601, 605-607 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1052, 99 S. Ct. 733, 58 L. Ed. 2d 713 (1978); <em>Washington Utilities &amp; Transportation Commission </em>v. <em>F.C.C., </em>513 F.2d 1142, 1149-51 (9th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners </em>v. <em>F.C.C., </em>423 U.S. 836, 96 S. Ct. 62, 46 L. Ed. 2d 54 (1975); see generally 4 Davis, Administrative Law (2d Ed. 1983) \u00a7 24.16. Although the above cases are not controlling; <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>165 Conn. 687, 701, 345 A.2d 563 (1974); we find their reasoning to be consistent with our notions of aggrievement and we correspondingly adopt the rule in the circumstances presented by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-91 through 31-100, the board is given the broad responsibility of helping to resolve labor disputes. See <em>Board of Police Commissioners </em>v. <em>Maker, </em>171 Conn. 613, 620, 370 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>1076 (1976); <em>Danbury Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Local 402, </em>145 Conn. 53, 55, 138 A.2d 783 (1958). Consistent with its responsibilities, the board is empowered to arbitrate employee grievances; General Statutes \u00a7 31-97; mediate strikes and lockouts; General Statutes \u00a7 31-99; subpoena witnesses, order the production of documents; General Statutes \u00a7 31-95; and render awards in proceedings conducted under its authority. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-95, 31-97. The court\u2019s ruling in this case nullifying an award made by members of the board because they were not sworn pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-414 (d) clearly undermines the integrity of the administrative procedure employed by the board and calls into question the validity of most of the decisions it has rendered. The ruling therefore directly interferes with the discharge of the board\u2019s statutory responsibilities and the board, as a result, has sufficient interest in the controversy to confer standing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The primary issue raised by these appeals is whether the trial court properly vacated the award on the ground that the arbitrators did not take the oath contained in General Statutes \u00a7 52-414 (d). The board argues that its members are sworn upon taking office and that \u00a7 52-414 does not apply to the board\u2019s arbitration of labor disputes under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-91 through 31-100. The plaintiff responds that the legislature intended that all arbitrators, regardless of their posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tion on the board, be required to take the \u00a7 52-414 (d) oath before hearing a dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The parties have stipulated that the three arbitrators in this case were board members and that they were sworn to uphold the duties of their office upon appointment by the governor. General Statutes \u00a7 4-1 provides that \u201ceach person appointed or nominated for appointment by the governor, with or without the advice and consent of the general assembly or either house thereof . . . shall be sworn and shall hold office for the term prescribed by law . . . Article eleventh, \u00a7 1, of the state constitution further provides that \u201c[mjembers of the general assembly, and all officers, executive and judicial, shall, before they enter on their duties of their respective offices, take the following oath or affirmation, to wit: You do solemnly swear (or affirm, as the case may be) that you will support the constitution of the United States, and the constitution of the state of Connecticut, so long as you continue a citizen thereof; and that you will faithfully discharge, according to law, the duties of the office of. . . . to the best of your abilities. So help you God.\u201d See also General Statutes \u00a7 1-25. The plaintiff does not dispute that the board members are \u201cofficers\u201d of the state and are required to take the constitutional oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-414 was enacted in 1929 as part of legislation designed to make arbitration a workable alternative to judicial settlement of disputes. <em>Paranko </em>v. <em>State, </em>200 Conn. 51, 54, 509 A.2d 508 (1986). The statutes, now General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-408 through 52-424, provide for arbitration generally and do not specifically refer to the resolution of labor disputes through the state board of mediation and arbitration. <em>Danbury Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Local 402, </em>supra, 57. General Statutes \u00a7 52-414 (d) states that: \u201cBefore hearing any testimony or examining other evidence in the matter, the arbitrators and umpire shall be sworn to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>hear and examine the matter in controversy faithfully and fairly and to make a just award according to the best of their understanding, unless the oath is waived in writing by the parties to the arbitration agreement.\u201d In nonlabor matters we have held that if the arbitrators failed to take the oath required by \u00a7 52-414 (d), the award is invalid and must be vacated. <em>Reinke </em>v. <em>Greenwich Hospital Assn., </em>175 Conn. 24, 392 A.2d 966 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Thirty-four years prior to the enactment of our arbitration statutes, \u201cthe General Assembly had passed \u2018An Act Creating a State Board of Mediation and Arbitration.\u2019 Public Acts 1895, c. 239. This act provided in general for the submission of grievances and disputes between an employer and his employees to a board of mediation and arbitration.\u201d <em>Danbury Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Local 402, </em>supra, 55. The act is now embodied in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-91 through 31-100. It \u201cwas designed to deal exclusively with employer-employee grievances and disputes.\u201d Id., 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">We start with the familiar assumption that in enacting \u00a7 52-414, the legislature was cognizant of existing law, including \u00a7\u00a7 31-91 through 31-100, \u00a7 4-1, and article eleventh, \u00a7 1, of the state constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>192 Conn. 488, 494, 472 A.2d 775 (1984); <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 362, 472 A.2d 336 (1984). It is presumed, therefore, that the legislature intended General Statutes \u00a7 52-414 to be harmonious with the statutes providing for the arbitration of labor disputes and we must, if possible, \u201cconstrue each to leave room for the meaningful operation of the other.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>supra. The board claims that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the statutes, requiring board members to take a second oath before hearing disputes, creates an unnecessary procedure clearly not intended by the legislature. The plaintiff contends that the two oath requirements are consistent and that both should be given effect. We find the board\u2019s arguments more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>The labor legislation of 1895, creating a board of mediation and arbitration, was designed to cope with the special problems of employer-employee disputes and \u201cprovides a complete procedure up to the making of a decision by the board. Chapter 65 of the Public Acts of 1929, presently General Statutes [\u00a7\u00a7 52-408 through 52-424], deals, on the other hand, with the subject of arbitration generally. <em>Pratt, Read &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United Furniture Workers, </em>[136 Conn. 205, 206, 70 A.2d 120 (1949)].\u201d <em>Danbury Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Local 402, </em>supra, 57. The procedures established under each set of statutes are separate and distinct. See <em>Marsala </em>v. <em>Valve Corporation of America, </em>157 Conn. 362, 365, 254 A.2d 469 (1969). The board members are independently authorized under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-91 through 31-100 to arbitrate labor disputes and render awards. It would therefore be contrary to the intent of the legislature to impose the requirements of \u00a7 52-414 on the proceedings conducted under the aegis of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Furthermore, it would be anomalous to require board members to take an oath before every proceeding where they have already been sworn upon taking office. See <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Guilford, </em>136 Conn. 71, 81-82, 68 A.2d 371 (1949); <em>State ex rel. Rundbaken </em>v. <em>Watrous, </em>135 Conn. 638, 647-48, 68 A.2d 289 (1949). As Judge Hull, writing for the Appellate Court in <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>Council 15, </em>3 Conn. App. 590, 592, 490 A.2d 1021, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 809, 494 A.2d 905 (1985), has noted, \u201c[s]uch a requirement would be analogous to requiring judges and referees to take an oath prior to hearing every case.\u201d If we were to agree with the plaintiff and apply the oath provision of General Statutes \u00a7 52-414 (d) to board members, we would in effect render their constitutionally mandated oath redundant. The members\u2019 constitutional oath, although broadly worded in terms of \u201cduties,\u201d clearly encompasses the obligations recited in \u00a7 52-414 to arbitrate all labor dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>putes \u201cfaithfully and fairly.\u201d The legislature in passing \u00a7 52-414 (d), therefore, only intended that the section apply to those arbitrators not otherwise sworn to arbitrate disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We conclude then that General Statutes \u00a7 52-414 does not impose additional oath-taking requirements on board members and that the award rendered by the board members in this case was valid by virtue of their oath taken upon assuming office. The trial court therefore erred in vacating the award on the ground that the \u00a7 52-414 oath was not taken. Because the court below did not reach the other questions raised by the plaintiff in its application to vacate the award, the case must be remanded for consideration of those issues.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">There is no error in the plaintiff\u2019s cross appeal; there is error in the board\u2019s appeal, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-414 (d) provides: \u201cBefore hearing any testimony or examining other evidence in the matter, the arbitrators and umpire shall be sworn to hear and examine the matter in controversy faithfully and fairly and to make a just award according to the best of their understanding, unless the oath is waived in writing by the parties to the arbitration agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-9\"> Redin and the union have not joined the board in its appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\"> The plaintiff also questions the board\u2019s interest in the proceedings on the ground that under General Statutes \u00a7 52-410 standing to apply for the vacation or confirmation of an arbitration award is limited to the \u201cparties\u201d to the arbitration. See <em>Paranko </em>v. <em>State, </em>200 Conn. 51, 509 A.2d 508 (1986). General Statutes \u00a7 52-410, however, does not limit the court\u2019s discretion to permit a third party to intervene in the proceedings and does not limit an intervenor\u2019s standing to appeal the court's decision. Thus, although the board may not have been able to apply for an order confirming or vacating an award under the statutes, it could seek intervention and could, if sufficiently aggrieved by the court\u2019s order, appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b114-13\"> Because of our disposition of the board\u2019s claim that the court erred in vacating the award, we do not reach the plaintiffs claim on its cross appeal that the court erred in ordering a rehearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
