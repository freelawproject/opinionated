J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXv\">This case concerns the validity of municipal action, pursuant to the emergency provisions of the state building code, declaring parts of a building to be unsafe and prohibiting its further residential occupancy. The plaintiff, Gorra Realty, Inc., the owner of the Lena Building located at 153-165 State Street, New London, brought an action against the defendants Melvin Jetmore, the building official of the city of New London, and the city of New London, to enjoin the posting of the building and to recover compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. The trial court, after a hearing, rendered judgment for the defendants, and the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision contains the following finding of facts. The Lena Building is an historic building. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and located in the historic district of New London, adjacent to the New London municipal building on Captain\u2019s Walk. It contains four commercial establishments as well\u2014as twenty-three residential apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Acting on the basis of official inspections and complaints from tenants, the defendant Jetmore, as building official of the defendant city, first posted the Lena Building as unsafe on May 19,1980. That posting was removed after a conference at which the plaintiff promised repairs. The plaintiff had sought renovation funds under the HUD 312 program but such funds proved to be unavailable. Thereafter, on July 7, 1981, at a meeting held in the city manager\u2019s office, the plaintiff was notified that the Lena Building would be posted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>again. After a dispute about further inspections by the building official\u2019s office, the residential part of the building was posted as unsafe on July 27, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In posting the Lena Building on July 27, 1981, the building official purported to act pursuant to \u00a7 125.0<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Connecticut state building code, which permits emergency orders for the vacating of unsafe buildings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On that date, the Lena Building, as a whole, was struc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>turally sound. It was not in actual and immediate danger of collapse or failure and no lives were in danger therefrom. The building official had previously issued abatement orders concerning violations of the city housing, electrical and fire safety codes, but he did not claim that these violations rendered the building as a whole structurally unsafe. Despite the absence of present structural danger to the building as a whole, the building official maintained that emergency posting was appropriate because the condition of stairs and ceilings in the Lena Building indicated that parts of the structure were in danger of collapse.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Two days after the posting, the plaintiff sought and obtained a temporary injunction for the removal of the placards prohibiting occupancy of the Lena Building. The injunction remained in effect until the conclusion of the proceedings in the trial court. During that time, the city of New London through its welfare department housed thirty-two persons in the building. No tenants were shown to have vacated the premises because of the posting, and the plaintiff suffered no loss of rental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>thereby. The plaintiffs building was treated no differently than any other building situated in the historic district of the city of New London.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In its pleadings, the plaintiff sought injunctive and monetary relief, alleging violations of the federal and the state constitutions and of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court found all the issues for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">With respect to the plaintiffs claimed right to an injunction, the trial court found that the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law either under \u00a7 126 of the state building code or under \u00a7 122 of the New London housing code. In addition, the court determined that injunctive relief was unwarranted because the plaintiff had no due process right to notice or hearing preceding an emergency posting. Finally, the court concluded that the building official\u2019s decision to post the building was warranted because there were indications that portions of the structure were in danger of collapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">With respect to the plaintiff\u2019s claimed right to common law compensatory damages, the trial court found that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the posting had caused any financial loss to the plaintiff. Since the building was never vacated, its short-lived posting did not cause the plaintiff to lose rental income.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">With respect to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the trial court found that the plaintiffs constitutional rights had not been violated. The court reiterated that there was no due process right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>to a hearing prior to an emergency posting and concluded that emergency posting did not constitute a taking without just compensation. Finally, the court found that the plaintiff had failed to prove intentional, arbitrary, discriminatory or harassing conduct on the part of the defendant Jetmore. The court specifically found that the building official\u2019s insistence on reasonable inspections of the Lena Building was justified by virtue of his statutory responsibility for the enforcement of the standards promulgated by the building and housing codes.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred: (1) in finding that the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law; (2) in concluding that there was credible evidence to support the defendant Jetmore\u2019s decision to post the building; (8) in finding that it was proper to post the plaintiff\u2019s building without prior notice and hearing when the building as a whole was structurally sound; (4) in declining to find an exemption from compliance with the building code for the plaintiff\u2019s building, either as a prior lav/ful existing use or because of its status as an historic building; and (5) in various evidentiary rulings. We find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The first issue on appeal relates to the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling that the availability of administrative remedies precluded the plaintiff\u2019s access to injunctive relief. The plaintiff maintains that neither the state building code nor the New London municipal housing code affords him an adequate remedy at law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The trial court was of the opinion that \u00a7 126 of the state building code (Rev. to 1971) gave the plaintiff an administrative remedy through its provision for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>appointment of a \u201cboard of survey.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In this conclusion, the trial court was in error, for two reasons. First, it is doubtful that this section was applicable because it relates only to a building owner \u201cwho has been served with an unsafe order and notice,\u201d a procedure not followed in this case. Second, the section expressly excludes \u201ccases of emergency,\u201d impliedly cases governed by \u00a7 125, from the ambit of the \u201cboard of survey.\u201d It is entirely plausible that emergency orders should be immediately effective absent judicial intervention in the form of an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In the alternative, the trial court found that the plaintiff might have invoked \u00a7 122 of the New London housing code, which provides for a hearing before the city\u2019s code enforcement committee.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This finding cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>sustained because the appeal procedure in \u00a7 122 is limited to notices \u201cissued in connection with the enforcement of any provision of this ordinance.\u201d \u201c[TJhis ordinance\u201d is the housing code, which does not purport to encompass enforcement of the state building code. See New London Housing Code (Rev. to 1971) \u00a7\u00a7 101, 102.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although legislative bodies may authorize overlapping and consistent enforcement of building code and housing code violations; see <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>192 Conn. 207, 215, 471 A.2d 1368 (1984); <em>Bencivenga </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>183 Conn. 168, 172-73, 438 A.2d 1174 (1981); there is nothing in the present record to indicate that New London has chosen to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The trial court's denial of the plaintiff's claim for injunctive relief was not premised solely on the availa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>bility of administrative remedies. The trial court found that the action taken by the defendants was permissible because it comported both with statutory authorization for emergency measures and constitutional entitlements to due process and equal protection.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These are the matters addressed in the plaintiffs second and third claims of error, neither of which we find persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The plaintiff maintains that the defendant\u2019s posting of its property was not warranted by \u00a7 125 of the state building code, entitled \u201cEmergency Measures.\u201d Section 125.1 authorizes such posting when <em>\u201cin the opinion </em>of the building official, there is actual and immediate danger of failure or collapse of a building or structure or <em>any part </em>thereof which would endanger life . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court acknowledged that the evidence at trial \u201cwas in substantial conflict, especially as to the existence and extent of the claimed defective conditions of the Lena Building.\u201d The court found that, although the building as a whole was structurally sound, \u201cthe credible evidence supports Jetmore\u2019s decision to post the building because there were indications that portions of the structure were in danger of collapse.\u201d The plaintiff argues that this finding of fact was clearly erroneous. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s finding of fact to determine whether it is supported by the evidence; Practice Book \u00a7 3060D;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221, 435 A.2d 24 (1980); we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>operate under established constraints. \u201cIt is the province of the trier of fact to weigh the evidence presented and determine the credibility and effect to be given the evidence. See <em>Hally </em>v. <em>Hospital of St. Raphael, </em>162 Conn. 352, 359, 294 A.2d 305 (1972). On appellate review, therefore, we will give the evidence the most favorable reasonable construction in support of the verdict to which it is entitled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>178 Conn. 450, 461, 423 A.2d 118 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1980); <em>Hally </em>v. <em>Hospital of St. Raphael, </em>supra; <em>Busker </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>[156 Conn. 456, 458, 242 A.2d 708 (1968)].\u201d <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Rexton, </em>187 Conn. 540, 543, 447 A.2d 9 (1982); <em>Bieluch </em>v. <em>Bieluch, </em>199 Conn. 550, 556, 509 A.2d 8 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The evidence upon which the court relied consisted of testimony reporting substantial defects in stairways, ceilings and paint. Of these the most serious was evidence that the front stairway was being supported by a temporary metal lally column, that the front and rear staircases were not level, and that the staircases were pulling away from the wall. In addition, there was evidence that some of the ceilings were in danger of falling.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiff did not deny that these conditions existed, but adduced expert testimony that none of these conditions made the building unsafe. Further, the plaintiff complains that the trial court did not elaborate its finding that portions of the Lena Building were in danger of collapse and did not expressly reconcile this finding with its earlier finding that the building as a whole was structurally sound. That complaint is, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ever, addressed to the wrong forum. The plaintiff could have asked the trial court for further articulation of the basis for its decision. Practice Book \u00a7 3082.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to supporting the finding of the trial court, and mindful that it was the plaintiff who bore the burden of proof to establish that its rights had been violated, we cannot find that the trial court clearly erred in determining that the building official could reasonably have believed that parts of the Lena building were in danger of collapse. The trial court was not bound by the opinion expressed by the plaintiffs experts. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>190 Conn. 552, 556, 461 A.2d 988 (1983); <em>Ferri </em>v. <em>Pyramid Construction Co., </em>186 Conn. 682, 690, 443 A.2d 478 (1982); <em>Colonial Finance Co. </em>v. <em>Brodsky, </em>140 Conn. 391, 394-95,100 A.2d 568 (1953). The plaintiff has nowhere argued that the building code requires the building official to have more than a reasonable opinion that emer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>gency measures are required because existing conditions \u201cin any part [of a building] . . . would endanger life.\u201d Connecticut State Building Code (Rev. to 1971) \u00a7 125.0.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In addition to challenging the substantive basis of the defendants\u2019 action, the plaintiff also maintains that the trial court erroneously concluded that the plaintiff had not been deprived of its constitutional rights under the federal and the state constitutions. The plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claim has two components. The plaintiff alleges that, even under the emergency provisions of \u00a7 125 of the state building code, it had a due process right to prior notice, hearing and an opportunity to respond to claimed violations, in advance of the posting of its property. Furthermore, the plaintiff alleges that it had a right to equal protection of the laws that was violated because the posting of its property was arbitrary, capricious and in retaliation for the refusal of the plaintiff to permit the defendants to inspect its premises. We agree with the trial court that the plaintiff failed to establish any constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s due process claim founders on the well established constitutional principle permitting summary administrative action in situations of emergency. <em>Hodel </em>v. <em>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., </em>452 U.S. 264, 299-301, 101 S. Ct. 2352, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1981); <em>Calero-Toledo </em>v. <em>Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., </em>416 U.S. 663, 677-80, 94 S. Ct. 2080, 40 L. Ed. 2d 452 (1974). Our conclusion, supra, upholding the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendants justifiably invoked \u00a7 125 of the building code, places this case within the ambit of these precedents. In these circumstances, the plaintiff\u2019s due process rights are adequately protected by its access to judicial relief. See <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>179 Conn. 111, 119-20, 425 A.2d 576 (1979). In addition, it is noteworthy that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>tiff in fact had ample warning that its building would be posted, both because of the posting that occurred in 1980 and because of the conference held on July 7, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The plaintiffs equal protection claim stands on a somewhat different footing because it rests on the factual proposition that the defendants acted arbitrarily, discriminatorily and vindictively in posting the plaintiffs property. The trial court found that these claims were not supported by the evidence: \u201cWhile the relationship between the parties has been strained and adversarial, the plaintiff has not proven that defendant Jetmore acted improperly or outside his scope of authority. As building official, defendant Jetmore has reasonable rights of inspection and is required to uphold the standards promulgated by the codes. See New London Housing Code \u00a7\u00a7 111, 114; Connecticut State Building Code (Rev. to 1971) \u00a7 108.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Jetmore\u2019s actions were within the scope of these appointed duties.\u201d The plaintiff has not appealed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of its claim that the defendants\u2019 inspections constituted an unreasonable search and seizure.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nonetheless, it maintains that the trial court clearly erred in its finding that the plaintiffs property had not been singled out for adverse treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Since we have determined that the defendants had the authority, in the light of the conditions prevailing at the Lena Building, to invoke emergency posting measures, the plaintiffs claim comes down to an assertion that the trial court erred in concluding that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that this authority was exercised in bad faith. Questions going to intent and motive, which require the drawing of inferences from proven facts, depend for their resolution upon an assessment of demeanor and credibility that is peculiarly within the province of the trier of fact. <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Aberman, </em>196 Conn. 359, 378-79, 493 A.2d 193 (1985); <em>Dadio </em>v. <em>Dadio, </em>123 Conn. 88, 92-93, 192 A. 557 (1937). Our review of the evidence persuades us that the trial court did not clearly err in finding as it did. The plaintiff was afforded repeated opportunities to make the repairs that would have avoided the posting of its building. The plaintiff does not claim to have presented evidence indicating that other buildings, in like condition, were not posted.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>The issuance of an injunction is always discretionary with the trial court, even when irreparable harm has been shown. See, e.g., <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Holson Co., </em>185 Conn. 436, 440-41, 440 A.2d 935 (1981); <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>American Arbitration Assn., </em>174 Conn. 472, 477-78, 391 A.2d 137 (1978). At the trial, it was the plaintiffs burden to prove its entitlement to equitable relief. On appeal, it was the plaintiffs burden to establish so manifest an infringement of its statutory or constitutional rights as to demonstrate an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in its denial of the plaintiff\u2019s request for a permanent injunction. The plaintiff has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The resolution of the plaintiff\u2019s claims with regard to constitutional rights to injunctive relief is largely dis-positive of its claimed rights to damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. A \u00a7 1983 action requires a finding that a person has suffered a \u201cdeprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d because of the conduct of a person acting \u201cunder color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State or Territory.\u201d We are unpersuaded that the plaintiff\u2019s claims rise to this level. See <em>Briscoe </em>v. <em>LaHue, </em>460 U.S. 325, 329, 103 S. Ct. 1108, 75 L. Ed. 2d 96 (1983); <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>728 F.2d 97, 104-107 (2d Cir. 1984), after remand, <em>Powers </em>v. <em>McGuigan, </em>769 F.2d 72 (2d Cir. 1985); <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Washington County, Alabama, </em>700 F.2d 678, 682 (11th Cir. 1983); <em>Tarkowski </em>v. <em>Robert Bartlett Realty Co., </em>644 F.2d 1204, 1206 (7th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The specific conduct to which the plaintiff points our attention does not establish a constitutional deprivation. Although the plaintiff now complains that the defendants failed to file a certified inspection report, which it alleges to have been a statutory prerequisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>to an emergency posting, the plaintiff failed to obtain any ruling from the trial court on the significance of this procedural default. The plaintiff would have us draw adverse inferences from delays in the proceedings below, but we lack any factual findings concerning the reasons for delay in bringing this case to trial or for the defendants\u2019 extended acquiescence in the temporary injunction obtained by the plaintiff. We note, parenthetically, that such acquiescence can only have been protective of the plaintiff\u2019s interests and thus hardly demonstrates improper animus on the part of the defendants. Finally, the continued use of the Lena Building for welfare clients has not been linked in any factual fashion to the challenged conduct of posting the building and is in itself probative of no more than the regrettable substandard living accommodations in which people on welfare are only too often housed. See <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>supra. What remains is a question of discriminatory intent, which the trial court found had not been proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s fourth claim of error urges us to hold that its property was improperly posted because conditions at the Lena Building are not governed by the provisions of the state building code. The plaintiff relies on two alternate grounds: the exemption of buildings that were lawfully existing on October 1, 1945, under \u00a7 120.3 (Rev. to 1971) of the state building code,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the exemption of historic structures, under General Statutes \u00a7 29-259.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We agree with the trial court\u2019s rejection of these claims of exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">With respect to the claim of lawful pre-existing use, the trial court agreed factually with the plaintiff that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the Lena Building pre-dated the adoption of the state building code. The court also agreed that there had been no change of use or alteration to the Lena Building within the provisions of \u00a7 106.0 of the state building code.17 The plaintiff was therefore eligible to invoke the grandfather clause contained in \u00a7 120.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>The provisions of \u00a7 120.3 protect a lawfully existing building from building code orders that might otherwise \u201crequire . . . the alteration ... or prevent the continuance of the use and occupancy of a building lawfully existing on October 1, 1945, <em>except </em>as may be necessary for the safety of life or property.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We have, earlier in this opinion, upheld the trial court\u2019s finding that the condition of the Lena Building\u2019s stairways, ceilings, plumbing, and painting gave indication \u201cthat portions of the structure were in danger of collapse.\u201d This finding is sufficient to invoke the proviso in \u00a7 120.3 concerning \u201csafety of life or property.\u201d In the circumstances of this case, there is no exemption under \u00a7 120.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">With respect to the claim arising out of the Lena Building\u2019s classification as an historic structure, the trial court acknowledged that the building had been placed on appropriate registers of historic places. The court ruled, however, that such listings did not exempt its owner \u201cfrom complying with the required building codes, except as the same may be modified by requirements to retain its historic significance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The legislature, in General Statutes \u00a7 29-259, has ordered that the state building code be revised to allow exemptions from the state building code for historic structures, classified as such in the state register of historic places. Nothing in the record indicates that such exemptions have as yet been incorporated into the building code. That lacuna is, however, irrelevant in this case. The statute itself excludes from the exemption anything that would \u201caffect the safe design, use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>or construction of such property.\u201d The trial court\u2019s factual findings sufficiently implicate the safe use of the Lena Building to make the exemption inapplicable in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s final claims of error relate to a number of evidentiary rulings by the trial court. These claims fall into two categories: rulings concerning proof of damages, and rulings concerning the application of the building code to existing buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">We need not discuss those evidentiary rulings that relate to proof of damages. Since we have concluded that the plaintiff has failed to prove any violation of its statutory or constitutional rights, the question of damages has become academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The remaining claim of error concerns the proffered expert testimony of Leo Belval, who became state building inspector at some time after the disputed posting in this case. He had previously been a local building official in Essex. His testimony was offered with regard to the applicability of the building code to existing buildings. The plaintiffs brief has made review of this claim difficult. In contravention of the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 3060F (d) (3),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the brief fails to recite the specific questions that are at issue, the grounds of the objection, the grounds on which the questions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>claimed to have been admissible, or the basis for the trial court\u2019s ruling. In the absence of plain error or of a manifest showing of injustice, we have repeatedly refused to review evidentiary rulings that are so inadequately briefed. <em>Fogg </em>v. <em>Wakelee, </em>196 Conn. 287, 288 n.1, 492 A.2d 511 (1985); <em>Acheson </em>v. <em>White, </em>195 Conn. 211, 217 n.7, 487 A.2d 197 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>194 Conn. 573, 582 n.6, 484 A.2d 435 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>191 Conn. 604, 621, 469 A.2d 767 (1983). Because the plaintiff\u2019s allegations of error challenge only the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion with regard to the admissibility of expert testimony; <em>McKiernan </em>v. <em>Caldor, Inc., </em>183 Conn. 164, 167-68, 438 A.2d 865 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>181 Conn. 562, 588, 436 A.2d 33 (1980); enforcement of the Practice Book will cause no injustice and we therefore decline to consider these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-6\"> The Connecticut State Basic Building Code was revised in 1981, effective September 1, 1981, shortly after the incidents at issue in this case occurred.
