J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJU\">The sole issue on this appeal is whether evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct was properly admitted at his trial. The defendant, Lawrence Morowitz, was convicted of sexual assault in the second degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and sexual assault in the fourth degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (1) (B),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years. He appeals from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. In early 1983, the victim consulted the defendant, a practicing podiatrist in Stamford, concerning problems she was having with her feet. Following the initial examination, the defendant scheduled surgery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>in Ms office for the victim on several dates over the next few months. On at least two such occasions, having given the victim medication and an injection to put her to sleep, the defendant sexually assaulted her. The defendant was subsequently arrested in connection with these incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">During the trial, over defense objections, the state presented testimony that the defendant had committed a similar sexual assault on a female patient approximately three years prior to the incidents here at issue. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred in admitting tMs testimony because: (1) its prejudicial impact outweighed its probative value, the two assaults being neither sufficiently similar nor proximate in time; and (2) the charges resulting from the earlier assault had been dismissed and the records erased following the defendant\u2019s successful completion of the conditions of Ms accelerated rehabilitation, granted pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56e. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The rules governing the admissibility of evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s prior misconduct are well established. Although evidence of prior unconnected crimes is inadmissible to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s bad character or to suggest that the defendant has a propensity for criminal behavior; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>199 Conn. 47, 56, 505 A.2d 1225 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>195 Conn. 128, 133, 486 A.2d 637 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>191 Conn. 670, 675, 469 A.2d 760 (1983); McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed. 1984) \u00a7 190, pp. 557-58; such evidence may be admissible for other purposes, such as \u201cto prove knowledge, intent, motive, and common scheme or design, if the trial court determines, in the exercise of judicial discretion, that the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial tendency.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lizzi, </em>199 Conn. 462, 468, 508 A.2d 16 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 56; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>supra, 133-34. Our analysis of the defendant\u2019s initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>claim, therefore, turns on an inquiry into first, whether the evidence was relevant and material to an acceptable purpose, and second, if so, whether its probative value outweighed its prejudicial tendency.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The trial court admitted the evidence of the earlier sexual assault as tending to establish a common design or plan to assault sedated female patients, and thus as probative of the defendant\u2019s motive and intent in the present case. When evidence of prior misconduct is offered to show a common plan or design, \u201cthe marks which the [earlier] and the [present] offenses have in common must be such that it may be logically inferred that if the defendant is guilty of one he must be guilty of the other.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 172, 471 A.2d 949 (1984). It is not enough that the two offenses are similar. To establish a common design, the characteristics of the two offenses must be sufficiently distinctive and unique \u201cas to be like a signature.\u201d McCormick, supra, p. 560; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mandrell, </em>199 Conn. 146, 152, 506 A.2d 100 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>supra, 677. In the present case, the trial court found \u201cthe circumstances ... so unique, the factual situation so unusual, and the similarities between the alleged incidents ... so striking\u201d that they established a common design. In order to resolve the defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, we must examine the proffered evidence and compare it to the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">At a hearing held outside the presence of the jury, the victim of the earlier assault testified that, in January, 1980, she had consulted the defendant concerning problems with her feet. At the time, she was a twenty-six year old married woman. After an initial examination, the defendant scheduled her for foot surgery. He instructed her to take a capsule of nembutal one half hour before coming to his office for the surgery. She followed these instructions and arrived at the defendant\u2019s office feeling \u201clight-headed\u201d and \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>bit unsteady.\u201d Only the defendant was present in the office when she arrived. The defendant instructed the witness to remove her street clothes and to put a surgical gown over her underwear. The defendant then assisted her into the treatment room, helped her into a reclining chair, and gave her an injection of valium. Following the injection, the witness fell asleep, returning to consciousness some time later when she \u201cbecame aware of ... a penetrating sensation inside [her] vagina.\u201d She fell asleep again, and next became aware of the defendant massaging her thighs and breast. When she opened her eyes, she saw that the defendant was holding her underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">We agree with the trial court that the details of the earlier assault, as related by the former victim, are sufficiently similar to the details of the presently charged assault to be probative of a common design or plan on the part of the defendant to use his position as a podiatrist to assault sedated female patients. The present victim testified that, at the time she first consulted the defendant in 1983, she was a twenty-nine year old married woman. Following an initial consultation, the defendant scheduled her for foot surgery on various dates in early 1983. Prior to each scheduled date, the defendant instructed her to take two tablets containing a tranquilizer one half hour before coming to the office. When she arrived at the defendant\u2019s office after having taken the tranquilizers, the defendant instructed her to remove her clothes and to put a surgical gown over her underwear. She was placed on a reclining chair in the defendant\u2019s treatment room and given an injection of valium. She fell asleep, and, on at least two separate occasions, awoke to find the defendant engaged in sexual intercourse with her. Although the defendant\u2019s female assistant had been present when the victim arrived, she had been sent out of the office on each occasion prior to the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>The defendant argues that the evidence of the earlier offense should have been excluded because most of the similarities between the incidents reflect standard podiatric practices rather than criminal activities. We reject the defendant\u2019s argument for two reasons. First, the state presented expert testimony that neither the defendant\u2019s use of sedatives to induce sleep nor his practice of having patients disrobe was considered standard podiatric practice for the type of ambulatory surgical procedure performed by the defendant. Consequently, even the defendant\u2019s podiatric procedure can be considered unusual. Second, and more important, the fact that some of the similarities between the offenses were legal or relatively common occurrences when standing alone does not, as the defendant argues, negate the uniqueness of the offenses when viewed as a whole. It is the distinctive combination of actions which forms the \u201csignature\u201d or modus operandi of the crime; <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 171-72; <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>supra, 679; and it is this \u201ccriminal logo\u201d which justifies the inference that the individual who committed the first offense also committed the second. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mandrell, </em>supra, <em>151-52; State v. Esposito, </em>supra, 171. In both the present case and the prior offense, the defendant exploited his professional position to isolate, sedate, and assault young female patients who were rendered incapable of resisting by the use of tranquilizing drugs. We conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the circumstances of both offenses were sufficiently similar to be probative of a common design or plan. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hauck, </em>172 Conn. 140, 146-47, 374 A.2d 150 (1976); <em>People </em>v. <em>Wojahn, </em>169 Cal. App. 2d 135, 140, 147, 337 P.2d 192 (1959); <em>Rhine </em>v. <em>State, </em>336 P.2d 913, 916-17, 922 (Okla. Crim. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Having determined that the proffered evidence was relevant to a proper purpose, we must next review whether the probative value of the evidence outweighed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>its prejudicial impact. The primary responsibility for conducting the prejudicial-probative balancing test rests with the trial court, and its conclusion will be disturbed only for a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mandrell, </em>supra, 152; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>supra, 136; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>190 Conn. 541, 548-49, 461 A.2d 981 (1983). We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">After a hearing held outside the presence of the jury, the trial court ruled that the probative value of the evidence surpassed its prejudicial impact. In reaching this conclusion, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that, because the prior incident had occurred more than three years before the assaults at issue in the present case, the probative value of the evidence was nil and militated toward exclusion of the testimony altogether. We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The remoteness in time of a prior incident is rarely, standing alone, determinative of the admissibility of prior crimes evidence. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>432 F.2d 1109, 1112 (7th Cir. 1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Simerly, </em>463 S.W.2d 846, 848 (Mo. 1971); <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>State, </em>600 P.2d 1044, 1048 (Wyo. 1979); annot., 88 A.L.R.3d 8,13-14 (1978). Rather, it is one factor to be considered by the trial court in weighing the relative probative and prejudicial impacts of the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 169-70; <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>187 Conn. 681, 686 n.3, 447 A.2d 1167 (1982); McCormick, supra, p. 565. Where the probative value is strong, the evidence may be admissible in spite of significant time gaps between the offenses. See <em>Demmert </em>v. <em>State, </em>565 P.2d 155, 156-58 (Alaska 1977) (seven years not too remote); <em>State </em>v. <em>Simerly, </em>supra, 848 (eight years not too remote); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cardoza, </em>465 A.2d 200, 203 (R.I. 1983) (five years not too remote).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>In the present case, we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the probative value of the evidence was not significantly diminished by the lapse of three years between the incidents. The striking similarity between the offenses rendered the evidence highly probative. To lessen the prejudicial effect, the trial court carefully instructed the jury concerning the limited use for which the evidence was being offered, and expressly cautioned that the lapse of three years could have affected the witness\u2019s \u201cability to recall the events accurately.\u201d In view of the inherently imprecise nature of the balancing process, the care with which the trial court weighed the evidence, and the limiting instructions given to the jury, we are satisfied that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the evidence exceeded its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The defendant argues, however, that even if this court determines that the evidence of the earlier offense was admissible under the ordinary rules governing prior misconduct evidence, the disputed testimony should nevertheless have been excluded for an independent reason: because the incident to which the testimony referred formed the basis of criminal charges for which the defendant had been granted, and had successfully completed, accelerated rehabilitation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56e.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In accordance with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 54-142a,* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> all police, court, and prosecution records in connection with these dismissed charges had subsequently been erased. The defendant contends that, since the charges were ultimately dismissed and the erased records could not properly have been used against him at the trial, testimony describing the conduct which underlay those charges was equally improper and should equally have been excluded. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument misperceives both the focus of prior misconduct evidence and the scope of \u00a7 54-142a, the erasure statute. Evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s prior crimes or misconduct is offered, not to show that the defendant has a criminal record, but to establish that, because the prior conduct shares certain distinctive features with the charged conduct, it is reasonable to infer that the defendant committed the charged act in a similar manner. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mandrell, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>supra, 151-52; <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>196 Conn. 185, 190, 491 A.2d 1092 (1985). To be relevant for this purpose, it is not necessary for the prior offense to have resulted either in an arrest or in a conviction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lizzi, </em>supra, 469; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 54-55; <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>supra, 683. Such evidence may be admissible even when a prosecution for the earlier offense has resulted in an acquittal. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Van Cleave, </em>599 F.2d 954, 957 (10th Cir. 1979); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Etley, </em>574 F.2d 850, 853 (5th Cir. 1978); McCormick, supra, p. 564. Consequently, the fact that the defendant\u2019s earlier charges were dismissed when he satisfied the conditions of accelerated rehabilitation does not in any way lessen the relevance of the evidence in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">An analysis of General Statutes \u00a7 54-142a is equally unhelpful to the defendant\u2019s position. General Statutes \u00a7 54-142a refers by its terms to \u201crecords\u201d of criminal proceedings, mandating in subsection (a) the erasure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>of \u201call police and court records and records of any state\u2019s attorney\u201d pertaining to charges which have been dismissed, and prohibiting in subsection (e) the disclosure of the contents of those records by judicial or law enforcement personnel. There is no reference in the statute to disclosures by private parties or to matters extraneous to the records themselves. We have refused in the past to extend the strictures of \u00a7 54-142a beyond the classes of documents and individuals denominated therein. See <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>192 Conn. 488, 496, 472 A.2d 775 (1984) (photographs and fingerprints are not \u201crecords\u201d within the meaning of the statute); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 183, 188, 438 A.2d 859 (1981) (prison records in the custody of the commissioner of corrections are not \u201crecords\u201d within the meaning of the statute). The defendant offers no persuasive reason for us to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In the present case, the defendant has failed to establish that the disputed testimony represented a \u201crecord\u201d within the reach of \u00a7 54-142a. In admitting the testimony, the trial court carefully distinguished between evidence based on personal knowledge and evidence based on the erased records, and limited the scope of the witness\u2019s testimony to a description of the prior incident as she remembered it. Since the witness was also the victim of the earlier assault, her personal knowledge of the events to which she testified obviously preceded, and was independent of, the court proceedings which followed. No reference was permitted to the defendant\u2019s prior arrest or prosecution, nor were any records of the prior proceedings admitted into evidence. In an analogous situation, we have recognized the legitimacy of the distinction between testimony based on independent personal knowledge and testimony based on inadmissible records, permitting the former while barring the latter. See <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>169 Conn. 223, 236, 363 A.2d 143, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1025, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>96 S. Ct. 469, 46 L. Ed. 2d 399 (1975) (drug counselor\u2019s testimony based on personal observation admissible although records of the defendant\u2019s treatment were privileged under federal statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, a recognition of this distinction does not undermine the purpose of the erasure statute, which is \u201cto protect innocent persons from the harmful consequences of a <em>criminal charge\u201d </em>which is subsequently dismissed. (Emphasis <em>added.) Lechner v. Holmberg, </em>165 Conn. 152, 160, 328 A.2d 701 (1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>supra, 496. Prohibiting the subsequent use of records of the prior arrest and court proceedings adequately fulfills this purpose by insulating such an individual from the consequences of the prior <em>prosecution. </em>The statute does not and cannot insulate him from the consequences of his prior <em>actions. </em>Although the records of the defendant\u2019s prior prosecution were erased, the prior victim\u2019s memory of the assault remained. Because the disputed testimony was based on personal knowledge independent of the erased records, \u00a7 54-142a did not bar its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The defendant makes the related argument that, since the prosecutor in the present case also prosecuted the defendant\u2019s prior offense, his awareness of the earlier incident stemmed solely from his knowledge of the contents of the erased records. The defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly used that knowledge to obtain the prior victim\u2019s testimony in the present prosecution, and that this use is tantamount to an indirect violation of \u00a7 54-142a. We are unable to address the substance of the defendant\u2019s claim, however, because he has failed to support his accusation with any evidence, other than his own assertions, that the prosecutor solicited the prior victim to testify in the present case. It is equally plausible that the prior victim independently learned of the present prosecution and volunteered to testify. The defendant concedes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>that, if the witness\u2019s testimony was indeed volunteered, this claim is no longer viable. Since the record does not disclose any of the circumstances leading to the use of the disputed testimony, we cannot assume that this testimony resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s misuse of information he had obtained from the erased records.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly admitted the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">In this opinion Healey, Dannehy and Santaniello, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-10\"> At the time of the offense, General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (2) provided: \u201cSec. 53a-71. sexual assault in the second degree: class c felony: nine months not suspendable.

My only reason for writing separately in this case is that the majority opinion has failed to address on the merits the defendant\u2019s claim that the testimony of the prior victim resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s knowledge of the earlier case in which the defendant had been granted accelerated rehabilitation with the attendant consequence that the records of that incident had been erased pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-142a. The opinion refuses to consider that claim because the record does not support the defendant\u2019s assertion that the prosecutor solicited the prior victim to testify in this case, speculating that \u201c[i]t is equally plausible that the prior victim independently learned of the present prosecution and volunteered to testify.\u201d I regard that suggestion as utterly fanciful in the light of the undisputed circumstance that the prosecutor who tried the present case also had handled the earlier complaint that was disposed of by a grant of accelerated rehabilitation. Indeed, at oral argument before us, the state never disputed the defendant\u2019s assertions that the same prosecutor had handled both cases and that the prior victim had been brought in as a witness by the prosecutor. The state\u2019s silence, in the wake of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>defendant\u2019s factual claims, I view as curing any deficiency in the record as to how the state came to learn of the existence of this earlier complainant. See <em>Baskin\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>194 Conn. 635, 484 A.2d 934 (1984); <em>Trichilo </em>v. <em>Trichilo, </em>190 Conn. 774, 777, 462 A.2d 1048 (1983); <em>Miss Porter\u2019s School, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>151 Conn. 425, 429, 198 A.2d 707 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s argument that a prosecutor may not utilize information he has gained in a prior criminal case where the records have been erased, I see no merit in the claim. The erasure statutes, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-142a and 54-142c, are intended to preclude the use of information gained from records that have been erased but not to protect the defendant from the use of information concerning the underlying conduct mentioned in those records where knowledge thereof has been acquired from other sources. The statute was not intended to obliterate the memories of persons having knowledge of the events that led to the previous aborted prosecution. The circumstance that the prosecutor in this case happened to know of the prior victim because of his contact with the earlier case in an official capacity does not bring his calling her as a witness in the present case within the prohibition of \u00a7 54-142c.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Accordingly, I agree with the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
