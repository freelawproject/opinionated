The plaintiff, Donna Durso, brought this action against the defendant, Wayne Misiorek, to establish the paternity of the plaintiff\u2019s minor child. The case was tried to a jury which returned a verdict in favor of the defendant. After the court, <em>Hendel, J., </em>rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict, the attorney general filed a formal appearance and appealed to the Appellate Court. Without addressing the attorney general\u2019s claims of error, the Appellate Court dismissed the appeal on jurisdictional grounds. We granted certification to review the Appellate Court\u2019s finding that the attorney general was not a party to the action below and lacked standing to appeal. We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The decision of the Appellate Court fully describes the relevant procedural history of the case. <em>Durso </em>v. <em>Misiorek, </em>3 Conn. App. 212, 485 A.2d 1309 (1985). The plaintiff brought this action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-160, which provides that \u201c[proceedings to establish paternity of a child born or conceived out of lawful wedlock, including one born to, or conceived by, a married woman but begotten by a man other than her husband, shall be instituted by a verified petition of the mother or expectant mother, with summons and order <em>. \u201d </em>The plaintiff was at the time a recipient of state aid to families with dependent children and her attorney was selected pursuant to \u00a7 17-82e-6* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. Although required under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-160, the plaintiff did not serve the attorney general with her petition. The attorney general also did not appear or participate at trial. The court entered its judgment on September 22,1982, and the attorney general thereafter filed an appearance and appealed to the Appellate Court. The plaintiff did not join the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">After receiving briefs and hearing oral argument, the Appellate Court, on January 22,1985, sua sponte dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It rested its decision on the ground that the attorney general lacked standing to bring the appeal because: (1) he had not been a party to the action in the trial court; and (2) he had not participated at trial. <em>Durso </em>v. <em>Misiorek, </em>supra, 213-14. The attorney general claims that the Appellate Court erred in dismissing the appeal, arguing that under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-160 he is an automatic party to the paternity action and that participation at trial is not a requirement for standing. In reviewing this claim, our focus is on the judgment of the Appellate Court. We do not hear the appeal de novo and will consider only those issues squarely raised in the petition for certification. <em>Shelby Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Della Ghelfa, </em>200 Conn. 630, 634, 513 A.2d 52 (1986); <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>199 Conn. 231, 234, 506 A.2d 139 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430, 433, 493 A.2d 865 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>We consider first whether the Appellate Court was correct in concluding that because the attorney general was not a party to the proceedings below, he lacked standing to appeal. It is well established that the right to appeal is purely statutory and is accorded only if the conditions fixed by statute are met. <em>Milford </em>v. <em>Local 1566, </em>200 Conn. 91, 95, 510 A.2d 177 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 30, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). General Statutes \u00a7 52-263 provides that in proceedings before the Superior Court, \u201cif either party is aggrieved by the decision of the court or judge upon any question or questions of law arising in the trial ... he may appeal to the court having jurisdiction from the final judgment. . . . \u201d See also Practice Book \u00a7 3000. The right to appeal is therefore limited to <em>parties </em>who are aggrieved by a final judgment of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra; see <em>Paranko </em>v. <em>State, </em>200 Conn. 51, 53-54, 509 A.2d 508 (1986). General Statutes \u00a7 46b-160 states in part that: \u201cIn cases involving public assistance recipients the petition shall also be served upon the attorney general <em>who shall be and remain a party </em>to any paternity proceeding and to any proceedings after judgment in such action.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Appellate Court considered the effect of \u00a7 46b-160, but concluded that because the petition was not served on the attorney general, he never became a party to the action. In essence, the Appellate Court held that the attorney general\u2019s interest and status as a party to the proceedings was contingent upon having been served with the plaintiff\u2019s petition. We disagree with this interpretation of the statute and conclude that the attorney general was a party to the trial court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">When rendering judgment, the Appellate Court did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Lavertue </em>v. <em>Niman, </em>196 Conn. 403, 493 A.2d 213 (1985), where we held that indigent defendants in state-supported pater-</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>nity actions had a constitutional right to court-appointed counsel at state expense. In <em>Lavertue </em>we recognized the attorney general\u2019s standing to defend the appeal even though the plaintiff was not joined as a party. In so doing, we stated: \u201cThe state\u2019s interest in a paternity action concerning a child on public assistance is manifest and enduring. See <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>[452 U.S. 1, 9, 101 S. Ct. 2202, 68 L. Ed. 2d 627 (1981)]. The mother of such a child is required, on pain of contempt, to identify the child\u2019s father and, in the event he does not acknowledge paternity, to bring an action against him. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-82b, 46b-160, 46b-169; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7\u00a7 17-82e-4 through 17-82e-6. The state assists the plaintiff in finding an attorney and pays the plaintiff\u2019s legal fees and costs. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7\u00a7 17-82e-4, 17-82e-6. <em>The attorney general is automatically a party to such a paternity action, </em>and no such action can be settled without the approval of a state official. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-160, 46b-170. If the paternity action is successful and results in an award of child support, the moneys so awarded are paid directly to the state because the mother of a child on public assistance must assign her rights of support to the state. General Statutes \u00a7 17-82b.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis <em>added.) Lavertue </em>v. <em>Niman, </em>supra, 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The legislature has explicitly recognized that the state has a considerable interest in paternity proceedings involving a child on public assistance and, through \u00a7 46b-160, has made the attorney general an automatic party to such actions. The purpose of the requirement that the attorney general be served is to provide the state with notice of the action. Because the provision benefits the state, the service of the petition can be waived by the attorney general. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>166 Conn. 174, 176-77, 348 A.2d 666 (1974). The attorney general in this case waived the service requirement by entering a postjudgment appearance, having automatically become a party to the proceedings by operation of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-160. See also <em>Gelinas </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>165 Conn. 33, 40-41, 327 A.2d 565 (1973); <em>Castellani </em>v. <em>Criscuolo, </em>36 Conn. Sup. 501, 502, 409 A.2d 1040 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The Appellate Court mistakenly relied on our decision in <em>Mendez </em>v. <em>Mendez, </em>160 Conn. 237, 278 A.2d 795 (1971), where an appeal was brought by the attorney general and the wife from a judgment granting the husband a divorce. The trial court had determined that two minor children were not the issue of the marriage. We dismissed the appeal because the wife had not taken an active part in the appeal and \u201c[njeither the state nor the attorney general was named as a party in the complaint and no order of court joining either as a party appears to have been made.\u201d Id., 239. At the time <em>Mendez </em>was decided, however, there was no statute, as here, making the attorney general an automatic party to the proceedings. The case is therefore inapposite. Interestingly enough, a few months following the <em>Mendez </em>decision, the legislature passed what is now General Statutes \u00a7 46b-55 (a) which provides: \u201cThe attorney general shall be and remain a party to any action for dissolution of marriage, legal separation or annulment, and to any proceedings after judgment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>such action, if any party to the action, or any child of any party is receiving or has received aid or care from the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We also cannot agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the attorney general must participate at trial in order to have standing to appeal. <em>Durso </em>v. <em>Misiorek, </em>supra, 214. First, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-160 does not require the attorney general to participate at trial and the regulatory scheme is structured to allow the plaintiff to proceed with private counsel. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-82e-6. Indeed, it may not always be advisable for the attorney general to take an active role at trial. The state has two conflicting interests: on the one hand, as parens patriae, it has the obligation to insure that the child\u2019s father is accurately determined, and on the other hand, it has a financial interest in seeking reimbursement from the child\u2019s putative father. See <em>Lavertue </em>v. <em>Niman, </em>supra, 409. Thus, the state\u2019s presence at trial may in some cases only serve to confuse the jury. Secondly, participation at trial is not a requisite element of standing. See <em>Miner </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>102 Conn. 600, 603, 129 A. 547 (1925). Finally, as the defendant pointed out at oral argument, the state would in all likelihood be estopped from contesting the unfavorable judgment of the trial court in a collateral action for support payments. It would be unfair to hold, as the defendant nevertheless suggests, that the attorney general, without participating at trial, is unable to appeal from and yet is bound by the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The Appellate Court therefore erred in concluding that the attorney general had no standing on the grounds that he was not a party to the proceedings and did not participate at trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-160 provides: \u201cProceedings to establish paternity of a child born or conceived out of lawful wedlock, including one born to, or conceived by, a married woman but begotten by a man other than her husband, shall be instituted by a verified petition of the mother or expectant mother, with summons and order, filed in the superior court for the geographical area in which either she or the putative father resides. For trial purposes, jurors shall be selected from the judicial disctrict in which such geographical area is located. In cases involving public assistance recipients the petition shall also be served upon the attorney general who shall be and remain a party to any paternity proceeding and to any proceedings after judgment in such action. Upon the filing of such petition, said court or any judge assigned to said court shall cause a summons, signed by him or by the clerk or assistant clerk of said court, to be issued, requiring the putative father to appear in court at a time and place named therein to show cause, if any he has, why the prayer of such petition should not be granted. Such petition, summons and order shall be in a form approved by the judges of the superior court. In the case of a child or expectant mother being supported wholly or in part by the state, service of such petition may be made by any investigator employed by the department of human resources or the department of income maintenance. No such petition shall be brought after three years from the birth of such child, or after three years from cessation of contribution toward support of the child by the putative father, whichever is later; provided the provisions of section 52-590 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>shall be applicable to this section. If such putative father fails to appear in court at such time and place, the court may hear the petitioner and enter such judgment and order as the facts may warrant. Such court may order continuance of such hearing; and if such mother or expectant mother continues constant in her accusation, it shall be evidence that the respondent is the father of such child.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b670-9\"> Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-82e-6 (3) provides: \u201cPaternity proceedings are handled by private attorneys. The mother can select an attorney of her choice or, if she has none, the child support unit will give names of at least three attorneys from which to make a choice. She must make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>choice within 15 days. If she has not chosen an attorney by the end of 15 days after being given the names, the child support division will choose an attorney. The child support division maintains a list of attorneys willing to take on paternity actions within department requirements.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b671-9\"> The parties did not raise the issue of standing in their arguments before the Appellate Court. <em>Durso </em>v. <em>Misiorek, 3 </em>Conn. App. 212, 213, 485 A.2d 1309 (1985). The Appellate Court was of course obligated to consider its jurisdiction to hear the appeal despite the parties\u2019 failure to raise it. <em>Ardmore Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Freedman, </em>191 Conn. 497, 498 n.4, 467 A.2d 674 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b673-6\"> The United States Supreme Court in <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>452 U.S. 1, 9, 101 S. Ct. 2202, 68 L. Ed. 2d 627 (1981), recognized that Connecticut\u2019s involvement in paternity proceedings \u201cwas considerable and manifest, giving rise to a constitutional duty. Because [the mother\u2019s] child was a recipient of public assistance, Connecticut law compelled her, upon penalty of fine and imprisonment for contempt, \u2018to disclose the name of the putative father under oath and to institute an action to establish the paternity of said child.\u2019 Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 46b-169 (1981). See <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>432 U.S. 526 [97 S. Ct. 2474, 53 L. Ed. 2d 534] (1977); <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>422 U.S. 391 [95 S. Ct. 2221, 45 L. Ed. 2d 268] (1975).
