J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcQ\">The principal issue on appeal in this case is whether the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act applies to the purchase and sale of securities. The plaintiff, William A. Russell, brought suit against the defendants, James J. Reid and Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (Dean Witter), to recover for losses he sustained as a result of a securities transaction that the defendants had arranged. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had broken their contract with the plaintiff, made fraudulent misrepresentations, handled the plaintiffs account negligently, and violated both the Connecticut Uniform Securities Act (CUSA); General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36-470 through 36-502; and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA). General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-110a through 42-110q. A jury found for the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>tiff on all but the fraud count and the court held the defendants liable to the plaintiff for $18,120.09 in compensatory damages, $42,294.75 in attorney\u2019s fees, and $34,240.18 in punitive damages. The defendants appeal from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On April 8, 1981, the plaintiff authorized his stockbroker Reid, an employee of Dean Witter, to purchase for his cash account 1000 shares of stock in Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. (BESS). Reid proceeded to buy 2000, rather than 1000, shares of BESS stock in a margin account on the plaintiffs behalf. When the plaintiff learned of the size of the transaction, he immediately called Reid and objected. Reid told him that Dean Witter had made a clerical error in recording the transaction and that he would take care of the problem. Several days later, after receiving written confirmation from Dean Witter of a purchase of 2000 shares, the plaintiff again complained to Reid. Reid reassured the plaintiff that a \u201ccomputer foul up\u201d had caused the discrepancy and that he had purchased only the authorized number of shares. In early May, 1981, Dean Witter sent the plaintiff a statement of his account that indicated that he had purchased 2000 shares of stock in BESS and that he owed Dean Witter interest on the money Dean Witter had used to buy the stock. When the plaintiff confronted Reid with this document, Reid acknowledged that he had indeed purchased 2000 shares for the plaintiff and advised the plaintiff to keep the shares because they would be profitable. The plaintiff called Reid several more times during the next few days to complain further about the transaction. Finally, on May 14, 1981, the plaintiff directed Reid to sell enough of the BESS stock by May 29 to pay for the unauthorized shares. Reid agreed to follow this instruction, but did not carry it out. In early June of 1981, the price of BESS stock dropped sharply. The plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>forced to sell at a substantial loss over half of the shares in BESS that Reid had purchased for him in the disputed transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court erred in: (1) holding that CUTPA applies to the purchase and sale of securities; (2) instructing the jury improperly on several points of law; (8) admitting the testimony of other investors who had dealt with Reid; and (4) awarding the plaintiff full attorney\u2019s fees. We find error in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The defendants initially claim that the trial court erred in holding them liable to the plaintiff under CUTPA because CUTPA does not apply to the purchase and sale of securities. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The Connecticut statute that expressly governs the purchase and sale of securities is CUSA, which in General Statutes \u00a7 36-498<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides a private remedy for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>a buyer who has suffered injury because of allegedly deceptive sales practices by someone who offers or sells a security. That statute affords the defrauded buyer the right to recover restitutionary damages, interest and attorney\u2019s fees. We have not previously had occasion to consider whether an aggrieved buyer of securities may also invoke the provisions of CUTPA to afford him additional remedies, principally in the form of punitive damages. General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The trial court concluded that the plaintiff had stated a cause of action under CUTPA because of the broad sweep of CUTPA\u2019s coverage of unfair or deceptive acts or practices \u201cin the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court noted that none of CUTPA\u2019s express exemptions referred to security transactions; see General Statutes \u00a7 42-110c;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>and observed that CUTPA, as a remedial statute, should be generously construed to protect the victims of unfair or deceptive trade practices. General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (d);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corporation, </em>184 Conn. 607, 615, 440 A.2d 810 (1981). In further support of the trial court\u2019s position, the plaintiff reminds us that CUSA itself does not purport to preempt \u201cother rights [and remedies] that may exist at law or in equity.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 36-498. Although these contentions are certainly plausible, and the question of statutory construction is a close one, we have reached the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The crucial question is not whether CUSA transactions are exempt from CUTPA but whether CUTPA itself can fairly be interpreted to encompass such transactions in the first instance. We recognize the sweeping nature of the reference in \u00a7 42-110b (a) to \u201cdeceptive acts or practices in the conduct of <em>any </em>trade or commerce\u201d (emphasis added) and the breadth of the definition of \u201ctrade\u201d and \u201ccommerce\u201d in \u00a7 42-110a (4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This statutory language must, however, be reconciled with the equally unconditional statutory language that, in construing \u00a7 42-110b (a), \u201cthe commissioner and the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>given by the Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts to Section 5 (a) (1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45 (a) (1)), as from time to time amended.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">This court has repeatedly held, in accordance with this statutory instruction, that Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rulings and cases under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) serve as a lodestar for interpretation of the open-ended language of CUTPA. <em>McLaughlin Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>192 Conn. 558, 567-68, 473 A.2d 1185 (1984); <em>Conaway </em>v. <em>Prestia, </em>191 Conn. 484, 492-93, 464 A.2d 847 (1983); <em>Ivey, Barnum &amp; O\u2019Mara </em>v. <em>Indian Harbor Properties, Inc., </em>190 Conn. 528, 533-34, 461 A.2d 1369 (1983); <em>Heslin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Law Clinic of Trantolo &amp; Trantolo, </em>190 Conn. 510, 517-18, 461 A.2d 938 (1983); <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corporation, </em>supra. In <em>Heslin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Law Clinic of Trantolo &amp; Trantolo, </em>supra, 518-19, in determining the applicability of CUTPA to the provision of legal services, we undertook a searching inquiry of the federal cases and of the statements of the FTC before concluding that CUTPA applied to attorneys. In <em>Ivey, Barnum &amp; O\u2019Mara </em>v. <em>Indian Harbor Properties, Inc., </em>supra, 534-36, 539-40, we looked to the standards developed by the FTC for our determination of what constitutes a cognizable unfair or deceptive practice under CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Our recent decision in <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>199 Conn. 651, 509 A.2d 11 (1986), does not signal a departure from this interpretative principle. We there concluded that CUTPA covered deceptive practices in the insurance industry although the FTC does not presently regulate such conduct. In reaching that conclusion, we relied upon federal legislation, the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012 (b), which recognizes that federal regulation of insurance by the FTC would be appropriate \u201cto the extent that such business is not regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>lated by State Law.\u201d See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., </em>322 U.S. 533, 64 S. Ct. 1162, 88 L. Ed. 1440 (1944). Since federal law has thus authoritatively informed us that insurance is presumptively within the ambit of the FTC, we were led to a similar conclusion about the coverage of CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Application of the FTC lodestar to this case leads us to conclude that CUTPA does not apply to deceptive practices in the purchase and sale of securities. The FTC has never undertaken to adjudicate deceptive conduct in the sale and purchase of securities, presumably because such transactions fall under the comprehensive regulatory umbrella of the Securities and Exchange Commission. See Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77a et seq.; Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78a et seq. Despite the breadth of the language of \u00a7 5 (a) (l)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the FTC Act, which, read literally, would include security transactions, the plaintiff has cited no case in which the FTC or a federal court has applied the FTC Act to a securities transaction and we have found none. Indeed, in an agency statement listing the types of transactions and conduct to which the FTC Act applies, the FTC makes no mention of securities. 3 Trade Reg. Rptr. (CCH) f 9551, pp. 17,021-22. Consequently, in this case, taking our guidance from the FTC, we must construe CUTPA as not purporting to cover transactions for the purchase and sale of securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">This conclusion finds support in the totality of the legislative and administrative patterns regulating deceptive practices in this state. In contradistinction to the statutes governing unfair insurance practices; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>see <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 656-57; CUSA unequivocally provides a private cause of action for injuries caused by deceptive purchases and sales of securities. General Statutes \u00a7 36-498. Although this uniform statute was not enacted in Connecticut until 1977, four years after the passage of CUTPA in 1973, its predecessors in Connecticut law had established the existence of a private cause of action in Connecticut; General Statutes (Sup. 1969) \u00a7\u00a7 36-338<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 36-346;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> well before the enactment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>of CUTPA. Consistently, the commissioner of consumer protection, who bears administrative responsibility for the enforcement of CUTPA, has never sought to enforce CUTPA in the context of a security transaction. The commissioner has promulgated no regulation pertaining to the deceptive sale of securities; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7\u00a7 42-110b-l through 42-110b-28; and, to the best of our knowledge, has obtained not one order or injunction relating thereto.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This history demonstrates that, following the lead of the FTC, Connecticut has long separated regulation of the purchase and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>sale of securities from the regulation of unfair trade practices in other industries.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Furthermore, our conclusion is reenforced by the holdings of courts in other jurisdictions. A similar decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Cabot Corporation </em>v. <em>Baddour, </em>394 Mass. 720, 721-22, 477 N.E.2d 399 (1985), is particularly persuasive because the governing statutes in Massachusetts are virtually identical to our own and because that court had previously determined, in <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>373 Mass. 72, 79, 365 N.E.2d 802 (1977), as have we, in <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, that the state unfair trade practices act covered unfair insurance practices. The Massachusetts court noted that when Massachusetts had applied its unfair trade practices act to transactions not expressly subject to the FTC, it had done so in areas that had historically been subject to state rather than to federal regulation. It observed that federal law has largely superseded state regulation of securities transactions for the last fifty years or more. Like this court, it observed that state legislative history gave evidence that the private cause of action under the state unfair trade practices act was not intended to supersede the private cause of action provided in the state securities act. <em>Baddour </em>and its reasoning is on all fours with this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The decisions interpreting unfair trade practices in six other states likewise exclude securities transactions from the ambit of their unfair trade practices acts. See <em>Swenson </em>v. <em>Engelstad, </em>626 F.2d 421, 428 (5th Cir. 1980) (applying Texas law); <em>In re Cantanella </em>v. <em>E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. Securities Litigation, </em>583 F. Sup. 1388, 1443 (E.D. Pa. 1984); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Bear Stearns &amp; Co., </em>572 F. Sup. 667, 675 (N.D. Ga. 1983); <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., </em>314 N.C. 267, 274-75, 333 S.E.2d 236 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Piedmont Funding Corporation, </em>119 R.I. 695, 700, 382 A.2d 819 (1978); <em>State ex rel. McLeod </em>v. <em>Rhoades, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>275 S.C. 104, 106-107, 267 S.E.2d 539 (1980); contra <em>State ex rel. Corbin </em>v. <em>Pickrell, </em>136 Ariz. 589, 667 P.2d 1304 (1983); <em>Kittilson </em>v. <em>Ford, 23 </em>Wash. App. 402, 595 P.2d 944 (1979), aff'd, 93 Wash. 2d 223, 608 P.2d 264 (1980). Although the underlying statutes in these cases contain provisions that concededly distinguish them from CUTPA, the ultimate holdings of the majority of the cases are consistent with the conclusion we reach today.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Consequently, the trial court\u2019s award of damages to the plaintiff was in error insofar as it allowed the plaintiff to recover compensatory damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and punitive damages under CUTPA. In point of fact, however, many of these items of damages were equally recoverable pursuant to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action under CUSA. This duplication serves to validate the plaintiff\u2019s recovery of compensatory damages and of attorney\u2019s fees, and leaves reversible error only in his recovery of punitive damages, which must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The defendants\u2019 second claim of error involves a three-fold attack on the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury. The defendants contend that the court: (1) inaccurately charged the jury on the issue of ratification; (2) erroneously refused to instruct the jury on the statute of frauds defense; and (3) improperly instructed the jury that it might draw an adverse inference from the defendants\u2019 failure to produce a particular witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">At trial, as a defense to the plaintiff\u2019s contract claim, the defendants argued that, even if the plaintiff had not originally authorized Reid\u2019s acquisition of 2000 shares of BESS stock, the plaintiff had ratified the purchase through his acquiescence. After receiving the trial court\u2019s instructions on the definition of ratification, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>jury rejected this defense and found that the defendants had broken their contract with the plaintiff.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court erred in instructing the jurors that they could find that the plaintiff had ratified the transaction only if they first found that the plaintiff had had the opportunity to repudiate the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">We find no error because the trial court\u2019s instructions comported with the meaning of ratification. We have frequently held that: \u201cRatification is defined as \u2018the affirmance by a person of a prior act which did not bind him but which was done or professedly done on his account.\u2019 Restatement (Second), 1 Agency \u00a7 82 (1958). Ratification requires \u2018acceptance of the results of the act with an <em>intent </em>to ratify, and <em>with full knowledge of all the material circumstances.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Ansonia </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>64 Conn. 536, 544, 30 A. 760 (1894); see <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Holloways\u2019, Inc., </em>158 Conn. 395, 411, 260 A.2d 573 (1969); <em>Bond Rubber Corporation </em>v. <em>Oates Bros., Inc., </em>136 Conn. 248, 251, 70 A.2d 115 (1949).\u201d <em>Botticello </em>v. <em>Stefanovicz, </em>177 Conn. 22, 28, 411 A.2d 16 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The defendants do not challenge the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s instruction on any of the three elements of ratification. Instead, they contend that the trial court, in effect, added a fourth prong to the definition of ratification by including in the charge the following two sentences: \u201cBefore the plaintiff can be held to have ratified acts of the defendants which you find to have initially been unauthorized [by] the plaintiff, it is essential that [the plaintiff] had the privilege and opportunity of repudiating the unauthorized transaction if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>did not choose to ratify it. Thus, you must find that [the plaintiff] was given an opportunity to repudiate any transaction you find was unauthorized without any cost to [the plaintiff] or damage to [the plaintiff] as a result of the unauthorized transaction if he chose to repudiate it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Review of this instruction in context compels the conclusion that it served not to create a fourth component of the definition of ratification, but rather to clarify the requirement that the jury may find that a party ratified a transaction only if the jury finds an intent to ratify it. The trial court gave the instruction in the course of explaining that the jury could infer an intent to ratify from the plaintiffs actions. The challenged instructions cautioned the jurors that they could not permissibly infer such an intent from the plaintiff\u2019s inaction if he lacked the ability by his action to undo the disputed transaction. We have emphasized in the past that the finding of a free and informed decision to ratify is a prerequisite to a finding of ratification. See <em>Botticello </em>v. <em>Stefanovicz, </em>supra, 29. The trial court\u2019s instruction in this case helped to ensure that the jury rendered a verdict that was consistent with this principle. Accordingly, we find that it was not defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The defendants next contend that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that the statute of frauds afforded a defense to the plaintiff\u2019s claim that he had never agreed to the purchase of 2000 shares of stock in BESS. They argue that, because they sent the plaintiff a written confirmation of the 2000 share purchase, and because the plaintiff did not object in writing within ten days, the confirmation satisfied the statute of frauds for the sale of securities; General Statutes \u00a7 42a-8-319;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and bound the plaintiff to accept the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>defendants\u2019 acquisition of 2000 shares of stock in BESS. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The defendants\u2019 argument reflects a misunderstanding of the consequences of compliance with the statute of frauds. Under \u00a7 42a-8-319, a party may not enforce a contract that is subject to the statute of frauds without presenting specified written evidence of the existence of a contract. See <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>189 Conn. 518, 531-33, 457 A.2d 656 (1983). Satisfaction of the statute of frauds does not operate to bind the parties to the terms of the writing nor does it estop either party to challenge the existence of a valid contract. The existence of a written confirmation serves merely to preclude the parties from invoking the statute of frauds as a bar to the enforcement of the alleged agreement. See Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 42a-2-201, comment 3 (West); White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (2d Ed. 1980) p. 55; see, e.g., <em>McCubbin Seed Farm, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tri-Mor Sales, </em>257 N.W.2d 55, 58-59 (Iowa 1977).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The jury could have considered the contents of the written confirmation, and the plaintiffs failure to object in writing, as evidentiary of the terms of an agreement between the plaintiff and defendants. Nevertheless, the court properly refused to instruct the jury that the plaintiffs failure to object in writing prevented him from challenging the enforceability of the provisions of the written confirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The defendants further claim that the trial court erred in instructing the jurors that they might draw an adverse inference from the defendants\u2019 failure to call Richard Blumencranz as a witness. Blumencranz was a branch manager for Dean Witter and, at the time of the transaction in question in this case, he served as Reid\u2019s supervisor. The plaintiff sought to call Blumencranz as a witness during his case-in-chief, but Blumencranz, who was out of the state at the time, did not appear. The plaintiff instead read several pages of Blumencranz\u2019s deposition testimony to the jury.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Later in the trial, Blumencranz came to Connecticut and testified on behalf of the defendants. The defendants did not permit him to testify before the jury, instead limiting his testimony to an explanation of complex securities regulations to the trial judge. When Blumencranz completed his statement, the court offered to allow the plaintiff to examine Blumencranz before the jury as his own -witness. The plaintiff declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>In its instructions, the court charged that if the jury found that Blumencranz had been available during trial and that he had been a witness whom the defendants would naturally have produced, then the jury could permissibly have inferred from the defendants\u2019 failure to produce Blumencranz in their presence that Blumencranz\u2019s testimony would have been unfavorable to the defendants. The court then defined the term \u201cwitness whom the defendants would naturally have produced.\u201d It instructed the jury that Blumencranz had been available to the defendants and that the question of whether Blumencranz was a witness whom the defendant would naturally have produced was for them to resolve as finders of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court erred in so instructing the jury because: (1) Blumencranz did testify before the court; (2) Blumencranz, in effect, testified before the jury through his deposition; and (3) the plaintiff had an oppportunity to question Blumencranz before the jury when Blumencranz did appear in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">We need not review these claims because the defendants did not properly raise them below. It is well established that parties who seek appellate review of claimed defects in jury instructions must distinctly bring these flaws to the attention of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>197 Conn. 50, 53 n.2, 495 A.2d 1044 (1985); <em>McKiernan </em>v. <em>Caldor, Inc., </em>183 Conn. 164,166, 438 A.2d 865 (1981). In this case, the defendants\u2019 attorney, in the course of listing his exceptions to the court\u2019s charge, briefly mentioned his objection to the missing witness instruction in a single sentence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This reference was insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>to be of useful assistance to the court in determining whether the charge was inappropriate and in deciding whether to give a supplemental instruction to the jury. Consequently, the defendants, who were represented by experienced counsel at trial, failed adequately to preserve their claim of error on this issue. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>193 Conn. 70, 88, 475 A.2d 1087 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Even if we were to reach the merits on this question, we are not persuaded by the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court committed plain error in giving the missing witness instruction. We have held on numerous occasions that the trial court may appropriately instruct the jury that it may draw an adverse inference from a party\u2019s failure to call a witness who was available and who was a witness whom the party would naturally have produced. <em>Shelnitz </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>200 Conn. 58, 73, 509 A.2d 1023 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>198 Conn. 424, 428, 503 A.2d 588 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>195 Conn. 624, 631, 490 A.2d 75 (1985); <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 675, 165 A.2d 598 (1960). \u201cA witness who would naturally be produced by a party is one who is known to that party and who, by reason of his relationship to that party or to the issues, or both, could reasonably be expected to have peculiar or superior information material to the case which, if favorable, the party would produce.\u201d <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The trial court in this case did not instruct the jury to draw an adverse inference nor did it tell the jurors that the circumstances of the case permitted such an inference. The court merely instructed the jurors that they could permissibly draw an adverse inference if they first found that the prerequisite conditions existed. The defendants do not question Blumencranz\u2019s availability nor do they contend that a jury could not reasonably have found him to be a witness whom they naturally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>would have produced. Instead, they argue that the instruction was inappropriate because Blumencranz did appear at trial and because Blumencranz was also available to the plaintiff. These arguments, however, ignore the focus of the inquiry into the propriety of the missing witness charge. It is the party\u2019s decision to withhold the testimony of an available witness whom it would naturally have produced that permits the jury to draw an adverse inference. <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>supra, 674-75. Thus, it is irrelevant that another party introduced the missing witness\u2019s deposition testimony; <em>see Halpine </em>v. <em>Halpine, </em>138 Conn. 578, 580-82, 87 A.2d 146 (1952); cf. <em>Sileo </em>v. <em>Curran, </em>161 Conn. 572, 573, 290 A.2d 325 (1971); or that the witness testified to the court on issues that were immaterial to the jury\u2019s inquiry, or that the witness was also available to other parties. See <em>Kelsey </em>v. <em>Connecticut State Employees Assn., </em>179 Conn. 606, 616, 427 A.2d 420 (1980); <em>Zack </em>v. <em>Guzauskas, </em>171 Conn. 98, 102, 368 A.2d 193 (1976); <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>supra, 676. In this case, the defendants did not present Blumencranz to the jury. If the jury concluded that he was a witness whom the defendants would naturally have produced, it could permissibly have drawn an adverse inference from the defendants\u2019 failure. The trial court, therefore, properly instructed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In their third claim, the defendants argue that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence of Reid\u2019s prior misconduct when it permitted two of Reid\u2019s former clients, Frank McDonnell and James Kleinkauf, to testify that Reid had made several unauthorized purchases of stock on their behalves. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">We may usefully begin our inquiry on this issue by restating the two-step analysis that a trial court must conduct in deciding whether to admit evidence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>party\u2019s collateral misconduct. The court first must determine whether the evidence is relevant and material to an issue properly before the court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>195 Conn. 128, 134, 486 A.2d 637 (1985). \u201c \u2018Evidence of other misconduct, although not ordinarily admissible to prove the bad character or criminal tendencies of the accused, may be allowed for the purpose of proving many different things, such as intent, identity, malice, motive or a system of criminal activity\u2019; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>187 Conn. 348, 352, 446 A.2d 382(1982) . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>supra, 133. Second, after a finding that the evidence is relevant, the trial court must then decide whether its admission is warranted because its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect. Id., 134; <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>191 Conn. 670, 676, 469 A.2d 760 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In this case, the defendants concede that the trial court conducted an appropriate inquiry. They acknowledge that the court below found that the testimony of McDonnell and Kleinkauf was relevant to the issue of Reid\u2019s fraudulent intent and that the probative value of the witnesses\u2019 testimony exceeded its prejudicial effect. On appeal, the defendants limit their claim to an attack on these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Because of the latitude we accord trial courts on questions of relevance; <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>199 Conn. 155, 163, 506 A.2d 104 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 657, 491 A.2d 345 (1985); and \u201c \u2018[bjecause of the difficulties inherent in [the process of balancing probative value and prejudicial effect], the trial court\u2019s decision [to admit evidence of other misconduct] will be reversed only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done. . . . On review by this court, therefore, \u201cevery reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>[182 Conn. 335, 337, 438 A.2d 107 (1980)]. \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>[187 Conn. 681, 685, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>447 A.2d 1167 (1982)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>supra, 136, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>supra, 676-77; <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Applying this standard to the facts of this case, we conclude that the trial court properly admitted the testimony of Kleinkauf and McDonnell. In light of the close correspondence in time and character between Reid\u2019s conduct toward the plaintiff and his conduct toward these witnesses, and in light of Reid\u2019s disavowal of any intent to deceive the plaintiff, the trial court could reasonably have found the testimony of Kleinkauf and McDonnell material to the issue of Reid\u2019s motive and fraudulent intent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn 166, 171-72, 471 A.2d 949 (1984); see also <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>86 Conn. 252, 259-60, 85 A. 370 (1912); <em>Hoxie </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>32 Conn. 21, 37 (1864). Similarly, the court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the probative value of the testimony outweighed its prejudicial effect. Indeed, the defendants have established no basis for a determination by this court that the admission of the testimony resulted in undue prejudice. The court sought to minimize any possible prejudice by instructing the jury that it could consider the testimony only as evidence of Reid\u2019s fraudulent intent and that it could not infer from the testimony that Reid possessed a propensity for dishonesty.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 claim of prejudice is further undercut by the fact that the jury, after hearing the testimony, returned a verdict in favor of the defendants on the claim of fraud. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 513, 529, 447 A.2d 396 (1982). In the absence of a demonstrated likelihood of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>undue prejudice, we cannot say that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of Kleinkauf and McDonnell.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The defendants\u2019 final claim is that the trial court awarded the plaintiff excessive attorney\u2019s fees. At the conclusion of trial, the court held the defendants liable for the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees under the relevant provision of CUSA. General Statutes \u00a7 36-498.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> After reviewing billing records submitted by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, the court determined the appropriate amount of this award to be $42,294.75. On appeal, the defendants contend that this sum should be reduced because: (1) the plaintiff did not prevail on all of his claims; (2) the award was unreasonable in light of the compensatory damages the plaintiff obtained; and (3) the trial court assigned unrealistically high values to certain services provided by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The defendants first argue that the award was excessive as a matter of law because the fees that the trial court allowed improperly included amounts allocable to the plaintiff\u2019s unsuccessful claims of fraud and violation of CUTPA. This argument is unpersuasive because it erroneously assumes that, under \u00a7 36-498, an award of attorney\u2019s fees must automatically be reduced if its recipient fails to prevail on all of his claims at trial. We have no such rule. A plaintiff may recover \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d under \u00a7 36-498 only if he prevails on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>his \u00a7 36-498 claim. The magnitude of the amount awarded to a victorious party rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. See <em>Kenny </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>197 Conn. 270, 277-78, 496 A.2d 956 (1985); <em>Moffitt </em>v. <em>Horrigan, </em>37 Conn. Sup. 873, 876, 441 A.2d 207 (1982). Where a party succeeds on his \u00a7 36-498 claim, but fails on other claims brought in the same suit, the size of his award should reflect his success, as determined by the trial court, in securing redress for the injuries that prompted his \u00a7 36-498 claim and reasonable legal cost incurred in pursuing this success. See <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1983). In this case, the plaintiff sought relief, on five separate legal theories, for losses he had sustained as a result of a transaction that the defendants had arranged. He succeeded in this endeavor by prevailing on three of the five related counts.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because the amounts he expended on litigation, including the dollars spent on his unsuccessful claims, were devoted to the pursuit of a goal that he achieved, the trial court permissibly rejected the defendants\u2019 demand that it reduce the award by two-fifths.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The defendants also urge us to hold that the award was unreasonable because it exceeded the amount of compensatory damages that the plaintiff recovered. The trial court ordered the defendants to pay $42,294.75 in attorney\u2019s fees, while holding the defendants liable for only $18,120.09 in compensatory damages. This difference by itself, however, does not compel us to disturb the trial court\u2019s judgment. Section 36-498 provides for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>to encourage the enforcement of CUSA by victims of improper securities transactions who might not otherwise be able to afford to do so. See Rodriguez, \u201cRecovery of Attorneys\u2019 Fees in Consumer Contract Actions in Connecticut,\u201d 1 Bridgeport L. Rev. 55, 62-63 (1980). It reflects a legislative recognition that suits under CUSA are often long, complex, and prohibitively expensive for individual investors. The defendants in this case have offered this court no reason to conclude that attorney\u2019s fees that exceed compensatory damages are presumptively unreasonable. Indeed, the relative size of the award in this case tends to support the proposition that the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees is necessary to make the enforcement of CUSA economically feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Finally, the defendants attack the method the trial court used to calculate the attorney\u2019s fees that it awarded. They claim that the court should have assigned a lower hourly billing rate to time spent by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney working on administrative and nonlegal tasks. Because the defendants in their brief do not specifically describe the allegedly overvalued tasks or even mention the size of the hourly rate employed by the trial court, they have failed to provide sufficient information to allow us to evaluate the reasonableness of the trial court\u2019s calculation. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>American Thread Co., </em>200 Conn. 108, 509 A.2d 512 (1986); <em>Bieluch </em>v. <em>Bieluch, </em>199 Conn. 550, 552, 509 A.2d 8 (1986); <em>In re Final Grand Jury Report Concerning the Torrington Police Department, </em>197 Conn. 698, 715, 501 A.2d 377 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>One 1977 Buick Automobile, </em>196 Conn. 471, 480, 493 A.2d 874 (1985). In the absence of any such presentation in support of the defendants\u2019 argument, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s methods were clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>There is error in part, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to modify judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 36-498. buyer\u2019s remedies, (a) Any person who: (1) Offers or sells a security in violation of subsection (a) of section 36-474, 36-485 or subsection (b) of section 36-493 or of any regulation or order under section 36-491 which requires the affirmative approval of sales literature before it is used, or of any condition imposed under subsection (d) of section 36-487 or subsection (g) or (h) of section 36-488; or (2) offers or sells a security by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the buyer not knowing of the untruth or omission, and who does not sustain the burden of proof that he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the untruth or omission, is liable to the person buying the security from him, who may sue either at law or in equity to recover the consideration paid for the security, together with interest at eight per cent per year from the date of payment, costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, less the amount of any income received on the security, upon the tender of the security, or for damages if he no longer owns the security.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">\u201c(b) Eveiy person who directly or indirectly controls a seller liable under subsection (a) of this section, every partner, officer, or director of such a seller, every person occupying a similar status or performing similar func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>tions, every employee of such a seller who materially aids in the sale and every broker-dealer or agent who materially aids in the sale are also liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as the seller, unless the nonseller who is so liable sustains the burden of proof that he did not know, and in exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.
