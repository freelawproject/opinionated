J.</author>\n<p id=\"Au8\">The dispositive issue on this appeal is whether the defendant properly invoked his constitutional right to represent himself at the trial of the criminal charges against him. The defendant, Elton Carter, was convicted by a jury of one count of attempted murder, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>53a-54a (a),* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> one count of assault in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and one count of reckless endangerment in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-63,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and sentenced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>imprisonment for an effective term of twenty years. The defendant appeals from this judgment. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The jury might reasonably have found the following facts. The defendant was an employee of Phillips Dental Systems in Stamford. On the morning of November 18,1988, he refused to begin his work at the plant unless and until he had been afforded an opportunity to discuss the conditions of his employment and a contemplated pay raise with the company\u2019s personnel manager. Since the personnel manager had not yet arrived at the plant, the defendant was told by the operations manager either to begin working, pending the personnel manager\u2019s arrival, or to go home. Instead, the defendant entered the company\u2019s executive office area. The operations manager followed the defendant. Thereupon, the defendant shot the operations manager, and later beat him with a crowbar. He also shot two other individuals who were in the area. Immediately after these events, the defendant left the company facilities in his own car. He stopped at the Mill River to throw away the gun that he had been using. Driving to the home of a friend, he talked with her for some hours and then voluntarily surrendered to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">At trial, the defense was insanity. Rejecting this defense, the jury found the defendant guilty on three of the four counts with which he had been charged. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motions for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred in two respects, in its instructions to the jury on the issue of insanity and in its denial of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to represent himself. Neither claim is sustainable on the record of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">The defendant asks us to review the trial court\u2019s instructions on insanity even though, at trial, he requested no specific instruction on insanity and failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>to except to the instruction that was given. He concedes that the trial court\u2019s instruction included a charge on insanity that incorporated the definition of insanity set forth in our statute; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 (a);* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but claims that the instruction was erroneous because of its inclusion of extraneous considerations not encompassed within the statutory definition. We have only recently considered the question of whether such a claim is reviewable when it was not properly raised at trial, and we have determined that it is not. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 854, 3063;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>198 Conn. 386, 396-97, 503 A.2d 576 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>198 Conn. 314, 320-21, 502 A.2d 865 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harman, </em>198 Conn. 124, 134, 502 A.2d 381 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>198 Conn. 77, 87, 502 A.2d 388 (1985). The only factor that possibly distinguishes the defendant\u2019s case from these precedents is that he was tried at a time when the burden of proving insanity had been shifted, by statute, to the defendant; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13; Public Acts 1983, No. 83-486, \u00a7 1; whereas previously the state had borne the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>proving a defendant\u2019s sanity. For present purposes, this is a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that he was denied his constitutional right to self-representation equally founders on the lack of a proper foundation in the record. At trial, the defendant repeatedly expressed his dissatisfaction with the representation that he was receiving from his public defender. He asked that this attorney be dismissed and that a special public defender be appointed. He expressed his concern that his public defender was not properly examining prosecution witnesses so as to expose the alleged falsity of their testimony, and complained that the public defender did not want him to testify. In the course of that colloquy with the court, he stated: \u201cI am misrepresented and now I have to represent myself.\u201d A few moments later, after the trial court had asked the defendant to be seated so that the trial could begin, the defendant reiterated, \u201cI\u2019ll have to represent myself.\u201d Although he subsequently reiterated his desire to question a witness, that request was again couched in terms of his request for a different public defender. Thereafter, he raised no further objections to the adequacy of his representation and did avail himself of his right to testify on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">There is no doubt that a defendant has a right under both the state and the federal constitutions<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to represent himself at his criminal trial. <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>Califor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number><em>nia, </em>422 U.S. 806, 819, 95 S.

Va. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In the absence of a clear and unequivocal assertion of the right to self-representation, a trial court has no independent obligation to inquire into the defendant\u2019s interest in representing himself, because the right of self-representation, unlike the right to counsel, is not a critical aspect of a fair trial, but instead affords protection to the defendant\u2019s interest in personal autonomy. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>supra, 300; <em>People </em>v. <em>Salazar, </em>74 Cal. App. 3d 875, 888-89, 141 Cal. Rptr. 753 (1977); <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>94 Ill.

In the exercise of that discretion, the trial court must weigh into the balance its obligation to \u201cindulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver\u201d of the right to counsel. <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 404, 97 S. Ct. 1232, 51 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The record in this case fails to establish a clear and unequivocal invocation of the defendant\u2019s right to represent himself. The record demonstrates, instead, the defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction with appointed counsel\u2019s conduct during the early phases of the trial, and the defendant\u2019s misconception of the normal sequence of the presentation of evidence by the state and the defendant. A trial court, faced with the responsibility of reconciling a defendant\u2019s inherently inconsistent rights to self-representation and to counsel, is entitled to await a definitive assertion of a request to proceed pro se. Any other ruling would permit a defendant on appeal to claim a violation of his rights whether he defended himself or was represented by an attorney. <em>Meeks </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>482 F.2d 465, 467 (9th Cir. 1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>supra, 300. Courts in other jurisdictions have therefore been unwilling to find a clear and unequivocal assertion of the right of self-representation in such ambiguous circumstances. <em>Moreno </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>supra, 175-76; <em>People </em>v. <em>Salazar, </em>supra, 889; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 61; <em>State </em>v. <em>Burgin, </em>supra, 654; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hutchins, </em>supra, 339. The trial court in this case responded to the defendant\u2019s concerns by providing explanations concerning trial procedures and by offering the defendant repeated opportunities for further consultations with counsel. The defendant\u2019s apparent acquiescence in the continuation of the trial with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>appointed counsel demonstrates that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its conduct of the defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-13\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-49. criminal attempt: sufficiency of conduct; RENUNCIATION as defense, (a) A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>mission of the crime he: (1) Intentionally engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; or (2) intentionally does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in the course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-54a. murder defined, affirmative DEFENSES.
