He subsequently was sentenced to a total effective prison term of ten years, suspended after six years and five years probation. He claims on appeal that the trial court erred in allowing a battered women\u2019s counselor to testify as to certain communications between his wife and the counselor because such communications were privileged against disclosure by Public Acts 1983, No. 83-429, subsequently codified as General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also claims that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>trial court erred in refusing to allow into evidence various school records relating to the credibility of one of the state\u2019s witnesses. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On December 18, 1982, the ten year old victim and her mother went to the defendant\u2019s home in Hartford. At the time, the defendant resided with his wife, Nicole Lizotte, and their six year old daughter, Lisa, on the first floor of his three family home. The victim\u2019s mother left the victim with the Lizottes while she visited a friend. That evening, the defendant attended a small party in the basement apartment, rented by Robert and Lynn Willard. During the party, the victim stayed in the Lizottes\u2019 apartment with Lisa Lizotte and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Stephen Willard, Robert Willard\u2019s younger brother. At some point during the evening, the defendant went upstairs and directed the victim to go into his daughter\u2019s bedroom, where he sexually assaulted her. As the assault was taking place, Stephen Willard walked by the bedroom and observed what the defendant was doing to the victim. Later that night, the defendant went into his daughter\u2019s bedroom where the victim was sleeping, removed her from bed, and took her into the kitchen, where he again sexually assaulted her.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Sometime after the first incident in the bedroom, Stephen Willard told his sister-in-law, Lynn Willard, and Nicole Lizotte what he had seen. The next day, the victim\u2019s mother had a conversation with both Lynn Willard and Nicole Lizotte and, upon returning home with the victim, discussed the incident with her. On January 7, 1983, the victim gave a statement to the Hartford police concerning the defendant\u2019s actions on the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of his wife\u2019s caseworker.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At trial, the defendant called his wife to testify as an alibi witness. Nicole Lizotte testified that on December 18, 1982, the defendant was out of the house during the early evening and did not return home until 10 p.m. After his return, according to Nicole Lizotte, they went out to dinner, then to a bar, and did not come back to their apartment until late that night. On cross-examination, Nicole Lizotte testified that she had learned about the victim\u2019s claim approximately one week after the alleged incident and had discussed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>claim only with the victim\u2019s mother and Lynn Willard. She further testified that at one time she had been afraid of her husband and that he had physically beaten her. On redirect examination, however, she stated that as of December 18, 1982, she had been getting along well with the defendant and was no longer afraid of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In its rebuttal case, the state offered the testimony of a counselor at a crisis intervention support unit to impeach Nicole Lizotte\u2019s credibility. Prior to the counselor\u2019s testimony, Nicole Lizotte objected to the introduction of the testimony on the ground that any communications made to the counselor were privileged under G\u00e9neral Statutes \u00a7 52-146k.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On voir dire examination, the counselor stated that she had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Nicole Lizotte\u2019s caseworker from September, 1982, until the date of the trial. She testified that between September, 1982, and January, 1983, Nicole Lizotte had expressed fear that her husband would physically beat her and had inquired about the possibilities of being placed in a shelter. She further testified that at some point between December 25, 1982, and January 4, 1983, Nicole Lizotte had told her about an incident involving the defendant and the victim. The trial court ruled that the statute did not apply to communications made prior to the statute\u2019s effective date, October 1, 1983, and because the statements were made prior to this date, allowed the counselor to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The defendant claims that \u00a7 52-146k was applicable at the time of the trial and that the trial court should have refused to allow the counselor to testify. Section 52-146k (b) provides in part that \u201c[a] battered women\u2019s counselor or a sexual assault counselor shall not disclose any confidential communications made to such counselor by a victim in any civil or criminal case or proceeding or in any legislative or administrative proceeding unless the victim making the confidential communications waives the privilege . . . .\u201d The defendant reasons that because \u00a7 52-146k (b) prohibits a battered women\u2019s counselor from disclosing communications, the critical time for determining the applicability of the statute is when the communications are sought to be disclosed, not when the communications are originally made. Because the communications made by Nicole Lizotte were sought to be disclosed at trial, on November 18,1983, the defendant claims the statute was applicable, and thus should have prevented the counselor from testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">We cannot agree with the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 52-146k (b) that the legislative intent was to prohibit the disclosure of protected communications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>regardless of when they were made. The legislature, in enacting \u00a7 52-146k, sought to create a privilege, and in so doing, focused on the communications themselves, not when they were sought to be disclosed. Prior to the statute, communications between a battered women\u2019s counselor and a victim were not privileged. As we stated in <em>In re Robert H., </em>199 Conn. 693, 703, 509 A.2d 475 (1986), \u201c[t]he obvious intent and dominant purpose of this statute is to grant a privilege to confidential communications between a sexual assault counselor or a battered women\u2019s counselor and a victim.\u201d A close examination of the legislative history supports this view of the statute\u2019s purpose. In the House debate over the enactment of \u00a7 52-146k, Representative Pauline Kezer stated that \u201cthis bill <em>extends the privilege </em>that now exists to psychiatrists, clergy, to very narrowly defined counselors who work in battered [women\u2019s] shelters and rape crisis centers .... [T]he bill has been carefully enough drafted, and tightly enough drawn so that we are <em>extending a privilege.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 26 H. R. Proc., Pt. 15, 1983 Sess., pp. 5284-85. If the focus of the statute is on the underlying communications and not, as the defendant contends, on the ultimate disclosure of the communications, then the statute only protects communications made after its effective date, October 1, 1983. To exclude communications made prior to this date, would be, in effect, to apply the statute retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 55-3 states: \u201cNo provision of the general statutes, not previously contained in the statutes of the state, which imposes any new obligation on any person or corporation, shall be construed to have a retrospective effect.\u201d While we have noted the continued vitality and utility of the principle that procedural statutes will be applied retroactively absent contrary legislative intent; <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>189 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>346, 351, 456 A.2d 305 (1983); we consistently have expressed reluctance to construe statutes retroactively where the statutes affect substantial changes in the law, unless the legislative intent clearly and unequivocally appears otherwise. <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 350-51; <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>177 Conn. 327, 331, 416 A.2d 1201 (1979); <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Brown Co., </em>174 Conn. 219, 222-23, 384 A.2d 378 (1978); <em>East Village Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>173 Conn. 328, 332, 377 A.2d 1092 (1977); <em>State ex rel. Rundbaken </em>v. <em>Watrous, </em>135 Conn. 638, 648, 68 A.2d 289 (1949). \u201cThe test of whether a statute is to apply retroactively, absent an express legislative intent, \u2018is not a purely mechanical one\u2019 and even if it is a procedural statute, which ordinarily will be applied retroactively without a legislative imperative to the contrary, \u2018it will not be applied retroactively if considerations of good sense and justice dictate that it not be so applied. \u2019 . . . <em>Carvette </em>v. <em>Marion Power Shovel Co., </em>157 Conn. 92, 96, 249 A.2d 58 [1968].\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Americal Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Brown Co., </em>supra, 223. In <em>Sherry H. </em>v. <em>Probate Court, </em>177 Conn. 93, 411 A.2d 931 (1979), this court considered whether a statute that forbids the release of information about a genetic parent without that parent\u2019s consent applied retroactively to an action in which an adopted person sought the identity of her genetic mother. We reasoned that when a statute effected \u201ca substantial change in the law\u201d and created a completely different scheme, the rule precluding retroactive application applies, even if the statute is characterized as \u201cmerely procedural.\u201d Id., 101-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">In this case, as in <em>Sherry H. </em>v. <em>Probate Court, </em>supra, the legislature has effected a substantial change in the law by establishing a privilege as to communications between a battered women\u2019s counselor and a victim. Absent clear and unequivocal legislative intent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>\u00a7 52-146k should not be applied retroactively.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nowhere in the statute is there mention that the privilege extends to communications made prior to the effective date of the statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 353. Moreover, an examination of the legislative history does not reveal any intent that the statute have.retroactive effect. We, therefore, will not apply this statute retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In the present case, communications between Nicole Lizotte and her counselor were made between September, 1982, and January, 1983. General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k, however, did not become effective until October 1,1983. Because these communications made prior to the statute\u2019s effective date were not privileged, and because the statute does not apply retroactively to encompass them, we hold that the trial court did not err in permitting the counselor to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in refusing to allow into evidence certain school records of Stephen Willard. At trial, the state called Willard as a witness to testify on what he had observed on December 18,1982. In an attempt to impeach his credibility, the defendant subpoenaed Willard\u2019s school records and offered into evidence four documents relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742A\">*742A</page-number>to his school performance. After examining these documents, the trial court ruled that three of the documents had little probative value and were cumulative, and refused to admit them into evidence. The trial court, however, allowed one document, with the exception of its last sentence, into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Our rules of practice make it clear that counsel must object to a ruling of evidence, state the grounds upon which objection is made, and take exception to the ruling to preserve the grounds for appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 288. These requirements are not simply formalities. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>199 Conn. 453, 461, 508 A.2d 11 (1986). We consistently have stated that we will not consider evidentiary rulings where counsel did not properly preserve a claim of error by objection and exception. <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>191 Conn. 670, 684, 469 A.2d 760 (1983), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoffler, </em>174 Conn. 452, 461, 389 A.2d 1257 (1978); <em>see State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In examining the record, we find that after the trial court made its ruling as to the admissibility of the documents, the defendant did not take exception. Because of this failure to comply with the rules of practice, the defendant did not properly preserve his claim for appeal; nor has he asserted that the claim is reviewable under <em>Evans. </em>Therefore, we decline to address the merits of the claim. Practice Book \u00a7 3063;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> see <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>186 Conn. 654, 672, 443 A.2d 906 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-5\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-146k. privileged communications BETWEEN BATTERED WOMEN\u2019S OR SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELOR AND VICTIM.

Because we find that the privilege does not extend to the communications in this case, we do not address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b750-6\"> We recognize that subsequent to the trial court\u2019s decision, the legislature enacted Public Acts 1985, No. 85-112, effective October 1,1985, amending General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k. Public Acts 1985, No. 85-112, states in part that \u201cON OR AFTER OCTOBER 1,1983, A battered women\u2019s counselor or a sexual assault counselor shall not disclose any confidential communications made to such counselor AT ANY TIME by a victim in any civil or criminal case . . . . ANY REQUEST MADE ON OR AFTER OCTOBER 1,1983, BY THE DEFENDANT OR STATE FOR SUCH CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS-OF THIS SUBSECTION.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Although it is possible for the legislature to enact retroactive legislation affecting a trial court\u2019s judgment, provided an appeal to a higher court is pending; <em>Enfield Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Bissell, </em>184 Conn. 569, 572-73, 440 A.2d 220 (1981); we have consistently held that where the enactment effects substantive, rather than procedural changes, the trial court\u2019s decision is final, notwithstanding the amendment. <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 301, 309-10, 472 A.2d 316 (1984); <em>Schenck </em>v. <em>Pelkey, </em>176 Conn. 245, 251, 405 A.2d 665 (1978); cf. <em>Enfield Federal Savings &amp; Loan </em>Assn. v. <em>Bissell, </em>supra, 573 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Public Acts 1985, No. 85-112, substantially expanded the battered women\u2019s counselor/sexual assault counselor-client privilege to apply-to all communications between a counselor and a client whenever made. In enacting Public Acts 1985, No. 85-112, the legislature effected a substantive, rather than procedural, change in the law. The amendment thus does not affect the trial court\u2019s ruling and we apply the law as it was in existence at the time the trial court made its determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b754-8\"> We recognize that some jurisdictions have considered privileged communication statutes to be procedural rules of evidence and have applied them retroactively. See <em>Rom </em>v. <em>Calhoun, </em>227 Minn. 143, 145-46, 34 N.W.2d 359 (1948); <em>Mattison </em>v. <em>Poulen, </em>134 Vt. 158, 160-61, 353 A.2d 327 (1976); cf. <em>State ex rel.

Other jurisdictions have held that statutes relating to privileged communications affect the substantive rights of the parties and have not applied them retroactively. See <em>Davison </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>75 Wis. 2d 190, 200, 248 N.W.2d 433 (1977); cf. <em>Woelfling v. Great-West Life Assurance Co., </em>30 Ohio App. 2d 211, 220, 285 N.E.2d 61 (1972).
