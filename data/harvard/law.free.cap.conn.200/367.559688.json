J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajq\">The sole issue on this appeal is a determination of the scope of the indemnification provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 7-101a. The plaintiff, the city of Norwich, brought suit against the defendants, Richard N. Ziff and Guerson D. Silverberg, for legal malpractice. Ziff was corporation counsel to the plaintiff and Silverberg was assistant corporation counsel. In its malpractice action, the plaintiff complained that the defendants had provided inadequate representation in litigation involving a disputed tax assessment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each defendant answered by denying the plaintiffs allegations and by filing a counterclaim demanding reimbursement from the plaintiff under General Statutes \u00a7 7-101a<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for any amount that the court might order the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>defendants to pay as well as for all expenses incurred by the defendants as a result of the suit. The trial court granted the plaintiffs motions to strike these counterclaims. The defendants appeal from the judgments thereafter rendered against them on the counterclaims.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 7-101a (a) requires a municipality to \u201cprotect and save harmless any municipal officer, whether elected or appointed, of any board, committee, council, agency or commission, or any full-time municipal employee, of such municipality from financial loss and expense, including legal fees and costs, if any, arising out of any claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of alleged negligence, or for alleged infringement of any person\u2019s civil rights, on the part of such officer or such employee while acting in the discharge of his duties.\u201d The trial court, in striking the defendants\u2019 counterclaims, held that this statute requires the municipality to indemnify officers and employees only when they are sued by third parties and not when the municipality itself is the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court erred in its judgment because \u00a7 7-101a, by its plain lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>guage, applies to \u201cany claim, demand, suit or judgment.\u201d They urge us to hold that, in cases where a municipality sues its officials for negligence, the municipality must indemnify the officials for the amount it recovers as well as for costs to the officials that arise as a result of the action. In their view, \u00a7 7-101a effectively immunizes municipal officers and employees from any liability to their municipality for negligence. We find no error in the ruling of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">We note preliminarily the procedural framework that governs our inquiry on this appeal. \u201cIt is well settled that \u2018[wjhere an appeal is taken from a judgment following the granting of a motion to strike, we take the facts to be those alleged in the [appellant\u2019s pleadings] construed in a manner most favorable to the pleader. <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 471, 472, 427 A.2d 385 [1980]; <em>Stradmore Development Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>164 Conn. 548, 550-51, 324 A.2d 919 [1973]; <em>Senior </em>v. <em>Hope, </em>156 Conn. 92, 97, 239 A.2d 486 [1968]; <em>Rossignol </em>v. <em>Danbury School of Aeronautics, Inc., </em>154 Conn. 549, 557, 227 A.2d 418 [1967]. For purposes of appeal, all well-pleaded facts and those facts necessarily implied from the allegations are taken as admitted. <em>DeMello </em>v. <em>Plainville, </em>170 Conn. 675, 677, 368 A.2d 71 [1976]; <em>McAnerney </em>v. <em>McAnerney, </em>165 Conn. 277, 282, 334 A.2d 437 [1973]. See Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 151.\u2019 <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>182 Conn. 80, 82-83, 438 A.2d 6 (1980).\u201d <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>199 Conn. 651, 655, 509 A.2d 11 (1986). Accordingly, in this case, we must assume that the defendants were, as they have alleged, municipal officers who qualified for whatever protection \u00a7 7-101a provides. The only question before us is whether that statute affords indemnity to municipal officers whom the municipality itself sues for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Well-established principles of statutory construction govern our analysis of \u00a7 7-101a. Our objective is to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>strue the language of the section so as to give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 673, 509 A.2d 20 (1986); <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 57, 480 A.2d 425 (1984); 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 45.05. In our pursuit of that objective, we look to the language of the statute itself, its legislative history, and previous judicial construction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 673-74; <em>DeFonce Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>State, </em>198 Conn. 185, 187, 501 A.2d 745 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 161, 496 A.2d 186 (1985). Mindful of inherent statutory interrelationships, furthermore, we endeavor \u201cto read the statute as a whole and so as to reconcile all parts as far as possible.\u201d Gro<em>dis </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>190 Conn. 39, 44, 459 A.2d 994 (1983); see also <em>P. X. Restaurant, Inc. </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>189 Conn. 153, 159-60, 454 A.2d 1258 (1983); <em>Connecticut Theatre Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>179 Conn. 672, 677, 427 A.2d 863 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The defendants\u2019 argument that they may rely on \u00a7 7-101a for immunity from liability to their municipal employers depends primarily on the language of subsection (a) of \u00a7 7-101a. They point out that this subsection purports to govern \u201cany\u201d claim of negligence and therefore argue that this unqualified coverage conclusively establishes a legislative intent that \u00a7 7-101a apply to two-party as well as to three-party indemnity claims. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Read as a whole, \u00a7 7-101a refutes a construction affording the defendants the immunity they seek, because the section demonstrates, in its remaining subsections, that the transactions that the legislature sought to address were transactions in which an injured third person was seeking relief from a municipal employee and, indirectly, from a municipality itself. None of these subsections contemplates reimbursement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>for a municipal employee who has negligently failed to discharge his duties to his municipal employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Subsection (c) is instructive to a reading of \u201cany claim\u201d that excludes the municipality itself, because this subsection authorizes municipalities to purchase insurance to cover \u201cthe liability imposed by this section.\u201d Liability insurance is designed to protect an insured from claims for damages owed to a third person, and not from losses that the insured suffers directly. <em>Cain </em>v. <em>American Policyholders\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>120 Conn. 645, 653, 183 A. 403 (1936); see <em>Alcorn Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guarantee Co., </em>705 F.2d 128 (5th Cir. 1983); Keeton, Insurance Law (1971) \u00a7 4.8. The fact that subsection (c) speaks only to liability insurance implies that the legislature did not contemplate a need for a municipality to insure against its own losses to deal with the risk assigned to it by subsection (a). Although broader municipal insurance might well be available to provide a more extended all-risk coverage, the legislature was clearly of the view that \u201cthis section\u201d required municipalities only to \u201cinsure against . . . liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Even more definitively, subsection (d) imposes procedural preconditions on municipal liability that are entirely inconsistent with the defendants\u2019 expansive interpretation of subsection (a). No municipality need indemnify a municipal officer for his losses unless the prospective claimant (1) notifies the municipality of his intention to bring suit against the municipality\u2019s officer within six months of the accrual of the cause of action, and (2) initiates suit within two years after the accrual date. Failure to comply with these procedural prerequisites affects only the right to indemnification; it does not impair a claimant\u2019s cause of action against the defendant officer himself. See <em>Orticelli </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>197 Conn. 9, 13-14, 495 A.2d 1023 (1985); see also <em>Wakelee </em>v. <em>DeSanto, </em>152 Conn. 44, 202 A.2d 833 (1964). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>The application of \u00a7 7-101a to suits brought by municipalities would result in the anomaly of requiring municipalities to notify themselves of their intention to commence suit against their own officers. The municipality could avoid the obligation to indemnify by simply failing to file notice with itself within six months or neglecting to bring suit within two years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We cannot conclude that the legislature intended \u00a7 7-101a to operate in this way. Read as a whole, \u00a7 7-101a does not apply to actions brought by municipalities against their officers or employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">There are no previous judicial constructions of \u00a7 7-101a that point in a different direction, nor is there any illuminating legislative history to lend support to the defendants\u2019 argument that the statute was intended to shield municipal officers from liability to their own municipalities. The defendants note that a remark by Representative Kevin P. Johnston during a 1977 House debate demonstrates his belief that \u00a7 7-101a applies to suits brought by municipalities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6It was, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>ever, a 1971 enactment that provided the language of \u00a7 7-101a (a) which the defendants claim requires indemnification when the municipality is the claimant. Representative Johnston, who was not in the legislature in 1971, made his statement six years later in support of an amendment to \u00a7 7-101a that, when enacted, left this language intact and did not involve the issue of whether the statute should apply when municipalities sue their employees and officers. The remark therefore lacks authority as a guide to our interpretation of \u00a7 7-101a on this question. <em>Grodis </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 46-47; see also <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 63, 392 A.2d 491 (1978); <em>Norwalk </em>v. <em>Daniele, </em>143 Conn. 85, 89, 119 A.2d 732 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Our construction of \u00a7 7-101a comports with the apparent purpose behind its enactment. The statute is designed to furnish some relief for injustice that would otherwise attend our well-established doctrine of sovereign municipal immunity. See, e.g., <em>Gauvin </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>187 Conn. 180, 184, 445 A.2d 1 (1982); <em>Tango </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>173 Conn. 203, 204-205, 377 A.2d 284 (1977). Absent such a statute, claimants injured by the misconduct of municipal officers and employees acting in the course of their official duties would be limited to recourse against individual tortfeasors. The legislature might reasonably have concluded that such limited recourse would be unfair both to the injured claimant and to the municipal officer or employee. From the point of view of the claimant, he would be confronted with a defendant who might well lack the resources to provide adequate compensation for the claimant\u2019s injuries. From the point of view of the municipal officer or employee, he would be required to shoulder ultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>liability, as well as the costs of defense, for conduct that was solely beneficial to his municipal employer. To remedy these distortions that the law of sovereign immunity would otherwise impose upon the fair allocation of the risks of accident and other tortious misconduct, the legislature provided for statutory indemnification by municipalities to relieve individual municipal employees and officers of personal liability for injuries they cause, or are alleged to have caused, to third parties on behalf of their municipalities. In effect, the legislature has created a statutory analogue for the common law doctrine of respondeat superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The salutary purpose that \u00a7 7-10 la was designed to serve does not require its extension to suits brought by municipalities against their officers. Respondeat superior has never precluded an employer from recovery against an employee whose misconduct directly injures the employer. See 2 Restatement (Second), Agency \u00a7 402. It is true that the legislature might have determined that the need to attract citizens to public service required it to go beyond respondeat superior and to provide for municipal officers and employees total immunity from liability for actions in negligence brought by their municipal employers. In our view, however, if that had been the legislature\u2019s intention, it would have been manifested by a straight-forward immunity statute rather than by the round-about system of indemnification that the defendants ask us to read into \u00a7 7-101a. We will not infer such an intention without a clearer indication of purpose than \u00a7 7-101a, read as a whole, presently expresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The trial court correctly held that \u00a7 7-101a applies only to suits brought by third party plaintiffs. Consequently, the court did not err in granting the plaintiff\u2019s motions to strike the defendants\u2019 counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-6\"> Appeals involving this underlying controversy have twice come before this court. <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>200 Conn. 697, 513 A.2d 77 (1986); <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>193 Conn. 342, 477 A.2d 115 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 7-101a. protection of municipal officers AND FULL-TIME MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES FROM DAMAGE SUITS.
