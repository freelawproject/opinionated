J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKu\">The principal issue on this appeal is whether the trial court\u2019s finding of probable cause that the defendant had committed the crime with which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>was charged, made at a preliminary hearing mandated by article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution as amended,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is reviewable on appeal after the defendant\u2019s subsequent conviction. The defendant, Jerry Mitchell, was convicted of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and sentenced to imprisonment for forty years. He appeals from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. During the early morning hours of June 24,1983, the victim, a thirty-four year old male, approached the defendant and three associates as they stood outside of a bar in Bridgeport. He asked them to help him locate a woman who had allegedly stolen his wallet. The four men agreed, but, when the victim went to get his car, they made plans to rob him. Subsequently, they accompanied the victim to another section of Bridgeport, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>where they beat and stabbed him to death. Following the attack, the four men fled the scene in the victim\u2019s car. They later removed the tires from the car, sold them and split the proceeds. Two days afterward, the defendant was arrested and charged with felony murder in connection with this incident. A probable cause hearing was held on August 4, 1983, pursuant to article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution as amended and General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a. Following a finding by the trial court, <em>Callahan, J., </em>that the state had established probable cause to believe that the defendant had committed the offense of felony murder, the defendant was arraigned and bound over for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">On appeal from the judgment against him, the defendant raises two claims of error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He claims that the trial court should have dismissed the charge against him because: (1) the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing was insufficient to support the finding of probable cause; and (2) General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a (b), by prohibiting discovery motions at preliminary hearings, deprived him of his constitutional rights to due process and to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him, and therefore vitiated the finding of probable cause. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim requires us to make a threshold determination of whether the trial court\u2019s finding of probable cause made at the preliminary hearing is reviewable on appeal after the defendant\u2019s conviction. This is a question of first impression, requiring us to interpret the new constitutional right to a probable cause hearing that became part of our state con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>stitution in November, 1982. Only if we decide this initial question in the affirmative need we address the defendant\u2019s substantive claim that the evidence presented at the hearing was insufficient to establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The state contends that a finding of probable cause at a preliminary hearing should not be reviewable following conviction after trial. It argues that the probable cause hearing created by amendment to article first, \u00a7 8, of the state constitution was devised as a substitute for the simultaneously abolished indicting grand jury system. Reasoning by analogy from the well established rule barring review of the adequacy and competency of the evidence submitted to a grand jury to support an indictment, the state maintains that we should similarly foreclose review of the adequacy and competency of the evidence submitted at a probable cause hearing. In order to determine the validity of this syllogism, it is necessary for us to review briefly the genesis of the newly established probable cause hearing system and the purpose behind its creation.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Prior to November, 1982, the Connecticut constitution required a grand jury indictment as a prerequisite to the prosecution of anyone charged with a crime punishable by death or life imprisonment. This right to a grand jury determination of probable cause had its origin in our early statutory and common law and became part of our constitutional rights when the first state constitution was adopted in 1818. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanabria, </em>192 Conn. 671, 674, 474 A.2d 760 (1984); Nahum &amp; Schatz, \u201cThe Grand Jury in Connecticut,\u201d 5 Conn. B.J. Ill, 111-21 (1931). Although originally conceived as a shielding device to protect individuals from unfounded prosecutions; <em>State </em>v. <em>Menillo, </em>159 Conn. 264, 275, 268 A.2d 667 (1970); the grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>system came to be widely criticized for its secret operation and its ex parte nature. See Spinella, Conn. Crim. Proc. (1985) pp. 272-73; Berdon, \u201cConnecticut Grand Juries: The Case for Reform,\u201d 54 Conn. B.J. 8, 9-16 (1980); Goldstein, \u201cThe State and the Accused: Balance of Advantage in Criminal Procedure,\u201d 69 Yale L.J. 1165,1171 (1960). In Connecticut, an accused was generally permitted to attend the grand jury session and to question witnesses, but he was not permitted to have his attorney present or to present evidence in his own behalf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 552-57, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>188 Conn. 626, 631-33, 453 A.2d 418 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 928, 103 S. Ct. 2088, 77 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Menillo, </em>supra, 274. In addition, in order to preserve the traditional secrecy of grand jury proceedings, the use of the transcript of the session itself was carefully limited by statute;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra, 554-55; <em>State </em>v. <em>Canady, </em>187 Conn. 281, 286-87, 445 A.2d 895 (1982); and this legislative proscription was strictly construed by this court. <em>In re Final Grand Jury Report Concerning the Torrington Police Department, </em>197 Conn. 698, 708-709, 501 A.2d 377 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Canady, </em>supra, 287. The statutory interdiction of access to the grand jury transcript meant that a person against whom an indictment had been returned was effectively precluded from obtaining a judicial review of the evidentiary basis for his indictment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vinal, </em>198 Conn. 644, 656, 504 A.2d 1364 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>197 Conn. 507, 519, 498 A.2d 76 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra, 555; <em>State </em>v. <em>Canady, </em>supra, 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In an attempt to correct these perceived inequities of the grand jury system and to provide expanded protections to an accused charged with a serious crime; see 24 H. R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1981 Sess., pp. 3148-50, remarks of Rep. Alfred J. Onorato; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2,1981 Sess., pp. 369-70, remarks of Rep. Richard D. Tulisano;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the legislature in 1981 proposed a constitutional amendment to abolish the grand jury indictment system in Connecticut and to replace it with an open and adver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>sarial probable cause hearing. See Substitute House Joint Resolution No. 36 (1981). This proposed amendment was approved by the electorate on November 2, 1982, and certified by the secretary of state on November 24,1982, as amendment seventeen to the Connecticut constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanabria, </em>supra, 676-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Amendment seventeen to article first, \u00a7 8, coupled with implementing legislation effective May 26,1983; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> has created expansive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>new rights for an accused charged with a serious crime.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In order to provide such an individual with greater protections than he was afforded under the former grand jury system; see 26 S. Proc., Pt. 4,1983 Sess., pp. 1413-14, remarks of Sen. Howard T. Owens; 26 H. R. Proc., Pt. 8,1983 Sess., pp. 2945-46, remarks of Rep. Alfred J. Onorato; 26 H. R. Proc., Pt. 10,1983 Sess., p. 3783, remarks of Rep. Alfred J. Onorato;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> this new provision guarantees that no one will be forced to stand trial for a serious crime unless a court has first made a finding of probable cause at an open hearing in which the accused is provided with a full panoply of adversarial rights. A judicial determination of probable cause has thus been made a constitutional prerequisite to the court\u2019s subsequent jurisdiction to hear the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>The defendant claims that, in order to give meaning to this new constitutional safeguard, he must be afforded an opportunity to challenge on appeal the jurisdictional underpinnings of his conviction. Without such an opportunity for appellate review, he argues, the expanded protection envisioned by the adoption of amendment seventeen is but a hollow shell. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Appellate review of the adequacy of a constitutionally mandated determination of probable cause is required to give effect to the legislative history of amendment seventeen to article first, \u00a7 8. That history unequivocally manifests the intent of the legislature to adopt the preliminary probable cause hearing system as a constitutional safeguard to afford greater protection of an accused\u2019s rights than the grand jury system had provided. Displacement of the indicting grand jury displaces the rationale behind our historical refusal to review grand jury proceedings. There is no further need to preserve the secrecy of the indictment process when a probable cause hearing is now conducted in public.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We believe that appellate review of the determination of probable cause is essential to fulfilling the purpose of amendment seventeen.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The state argues, however, that such a reading of article first, \u00a7 8, as amended is in direct conflict with our recent holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 502 A.2d 886 (1986). In that case, we held that an illegal arrest, without more, \u201cimpose[d] no jurisdictional barrier to a defendant\u2019s subsequent prosecution\u201d nor did it require \u201ca voiding of the resulting conviction.\u201d Id., 263. The state asks us to extend the principle underlying <em>Fleming </em>and to hold that all defects in pretrial procedures are cured by a subsequent conviction after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>trial and are therefore not reviewable on appeal. We believe, however, that a contrary conclusion is mandated by the significant constitutional differences between an illegal arrest and an invalid finding of probable cause at a constitutionally required preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Unlike the adversarial probable cause hearing, an arrest is neither an integral part nor a critical stage of a judicial proceeding. <em>State </em>v. Carr, 172 Conn. 458, 472, 374 A.2d 1107 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>99 Idaho 694, 697, 587 P.2d 635 (1978); see <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>406 U.S. 682, 688-89, 92 S. Ct. 1877, 32 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1972). An arrest is simply a device which \u201cserves to insure the presence of the accused at the proceedings which name him as a violator and to insure his presence afterward to accept the judgment of the court if he is found guilty.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 697. Consequently, any irregularities in the arrest procedure do not affect the subsequent jurisdiction of the court to hear the case. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews, </em>445 U.S. 463, 474, 100 S. Ct. 1244, 63 L. Ed. 2d 537 (1980); <em>Frisbie </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>342 U.S. 519, 522, 72 S. Ct. 509, 96 L. Ed. 541 (1952); <em>Ker </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>119 U.S. 436, 440, 7 S. Ct. 225, 30 L. Ed. 421 (1886); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>supra, 262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The adversarial probable cause hearing at issue here, on the other hand, is a critical stage in the prosecution; <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>399 U.S. 1, 7, 9-10, 90 S. Ct. 1999, 26 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1970); and, under the express terms of article first, \u00a7 8, of our state constitution as amended, is a jurisdictional prerequisite to continuing prosecution. Accordingly, an invalid finding of probable cause at such a hearing undermines the court\u2019s power to hear the case at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">In addition, we note that an individual who has been illegally arrested has civil redress in the nature of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>common law tort action or an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Malley </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 335, 343-44, 106 S. Ct. 1092, 89 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1986). There is no equivalent civil remedy for an invalid finding of probable cause at a preliminary hearing. Absent appellate review of the probable cause determination, therefore, there would be no recourse whatsoever for even the most blatant violation of this clear constitutional right. We agree with Justice Thurgood Marshall of the United States Supreme Court that <em>\u201ca </em>right without an effective remedy has little meaning.\u201d <em>Guardians Assn. </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, New York City, </em>463 U.S. 582, 626, 103 S. Ct. 3221, 77 L. Ed. 2d 866 (1983) (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In arguing for a contrary conclusion, the state refers us to several cases from other jurisdictions in which courts have refused to review after conviction the validity of a pretrial finding of probable cause. Most of these cases are inapposite because they concern defects in the arrest procedure rather than defects in probable cause hearings. See <em>Yellen </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>680 P.2d 234 (Colo. 1984); <em>Ramirez </em>v. <em>State, </em>455 N.E.2d 609 (Ind. App. 1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>422 So. 2d 109 (La. 1982); <em>In re Harris, </em>38 Wash. App. 684, 689 P.2d 95 (1984). One cited case which appears at first glance to be on point is <em>United States </em>v. <em>Millican, </em>600 F.2d 273, 277-78 (5th Cir. 1979), in which the Fifth Circuit held that the total failure to hold a probable cause hearing prior to trial, although improper, did not vitiate the defendant\u2019s subsequent conviction. Id., 278. The state\u2019s reliance on this case, however, is misplaced. Unlike the present defendant, the defendant in <em>MiUican </em>had no constitutional right to a probable cause hearing as a prelude to further proceedings. Id. 276; see <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 119-20, 95 S. Ct. 854, 43 L. Ed. 2d 54 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>(1975).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Connecticut constitution, on the other hand, not only specifically guarantees this right to persons charged with serious crimes, it also makes such a hearing a jurisdictional prerequisite to continuing prosecution. The state has cited us to no jurisdiction, nor has our research discovered any, in which an accused enjoys the identical constitutional protection afforded by article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution as amended.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is the unique nature of this express constitutional guarantee, coupled with the legislative history indicating an intent thereby to increase the protection afforded to criminal defendants, that impels us to the conclusion that appellate review of the finding of probable cause is warranted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, we will review the evidence presented at the defendant\u2019s preliminary hearing to determine if it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>sufficient to establish probable cause to continue his prosecution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The defendant claims that the evidence presented by the state was insufficient to establish probable cause that he committed the crime of felony murder. The defendant concedes that there was sufficient evidence to establish that he was present during the assault and robbery of the victim. He argues, however, that there was no evidence to support a finding that he actually participated in the crime. At the conclusion of the probable cause hearing, and again prior to trial, the defendant moved to dismiss the charge oh this ground. Both motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">In order to decide the defendant\u2019s claim, we must examine the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing to determine whether it was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding of probable cause. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>188 Conn. 574, 580, 452 A.2d 634 (1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1089, 103 S. Ct. 1785, 76 L. Ed. 2d 354 (1983). The testimony of six witnesses at the hearing established that, several days after the murder in question, the defendant had given a statement to the police in which he admitted that he had accompanied three men when they robbed, beat and stabbed the victim. Following this assault, he fled the scene with the three participants in the victim\u2019s car, and was seen several hours later in the company of one of the attackers. The other three men each gave a statement to the police in which each admitted joining in either the attack or the robbery of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The defendant claims that, because there was no direct evidence that he had actually participated in the crime, the trial court\u2019s finding of probable cause was erroneous. We disagree. The quantum of evidence necessary to establish probable cause at a preliminary hearing is less than the quantum necessary to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt at trial, as the defendant concedes. <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>237 Kan. 146, 148, 697 P.2d 1305 (1985); <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843, 850, 298 N.E.2d 819 (1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>121 Wis. 2d 389, 396, 359 N.W.2d 151 (1984). In making its finding, the court had to \u201cdetermine whether the government\u2019s evidence would warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that the accused [had] committed the crime.\u201d Arenella, \u201cReforming the Federal Grand Jury and the State Preliminary Hearing to Prevent Conviction Without Adjudication,\u201d 78 Mich. L. Rev. 463, 478 (1980); <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 175-76, 69 S. Ct. 1302, 93 L. Ed. 1879 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Using this standard, we are convinced that the trial court correctly found that probable cause had been established. Under the felony murder statute with which the defendant was charged, it was not necessary for the state to establish that the defendant had personally joined in the attack on the victim. It was sufficient to establish that he had committed the underlying felony of robbery, either as a principal or as an accessory, and that the victim had been killed as a result. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>supra, 268 n.15. The evidence before the court showed that the defendant had admitted being in the company of three participants at the time the crime was committed, and that he had further admitted fleeing the scene with them in the victim\u2019s car. In addition, he was seen with one of the participants several hours later. Although the defendant stopped short of implicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>himself in the actual commission of the crime, it was reasonable for the trial court to draw the inference that he would not have fled with the assailants and remained in their company unless he was also involved. We find, therefore, that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In his second claim of error, the defendant labels unconstitutional that portion of \u00a7 54-46a (b) which prohibits discovery motions at probable cause hearings. The defendant makes no claim that he is constitutionally entitled to the broad range of discovery materials permitted by statute to a criminal defendant at trial. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-86a and 54-86b. He argues, however, that by barring discovery motions altogether, \u00a7 54-46a (b) prevents disclosure of even exculpatory information within the control of the prosecution, thereby impairing his constitutional rights to due process and to cross-examine witnesses effectively.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> At the start of the probable cause hearing, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>moved to dismiss the charge on the basis of the alleged unconstitutionality of \u00a7 54-46a (b). This motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">We conclude that \u00a7 54-46a (b) is constitutional when read in conjunction with the prosecution\u2019s on-going constitutional duty to disclose exculpatory material to a criminal defendant independent of a defense motion or request. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 106-107, 96 S. Ct. 2392,49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976); <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>195 Conn. 444, 455, 488 A.2d 212, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 833, 106 S. Ct. 103, 88 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 397, 429 A.2d 919 (1980). The state has conceded that this constitutional obligation applies to the preliminary hearing stage of prosecutions, including hearings to determine probable cause, and we agree. Only recently, we noted that \u201c[t]he unmistakable tone of <em>Brady </em>is that evidence required to be disclosed must be disclosed at a time when it can be used.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>199 Conn. 399, 414, 501 A.2d 8 (1986); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra, 557. Since the adversarial probable cause hearing at issue here is an essential part of a defendant\u2019s criminal prosecution, the constitutional obligation to disclose exculpatory material attaches at that time. Consequently, \u00a7 54-46a (b)\u2019s ban on defense discovery motions did not impair the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The defendant makes no claim that the prosecution failed to disclose any exculpatory material at his prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>able cause hearing. On the contrary, we note that the state turned the defendant\u2019s statement to police over to the defense during that hearing, and that defense counsel subsequently used the statement in his cross-examination of a police witness.

What that means is that the State\u2019s Attorney has to call for a Grand Jury consisting of some 18 people. The 18 people then meet in the Superior Court and prepare to hear evidence on whether or not there are [evidentiary] matters to hand down an indictment. The only ones that can testify, and by the way the Grand Jury can\u2019t ask questions at this proceeding, the only ones that can testify are obviously the state\u2019s witnesses. No one else is allowed to testify. Most Grand Juries can be done without a State\u2019s Attorney or without a Judge. So you have some inspector in there with the state\u2019s witnesses going through the process, and inevitably you have an indictment that is handed down.\u201d 24 H. R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1981 Sess., p. 3148.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\u201cThis particular [probable cause hearing] process would protect those accused from arbitrary or unjustified use of the Grand Jury.

Tulisano made the following observation: \u201c[T]he Grand Jury is not what it used to be, or intended to be at the time of the Magna Carta, I guess. So that if we substituted in the Grand Jury constitutionally, a preliminary hearing type system ... it would take the place of what the original purpose of the Grand Jury must have been, and it would insure that they got them in the most serious offenses.\u201d Conn.

Ed. 2d 54 (1975), a criminal defendant possesses a constitutional right to a judicial determination of probable cause to arrest, either in the issuance of an arrest warrant or in an ex parte proceeding shortly after arrest. There is, however, no federal constitutional right to an adversarial probable cause hearing as a prerequisite to prosecution. Id., 120.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\"> Several states provide for <em>either </em>a grand jury indictment <em>or </em>a preliminary hearing to establish probable cause. See, e.g., Idaho Const., art. I \u00a7 8; N.M. Const., art. II \u00a7 14; Or. Const., art. VII \u00a7 5; Utah Const., art. I \u00a7 13. Of these states, apparently only Idaho refuses to review the preliminary hearing\u2019s finding of probable cause on appeal after conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>104 Idaho 493, 500, 660 P.2d 1336 (1983); <em>Mascarenas </em>v. <em>State, </em>80 N.M. 537, 538-540, 458 P.2d 789 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>291 Or. 231, 234-35, 630 P.2d 810 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>612 P.2d 778, 781-82, 787 (Utah 1980).

Antecedent to a finding of harmless error is a <em>review </em>of the claim of error at issue. The concurring opinion\u2019s approach would bar review of the finding of probable cause altogether. Such an extension of the harmless error doctrine is unwarranted in the face of the clear expression of intent by the people of this state to create a specific new constitutional protection for those charged with serious crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b347-9\"> Although the defendant raised at oral argument the question of interlocutory review of the determination of probable cause, this issue was not raised either before the trial court or in the defendant\u2019s brief.

Although I agree with the result, I disagree with part IA of the opinion that holds the trial court\u2019s finding of probable cause to be reviewable even though the sufficiency of the evidence to support the defendant\u2019s conviction after a trial on the merits remains unchallenged. A finding by a jury that a person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt a fortiori signifies that there is probable cause to prosecute him. Even if the evidence offered at the probable cause hearing in this case had been found inadequate by the majority to support the finding of probable cause made by the trial court, it would still make no sense to vacate the jury\u2019s finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt after a fair trial in order to require the state to make an adequate showing of probable cause at this stage of the proceeding. Such an exercise in futility, which would ordinarily amount to a rerun of evidence presented at the trial that has already been determined to be adequate to support a conviction, is an utter waste of judicial resources that should be conserved for more useful purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">I fear that this unnecessary chore the majority has chosen to undertake will become a frequent ritual of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>this court in appeals from murder convictions. Henceforth the focus of our evidentiary review in murder cases will be, not the evidence at trial, which a jury found sufficient for a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, but the evidence presented at the probable cause hearing, where the only issue to be determined is whether there is enough evidence to warrant a prosecution. In those cases where the trial court as well as the prosecutor have overlooked some essential element of the crime at the probable cause hearing, the conviction presumably will be set aside despite ample proof of such element at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Of more serious consequence than the additional burden the majority opinion casts upon the judicial system is the likelihood that in some instances murderers who have been convicted after a fair trial will escape the consequences of their crimes because of the unavailability of some witnesses for a second trial and the staleness of their recollection. Presumably the transcript of their testimony at the first trial could still be used, but its impact seldom would measure up to the impression created by the testimony of live witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u201c[I]t is the duty of a reviewing court to consider the trial court record as a whole and to ignore errors that are harmless,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> including most constitutional violations.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hasting, </em>461 U.S. 499, 509, 103 S. Ct. 1974, 76 L. Ed. 2d 96 (1983). This court has frequently applied this principle to violations of constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>rights of an accused. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>199 Conn. 718, 508 A.2d 748 (1986) (use of photograph obtained during illegal search to obtain confession); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 258-63, 502 A.2d 886 (1986) (illegal arrest does not void subsequent prosecution and conviction); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harman, </em>198 Conn. 124, 131, 502 A.2d 381 (1985) (delay in appointment of new counsel to represent defendant). Not every constitutional violation requires automatic reversal. \u201cThe question is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the [violation] complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Fahy </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>375 U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S. Ct. 229, 11 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1963); see <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23-24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967). In no realistic sense can an erroneous finding of probable cause be said to have contributed to a conviction after a trial on the merits unless the finding in some manner has resulted in the use of prejudicial evidence at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The United States Supreme Court has held that an indictment may not be dismissed because of the inadequacy or incompetence of the evidence adduced before the grand jury to support it. <em>Costello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>350 U.S. 359, 362, 76 S. Ct. 406, 100 L. Ed. 397 (1956); <em>Holt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>218 U.S. 245, 247, 31 S. Ct. 2, 54 L. Ed. 1021 (1910). Even where an indictment is based on evidence obtained in violation of a constitutional right, it may stand. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Blue, </em>384 U.S. 251, 255, 86 S. Ct. 1416, 16 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1966). This court has refused to set aside convictions despite a constitutionally erroneous instruction to the grand jury on the presumption of innocence; <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>181 Conn. 268, 283-84, 435 A.2d 701 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1077, 101 S. Ct. 856, 66 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1981); a recognized abuse of discretion in excluding a defendant from the grand jury hearing; <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>188 Conn. 626, 633, 453 A.2d 418 (1982), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>denied, 461 U.S. 928, 103 S. Ct. 2088, 77 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1983); and a plain violation of a rule of practice prohibiting anyone but regular members of the grand jury from being present during deliberations. <em>State </em>v. <em>McGann, </em>199 Conn. 163, 167, 506 A.2d 109 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\u201cIt is only a violation of the most sacrosanct of constitutional rights in the indicting process, such as racial discrimination in the composition of the grand jury, that can justify the illogic of remanding a case to redetermine whether there is probable cause to prosecute a defendant whose guilt after a fair trial has been found beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McGann, </em>supra, 169; see <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Hillery, </em>474 U.S. 254, 106 S. Ct. 617, 88 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986); <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>443 U.S. 545, 551-59, 99 S. Ct. 2993, 61 L. Ed. 2d 739 (1979). An erroneous determination of probable cause has never previously been regarded as violating such a significant constitutional right. The majority opinion cites no authority, and I am aware of none, supporting a review of a grand jury indictment following a conviction at trial for the purpose of determining whether the finding of probable cause was supported by sufficient proof. See <em>Costello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 362- 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">There is nothing in the history of the adoption of the 1982 amendment to article first, \u00a7 8, of our state constitution to warrant the innovation sponsored by the majority in appellate treatment of findings of probable cause. The nonreviewability of such findings was never based wholly upon the traditional secrecy of grand jury proceedings, as the opinion assumes, because even errors in grand jury proceedings fully disclosed by transcripts have been held not reviewable. <em>State </em>v. <em>McGann, </em>supra, 166-70; <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>supra, 283-84; see <em>Costello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 363- 64. The language of the amendment and its implementing legislation, General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>contains no support for the view that appellate review of probable cause determinations is now mandated in every case. The amendment merely substituted for the phrase, \u201cunless on a presentment or an indictment of a grand jury,\u201d the language, \u201cunless upon probable cause shown at a hearing in accordance with procedures prescribed bylaw.\u201d Conn. Const., amend. XVII. General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a, which implements the amendment, prescribes a new probable cause procedure allowing a defendant to have counsel at the hearing, to present argument to the court, to cross-examine witnesses and to obtain a transcript. These modifications of our former grand jury procedure are wholly unrelated to the propriety of appellate review of the evidence offered to support a finding of probable cause. Nor do they transform deficiencies in such findings into jurisdictional flaws, as the majority opinion holds, of such significance as to require a criminal proceeding to be recommenced ab initio after a trial on the merits. The language of article first, \u00a7 8, that \u201c[n]o person shall be held to answer for any crime, punishable by death or life imprisonment,\u201d which is claimed to require this consequence, was not changed by the 1982 amendment. Since this court has not previously viewed that provision to create any jurisdictional barrier to a prosecution upon an indictment that is flawed for lack of evidence or for incompetent evidence, it is difficult to perceive why a change in the mechanism for determining probable cause should have this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Apparently the principal concern of the majority is that, unless appellate review is provided of probable cause determinations, \u201cthe expanded protection envisioned by the adoption of amendment seventeen would become a hollow shell.\u201d The same argument can be advanced with respect to many other constitutional rights where the harmless error principle has been applied. A demonstration of prejudice, nevertheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>has been deemed essential to warrant overturning a conviction for constitutional violations equally as basic as that involved here. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harman, </em>supra. It is incorrect to assume that no occasion will ever arise for review of probable cause findings made pursuant to \u00a7 54-46a. Where an erroneous determination has led the police to discover evidence used at the trial, as where a defendant has confessed during the period of confinement following the hearing, a claim of prejudice might well be justified. Just as evidence obtained as the result of an illegal arrest continues to necessitate our review of probable cause for the arrest, despite the demise of <em>State </em>v. <em>Licari, </em>153 Conn. 127, 214 A.2d 900 (1965), the nonreviewability of probable cause found pursuant to \u00a7 54-46a, where there has been no prejudice at the trial, does not foreclose such review where prejudice can be shown. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>supra, 261-63. Any concern that trial judges will feel wholly uninhibited in finding probable cause to exist unless such a finding is reviewable in every instance, regardless of any prejudice that may ensue, is unwarranted. They, no less than the members of this court, are sworn to uphold the constitution and the laws of this state. General Statutes \u00a7 1-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Accordingly, I concur only with the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\"> Since the thesis of this concurring opinion is that an erroneous finding of probable cause is of no import once there has been a trial on the merits, it follows that review of the specific claim of error is unnecessary. Contrary to the suggestion in footnote 12 of the majority opinion, this court ordinarily does not review claims of error that must inevitably be found harmless. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 259, 502 A.2d 886 (1986) (legality of arrest not resulting in illegally obtained evidence); <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>190 Conn. 798, 803 n.1, 463 A.2d 553 (1983) (general verdict rule); <em>Slattery </em>v. <em>Maykut, </em>176 Conn. 147, 150 n.3, 405 A.2d 76 (1978) (ruling excluding evidence that is not material in view of trial court\u2019s conclusions).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b356-7\">Arthur H.
