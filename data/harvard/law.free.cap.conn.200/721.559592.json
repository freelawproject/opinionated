On appeal, he claims that the trial court erred in: (1) excluding the hearsay confession of a third party; and (2) denying the defendant\u2019s motion to open his case after the close of evidence but prior to closing arguments. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>The jury could reasonably have found that on December 23, 1980, at about 5:30 p.m. two hispanic males entered Jack\u2019s Pharmacy at 714 Albany Avenue in Hartford. The co-owners of the pharmacy, Joseph Gartrell and Robert Gentry, as well as an employee, Ruby McKnight, were working in the pharmacy that evening. No customers were in the pharmacy. Upon entering the pharmacy, the two men proceeded to the cooler, removed an eight-pack of beer, and placed it on the sales counter, behind which Gartrell, Gentry and McKnight were standing. One of the men then inquired as to the price of the beer, whereupon he took a ten dollar bill out of his wallet and placed it on the counter. McKnight opened the cash register to get change at which time the same man placed the barrel of a gun on the cash register, and told McKnight to \u201cleave it as is.\u201d McKnight complied with the man\u2019s demand for her to lie face down on the floor behind the counter. Gentry and Gartrell remained standing. Gentry then said something in Spanish to one of the men, at which time the man fired a handgun at Gentry, fatally wounding him. McKnight later identified the defendant in a photo array as the person who shot Gentry. Gartrell also identified the defendant in a corporeal lineup as the person who shot Gentry. Other facts will be discussed as they become relevant to the specific claims raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court erred in excluding the hearsay confession of a third party. The defendant attempted to introduce a statement made out of court by a third party, one Jovino Solar. The statement was sought to be introduced through Maria Navarro, who had previously testified that the defendant had been with her on the night of the robbery and murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>In the absence of the jury, the defendant offered Navarro\u2019s testimony concerning the statement allegedly made by Solar, viz., that he had committed the robbery and murder at Jack\u2019s Pharmacy on December 23,1980. Navarro, who had lived with the defendant for eight years at the time of the trial, testified that on December 23,1980, she was'with the defendant in their apartment all day until late that evening, when Solar\u2019s brother visited them. She further testified that the three then left her apartment and went to an apartment where they met Solar. Navarro testified that Solar at that time told her that he had robbed and \u201ckilled the guy\u201d at Jack\u2019s Pharmacy. According to Navarro\u2019s testimony, Solar told her that he had entered the pharmacy at about 5 p.m. and said, \u201cDon\u2019t move, anybody,\u201d whereupon the owner of the pharmacy \u201cfired the gun three times.\u201d In response, Solar claimed he fired his gun three times \u201cbecause he got upset.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel argued that, although this statement constituted hearsay, it should be admitted as a declaration against penal interest, an exception to the hearsay rule. The trial court refused to admit the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>179 Conn. 431, 426 A.2d 799 (1980), we held that third party statements against penal interest exculpatory to a defendant were no longer per se inadmissible. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>182 Conn. 476, 479, 438 A.2d 735 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 431 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980). The rule we adopted in <em>DeFreitas </em>is consistent with the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973), and is also in accord with rule 804 (b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence providing that trustworthy third party statements against penal interest exculpatory to a defendant are admissible if the declarant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>unavailable. \u201cCourts have extracted from <em>Chambers </em>four general considerations relevant to an investigation of the trustworthiness of a third party confession: \u2018(1) the time of the declaration and the party to whom the declaration was made; (2) the existence of corroborating evidence in the case; (3) the extent to which the declaration is really against the declarant\u2019s penal interest; [and] (4) the availability of the declarant as a witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>supra, 479. No single factor in the test for determining trustworthiness is necessarily conclusive; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 633-34; the factors are reflective of the fact that there can be \u201c \u2018no precise formulation of the proof which would constitute sufficient evidence of the trustworthiness\u2019 \u201d of such declarations. <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>supra, 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">In our review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of the third party confession, the determination as to whether the third party declaration against penal interest is trustworthy is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra. In this case, the trial court excluded the proffered testimony on the ground that \u201cthe corroborating circumstances clearly indicate[d] that the alleged statement was untrustworthy.\u201d The unavailability of the declarant was established, and it is undisputed that the alleged statement was against the declarant\u2019s penal interest. Therefore, we will examine only the evidence concerning the time of the declaration, the party to whom it was made, and the evidence corroborating the statement. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The defendant first argues that Solar\u2019s statement. was made at a time and to a person that would tend to indicate trustworthiness. We disagree. Although the statement was allegedly made only hours after the crimes occurred; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 634; cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>572 F.2d 687 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 840, 99 S. Ct. 128, 58 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>138 (1978) (confession made two years after crime); the record does not support the claim that it was made to a person which would indicate that it was trustworthy. Navarro testified that Solar had lived in an apartment above her and the defendant and that she had known him for \u201cmaybe one month.\u201d The remainder of Navarro\u2019s testimony concerned Solar\u2019s request that Navarro and Sanchez assist him in leaving Hartford and the fact that Solar had spent the night at their apartment following the killing of Gentry. None of this testimony, however, was corroborated by independent evidence. We conclude, as did the trial court, that there was no close, confidential relationship between the declarant and the witness that would indicate the trustworthiness of the alleged declaration by Solar. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 634; cf. <em>Lowery </em>v. <em>State, </em>401 F. Sup. 604 (D. Md. 1975), aff\u2019d without opinion, 532 F.2d 750 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 919, 97 S. Ct. 312, 50 L. Ed. 2d 285 (1976) (affidavit sworn to before prison official). Additionally, the untrustworthiness of Navarro\u2019s testimony was colored by her intimate relationship with the defendant with whom she. had lived for eight years preceding the robbery and murder at Jack\u2019s Pharmacy. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 634-35, 638; <em>People </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>54 Ill. 2d 419, 429, 299 N.E.2d 1 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">We now turn to the second factor, the corroboration of the statement. Unlike the situation in <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 634, where \u201ca myriad of corroborating circumstances were present\u201d to indicate reliability, here the record reveals few, if any, corroborating circumstances. The declarant in this case was not placed in the vicinity of the crime by another witness. Therefore, there was no independent evidence that Solar had an opportunity to commit the murder. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 634-35. Moreover, the alleged statement by Solar was in direct conflict with the testimony of the two eyewit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>nesses to the robbery and murder of Gentry. According to Navarro, Solar said that he had entered the pharmacy and said, \u201cDon\u2019t move, anybody,\u201d whereupon the owner of the pharmacy \u201cfired the gun three times.\u201d Both eyewitnesses testified that only one shot had been fired by the defendant. In addition, the police only found one spent bullet during their investigation at the pharmacy. Finally, there were discrepancies between Navarro\u2019s testimony concerning Solar\u2019s appearance at the time of the robbery and the eyewitness descriptions of the robbers. Navarro testified that Solar had a beard, mustache, and sideburns. The eyewitnesses testified that one of the robbers, later identified by them as the defendant, had only a \u201cthin mustache\u201d and that his younger accomplice was \u201cclean shaven.\u201d Navarro\u2019s account of Solar\u2019s confession made no reference to any accomplice in the crimes. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded Navarro\u2019s rendition of Solar\u2019s alleged statement in the absence of any corroborating circumstances to indicate that it was trustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to open his case for the purpose of calling an additional alibi witness, Hector Rodriguez. Specifically, he challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling on four grounds: (1) he was in compliance with the applicable Practice Book sections; (2) the trial court improperly relied upon the \u201cstipulation\u201d of the defendant that Rodriguez would not be called as a witness; (3) the trial court\u2019s ruling denied him due process of law under the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution; and (4) the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion to open. We disagree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>and find that, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court acted properly in excluding the alibi testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">As we recently stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>199 Conn. 207, 209, 506 A.2d 125 (1986), \u201cour state\u2019s notice of alibi discovery rules are similar in scope and wording to those used in the federal system and most states. See Fed. R. Crim. Proc., rule 12.1; see generally LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure (1985) \u00a7 19.4 (b).\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 763 provides that \u201c[u]pon written demand filed by the prosecuting authority ... the defendant shall file within ten days, or at such other time as the judicial authority may direct, a written notice of his intention to offer a defense of alibi.\u201d Pursuant to \u00a7 763 the notice must state \u201cthe specific place or places at which the defendant claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense and the names and addresses of the witnesses upon whom he intends to rely to establish such alibi.\u201d Once this notice is filed by the defendant, the state \u201cwithin ten days after filing of the notice, but in no event less than ten days before the trial unless the judicial authority otherwise directs, shall file a written notice stating the names and addresses of the witnesses upon whom the state intends to rely to establish the defendant\u2019s presence at the scene of the alleged offense and any other witnesses to be relied upon to rebut testimony of any of the defendant\u2019s alibi witnesses.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 764. Upon failure of the defendant or the state to comply with these provisions, the trial court \u201cmay exclude the testimony of any undisclosed witness . . . . \u201d Practice Book \u00a7 766.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cFor good cause shown, the judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>authority may grant an exception to any of the requirements of [\u00a7\u00a7] 763 through 766.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 767; <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>supra, 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">On July 15,1982, the state filed a demand for notice of alibi pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 763. The defendant filed a notice of alibi defense on July 19,1982, naming only Maria Navarro as an alibi witness. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 764, the state filed a notice stating the names and addresses of the witnesses it would call to establish the defendant\u2019s presence at the scene of the alleged offense. After both the state and the defendant had rested their respective cases, the defendant moved to open his case to permit Rodriguez to testify as an alibi witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The trial court conducted a thorough examination of the defendant and his counsel to determine the merits of the defendant\u2019s motion. The court asked why Rodriguez\u2019 name had not been included in the original notice of alibi. The trial court also noted that defense counsel had \u201cstipulated\u201d earlier in the trial that Rodriguez would not be called as a witness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defense counsel indicated that he had \u201cno idea\u201d that Rodriguez could offer alibi testimony, and that the defendant had never mentioned that such testimony was available. The trial court then tried to ascertain whether the defendant had known of the potential alibi testimony prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>to the filing of his motion to open. The defendant responded that he \u201cknew [all the time] about it.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the defendant, however, he had not told his attorney about Rodriguez\u2019 alibi testimony until that day. The defendant claimed that Rodriguez was selling drugs for him outside his apartment on the evening of the alleged crimes, and he had not wanted to reveal such drug involvement in his trial for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The trial court stated that the defendant\u2019s failure to make a timely disclosure of a proffered alibi witness permitted exclusion of the testimony under Practice Book \u00a7 766. The court added, however, that Practice Book \u00a7 767 indicates that for good cause shown, the judicial authority may grant an exception to the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 763 through 766, and allow the testimony. It concluded, however, that the failure of the defendant to comply with the Practice Book requirements was not excused because the defendant had not shown good cause. It also noted that the defendant had \u201cstipulated\u201d during the trial that he would not call Rodriguez as a witness. The defendant duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The defendant claims that under the circumstances he complied with \u00a7 763 in a timely fashion and that the trial court failed to consider Practice Book \u00a7 765 in rendering its decision. Practice Book \u00a7 765 requires that, \u201c[i]f prior to or during the trial, a <em>party </em>learns of an additional witness whose identity, if known, should have been included in the information furnished under Secs. 763 or 764, the <em>party </em>shall <em>promptly notify </em>the other <em>party </em>or his counsel of the existence and identity of such additional witness.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>defendant contends that, as soon as defense counsel knew of Rodriguez\u2019 potential testimony, counsel notified the trial court and the state and thereby complied with the applicable Practice Book provisions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">As the state argues, Practice Book \u00a7 765 requires that, upon learning of the identity of an additional alibi witness, \u201cthe <em>party </em>shall promptly notify the other <em>party or his </em>counsel... of such additional witness.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that where the language of a statute is clear, \u201c \u2018it is assumed that the words themselves express the intent of the legislature . . . and thus there is no need to construe the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 213, 221, 479 A.2d 814 (1984). This rule applies with equal force to Practice Book provisions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>193 Conn. 526, 551, 480 A.2d 435 (1984) <em>(Healey, J., </em>dissenting). The language of Practice Book \u00a7 765 requires a \u201cparty\u201d to disclose the identity of witnesses. Although there is no indication on the record that defense counsel knew of Rodriguez\u2019 alibi testimony prior to filing the defendant\u2019s motion to open, the defendant acknowledged that he knew as early as December 23,1980, the day of the alleged crimes, that Rodriguez could offer alibi testimony. The defendant, a \u201cparty,\u201d therefore had a duty to disclose this information prior to trial. We agree with the trial court that the defendant did not comply with either \u00a7\u00a7 763 or 765 of the Practice Book and failed to show \u201cgood cause\u201d for noncompliance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude therefore that the trial court did not abuse its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>tion conferred upon it by the Practice Book when it excluded the testimony of the undisclosed alibi witness Rodriguez.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in rendering its decision on the testimony because it relied on a \u201cstipulation\u201d* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by the defendant and his counsel that Rodriguez would not be called as a witness during trial. He argues that the decision as to which witnesses will be called, and in what order, is generally regarded as a matter of trial tactics within the province of defense counsel. Further, he argues that the decision not to allow Rodriguez\u2019 alibi testimony denied him his right to present a defense in violation of the sixth amendment to the United States constitution, applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">We do not disagree with the defendant\u2019s characterization of defense counsel\u2019s role with respect to trial strategy. It is established that \u201c[f]ew rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense.\u201d <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, 302; <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>supra, 214. However, in presenting a defense, the accused, as well as the state, is required to comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and relia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>bility in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence. <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra; see <em>State </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>191 Conn. 564, 469 A.2d 397 (1983). We recognized these principles in <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>supra, 213, when we held that \u201c[t]he sixth amendment \u2018does not confer the right to present testimony free from the legitimate demands of the adversary system.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nobles, </em>422 U.S. 225, 241, 95 S. Ct. 2160, 45 L. Ed. 2d 141 (1975).\u201d We further held, however, that the \u201cexclusion of alibi witnesses may not be justified in all cases where the defendant has failed to comply with the discovery rules. The trial court must weigh the need for exclusion against the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense. See note, \u2018The Preclusion Sanction\u2014A Violation of the Constitutional Right to Present a Defense,\u2019 81 Yale L.J. 1342, 1353-56 (1972). The decision is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will turn on the facts of the particular case. Factors which the trial court must consider include: \u2018whether the disclosure violation was technical or substantial, the timing of the ultimate disclosure, the reason, if any, for the violation, the degree of prejudice to the parties respectively offering and opposing the evidence, whether any resulting prejudice might be cured by a postponement and, if so, the overall desirability of a continuance.\u2019 <em>Taliaferro </em>v. <em>State, </em>[295 Md. 376, 390-91, 456 A.2d 29 (1983)]; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>550 F.2d 1036, 1043 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaFrennie, </em>13 Mass. App. 977, 979, 432 N.E.2d 535 (1982); <em>People </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>396 Mich. 67, 82-83, 238 N.W.2d 31 (1976); <em>State v. Smith, </em>17 Ohio St. 3d 98, 104, 477 N.E.2d 1128 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>supra, 213-14. Applying these factors in this case, we conclude that the sanction of exclusion was justified and therefore did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-5\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-54c. felony murder.

Is that correct, Mr. Sanchez?</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Sanchez, is that a correct statement just made by Mr. Connor?</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b742-7\"> \u201cThe Court: Well, did you, Mr. Sanchez, did you know about this before last night?</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">\u201cThe Interpreter: About what?</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">\u201cThe Court: About the fact that Mr. Rodriguez had this information, or did you know it before?</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">\u201cThe Interpreter: All the time I knew about it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b743-6\"> The record indicates that the defendant argued that he had not called Hector Rodriguez as a witness because he did not know where Rodriguez was at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">\u201cThe Court: Well, what I\u2019m saying is that when he made that statement he said that he did not want to call\u2014he didn\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t able to get a hold of him. He said he did not want to call him. And he said that after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>discussing it with Mr. O\u2019Connor [sic]. And I\u2019m trying to determine why that Mr. Rodriguez might be helpful to him with regard to his alibi, defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">\u201cThe Interpreter: All the time I knew he could help me, but I didn\u2019t know where he was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">We note that even if the defendant had not known of Rodriguez\u2019 whereabouts until the day of the motion to open, this did not relieve the defendant of his duty to disclose under Practice Book \u00a7 765. Trial counsel could have sought a continuance pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 981 to enable him to locate Rodriguez.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b744-12\"> The defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s characterization of the defendant\u2019s statement on the record as a \u201cstipulation.\u201d We do not consider the statements of the defendant or defense counsel to be formal stipulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
