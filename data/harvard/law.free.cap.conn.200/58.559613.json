Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAf\">This is a medical malpractice action brought in 1977 by Charlotte Shelnitz for personal injuries and by her husband, Hyman Shelnitz, for loss of consortium, arising out of an ambulatory myelogram performed by the defendant neurosurgeon, Alvin Greenberg, who at the time of the procedure was a member of the defendant Neurosurgical Associates of New Haven, P. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">The plaintiff\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> complaint alleged negligence and a failure by the defendant<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to obtain informed consent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>After a trial to a jury, a verdict was returned in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $750,000 for Charlotte Shelnitz and $50,000 for Hyman Shelnitz. The defendant\u2019s motions to set aside the verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict were denied and the court rendered judgment for the plaintiff. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The defendant raises six issues on appeal: (1) whether the evidence was sufficient to support the jury verdict on the issue of causation; (2) whether the court erred in failing to give a <em>Secondino </em>charge; (3) whether the plaintiff produced expert testimony sufficient to support her claim of lack of informed consent; (4) whether several of the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings resulted in harmful error; (5) whether the court erred in refusing to grant the defendant\u2019s motions for a mistrial; and (6) whether the verdict was excessive. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">On the advice of her internist, the fifty-four year old plaintiff consulted the defendant on November 22, 1974, with respect to a back problem. After an examination, the defendant recommended conservative treatment. The plaintiff was not \u201cmaking much progress\u201d and called the defendant on January 3,1975, at which time she was told that he would perform an ambulatory myelogram at the Neuro-Diagnostic Center in New Haven on January 9, 1975. The plaintiff testified that during this telephone conversation the defendant did not tell her about \u201cany of the risks\u201d nor did he inform her that the myelogram could be performed in a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">The testimony at trial established that a myelogram is an invasive diagnostic procedure whereby a contrast material, in this case Pantopaque, is injected into the patient\u2019s spinal column and then fluoroscoped and highlighted by x-ray to determine whether there is any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>pathology of the lumbar vertebrae and other portions of the patient\u2019s anatomy. See also 2 Schmidt, Attorneys\u2019 Dictionary of Medicine, M-173; Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary (24th Ed.) p. 917. The spinal canal consists of three membranes: the dura, the arachnoid in the middle, and the pia matter. It is a closed, pressurized system in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates, cleansing and nourishing the spinal canal and the brain and the other elements of the central nervous system.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">A physician, in order to perform a lumbar myelogram, uses a needle to puncture the dura and arachnoid membranes in order to inject the contrast material into the closed system. As a result of the puncture, CSF leaks out of the closed system of membranes into the tissue around the puncture of the dura until the puncture heals and reseals itself. Every patient loses a small amount of CSF in the course of the procedure. The leak of CSF lowers the pressure in the closed system, the central nervous system, and causes irritation to the brain, nerves and other elements of the central nervous system. The CSF leak and the attendant drop in pressure are thought to cause postmyelogram headaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">When the plaintiff arrived at the defendant\u2019s office at the Neuro-Diagnostic Center on January 9,1975, she was told by a radiology technician that she could possibly experience postmyelogram headaches of up to six weeks duration. The defendant performed the myelogram on the plaintiff and afterwards placed her on a stretcher \u201cfor about ten minutes or so.\u201d She was then allowed to dress and was driven home by her husband. There were no facilities at the center for a patient to lie down for a period of time exceeding ten minutes because of the times scheduled for various patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">A card given to patients, including the plaintiff, by the defendant\u2019s office, contained directions to \u201cstay in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>bed, for no less than eight hours following myelogram. Patient may get up to use bathroom <em>only, </em>meals should be served in bed. Patient should force fluids . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The purpose of these procedures is to decrease the pressure on the puncture site and to decrease the frequency and severity of spinal headache.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The day after the myelogram, the plaintiff began to experience headaches and telephoned the defendant\u2019s office. Several of the plaintiff\u2019s calls to the defendant to inform him of her headaches were not returned. The defendant finally spoke with the plaintiff about her complaint and he prescribed Valium.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">On February 5, 1975, the defendant admitted the plaintiff to Yale-New Haven Hospital with a diagnosis of spinal headache as a result of continued CSF leak, and, after bed rest, she was discharged on February 13, 1975. A few days later, the plaintiff again contacted the defendant and complained of headaches. He asked her to come to Yale-New Haven Hospital as an outpatient on February 22, 1975, to undergo a procedure, called a saline bolus injection, to be performed by an anesthesiologist in order to seal the presumed CSF leak. The procedure was considered unsuccessful and no writing evidencing this procedure could be found in either the defendant\u2019s or Yale-New Haven\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The plaintiff sought treatment for her condition in the Boston area, and, from 1975 through 1982, she was admitted nine times to two hospitals for diagnostic tests and treatments. She became a patient of Richard Tyler, a physician at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (PBBH). She underwent two venous blood patch procedures in 1975 at PBBH in an attempt to close what was considered to be a leak. In March, 1978, a myelogram was performed at PBBH. A radioisotope dye injection in March, 1978, at PBBH was done and an evaluation by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>its department of nuclear medicine stated that there was \u201cno evidence of CSF leakage.\u201d In May, 1979, a cervical myelogram was performed. The plaintiff was again admitted to PBBH in November, 1979. Another myelogram was performed, and an evaluation by PBBH\u2019s department of radiology indicated that there was a leak of the Pantopaque used in the myelogram from the subarachnoid space into the epidural space, although the \u201clocation of this leak [was] not ascertained.\u201d The discharge diagnosis was \u201cchronic postmyelogram headache.\u201d In January, 1980, the plaintiff was again admitted to PBBH and a laminectomy was performed by Keasley Welch, a neurosurgeon, in an attempt to discover the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s headaches. The operative note indicated that there was no \u201cobvious CSF leak\u201d but that a dimple was found in the area where the defendant had performed the original myelogram. The discharge diagnosis stated that there was a \u201cpersistent cerebral spinal leak.\u201d In September, 1982, the plaintiff was admitted to PBBH and another myelogram, using metrizamide, was performed and there was \u201csome extravasation of dye from the lumbar area.\u201d The discharge summary of October 18, 1982, stated that because a spinal tap had revealed a normal CSF pressure reading it \u201cimplied] that the headaches are not low pressure headaches which had been the theory . . . .\u201d An October, 1982 report by Tyler to Morton Bender, one of the plaintiff\u2019s treating physicians in 1982, stated that dye escaping into the lumbar area indicated that the plaintiff\u2019s positional headache has \u201cmany characteristics of a spinal fluid leak.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In November, 1982, the Journal of Neurosurgery contained an article written by Doctors Harrington, Tyler and Welch of Boston on the plaintiff\u2019s condition and subsequent hospitalizations, although her identity was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>not disclosed in the article. The defendant testified that he had read the article and recognized the patient as the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The plaintiff offered expert testimony from Herbert Rabiner, a radiologist, and Lawrence Kaplan, a neurologist and psychiatrist. Both doctors practice in New York state but testified that they were familiar with the standards of practice for myelograms in Connecticut in 1975.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Neither of the plaintiffs experts had examined her prior to trial. Rabiner testified that \u201cthere is a direct causal relationship between the early precipitous ambulation of this patient and the prolonged severe post-myelographic or post-spinal headaches which she suffered as a result of this early ambulation.\u201d He further testified that instructing the patient to ambulate ten minutes following the myelogram \u201cwas a deviation from accepted medical care at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Kaplan also testified that it was a departure from acceptable practice to allow a patient \u201cto be up and around\u201d only ten minutes after a lumbar myelogram and that this violation was the cause of the plaintiffs headaches. He testified that the fact that the patient had not been properly confined to bed rest after the procedure caused a delay in the healing of the puncture wound and that this delay is \u201cgoing to cause a persistent spinal fluid leak .... [W]hen this persistent spinal fluid leak occurs, as it did in this case, it is related to the fact that healing was not properly permitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The defendant offered expert medical testimony from Franklin Robinson, a neurosurgeon associated with the defendant, William Scoville, a neurosurgeon, James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Collias, a neurosurgeon, William Allen, a neuroradiological specialist, and Robert Shapiro, a radiologist and author of a book on myelography. Robinson testified that there was no causal relation between a patient\u2019s ambulation ten minutes after the procedure to go home and postmyelogram headaches. Robinson testified that it was good practice to advise patients, as he does, to assume the horizontal position following a myelogram, although not necessarily immediately following the procedure. Scoville, Collias and Allen testified that it was within the standards of care exercised by physicians performing myelograms in Connecticut in 1975 to allow patients to go home directly after the procedure. Shapiro testified that in Connecticut in 1975 a patient was permitted to go home following a myelogram \u201cas soon as in the opinion of the physician . . . the patient was suited to go home.\u201d The textbook authored by Shapiro, Myelography (3d Ed.), a portion of which the plaintiff offered into evidence and upon which she examined, states, however, that \u201cthe patient should be instructed to lie in the prone position without a pillow for twenty-four hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim of error is that the plaintiff failed to establish the necessary causal relation between the defendant\u2019s performance of the myelogram and the alleged injuries on the basis of reasonable medical probabilities. The defendant also claims that because of this failure, it was error for the trial court not to grant his motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">The defendant, in his brief, does not dispute the probability of a CSF leak following the myelogram as the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s headaches immediately thereafter, but he does dispute whether there was sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>evidence of this leak continuing for eight years and causing the plaintiff\u2019s persistent headaches. The defendant claims that because the plaintiff\u2019s treating physicians in the Boston area did not testify, the plaintiff\u2019s Boston hospital records form the only factual basis for the plaintiff\u2019s claim of a causal relation between the myelogram and the headaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The plaintiff claims, however, that her expert witnesses, specifically relying upon the hospital records and trial testimony, provided the expert opinion on the causal connection, including the belief that the plaintiff\u2019s disability is permanent. \u201cCausation may be proved by circumstantial evidence and expert testimony. <em>Slepski </em>v. <em>Williams Ford, Inc., </em>170 Conn. 18, 22, 364 A.2d 175 (1975).\u201d <em>Pisel </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>180 Conn. 314, 340-41, 430 A.2d 1 (1980). In a medical malpractice case, expert testimony is necessary to establish the standard of proper professional skill or care on the part of a physician, surgeon or other similar practitioner because \u201cin most such cases a layman does not and cannot have the requisite knowledge as to whether the proper treatment was given, procedure followed, or care used.\u201d <em>Chubb </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>111 Conn. 482, 486, 150 A. 516 (1930); see <em>Ardoline </em>v. <em>Keegan, </em>140 Conn. 552, 556, 102 A.2d 352 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The expert opinion that seeks to establish the causal connection between the injury and the alleged negligence \u201cmust rest upon more than surmise or conjecture.\u201d <em>Boland </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt, </em>140 Conn. 520, 525, 102 A.2d 362 (1953). \u201cIn evaluating damages in a tort action, a trier is concerned with reasonable probabilities, not with possibilities.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Healy </em>v. <em>White, </em>173 Conn. 438, 443, 378 A.2d 540 (1977); <em>Sheiman </em>v. <em>Sheiman, </em>143 Conn. 222, 225, 121 A.2d 285 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>\u201cIn reviewing the evidence . . . we must give it the most favorable construction in support of the verdict of which it is reasonably capable.\u201d <em>Healy </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 442. \u201cThe causal relation between an injury and its later physical effects may be established by the direct opinion of a physician, by his deduction by the process of eliminating causes other than the traumatic agency, or by his opinion based upon a hypothetical question.\u201d <em>Boland </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt, </em>supra. The medical experts called by the plaintiff in this case did not examine the plaintiff but prior to the trial they were able to review her medical records for hospitalizations subsequent to the myelogram performed by the defendant. The defendant claims that Rabiner, one of the plaintiffs expert witnesses, never saw any of the patient\u2019s records after the hospitalization of March 19, 1975, and that he, therefore, did not have any basis for an opinion regarding causation subsequent to that hospitalization. We need not determine whether Rabiner\u2019s testimony on causation could have provided the jury with evidence of a causal connection beyond mere speculation because the plaintiff\u2019s other expert witness, Kaplan, provided the needed testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Kaplan, although he did not personally examine the plaintiff, reviewed all of her hospital records before he testified. \u201cA doctor may give an opinion on a medical issue without having examined or treated the patient.\u201d <em>Kaye </em>v. <em>Newhall, </em>360 Mass. 701, 703, 277 N.E.2d 697 (1972); see <em>Barksdale Lumber Co </em>v. <em>McAnally, </em>262 Ark. 379, 388, 557 S.W.2d 868 (1977); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Dawidowicz, </em>209 Md. 77, 87-88, 120 A.2d 399 (1956). He testified that, in his opinion based on a reasonable degree of medical probability, the plaintiffs headaches, as recently as October, 1982, were causally related to the myelogram and postmyelogram care received by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He testified further that \u201ceven if the hole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>is plugged and there is no further leakage of spinal fluid demonstrable, the patient continues to have symptoms because of the prolonged duration of time that this remained a leaking hole.\u201d Kaplan testified that, in his opinion, the plaintiff will have \u201cpermanent difficulty\u201d as a result of the procedure and that the headaches will persist for the rest of her natural life. This testimony, if the jury believed it, was sufficient to establish the necessary causal relation as a fact and not as a matter of conjecture or speculation. In addition, the plaintiff testified that she had not experienced severe headaches before the myelogram but that since the procedure in January, 1975, she has \u201cnever lived a day . . . without a headache and having to go to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Although the defendant stresses in his brief that all four of his expert witnesses testified that the defendant\u2019s myelogram procedure was in accordance with the established Connecticut standard of care in 1975, it is within the jury\u2019s province to judge the credibility of the various witnesses. <em>See Healy v. White, </em>supra, 444. \u201cAs to the conflicting expert testimony, the jury is free to accept or reject each expert\u2019s opinion in whole or in part.\u201d <em>Slepski </em>v. <em>Williams Ford, Inc., </em>supra, 22-23. In view of all the evidence, the trial court was correct in declining to exercise its power to set aside the verdict or to render a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because there was sufficient evidence for the jury reasonably and legally to reach a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in failing to give the <em>Secondino </em>charge requested by him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 165 A.2d 598 (1960). We find no error on this claim. In his brief, the defendant argues that he requested this charge to raise a negative inference \u201cfrom the plaintiffs failure to produce any of the physicians who treated her during eight years of hospital admissions for her alleged persistent headaches.\u201d He maintains that Tyler, her chief treating physician for the alleged headaches from 1975 through 1982, was one of \u201cthe treating physicians in Boston\u201d that the plaintiff would naturally have produced. He also includes Welch in that claim and he contends that testimony by the plaintiffs own expert<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> patently meets the test in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number><em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Coppola Motors, Inc., </em>178 Conn. 335, 342, 422 A.2d 260 (1979), for showing \u201cavailability\u201d under <em>Secondino. Citing Nichols </em>and <em>Grabowski </em>v. <em>Fruehauf Trailer Corporation, 2 </em>Conn. App. 167, 477 A.2d 685 (1984),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to grant his request for a <em>Secondino </em>charge on the ground that he failed to satisfy his burden of producing evidence sufficient to warrant the requested charge. Moreover, he argues that the evidence \u201cfrom the uncalled medical specialists in Boston\u201d would not have been cumulative or corroborative of testimony already on the record since none of the \u201cspecialist physicians\u201d who actually treated the plaintiff for her alleged headaches testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The plaintiff, however, claims that the trial court properly refused the <em>Secondino </em>request as the defendant had not presented any evidence that Tyler had been available. Additionally, she refers to the colloquy between the court and defense counsel, when the court was taking the exceptions to its charge, where the trial court asked: \u201cHow do we know that all of these Boston doctors aren\u2019t in China?\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiff also argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>that because Tyler is from Massachusetts, he is not subject to a subpoena from Connecticut courts. In response to the defendant\u2019s <em>Secondino </em>claim, it is also argued that even a doctor who has been treating a patient has not thereby agreed to travel to a different state to testify, particularly in a medical malpractice case. It is also argued that any testimony by Tyler would have been totally cumulative because all his reports and records were in evidence and referred to throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">We conclude that the trial court properly refused to grant the <em>Secondino </em>charge requested by the defendant for two independent reasons.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> First, the request to charge was itself defective. The object in filing a request to charge is to inform the trial court of a party\u2019s claim of the applicability of a principle of law to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>case. <em>Pickens </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>119 Conn. 553, 555, 177 A. 573 (1935); see <em>Kast v. Turley, </em>111 Conn. 253, 257-58, 149 A. 673 (1930); Practice Book \u00a7 318; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 109. Our rules provide that each request to charge shall contain \u201ca single proposition of law clearly and concisely stated with the citation of authority upon which it is based, <em>and the evidence to which the proposition would apply. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7 318; <em>see Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>186 Conn. 632, 643, 443 A.2d 471 (1982); <em>Ziskin </em>v. <em>Confietto, </em>137 Conn. 629, 633, 79 A.2d 816 (1951). A proper request to charge cannot, therefore, under our practice merely be a statement of an abstract proposition of law; Practice Book \u00a7 318; see <em>Ratti </em>v. <em>Berry &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>98 Conn. 522, 524, 119 A. 894 (1923); <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>86 N.J. 281, 290, 430 A.2d 914 (1981); any more than a court may give a charge, which though legally correct, is one \u201cgiven in the abstract . . . and [is] insufficient fully to apprise the jury of the identity of the witness who was the subject of the charge.\u201d <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Tousignant, </em>172 Conn. 54, 59, 372 A.2d 151 (1976) (error in giving <em>Secondino </em>charge because given in abstract, made no reference to the evidence and did not fully apprise the jury of the identity of the \u201cparticular missing witness\u201d). Our examination of the transcript and the exhibits indicates that Tyler and Welch appear to be those two Boston physicians who were the treating physicians. There were other physicians in Boston who treated the plaintiff, albeit not on the level of Welch and particularly Tyler. The request to charge should have specifically referred to the Boston physician or physicians to whom the <em>Secondino </em>request was directed. Such a reference accompanied by the evidence to which the request was claimed to apply would constitute a proper request. It would then have been adequate to permit the court to give instructions \u201csufficient to furnish a practical guide to the jury as to how the stated law [was] to be applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>to the evidence before them.\u201d <em>Vita </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>158 Conn. 75, 77, 255 A.2d 848 (1969); see <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Tousignant, </em>supra, 60. In that regard, we also note that in taking the exceptions, the trial court specifically pointed out to defense counsel that the request did not refer to \u201cany specific witness.\u201d Despite that, no names of any such witnesses were stated to the court at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The second reason that the trial court properly declined to charge on <em>Secondino </em>as requested was because the defendant did not sustain his burden of demonstrating the availability of the witness. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>195 Conn. 624, 631, 490 A.2d 75 (1985); <em>Doran </em>v. <em>Wolk, </em>170 Conn. 226, 229, 365 A.2d 1190 (1976); <em>New England Whalers Hockey Club </em>v. <em>Nair, </em>1 Conn. App. 680, 685, 474 A.2d 810 (1984). The <em>Secondino </em>rule is: \u201c \u2018The failure of a party to produce a witness who is within his power to produce and who would naturally have been produced by him, permits the inference that the evidence of the witness would be unfavorable to the party\u2019s cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>supra, 675, quoting <em>Ezzo </em>v. <em>Geremiah, </em>107 Conn. 670, 677, 142 A. 461 (1928). The party against whose cause an unfavorable inference is claimed may, of course, offer evidence to explain the failure to produce the witness. \u201cThere are two requirements for the operation of the rule: The witness must be available, and he must be a witness whom the party would naturally produce.\u201d <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">There would appear to be no real dispute between the parties that Tyler would be a witness whom the plaintiff would naturally have produced under <em>Secondino. </em>We need not, however, reach that question because of the basis of our disposition of this claim. The defendant claims that Tyler was \u201cavailable\u201d under that rule and he points to the following language in <em>Nichols </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>Coppola Motors, Inc., </em>supra, 342, to support his claim: \u201cAvailability may be shown or determined not only from mere physical presence or accessibility for service, but also from the relationship, usefulness or nature of the expected testimony and this means only that the witness is in such relationship with the party that it is likely that his presence could be procured.\u201d Our statement in <em>Nichols </em>must be considered in the light of our discussion of \u201cavailability\u201d in <em>Secondino </em>and its progeny. Whether a particular witness is \u201cavailable\u201d is one of two distinct requirements for the operation of the rule. <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>supra, 675. The language of <em>Nichols, </em>as we now examine it, overlaps the two distinct requirements of the rule. Although this charge has been dubbed the <em>Secondino </em>charge, \u201cit appears to have been first formally recognized in <em>Ezzo </em>v. <em>Geremiah, </em>supra.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>180 Conn. 101, 109, 429 A.2d 813 (1980). In <em>Ezzo, </em>and later in <em>Secondino, </em>the rule is expressly linked to the maxim that \u201c \u2018all evidence is to be weighed according to the proof which it was in the power of one side to have produced, and in the power of the other side to have contradicted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ezzo </em>v. <em>Geremiah, </em>supra; <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>supra; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>supra, 632; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>146 Conn. 149, 161, 148 A.2d 334 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">While we have not said and do not say that to be available a witness must be subject to subpoena, it is apparent that a witness is \u201cavailable\u201d if the party against whom the negative inference of <em>Secondino </em>is claimed is able to procure the witness\u2019 testimony at the trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>171 Conn. 47, 57, 368 A.2d 184 (1976). There is little question that availability is related to the naturalness of production requirement. The notion of the power and the ability to procure the witness, by process or otherwise, is critical to availability. Before a negative inference can be drawn from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>party\u2019s failure to produce a particular witness, it must be shown that the party was able to procure the witness\u2019 physical presence in court. This capability of the naturalness of production of a witness has caused Wig-more to state that it \u201cis unquestioned\u201d that the person involved must be <em>\u201cwithin the power </em>of the party to produce.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) 2 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadboum Rev.) \u00a7 286.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This is consonant with our view of the meaning of \u201cavailable.\u201d It accords with common sense, especially if it is kept in mind that wisdom counsels caution in the application of this inference. See McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed. 1984) \u00a7 272; 2 Wigmore, supra, \u00a7 285. It also is borne out by our implicit overruling in <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Gagliola, </em>162 Conn. 164, 169, 292 A.2d 890 (1972), of \u201csuch cases as <em>Cascella </em>v. <em>Jay James Camera Shop, Inc., </em>147 Conn. 337, 343, 160 A.2d 899 [1960], which placed the burden of proof of nonavailability on the party who would naturally have produced the witness.\u201d <em>Doran </em>v. <em>Wolk, </em>supra, 229. Of course, \u201c \u2018[w]hether an inference can be drawn from the failure to call witnesses necessarily depends, as with inferences generally, upon the posture of the particular case and the state of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Collins Transportation Co., </em>341 Mass. 502, 506, 170 N.E.2d 725 (1960), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Rourke, </em>311 Mass. 213, 222, 40 N.E.2d 883 (1942). The <em>Secondino </em>charge, therefore, should not be given unless there is a sufficient foundation to do so. In a malpractice case, one court, in finding error in giving the negative inference charge, stated, in adopting <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 614, 85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1965): \u201c \u2018What the jury may infer, given no help from the court is one thing. What it may infer when the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>solemnizes the silence . . . into evidence . . . is quite another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wild </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>91 N.J. Super. 410, 415, 220 A.2d 711 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The defendant did not sustain his burden of demonstrating the availability of Tyler.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The statements of Kaplan that Tyler \u201cis in charge of neurology\u201d at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (PBBH), which was part of the Massachusetts General/Harvard Medical School in Boston, fall far short of that burden. Moreover, the defendant does not claim that there is any other evidence nor do we find any other evidence on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict and in denying his motions to set aside the verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of informed consent because the plaintiff failed to produce expert medical testimony that a spinal headache of long duration is a risk of the myelogram procedure. Because we uphold the judgment in favor of the plaintiff on the issue of actionable negligence and because the jury\u2019s award of damages on both issues is not severable, we need not address the informed consent issue since the damages awarded may stand on the negligence issue alone.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">The defendant raises as a fourth claim of error several of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. The defendant claims that a hypothetical question posed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>plaintiff to her expert witness, Kaplan, was defective because it assumed a fact not in evidence. The defendant objected, the court overruled the objection, and an exception was taken. The plaintiff claims that the defendant, on cross-examination of the expert, was allowed to prove the issue that he had objected to in the hypothetical-\u2014whether on each of the plaintiffs hospitalizations over the last eight years \u201cshe\u2019s there because of a post-spinal headache . . . .\u2019\u2019The defendant claims that the plaintiff\u2019s hospital records do not bear out that assumption and points to a discharge summary of the plaintiff from PBBH in 1982 which indicates that the headaches may be of a \u201cpossible\u201d vascular etiology.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In <em>Floyd v. Fruit Industries, Inc., </em>144 Conn. 659, 666, 136 A.2d 918 (1957), we stated that the determination of the admissibility of a hypothetical question \u201ccalls for the exercise of a sound discretion as to whether the question, even though it does not contain all of the facts in evidence, presents the facts in such a manner that they bear a true and fair relationship to each other and to the whole evidence in the case . . . is not so worded as to be likely to mislead or confuse the jury, and is not so lacking in the essential facts as to be without value in the decision of the case.\u201d (Citations omitted.) The court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The hypothetical, while not a model of clear speech, asked the expert to assume that the plaintiff was hospitalized because of her postspinal headache. What a patient reports as her symptoms upon admission to a hospital is not conclusive upon the treating physician as to the actual diagnosis. The plaintiff\u2019s hospital records reflect, in the admission histories, a continued complaint of headache that began following the 1975 myelogram. We note that the plaintiff\u2019s Yale-New Haven and Boston hospital records were in evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>as full exhibits prior to the hypothetical question involved and also that Kaplan had reviewed these records. The hypothetical question cannot be said to have distorted the facts or to have misled or confused the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim of error in evidentiary rulings is in the court\u2019s application of the \u201cbest evidence\u201d rule to certain testimony of Robinson, one of the defendant\u2019s expert witnesses. The expert witness was asked on redirect examination: \u201c[I]n the period of time . . . from 10/1/73 through 9/30/74, approximately, sir, how many ambulatory myelograms were performed by your group during that period?\u201d The plaintiff objected and claimed that the best evidence rule barred this testimony unless it was introduced through records kept by the group. The best evidence rule requires, where the contents of a document are to be proved, that the original document be offered into evidence unless such production is excused. <em>See Brown </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>145 Conn. 290, 296, 141 A.2d 634 (1958); Tait &amp; LaPlante, Handbook of Connecticut Evidence \u00a7 10.7, p. 169; McCormick, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 229 through 233. The court sustained the objection and stated that \u201cthe best evidence would be the records of what the actual number of myelograms were, rather than the expression of his opinion at this point as to how many were done during that course of time.\u201d The defendant took an exception to the ruling. We agree with the defendant that the question posed by him did not seek to prove the contents of a document. The defendant claims that the question instead sought to elicit information about Robinson\u2019s experience in performing ambulatory myelograms. The trial court referred not only to the best evidence rule in sustaining the objection but also to the apparently inadequate foundation for Robinson\u2019s testimony on this subject. The trial court stated that the period in ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>tion was an approximately eleven or twelve month period ten years prior to trial and that there had been a \u201clong lapse of time\u201d since then. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the objection as the question was based on an inadequate foundation. Alternatively, the defendant has not demonstrated harmful error even if the trial court\u2019s ruling is considered to have been based solely on the best evidence rule. The burden rests upon the defendant to demonstrate the harmfulness of the error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 174, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981). Because Robinson had previously testified that he had performed \u201cthousands\u201d of ambulatory myelographies \u201cup through the month of January, 1975,\u201d there was sufficient evidence before the jury of Robinson\u2019s professional experience in this area so that the ruling cannot be said to have been harmful error.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The defendant also claims error in the court\u2019s denials of his motions for mistrial because the \u201ccumulative harm\u201d resulting from the actions of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and the remark of the plaintiff\u2019s witness created \u201cinsurmountable prejudice\u201d against him. The defendant specifically cites five incidents during the trial, for which each time a motion for mistrial was made, denied, and an exception taken. The first incident involved a remark by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel concerning the formation of the codefendant professional corporation, about which he stated: \u201cIt goes to the motive of this doctor in trying to steer his patients into this corporation for billing purposes as opposed to a hospital.\u201d The trial court, stating that the question of financial arrangements was totally irrelevant and immaterial to the case, instructed the jury to disregard the comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>The second and third incidents claimed by the defendant to require a mistrial involved the manner in which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel \u201cbrowbeat\u201d and \u201cbadgered\u201d the defendant during his testimony. The fourth incident involved the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, who when on redirect examination was asked if she felt \u201ca sense of anger and hostility about what happened to [her] mother,\u201d responded: \u201cAnger? I\u2019d like to kill that man [the defendant] right there.\u201d The court instructed the jurors to disregard the last question and answer and instructed them that \u201cthe mere fact that there is an emotional response ... is not to have any significance to you as to the merits of this case.\u201d The final incident raised by the defendant is the \u201cbrowbeating\u201d of Robinson during the plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination. The trial court, after the particular incident at issue, again directed the jury to disregard the comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">A mistrial, as a general principle, should only be granted when it is apparent to the trial court that because of an incident during the trial a party cannot have a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 264, 502 A.2d 886 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Festo, </em>181 Conn. 254, 265, 435 A.2d 38 (1980); <em>Izzo </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>157 Conn. 561, 565, 254 A.2d 904 (1969); <em>Ferino </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>133 Conn. 463, 466, 52 A.2d 433 (1947). The trial court has wide discretion in ruling on motions for mistrial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>195 Conn. 444, 453, 488 A.2d 812, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 833, 106 S. Ct. 103, 88 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Festo, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 719-20, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979). \u201cMoreover, we have consistently recognized that a careful, cautionary instruction given by the trial court is a relevant factor to be considered in determining whether the denial of such a motion constituted an abuse of the trial court\u2019s broad discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>171 Conn. 264, 274, 368 A.2d 222 [1976]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Savage, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>[161 Conn. 445, 449, 290 A.2d 221 (1971)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>154 Conn. 622, 631, 228 A.2d 136 [1967].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>supra, 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">In the present case, the trial extended over several weeks and included extensive direct and cross-examination of the various witnesses. We have carefully reviewed the lengthy transcript in this case and find no error in the trial court\u2019s denials of the defendant\u2019s motions for mistrial. In the context of the entire trial, the above incidents involving the defendant or Robinson were reflective of the intense questioning by counsel from both sides. While not entirely proper or commendable examination tactics were used by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motions. As to the incident involving the plaintiffs daughter, it was an isolated incident in the trial. The trial court heard counsel for each of the parties before ruling on the motion, including the plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s statement that the response was not anticipated or elicited but that it was \u201cspontaneous.\u201d \u201cIn making our independent assessment we do so under the limitations of a printed record, without the benefit of instant replay or of the sights and sounds of a trial in action. The trial judge, on the other hand, is in a better position to sense the atmosphere of the trial and therefore can apprehend far better than we can the effect of certain remarks on the jury. <em>Marko </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 550, 559, 364 A.2d 217 (1975); <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Steck, </em>146 Conn. 114, 119, 148 A.2d 246 (1959).\u201d <em>Pisel </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>180 Conn. 314, 322, 430 A.2d 1 (1980); see <em>Pietrorazio </em>v. <em>Santopietro, </em>185 Conn. 510, 515, 441 A.2d 163 (1981). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motions for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim of error is that the jury\u2019s award of $800,000 in damages was excessive. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and rendered judgment for the plaintiff for $800,000. In his brief, the defendant claims that because the headaches suffered by the plaintiff cannot be causally connected to the defendant\u2019s performance of the myelogram beyond a period of a few months, the award is \u201cpatently outrageous.\u201d The defendant, in oral argument to this court, conceded that this claim would fail if we were to affirm the judgment on the negligence issue and find that causation was established. Because of our ruling on the causation issue, and in light of the defendant\u2019s concession on this issue, we need not discuss this claim further.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-14\"> The references to the plaintiff encompass both Charlotte and Hyman Shelnitz, unless otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-15\"> References to the defendant encompass both Alvin Greenberg, M.D., and Neurosurgical Associates of New Haven, P.C.,unless otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b76-9\"> The plaintiffs expert witnesses testified that they were familiar with the standards in Connecticut for performing myelograms in 1975.
