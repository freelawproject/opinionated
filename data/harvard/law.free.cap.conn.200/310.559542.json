Roberson asked the clerk for the agency\u2019s gray cash box, fled down the street with it, and was arrested shortly thereafter. On March 12, 1980, the defendant and his sister had gone to the Fournier agency, purchased some insurance and made a cash payment for it. At that time, the clerk who had dealt with the defendant had placed the cash she received from him in the same cash box that was taken by the robber on March 21,1980. Approximately five minutes after the robbery, the defendant came into the insurance agency where the same clerk, who had observed him on March 12, 1980, was on duty. She recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>him from that earlier transaction. He inquired of her whether the policy that he had earlier taken out in his sister\u2019s name covered towing because his car had been stuck down the street for a couple of hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In a statement given to the Watertown police, the defendant stated that on the night before the robbery, Roberson had asked the defendant to give him a ride to Oakville because \u201che had to throw down on something [\u2018rob the place\u2019] in Oakville for some big money.\u201d The next morning the defendant picked Roberson up and drove him to Oakville. Roberson gave him twenty dollars for driving him there so that he could rob \u201cthis place he was going to hit.\u201d A few minutes after Roberson exited the car in Oakville, he came back to tell the defendant that he was getting ready to commit the robbery and he showed the defendant his gun, flipping the cylinder so that the defendant could see bullets in it. The defendant asked Roberson not to commit the robbery at that time because his car would not start. The latter reiterated that he had to rob the agency and he walked toward the Fournier agency. There was also evidence that the defendant later gave a false statement to Watertown police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The defendant claims error in the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a continuance in conjunction with its ruling concerning Roberson\u2019s claimed fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The background circumstances involved are the following: On August 21,1980, during the argument on the defendant\u2019s motion to sever his case from that of Roberson, the defendant\u2019s counsel indicated that he wanted Roberson to be available to testify for the defendant. This was a result of the state\u2019s response to the defendant\u2019s discovery motion seeking exculpatory information which stated: \u201cThe co-accused, Elbert Roberson, claimed not to have had an accomplice during this [r]obbery and claims not to know the Defendant.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>defendant\u2019s counsel, in seeking a severance, said that he wanted to call Roberson to have him tell the jury that he had acted without an accomplice and had not even known the defendant. The motion to sever the trials was granted on September 16, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">On October 29, 1980, Roberson pleaded guilty to a substitute information charging him with robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134, 53a-48. The court<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> accepted the pleas and sentencing was scheduled for December 12, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">On October 30, 1980, jury selection began in the defendant\u2019s case. Later, on November 5,1980, during jury selection, the defendant\u2019s counsel informed the court that Roberson was \u201cvery strongly\u201d a possible witness in the case. At that time, he stated that he had received a letter from Roberson\u2019s attorney indicating that Roberson intended, if called, to invoke his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination and that this privilege, the attorney had informed the defendant\u2019s counsel, persisted until he was actually sentenced. Moreover, counsel also said that Roberson\u2019s attorney had told him that a motion to quash would be directed to any subpoena issued to Roberson, and, if that failed, Roberson just would not testify. The defendant\u2019s counsel said that Roberson, having pleaded guilty, had waived his right to self-incrimination, but pointed out that if the trial court agreed with Roberson\u2019s argument, then he asked that the trial not continue any further (\u201cat least not proceed with the evidence\u201d) until after Roberson had been sentenced on December 12,1980. The state opposed the request for a continuance, argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>ing that it was \u201chypothetical\u201d at that time whether Roberson would even be called and if he were, whether he would exercise his privilege. It also maintained that Roberson\u2019s fifth amendment privilege lasted until he had been sentenced and that although the trial court had accepted Roberson\u2019s guilty plea, it might reject the state\u2019s recommended sentence. In the latter event, the state argued that then Roberson could be tried and, if he had already testified in the defendant\u2019s case, the state could use that evidence against him at his later trial. The state took this position although it acknowledged that Roberson had told the police that he had not had an accomplice and that he had not known the defendant; the state argued \u201cthat that [was] not the truth.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Just prior to the court\u2019s ruling, the defendant\u2019s counsel said that if it ruled in the state\u2019s favor, then the defense would have to seek a mistrial in the event the trial progressed to the point that Roberson would have to be called prior to his sentencing. The trial court denied the defense motion, pointing out that it could not act then as the matter was in the realm of speculation and could only act when the fifth amendment claim was actually made.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">On November 12,1980, Roberson was called as a witness by the defense after the trial court had denied his motion to quash defense counsel\u2019s subpoena. He was questioned in the absence of the jury to determine whether he would exercise his fifth amendment privilege although defense counsel persisted in his claim that Roberson had already waived it by pleading guilty. Roberson\u2019s refusal to answer a number of questions was sustained by the trial court because of his fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>amendment privilege against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The questions involved the crimes to which Roberson had pleaded guilty and certain of the crimes for which the defendant was then on trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Reiterating his earlier claims concerning the importance of Roberson as a witness to his case, as well as his efforts to alert the trial court to that fact, beginning at the pretrial motion stage, defense counsel then moved that all proceedings in the case be stayed until after Roberson\u2019s sentencing on December 12,1980. This motion was denied, as was the defense motion to dismiss all the charges made immediately thereafter. The trial continued and the jury verdict of guilty was returned on November 19,1980. The defendant was sentenced on December 12,1980.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The trial court had, sometime prior to the trial, exercised its discretion in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to sever. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vigil, </em>561 F.2d 1316 (9th Cir. 1977); 2 Wharton, Criminal Procedure (12th Ed. Torcia) \u00a7 303. It did so after the defendant had told the court that the state had disclosed, on a request for exculpatory information, that Roberson had told the police that he had no accomplice in the robbery and that the defendant intended to call Roberson as a witness in his case. The <em>Bruton </em>issue was also raised. See <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S. Ct. 1620, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1968). \u201cThere is no duty to sever merely because potentially exculpatory testimony of a codefendant exists. The defendant-movant must desire to use it.\u201d <em>Byrd </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>428 F.2d 1017, 1020 (5th Cir. 1970). These criteria were met here. More to the point, Roberson\u2019s statement to the police that he had no accomplice was \u201cexculpatory in effect\u201d; <em>Byrd </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>supra; <em>it meant that the defendant was not involved at all. </em>The state\u2019s claim at trial that this testimony of Roberson was not true is not focal because that issue is ultimately for the jury. See <em>Byrd </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>supra, 1021. The defendant\u2019s need to obtain exculpatory evidence from a codefendant has been found in some cases to be a proper ground for severance. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shuford, </em>454 F.2d 772, 776-77 (4th Cir. 1971); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Echeles, </em>352 F.2d 892, 897-99 (7th Cir. 1965). In granting the severance, it is a fair assumption that the trial court recognized that a single joint trial, however desirable, viewed in the context of efficient and expeditious criminal adjudication, may not be had at the higher expense of a defendant\u2019s right to a fundamentally fair trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Echeles, </em>supra, 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">At the outset of jury selection, the trial court heard the defendant\u2019s counsel announce to the jury panel that Roberson was a possible witness in the case. During <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>jury selection, on November 5, 1980, the defendant\u2019s counsel again alerted the trial court at length to his and Roberson\u2019s position on the self-incrimination privilege issue. In rejecting the defense claims,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the court also denied a continuance of the proceedings until after Roberson\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The state proposed several reasons why the privilege against self-incrimination continued at least until sentencing. Roberson had, according to the state, pleaded guilty on October 29, 1980, on the basis of a recommended sentence. In the event that the sentencing court had rejected that recommendation, Roberson could have moved to withdraw his guilty plea and proceeded to trial. See Practice Book \u00a7 721 (3); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasher, </em>190 Conn. 259, 265, 460 A.2d 970 (1983). If this had been done, then the state might have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>able to use the \u201cincriminating\u201d testimony he had given in a codefendant\u2019s trial in his own trial and this testimony could have substantively jeopardized his right to have the state prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>43 N.J. 411, 416, 204 A.2d 864 (1964), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 987, 85 S. Ct. 1359, 14 L. Ed. 2d 279 (1965); <em>State </em>v. <em>McConnohie, </em>121 Wis. 2d 57, 358 N.W.2d 256 (1984). Practically speaking, this would have amounted to self-incrimination. This is particularly so when it is remembered that in applying the required test for denying the invocation of the privilege it must be \u201c <em>\u2018perfectly clear, </em>from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the witness is mistaken, and that the answerfs] <em>cannot possibly </em>have such tendency\u2019 to incriminate.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 488, 71 S. Ct. 814, 95 L. Ed. 1118 (1951); <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>170 Conn. 206, 209, 365 A.2d 821, cert. denied, 425 U.S. 954, 96 S. Ct. 1732, 48 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">We add that a judge, appraising such a claim by a witness, \u201cmust be governed as much by his personal perception of the peculiarities of the case as by the facts actually in evidence.\u201d <em>Ex parte Irvine, </em>74 F. 954 (S.D. Ohio 1896) (Taft, J.), quoted in <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 487. We note that a defendant who has pleaded guilty but who is awaiting sentencing may invoke the fifth amendment privilege in order to prevent the possible enhancement of his sentence. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>598 F. Sup. 138, 142 (E.D. Pa. 1984) and cases there cited. Thus, the right to.one\u2019s privilege against prosecution that could result from the testimony sought does not depend upon the likelihood of prosecution but upon the possibility of prosecution. <em>In re Folding Carton Antitrust Litigation, </em>609 F.2d 867, 872 (7th Cir. 1979); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>488 F.2d 1206 (1st Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Having concluded that the trial court properly permitted the witness Roberson to refuse to testify in reliance on the privilege against self-incrimination, we must return to the propriety of the trial court\u2019s denial of a continuance when this event occurred. There is no question but that the \u201cmatter of a continuance is traditionally within the discretion of the trial judge\u201d which will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse. <em>Ungar </em>v. <em>Sarafite, </em>376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S. Ct. 841, 11 L. Ed. 2d 921, reh. denied, 377 U.S. 925, 84 S. Ct. 1218, 12 L. Ed. 2d 217 (1964); <em>State </em>v. <em>Beckenbach, </em>198 Conn. 43, 46, 501 A.2d 752 (1985). It is not every denial of a request for a continuance that violates due process. See <em>Ungar </em>v. <em>Sarafite, </em>supra, 589; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bethea, </em>167 Conn. 80, 84, 355 A.2d 6 (1974). Thus, the right of a defendant to a continuance is not \u201cabsolute\u201d and the propriety of a denial of one is to \u201cbe found in the circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Beckenbach, </em>supra, 47-48, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Bethea, </em>supra, 83, and <em>Ungar </em>v. <em>Sarafite, </em>supra, 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In this case, the trial court had been timely alerted to the defendant\u2019s claims concerning Roberson\u2019s testimony. His \u201cexculpatory\u201d testimony that he had no accomplice would hardly have been cumulative. Once Roberson was permitted to invoke his fifth amendment privilege during the defendant\u2019s trial, the unique interest that the defendant had in a continuance in order to get that testimony before the trial jury became more significant. \u201cA criminal defendant is not entitled to a trial which guarantees to him \u2018every item of evidence he would like to offer, but one which meets constitutional standards of due process.\u2019 <em>Byrd </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>428 F.2d 1017, 1021 (5th Cir. 1970).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Blackston, </em>547 F. Sup. 1200, 1207 (S.D. Ga. 1982). While the trial court could properly consider counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>vailing factors such as the right to control its own docket and judicial economy; see generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Zeko, </em>176 Conn. 421, 423, 407 A.2d 1022 (1979); the graver question in this case emerges: whether depriving the defendant of the opportunity to use the exculpatory testimony of Roberson amounted to prejudice resulting in the denial of due process and a fair trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See generally <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>486 F.2d 15, 22 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>Ungar </em>v. <em>Sarafite, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Beckenbach, </em>supra. The continuance requested here was not unreasonable under the circumstances of this case. It would have given the defendant the opportunity to confront Roberson after he had been sentenced, at a time when he could no longer have validly invoked his federal constitutional fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination as to those crimes for which he was sentenced. On this phase, we hold specifically that Roberson\u2019s fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination, with respect to the crimes to which he had pleaded guilty, continued until his sentencing for those crimes. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>283 Md. 187, 388 A.2d 539 (1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1130, 99 S. Ct. 1050, 59 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garland, </em>475 Pa. 389, 380 A.2d 777 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>McConnohie, </em>supra, 65; note, \u201cPlea of Guilty or Conviction as Resulting in Loss of Privilege against Self-incrimination as to Crime in Question,\u201d 9 A.L.R.3d 990. The prejudice to the defendant was substantial. The denial of the continuance constituted an abuse of discretion and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>The defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court committed constitutional error by failing to instruct the jury on the definition of larceny in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119 requires little discussion in view of our disposition of this case. We need not review this claim. \u201cWe have held on numerous occasions that the court will not pass upon a constitutional question if there is present some other ground upon which the case may be decided.\u201d <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>183 Conn. 76, 84-85, 438 A.2d 824 (1981) and cases there cited, including <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 639-40, 431 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980). \u201cConstitutional issues are not considered unless absolutely necessary to the decision of a case ... or unless sufficient public interest warrants such a review.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DellaCamera, </em>166 Conn. 557, 560-61, 353 A.2d 750 (1974). These criteria are not present here. Moreover, review of this issue is also unnecessary since it will not affect the final result in this case. <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>New Milford, </em>161 Conn. 490, 499, 290 A.2d 231 (1971). In addition, we do not believe that such an error, if any, will recur upon retrial and we therefore need not address this claim further. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>200 Conn. 9, 19, 509 A.2d 493 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The same legal considerations also apply to the lack of the need to address the defendant\u2019s remaining claim that the trial court\u2019s instructions on conspiracy misled the jury and, thus, deprived him of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside, and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime ...

At the close of all the evidence, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal as to the latter two crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b328-15\"> We note that, according to the defendant, he had already served the sentence imposed in this case for which his maximum discharge date was December 15, 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\"> The defendant seems to argue that because Roberson had already pleaded guilty he had no fifth amendment privilege to invoke when called by the defendant as a witness on November 12, 1980. He argues that to hold that he did is contrary to our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rado, </em>172 Conn. 74, 372 A.2d 159 (1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 918, 97 S. Ct. 1335, 51 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1977). We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">In <em>Rado, </em>there is nothing in the opinion to indicate that the circumstances under which the witness was invoking the privilege were in issue or that the trial court was aware that he may not have been sentenced. The issue in <em>Rado </em>actually was the propriety of the state calling as a witness a codefendant who had pleaded guilty to one of the charges for which the defendant was on trial (two others having been nolled) whom it allegedly knew or should have known would refuse to testify. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rado, </em>supra, 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">In <em>Rado, </em>we quoted the following statement of the Second Circuit: \u201cIt is well established that once a witness has been convicted for the transactions in question, he is no longer able to claim the privilege of the Fifth Amendment and may be compelled to testify.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>249 F.2d 371, 375 (2d Cir. 1957). A reading of <em>Romero </em>discloses that the witness in that case had in fact been sentenced. Moreover, <em>Rado, </em>immediately following the quote from <em>Romero, </em>also cites <em>Reina </em>v. <em>United States, </em>364 U.S. 507, 513, 81 S. Ct. 260, 5 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1960), and <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>161 U.S. 591, 597-600, 16 S. Ct. 644, 40 L. Ed. 819 (1896). A reading of <em>Reina </em>makes evident that the witness in that case had in fact also been sentenced. In <em>Brown, </em>the witness involved had been immunized when called to the stand. In sum, <em>Rado </em>did not hold as the defendant appears to claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\"> The defendant also argues that the refusal to grant the continuance denied him, inter alia, his right to compulsory process. While our disposition of the continuance issue does not require that we discuss this claim further, we do note that we have said: \u201cThe rights of compulsory process and due process of law may be violated by the denial of a continuance which prevents a defendant from presenting witnesses on his behalf.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bethea, </em>167 Conn. 80, 83, 355 A.2d 6 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
