(hereinafter E.I.S.),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to discontinue its violations of General Statutes \u00a7 20-306a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>The board issued a complaint pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 20-307a<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> charging E.I.S. with engaging in the practice or offering to practice the profession of engineering without proper registration. Following hearings on July 31,1981, and March 9,1982, the board made the following findings: that E.I.S.\u2019s ordinary business involves analysis of applications submitted to town agencies, preparation of environmental impact statements, and teaching seminars concerning the interrelationship between biology, geology and hydrology and land use decisions; that the Woodbury planning commission asked E.I.S. for an environmental analysis of an application for a proposed business condominium development; and that E.I.S. prepared a report which included statements to the effect that sight lines were in excess of 200 feet, that a solution to this problem was to move the entrance twenty feet south, and that \u201cRip Rap for energy dissipators must be designed into an appropriate water control plan.\u201d The board found that these statements constituted engineering within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 20-299 since they involve \u201cconsultation and evaluation in connection with a privately owned project wherein the public welfare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>and safeguarding of life, public health or property is concerned.\u201d The board concluded that E.I.S. violated General Statutes \u00a7 20-306a by practicing the profession of engineering without a license issued in accordance with chapter 391 of the General Statutes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court and that court dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">On appeal to this court the plaintiff argues on a number of grounds that the trial court erred in upholding the board\u2019s decision that E.I.S. violated General Statutes \u00a7 20-306a by practicing engineering without a license. Because we find that there was insufficient evidence before the board to warrant a finding that E.I.S. was engaged in the practice of professional engineering, we need not address the plaintiff\u2019s other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We note that the interpretation of a statute by an agency created to administer that statute is traditionally accorded great deference. <em>Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>177 Conn. 68, 74, 411 A.2d 28 (1979). A court may, however, reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are arbitrary. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (g) (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The board is empowered to regulate those persons engaged in professional engineering. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7\u00a7 20-300, 20-299. General Statutes \u00a7 20-299 defines a \u201cprofessional engineer\u201d as an individual who, by his knowledge of certain sciences, renders or offers to render \u201cprofessional service such as consultation, investigation, evaluation, planning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>design or responsible supervision of construction, in connection with any public or privately owned structures . . . wherein the public welfare or the safeguarding of life, public health or property is concerned or involved.\u201d The plaintiff contends that the three statements in its report to the town of Woodbury do not constitute the practice of professional engineering. The board argues that the record fully supported its decision that E.I.S.\u2019s statements constituted professional engineering in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 20-306a.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The report prepared by E.I.S. was an environmental analysis of a proposed business condominium development in Woodbury, discussing the environmental effect of the development on a cranberry bog. The three statements cited by the board as constituting engineering were merely comments and suggestions made by an environmental analyst. The preparation of the report did not require knowledge of \u201cmathematics, the physical sciences and the principles of engineering, acquired by professional education and practical experience.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 20-299; see <em>Howarth </em>v. <em>Gilman, </em>365 Pa. 50, 53-54, 73 A.2d 655 (1950); <em>State ex rel. Wisconsin Registration Board of Architects &amp; Professional Engineers </em>v. <em>T. V. Engineers of Kenosha, Inc., </em>30 Wis. 2d 434, 442, 141 N.W.2d 235 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">It is established that regulatory statutes such as the one involved in this case are founded upon the sound policy of the protection of public health and safety, as well as the protection of the public against incompetence and fraud. <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Schmidlin, </em>404 F.2d 87, 93 (3d Cir. 1968); <em>Dick Weatherston\u2019s Associated Mechanical Services, Inc. v. Minn. Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>257 Minn. 184, 189-90, 100 N.W.2d 819 (1960). This purpose is reflected in the language of General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>utes \u00a7 20-299.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> E.I.S. was not involved in the design or planning of the Woodbury project. Rather, its report was merely incidental and preparatory to the project and prepared for the information of the municipal agency involved. See <em>Dick Weatherston\u2019s Associated Mechanical Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Minn. Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 191-92. We conclude that these facts do not support a finding that the plaintiffs report was inimical to life, health, property or public welfare as required by \u00a7 20-299 and did not trespass upon the functions for which only a professional engineer has the requisite skill and training. Id., 191. Any changes that Woodbury chose to implement as a result of E.I.S.\u2019s report would have to be approved and supervised by a licensed engineer thereby protecting the public interest. Id. The board\u2019s finding that the three statements contained in E.I.S.\u2019s environmental impact report constitute professional engineering is therefore arbitrary and has the unreasonable effect of restricting mere commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to sustain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-7\"> The plaintiff Barbara A. Obeda is not a party to this appeal. We therefore refer to E.I.S. as the plaintiff for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1981)] Sec. 20-306a. practice of engineering by corporations, (a) The practice of or the offer to practice engineering in this state by individual registered professional engineers under the corporate form or by a corporation, a material part of the business of which includes engineering, is permitted, provided such personnel of such corporation as act in its behalf as engineers are registered or exempted from registration under the provisions of this chapter, and provided such corporation has been issued a certificate of authorization by the board of registration for professional engineers and land surveyors as provided herein. No such corporation shall be relieved of responsibility for the conduct or acts of its agents, employees or officers by reason of its compliance with the provisions of this section, nor shall any individual practicing engineering be relieved of responsibility for engineering services performed by reason of his employment or relationship with such corporation.

If all requirements of this chapter are met, the board shall issue to such corporation a certificate of authorization within thirty days of such application; provided the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>board may refuse to issue a certificate if any facts exist which would entitle the board to suspend or revoke an existing certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u201c(c) Each such corporation shall file with the board a designation of an individual or individuals registered to practice engineering in this state who shall be in charge of engineering by such corporation in this state.
