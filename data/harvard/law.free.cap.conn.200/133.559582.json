The hospitals claim that the trial court erred: (1) by applying improper standards in its review of the declaratory ruling issued by the commission; and (2) by failing to reverse the declaratory ruling of the commission and to hold that the commission has no authority to regulate capital expenditures that are under the statutory threshold dollar amounts set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 19a-155. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">On September 23, 1982, the hospitals filed with the commission a petition for a declaratory ruling on three questions pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 4-176,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a statement in support of the petition and an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>appendix. The commission voted to consider the petition and held a hearing on December 15,1982, at which the hospitals presented evidence and testimony in support of the requested ruling. Subsequent to that hearing, the enactment of Public Acts 1983, No. 83-215 (now General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-154 and 19a-155), effective on May 26,1983, caused the first two questions raised by the hospitals in the petition to become moot. The only issue raised by the request for a declaratory ruling which has not become moot and the only issue we will consider involves the extent of the commission\u2019s jurisdiction over capital expenditures. On that issue, the hospitals sought the following declaratory ruling: \"[A] capital expenditures budget submitted to the Commission in accordance with the provisions of Section 19-73o (a) [now Section 19a-156 (a)] does not prevent a hospital desiring to undertake additional capital expenditures (not in its capital expenditures budget and not exceeding the minimum jurisdictional dollar amounts set forth in Section 19~73m [now Section 19a-155]), from freely undertaking such additional capital expenditures without Commission review or approval unless they are undertaken in conjunction with new services or functions subject to Commission approval under Section 19-731 [now Section 19a-154] of the Connecticut General Statutes.\u201d The commission issued its declaratory ruling on September 13, 1983, in which it rejected the hospitals\u2019 requested ruling and held that commission approval is required for any capital expenditures, as defined in the regulations, which are not in the approved capital budget, regardless of whether or not the amount of such expenditure falls below the threshold of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-155. The hospitals appealed this decision. On November 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>1984, the trial court, <em>Mack, J., </em>issued a memorandum of decision affirming the commission\u2019s declaratory ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The question at issue arises out of the language contained in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-156<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 19a-155.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 19a-155 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) . . . [A]ny health care facility or institution . . . proposing a capital expenditure exceeding six hundred thousand dollars, or the acquisition of major medical equipment having a cost exceeding four hundred thou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>sand dollars, including the leasing of equipment or a facility, which expenditure was not included in a budget approved under section 19a-156, shall submit a request for approval of such expenditure to the commission . . . . \u201d General Statutes \u00a7 19a-156 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Every hospital . . . shall submit annually to the commission its proposed operating and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>capital expenditures budget for its next fiscal year .... The commission shall review such proposed budget and may, with the consent of the facility or institution, informally discuss such budget with representatives of the facility or institution. The commission shall notify the facility or institution of its approval, denial or modification of such budget not later than forty-five days before such proposed adoption date. . . . [T]he commission shall order the institution to adopt a budget which the commission deems acceptable for the coming fiscal period. . . . (c) In the event of unforeseen and material changes in circumstances during any fiscal year, any hospital or health care facility or institution which has submitted a budget to the commission pursuant to the provisions of this section may submit a proposed revised budget to said commission pursuant to regulations adopted by the commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\u201cThere are clear indications in the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA); General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166\u20144-189; that the legislature intended that the administrators issue declaratory rulings based on their interpretations of statutes.\u201d <em>Connecticut Life &amp; Health Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>173 Conn. 352, 356, 377 A.2d 1099 (1977). The commission therefore was correct in giving its interpretation of whether General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-155 and 19a-156 provide that additional capital expenditures which are not in the capital expenditures budget and which do not exceed the threshold amounts under \u00a7 19a-155 can be freely undertaken without review or approval by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">We first address whether the Superior Court applied the proper standards in its review of the declaratory ruling issued by the commission. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (g) allows judicial modification of a decision of an administrative agency \u201cif substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>trative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: (1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (3) made upon unlawful procedure; (4) affected by other error of law; (5) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (6) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\u201d The trial court appears to have focused its analysis on whether the commission\u2019s declaratory ruling interpreting the statutes was clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record. We do not believe that review of the declaratory ruling should have been so limited. \u201cAlthough the factual and discretionary determinations of administrative agencies are to be given considerable weight by the courts; see General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (g); <em>Board of Aldermen </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Community Antennae Television Co., </em>168 Conn. 294, 298-99, 362 A.2d 529 (1975); <em>Westport </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>167 Conn. 151, 355 A.2d 25 (1974); 2 Am. Jur. 2d, Administrative Law \u00a7\u00a7 645, 675; it is for the courts, and not for administrative agencies, to expound and apply governing principles of law. <em>N.L.R.B. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>380 U.S. 278, 291, 85 S. Ct. 980, 13 L. Ed. 2d 839 (1965); <em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers </em>v. <em>N.L.R.B., </em>487 F.2d 1143, 1170-71 (D.C. Cir. 1973), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, </em>417 U.S. 790, 94 S. Ct. 2737, 41 L. Ed. 2d 477 (1974); 73 C.J.S., Public Administrative Bodies and Procedure \u00a7 69.\u201d <em>Real Estate Listing Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>179 Conn. 128, 138-39, 425 A.2d 581 (1979). This case presents a question of law turning upon the interpretation of statutes. See <em>Brannigan </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>139 Conn. 572, 577, 95 A.2d 798 (1953); <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>131 Conn. 368, 371, 40 A.2d 272 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>We conclude therefore that the trial court\u2019s standard of review was, in the present case, too limited. This conclusion, however, does not require reversal. Rather, we will review the commission\u2019s declaratory ruling with our focus on whether the ruling was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The commission asserts that its declaratory ruling is consistent with the expressed intent of the legislature. \u201cIt is well settled that a statute must be applied as its words direct. <em>Dental Commission </em>v. <em>Tru-Fit Plastics, Inc., </em>159 Conn. 362, 365, 269 A.2d 265 [1970]; <em>Obuchowski </em>v. <em>Dental Commission, </em>149 Conn. 257, 265, 178 A. 537 [1962].\u201d <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>168 Conn. 478, 485, 362 A.2d 785 (1975). The statutory provisions in question are unambiguous. \u201c[I]f the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no room for construction.\u201d Id. \u201c Tt has often been said that the legislative intent is to be found not in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say. <em>Wiegand </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>170 Conn. 567, 581, 368 A.2d 103 (1976); <em>Colli </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>169 Conn. 445, 452, 364 A.2d 167 (1975); <em>Sillman </em>v. <em>Sillman, </em>168 Conn. 144, 148, 358 A.2d 150 (1975).\u2019 <em>Muha </em>v. <em>United Oil Co., </em>180 Conn. 720, 730, 433 A.2d 1009 (1980). Where the language used is clear and unambiguous, we will not speculate as to some supposed intention. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>[181 Conn. 1, 6, 434 A.2d 293 (1980)].\u201d <em>Waterbury Petroleum Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil &amp; Fuel Co., </em>193 Conn. 208, 231, 477 A.2d 988 (1984). Further, where the legislative intent is clearly and unambiguously expressed in the words of the statutes, there is no need for a review of their legislative history. <em>Federal Aviation Administration </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>196 Conn. 546, 550, 494 A.2d 564 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The commission\u2019s declaratory ruling is consistent with the unambiguous language of the statutes in ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>tion and therefore consistent with the expressed intent of the legislature. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-156 clearly authorizes the commission to order a hospital to adopt a capital expenditure budget which the commission finds acceptable. In that statute, there is no language which limits the commission\u2019s authority to the threshold limits of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-155. The capital budget process for capital expenditures described in General Statutes \u00a7 19a-156 clearly applies to all capital expenditures no matter what their cost. In this capital budget process, the commission does not review the individual items within the budget to determine if they are reasonable expenditures, but the total capital budget must be acceptable. It would make little sense to interpret this statute to require approval of a hospital\u2019s budget for all capital expenditures by the commission, but then allow the hospital freely to spend more than the authorized budget as long as the cost of no one capital expenditure reaches the \u00a7 19a-155 threshold. The language of \u00a7\u00a7 19a-155 and 19a-156 nowhere indicates that such an interpretation was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The capital budget process of \u00a7 19a-156 is separate from the procedure described in General Statutes \u00a7 19a-155. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-155 serves a different purpose from that of the overall budget review pursuant to \u00a7 19a-156. It allows the commission to review thoroughly any expenditure over the $600,000/$400,000 threshold \u201cwhich expenditure was not included in a budget approved under section 19a-156.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 19a-155 (a). The specific project is considered \u201cin relation to the community or regional need for such capital program or purchase of land, the possible effect on the operating costs of the health care facility or institution, the recommendations of the Health Systems Agency regarding such proposal, and such other relevant factors as the commission deems necessary.\u201d Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 19a-155 (a). The commission\u2019s interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-155 and 19a-156 conforms to the intent expressed in the statutes and does not render either statute superfluous or contradictory. The statutes are compatible and can coexist.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The commission\u2019s interpretation of the statutes in question is also consistent with the May 18,1982 opinion of the attorney general. Although an opinion of the attorney general is not binding on a court, it is entitled to careful consideration and is generally regarded as highly persuasive. <em>Windham Community Memorial Hospital v. Willimantic, </em>166 Conn. 113, 118, 348 A.2d 651 (1974). The opinion of the attorney general stated that \u201cif a hospital proposes to undertake a capital program which will cause it to exceed its capital expenditures budget but which is less than the threshold requiring review pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19-73m, as amended by Section 6 of Public Act 81-465 [now Section 19a-155], a hospital must obtain the prior approval of the Commission in the form of a revised budget submitted pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19-73o (c), as amended by Section 7 of Public Act 81-465 [now Section 19a-156].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">We find further support for the commission\u2019s position in the regulations which have been subsequently approved by the legislative regulation review committee. The UAPA provides that the term \u201cregulation\u201d means \u201ceach agency statement of general applicability, without regard to its designation that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy, or. describes the organization, procedure or practice requirements of any agency. The term includes the amendment or repeal of a prior regulation, but does not include (A) statements concerning only the internal management of any agency and not affecting private rights or procedures available to the public, (B) declaratory rulings issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>pursuant to section 4-176 or (C) intra-agency or inter-agency memoranda . . . General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (7). \u201cThe power of an administrative agency to prescribe rules and regulations under a statute is not the power to make law, but only the power to adopt regulations to carry into effect the will of the legislature as expressed by the statute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMeglio, </em>385 Pa. 119, 124, 122 A.2d 77 (1956); see <em>Volunteer Firemen\u2019s Relief Assn. </em>v. <em>Minehart, </em>425 Pa. 82, 89, 227 A.2d 632 (1967).\u201d <em>Salmon Brook Convalescent Home </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>177 Conn. 356, 363, 417 A.2d 358 (1979). Regulation \u00a7 19a-160-115 (c)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of Connecticut State Agencies allows the commission to review all capital expenditures both below and above the limits set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 19a-155. The legislative regulation review committee\u2019s ratification of this regulation supports the position that the commission\u2019s review of capital expenditures below the threshold amount of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-155 is part of the general statutory scheme that the legislature provided for the commission\u2019s regulation of hospitals. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-170.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">We conclude, therefore, based on the unambiguous language of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-155 and 19a-156, that the commission\u2019s declaratory ruling was correct. To hold otherwise would render the budget authorization of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-156 meaningless because a hospital could then with impunity spend more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the amount authorized in its capital budget as long as the cost of no one capital expenditure reached the \u00a7 19a-155 threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-8\"> The named plaintiff association is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1981)] Sec. 4-176. declaratory rulings.
