L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, and received a sentence of from twenty-four to thirty years in State prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant argues that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>is unconstitutionally vague on its face. He also argues that the term of imprisonment under the statute (a minimum of twenty years up to life for a first offense) constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under State and Federal constitutional provisions. Both issues presented in the appeal involve a facial challenge to the home invasion statute; hence, for purposes of appellate review, the facts underlying the conviction are not relevant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>395 Mass. 302, 303 n.l (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">1. <em>Vagueness. </em>The well-settled principles for determining whether a criminal statute is unconstitutionally vague and, therefore, a violation of due process are stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 303-304. A criminal statute must be \u201csufficiently clear to give notice of the prohibited conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohmer, </em>374 Mass. 368, 371-372 (1978). The statute must \u201cdefine the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, quoting from <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983). Proscribed conduct need not, however, be set forth by \u201cprecise legal definition\u201d or with \u201cmathematical precision.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Wil<em>liams, supra </em>at 304. A person may fairly be required to conform his conduct \u201cto an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>371 Mass. 732, 734 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">When examining a criminal statute for possible unconstitutional vagueness, we may go beyond the actual language of the statute to give meaning to the words and phrases according to their common law meaning or statutory history. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 581 (1977). A criminal statute is to be construed strictly against the Commonwealth and in favor of the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>391 Mass. 718, 720 (1984). But a statute need not be so strictly construed \u201c \u2018as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature\u2019 or \u2018to override common sense.\u2019 \u201d LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 2.2(d), at 109 (1986), quoting from <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>423 U.S. 212, 218 (1976), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>423 U.S. 122, 145 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Bearing these principles in mind, we examine the statute to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>determine if it is impermissibly vague. General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 18C, inserted by St. 1993, c. 333, and approved with an emergency preamble, establishes the crime of home invasion. The statute, in pertinent part, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">\u201cWhoever knowingly enters the dwelling place of another knowing or having reason to know that one or more persons are present within or knowingly enters the dwelling place of another and remains in such dwelling place knowing or having reason to know that one or more persons are present within while armed with a dangerous weapon, uses force or threatens the imminent use of force upon any person within such dwelling place whether or not injury occurs, or intentionally causes any injury to any person within such dwelling place shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of not less than twenty years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">From the language quoted, the defendant asserts a number of ambiguities which he claims could make criminal otherwise innocent conduct. First, he contends that the statute fails to distinguish a lawful from an unlawful entry. The term \u201centers\u201d within the statute is given no special definition. Nonetheless, the word is to be construed as an unlawful entry, consistent with its use in a criminal context. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 533 (6th ed. 1990) (\u201cIn criminal law, entry is the unlawful making [of] one\u2019s way into a dwelling or other house, for the purpose of committing a crime therein\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ricardo, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 345, 355 (1988) (for purposes of armed assault within a dwelling, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18A, entry must be \u201cunprivileged\u201d or unlawful). Indeed, the act\u2019s very caption \u2014 \u201cAn Act Establishing the Crime of Home Invasion\u201d \u2014 bespeaks legislative intent that a consensual or privileged entry is not an \u201cinvasion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Further, the word \u201centers\u201d appears in related statutory contexts, including G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18A, and G. L. c. 266, \u00a7\u00a7 14-19 (pertaining generally to burglary and to breaking and entering). As here, the word contemplates the common law meaning of an unlawful, or nonconsensual, entry. Terms appearing within the same or related statutes are to be given the same meaning unless the Legislature intends a different meaning. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 531, 535 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"A2dO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>The defendant next points out that the statute\u2019s omission of a comma immediately before the phrase, \u201cwhile armed with a dangerous weapon,\u201d means that that phrase could refer to the occupant of the dwelling and not to the perpetrator. We need not interpret a statute so as \u201cto override common sense,\u201d LaFave, <em>supra </em>at 109, or reach an absurd result, even when faced with minor and insignificant flaws or oversights in draftsmanship. The simple insertion of a comma immediately before the phrase makes the meaning clear. Other criminal statutes include the same element or requirement as the home invasion statute that a perpetrator be \u201carmed with a dangerous weapon.\u201d See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17 (armed robbery); G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18 (assault with intent to rob or murder); G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18A (armed assault in a dwelling); and G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 14 (armed burglary). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, supra </em>at 535. The phrase \u201carmed with a dangerous weapon\u201d obviously refers to the perpetrator of the crime of home invasion and not to the potential victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The defendant seizes upon the statute\u2019s failure to state what constitutes \u201ca dangerous weapon,\u201d or to specify whether the dangerous weapon is legally or illegally possessed, or even to make clear whether the force or threat of force must be occasioned by actual use of the dangerous weapon. Nowhere in the roundup of statutes we have already cited is \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d defined. Rather, its meaning is left largely to the fact finder to determine \u201cthe instrumentalities\u2019 s potential for harm as it might. . . objectively seem[ ] to a reasonable individual.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tarrant, </em>367 Mass. 411, 414 (1975) (referring to dangerous weapon under the armed robbery statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17). What constitutes \u201ca dangerous weapon\u201d does not fluctuate with the particular statute in which that term appears. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 7, 15-16 (1995). The failure to describe what is meant by a dangerous weapon does not render the statute vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Whether a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d is illegally possessed or is used during the commission of the crime of home invasion to commit an assault or battery is irrelevant under the statute. When the Legislature has intended to criminalize the unlawful, versus lawful, possession of certain types of weapons, it has done so. See G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10. And when the Legislature has intended to distinguish crimes that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>committed \u201cby means of a dangerous weapon\u201d from other crimes that are committed simply by \u201cbeing armed with a dangerous weapon,\u201d whether or not the weapon is actually used, it has also done so. Compare G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A (assault and battery with a dangerous weapon), and G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B (assault with a dangerous weapon), with G. L. c. 265, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 18, 18A, and G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 14. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 766, 768 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Finally, the defendant complains of the statute\u2019s lack of specificity as to the modicum of actual or threatened force that is required. According to the defendant, a mere offensive touching of the dwelling\u2019s occupant could suffice. We agree that serious bodily injury need not be inflicted or threatened in order to satisfy the element of force. That, however, does not render the statute invalid. As with robbery, \u201cthe degree of force is immaterial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>362 Mass. 83, 87 (1972). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 489, 491 (1981). The defendant who \u201cthreatens the imminent use of force,\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, has committed criminal assault regardless of whether the dwelling\u2019s occupant was in fear or apprehension of harm, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 653, 657 (1993), or whether the defendant actually intended to harm the occupant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matsos, </em>421 Mass. 391, 395 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">We conclude that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, is not unconstitutionally vague. The elements of the crime \u2014 most of which appear in substantially the same form elsewhere in related criminal statutes \u2014 are set forth with reasonable clarity and provide adequate notice of the conduct that the Legislature wishes to proscribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">2. <em>Cruel and unusual punishment. </em>The defendant contends that the statute\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years \u2014 compared to sentences that appear in other criminal statutes \u2014 is excessive and disproportionate, amounting to cruel and unusual punishment. We do not lightly second guess or upset the Legislature\u2019s independent determinations concerning particular conduct it wishes to criminalize and the sanctions it wishes to prescribe for that conduct to vindicate the community\u2019s legitimate interests in a secure, peaceable, and orderly society. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>413 Mass. 224, 233 (1992), and cases cited. A defendant, therefore, bears a heavy burden of showing that a particular punishment that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>has been established by the Legislature exceeds the limitations of art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights or the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, to reach the level of cruel and unusual punishment. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marcus, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 698, 699 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Specifically, a defendant must persuade a reviewing court that the punishment is \u201cso disproportionate to the crime that it \u2018shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>In re Lynch, </em>8 Cal. 3d 410, 424 (1972). When analyzing a claim that a punishment is disproportionate to the offense committed, we consider three factors: \u201c(1) the nature of the offender and offence in light of the degree of harm to society; (2) sentencing provisions in other jurisdictions for similar offenses; and (3) sentences for more severe offenses within the Commonwealth. \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarez, supra </em>at 234, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therriault, </em>401 Mass. 237, 240 &amp; n.l (1987). In light of the Supreme Court decision in <em>Solem </em>v. <em>Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 292 (1983), the Supreme Judicial Court noted that the disproportionality test adopted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 910-913 (1976), \u201cset[ ] forth the appropriate standard for reviewing . . . cruel and unusual punishment claim[s] under both State and Federal constitutional law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therriault, supra </em>at 240 n.3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s claim comes up short on each of these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">We consider in particular the first factor concerning the nature of the offense of home invasion and the degree of harm to society that the statute seeks to prevent. The crime of home invasion is akin to that of armed burglary, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 14, and armed assault within a dwelling, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18A. The latter two crimes presently carry sentences of from ten years to life. The Supreme Judicial Court has previously determined that a minimum sentence of ten years for armed burglary and a sentence to any term of years for armed assault within a dwelling are not cruel and unusual punishments for crimes the court described as \u201camong the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>serious ... in our jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>363 Mass. 601, 611 (1973).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">What sets home invasion apart from the other two crimes \u2014 and we think legitimately triggers a longer minimum sentence \u2014 is the additional element that the armed intruder knows, or should know, that an occupant is present before he enters the dwelling. The intruder\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge on that score, we think, dramatically heightens the risk of a potentially deadly encounter with a frightened or startled occupant. Indeed, the unlawful entry into a dwelling, even absent knowledge that someone is present inside, \u201cinevitably poses a high degree of danger to any and all occupants.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Claudio, </em>418 Mass. 103, 109 (1994). Moreover, that risk is even greater considering that an occupant within his own dwelling has no duty to retreat in the face of deadly force before resorting to deadly force in self-defense. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 8A, inserted by St. 1981, c. 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The Legislature may establish disparate penalties for similar types of crimes where there is a legitimate objective served. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brisson, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 418, 423 (1991). Hence, the Legislature may exact a harsher price for criminal offenses with a higher degree of criminal culpability. The home invasion statute punishes more severely the armed intruder who invades another\u2019s dwelling while knowing that one or more individuals are present and then proceeds to assault those individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Comparison of the punishment imposed by G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, with the punishments imposed by similar statutes in other States leads to the conclusion that our statute\u2019s term of imprisonment is not grossly disproportionate. Michigan<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Florida,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the two States with statutes somewhat similar to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, impose prison sentences ranging from a maximum of twenty years in Michigan to a maximum of thirty years in Florida but do not impose minimum sentences. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The Illinois home invasion .statute<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is substantially the same as G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, and it imposes a minimum sentence of from six years to a maximum sentence of thirty years. These sentences \u2014 in particular the sentence imposed by Illinois \u2014 are not so disparate from the Commonwealth\u2019s sentence of from twenty years to life as to offend against any disproportionality principle for cruel or unusual punishment under art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Here, where there are only two States that have comparable statutes, the fact that one State imposed a more severe punishment does not indicate anything \u201cmore than different exercises of legislative judgment.\u201d By enacting G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, the Legislature did not demonstrate \u201cunrestrained\u201d use of its power. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 914 (1976), quoting from <em>Weems </em>v. <em>United States, </em>217 U.S. 349, 381 (1910). Cf. <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 495, 498 (1981), appeal dismissed, 455 U.S. 931 (1982) (upholding, though no other State had imposed as severe a sentence, a forty to fifty year sentence for possession of a machine gun). \u201cThe inherent nature of our Federal system . . . result[s] in a wide range of constitutional sentences.\u201d <em>Solem, supra </em>at 290-291 n.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We are hard-pressed to compare punishment under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, with punishments for \u201cmore serious offenses within the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>413 Mass, at 234. The \u201cmore appropriate comparison,\u201d in this case, is with punishments for similar offenses. See <em>ante </em>at 63-64; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrault, </em>401 Mass, at 241. It suffices to say, however, that the crimes of manslaughter (in certain of its forms), G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13; armed robbery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22(a); and aggravated rape, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22(a), all carry sentences for any term of years up to and including life.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In sum, we conclude that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, is not unconstitutionally vague and does not impose cruel or unusual punishment for the crime of home invasion. The defendant\u2019s conviction under the statute is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-15\">In addition, the defendant received sentences of from five to six years in State prison on each of three guilty verdicts \u2014 two for assault with a dangerous weapon and one for illegal possession of a firearm. The five to six year sentences all run concurrently with the twenty-four to thirty year sentence. The defendant received an additional concurrent one year sentence to a house of correction for unlawfully possessing a firearm without a valid firearms identification card.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\">At this juncture, we have no need to, nor do we, address the most recent Supreme Court decision, <em>Harmelin </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957 (1991), concerning the Federal constitutional proscription against cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b90-8\">General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 18A, armed assault within a dwelling, was amended by St. 1969, c. 473, to establish the present ten year minimum sentence. Prior to that, the sentence was for any term of years up to life. The offenses charged in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrow </em>predated the 1969 amendment. Hence, the <em>Morrow </em>case does not explicitly pass on whether a ten year minimum sentence for committing armed assault within a dwelling is cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Michigan Comp.
