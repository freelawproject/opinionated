The defendants are members of the board of trustees for the unit owner organization of the condominium.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">In 1993, the declarant, also referred to more commonly as the developer, brought suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as to two matters: its right to finish construction of the last two sub-phases of the condominium, and its ownership interest in the land upon which such sub-phases were to be built. The unit owners by counterclaim sought countervailing declaratory and injunctive relief, requesting determinations that the developer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>right to build the last two sub-phases had expired and that the land in question was part of the condominium\u2019s common area.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Following a bench trial, the judge declared that the developer\u2019s right to construct the last two sub-phases had expired and that the land on which those phases were to be built is owned by the developer. The unit owner trustees appeal the latter part of the judgment; no cross appeal was filed. The only issue before us, then, is whether the land upon which the last two sub-phases were to be built is condominium common area or is owned by the developer. Because we conclude that the subject land is common area, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\"><em>Background facts.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The developer recorded the master deed for the condominium on June 26, 1985, pursuant to G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 8. The master deed described the premises constituting the condominium as encompassing the entire parcel of 46.2 acres of land, including the subject land. Nothing in the record suggests that the parcel is divisable or is comprised of more than one legal lot. At the time the master deed was recorded, the developer had constructed twenty-eight units denominated sub-phases la and lb of Phase I and, accordingly, recorded the site plans and \u201cas built\u201d plans required by G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 8, as to those first two sub-phases of Phase I. The master deed specifically reserved to the developer for seven years the right to amend the master deed so as to submit to c. 183A<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> additional phases and sub-phases, as depicted on referenced plans, upon substantial completion of the construction of additional buildings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Subsequent sub-phases of the condominium (Ic-h; Ila-c; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Hla-d) comprising 240 units were thereafter constructed and the master deed was duly amended a number of times to reflect the particular buildings added, their location, the location of common areas and the changes in beneficial ownership by unit owners. \u201cAs built\u201d plans and site plans for the additional buildings were also recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The final two planned sub-phases (IIIe-f) were not constructed within the seven-year period reserved to the developer for phased development, and no master deed amendments, site plans, or \u201cas built\u201d plans pertaining to such sub-phases were recorded. The trial judge found that because no documents pertaining to sub-phases (III e-f) were ever recorded, the developer \u201cnever effectively added sub-phases 3e and 3f to the condominium.\u201d He based that finding upon his determination that \u201cwhen the Master Deed was recorded, the only site plans and \u2018as built\u2019 building plans recorded were those pertaining to phase I, subphase la and lb. As such plans are a mandatory part of a Master Deed pursuant to G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 8, the Master Deed was incomplete and hence inadequate to add subphases II and III to the condominium without further amendment.\u201d He then declared that \u201cthe land constituting Phase in, subphases 3e and 3f, has not been effectively conveyed by the DiBiase Corporation to the Pickman Park Condominium, and that the land constituting Phase III, subphases 3e and 3f is owned by DiBiase Corporation free and clear of any legal or equitable claim thereto by Pickman Park Condominium.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The unit owner trustees contend that the judge erred as matter of law in ruling that title to the subject land remained in the developer. They observe that the master deed\u2019s description of the premises constituting the condominium included the entire 46.2 acre parcel. They suggest that the trial judge misconstrued both the requirements of G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 8, and the master deed\u2019s language concerning the role of master deed amendments in the phasing process. This led the judge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>conclude, erroneously they argue, that subsequent conveyances of land are necessary when adding phases of the condominium. The developer, in contrast, contends that a valid condominium exists only as to the land, buildings, and improvements thereon concerning which all requirements of G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 8, had been met at the time submitted to c. 183A. Here, when the master deed was originally recorded, it was accompanied by site plans and \u201cas built\u201d plans only for sub-phases la and lb. The developer argues that, accordingly, a valid condominium existed only as to the land, buildings, and improvements constituting those two sub-phases. It was only with the subsequent amendments pertaining to later phases that, on this view, the land, buildings, and improvements constituting those phases were submitted to c. 183A and became part of the condominium.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">We think it clear from the language of the master deed and plans recorded in 1985 that the developer intended the entire 46.2 acre parcel to constitute the condominium along with the extant initially constructed buildings and improvements in sub-phases la and lb. The buildings and improvements which the developer planned to construct in subsequent development phases pursuant to its reserved rights would be constructed on land already submitted to c. 183A, i.e., on common area land. As to those subsequent phases, the developer reserved the right to amend the master deed in order to submit to c. 183A those later constructed buildings and improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Neither the language of paragraph 16(a) of the master deed nor the requirements of c. 183A, \u00a7 8,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> alter this analysis. While perhaps somewhat inartful in its reference to land as being among those things the developer reserved the right to add via amendment of the master deed, the plain import of paragraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>16(a) permits the developer a limited period of time within which further to develop, in phases, the condominium already subject to c. 183A. Indeed, the amendments that the developer recorded in this regard are instructive insofar as they do not purport to convey additional land when adding phases; instead, the amendments reflect the particular buildings added, their location, the location of remaining common areas, and the changes in beneficial ownership by unit owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The developer reserved the right to conduct phased development, but had no obligation under the terms of the master deed to do so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Had no further phases beyond the first two sub-phases been developed, the Pickman Park Condominium would consist of the sub-phase la and lb buildings and improvements situated upon the 46.2 acre parcel of land described in the master deed as the \u201cpremises.\u201d There is no indication that the developer deviated from the requirements of G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 8, in 1985 as to the parcel of land submitted to the statute or as to then existing buildings and improvements situated thereon, i.e., sub-phases la and lb. The descriptive and \u201cas built\u201d plan requirements of \u00a7 8, sensibly construed, pertain only to existing buildings and improvements submitted to the statute. As the words connote, \u201cas built\u201d plans, in particular, contemplate edifices already in being. Section 8\u2019s requirement of \u201cas built\u201d plans can have no application either to land or to buildings yet to be constructed. A valid condominium was thus created in 1985; the master deed was neither incomplete nor inadequate with respect to the land, buildings, and improvements then submitted to c. 183 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">As to subsequent phases and sub-phases, amendments to the master deed were necessary in order to include within the condominium later constructed buildings and improvements and to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 8. Hence, \u201cas built\u201d and other descriptive plans pertaining to the later constructed buildings and improvements were recorded as part of the phasing amendments. Section 8 required nothing further as to the land, already submitted to c. 183A and described pursuant to \u00a7 <em>8(b), </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>on which those new buildings and improvements were constructed. The master deed described the entire parcel of land from the outset, and the entire parcel of 46.2 acres was common area from the time the master deed was recorded in 1985. It is owned by the unit owners as tenants in common in proportion to their respective undivided interests. <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Boudreaux, </em>410 Mass. 435, 438 (1991). <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 452, 456 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">We conclude that it was error to declare that title to the land upon which the last two sub-phases were to be built remained in the developer. We remand this matter to the Superior Court for entry of a declaratory judgment consistent with this opinion, declaring that title to the subject land is in the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\">We take these facts from the judge\u2019s findings, supplemented by the uncontroverted evidence of record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Chapter 183A provides that a condominium is created when it is \u201csubmitted\u201d to the provisions of the chapter.

L. c. 183A, \u201cprobably did not anticipate phased condominiums.\u201d <em>Barclay </em>v. <em>DeVeau, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 236, 247 (Greaney, J., dissenting), <em>S.C., </em>384 Mass. 676 (1981). Nonetheless, as our appellate decisions have recognized, phased condominiums are a reality notwithstanding statutory silence on the subject. See <em>Tosney </em>v. <em>Chelmsford Village Condominium Assn., </em>397 Mass. 683 (1986); <em>Podell </em>v. <em>Lahn, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 688, 689 n.3 (1995); <em>Suprenant </em>v. <em>First Trade Union Sav. Bank, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 637 (1996). As with other \u201cmutations which creative real estate lawyers have contrived,\u201d <em>Barclay, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. at 247, where the statute does not specifically address the issue in question, a flexible interpretation of the statute, viewed as an enabling act, is to be preferred. See <em>Barclay </em>v. <em>DeVeau, </em>384 Mass, at 682; <em>Tosney, supra </em>at 686-687. We construe \u00a7 8 in this light.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Paragraph 16(b)(i) reserves to the developer the right \u201c[t]o develop and construct additions to the Condominium, including, without limitation, buildings, roads, ways, utilities and other improvements and amenities pertaining thereto; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall obligate Declarant to commence or complete construction of additional buildings or other improvements on the land reserved for phasing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
