He moved for a new trial; the trial judge without a hearing entered an order denying the motion. On appeal from the conviction and the judge\u2019s order to this court, we reversed the order and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing of the new trial motion. The trial judge conducted such a hearing and denied the motion. On the present appeal from the denial, we again reverse, and now order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>Substance of the trial (October, 1992). </em>Lesa Zollo left work at \u201cTop It Off,\u201d a clothing store on Highland Street in Worcester, around 6 P.M. on January 16, 1992. Walking to her car in a parking space at the corner of Highland and West Streets, Zollo saw a man \u201ccoming across between the back of two buildings,\u201d seemingly headed toward a nearby store. Aware of the dangers of the location at night, Zollo cut over diagonally to reach her car quickly. The man moved behind her as she entered her car. He pulled her out of the car and pinned her down beneath the car door. He kicked her and said, \u201cLet it go. Let it go.\u201d He seized her pocketbook and made off and ran back between the two buildings. Zollo thought the attack lasted perhaps five minutes. The parking space was illuminated only by a street light of an old-fashioned green type.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">During the next hour, Zollo went to the local police station. She described the man to Detective Faith Tozeski as a light-skinned black man, 5\u20197\u201d to 5\u20199\u201d in height, and said he was wearing oval-shaped thick plastic glasses and a short blue or black nylon jacket with a quilted lining.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Zollo was shown an array of photographs in black and white of seven black male faces and selected that of the defendant, assisting herself by drawing eyeglasses on the defendant\u2019s picture. She said she was confident \u201ceight out of ten\u201d that this was her assailant. Zollo was then shown an array in color of seven black male faces which included from the previous array only the defendant\u2019s picture; she selected that picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Detective Tozeski and her partner went searching for the defendant, who was known to Tozeski, and about 10:15 P.M. that evening they found him walking on Piedmont Street at a place one and one-half miles from the scene of the robbery. At the detective\u2019s request, the defendant came over to speak with her and entered the police cruiser. Tozeski told the defendant she was going to arrest him on an outstanding warrant (based on an extraneous charge). Promptly the defendant quit the car and fled. The police soon caught up with him hiding in an apartment in a building at 147 Austin Street, perhaps a mile and one-half from the crime scene. The defendant was a dark-skinned black man, 5\u20194\u201d in height, he had on a tan coat over a gray hooded sweatshirt, he was not wearing eyeglasses and had none in his possession, and he had none of Zollo\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>At a \u201cone on one viewing\u201d at the police station that evening Zoilo recognized the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Tozeski testified that she had seen the defendant wearing eyeglasses at least five times but she could not remember when. The Commonwealth called another officer, Robert Couture. He said the defendant\u2019s apartment was three to four blocks from the crime scene. The officer said he had twice seen the defendant wearing glasses. He recalled one time within the last \u201csix months at most\u201d when he stopped the defendant outside a bar: he was wearing wire-rimmed glasses. But the defendant as part of his case (based essentially upon misidentification) showed that he was in the Worcester house of correction during the six-month period referred to (so it was the officer who probably misidentified); the defendant also established through a prison medical report that he had 20/30 vision in one eye and 20/20 vision in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\"><em>Sentencing episode. </em>At the sentencing hearing on the same day as the guilty verdict, the prosecutor spoke of Zoilo\u2019s victim impact statement and what it set forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">Prosecutor: \u201cShe has written up the victim witness statement. I think one of our people inside still has that. She did turn it over to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">\u201cThe young lady tells me that the day after this crime, she got two calls on the same night or the following day by a man describing some of the effects she had in her purse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">Court: \u201cDescribing what?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">Prosecutor: \u201cSome of the effects she had in her purse. She didn\u2019t recognize the voice, she couldn\u2019t tell. She had some photos in her purse. She said at first I even thought it was my husband because of the words of intimacy he was using, but soon realized that [it] wasn\u2019t him, especially given the state I was in. I hung up the phone, he called back a few minutes later, he went on again and again describing some various pictures she had where she had modeled in the years past, and pictures she had kept where she had modeled different clothes, outfits, swimming suit outfits, things like that. If anything, that only aggravated my distraught even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>more than being assaulted by this defendant. Given that someone out there I don\u2019t know, who knew where I lived, knew my phone number, knew my identity, knew what I looked like. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">It is worth noting that Zoilo said the caller was resorting to \u201csome of the effects she had in her purse,\u201d and that he \u201cdescribed\u201d them, particularly \u201cvarious pictures she had.\u201d As to the pertinence of all this to sentencing, manifestly the prosecutor was suggesting to the judge, in aggravation of the crime of robbery itself, that the defendant was responsible for taunting and perhaps threatening the victim with salacious insinuations. Curiously, however, the prosecutor did not advert to whether the defendant was in any position to make those calls.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge sentenced the defendant to from eight to fifteen years imprisonment (\u201cforthwith\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> beyond the four years, seven months guideline reported to the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\"><em>New trial peremptorily denied (February, 1994). </em>The defendant, through new counsel, appealed his conviction to this court. The appeal was stayed to permit him to move below for a new trial, which he did on January 31, 1994. The motion attacked the prosecutor\u2019s failure to disclose the potentially exculpatory information about the telephone calls until after the guilty verdict. The motion argued that the information so withheld, constituting newly discovered evidence, could have been a real factor in the jury\u2019s deliberations. The motion was documented and subjoined with sworn statements by defendant\u2019s trial counsel and previous counsel that they were not informed of the telephone calls which were disclosed only at sentencing. On February 3, 1994, the motion judge, who had been the trial judge, wrote \u201cdenied\u201d on the motion without according any hearing, evidentiary or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\"><em>Reversal and remand (March, 1995). </em>Upon review here, a panel of our court held that the judge had erred in denying the new trial motion out of hand. By memorandum and order pursuant to our rule 1:28, the panel remanded for an evidentiary hearing. The panel noted that Zollo had formally identified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>defendant as the assailant, but that \u201cthe dangers of a good faith mistake in identification are well known. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>372 Mass. 783, 789 (1977).\u201d Even without regard to the newly discovered evidence following from the prosecutor\u2019s late disclosure,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> said the panel, there were reasons to doubt the identification: the discrepancies in skin color, height, and clothing; the perpetrator\u2019s wearing thick eyeglasses when the defendant had nearly perfect vision; and the lack of circumstantial evidence that it was the defendant who committed the crime.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The case was ordered remanded and the judge was directed to consider in an evidentiary hearing the events involved in the victim\u2019s impact statement and in particular to make findings, see Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979), about when Zoilo received the telephone calls and the content of the conversations. The judge was then to render his opinion whether the defendant was entitled to a new trial, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 413 (1992): \u201cThe judge must determine whether there is a substantial risk that the jury would have reached a different conclusion if the evidence had been admitted at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>[397 Mass. 303, 306 (1986)]. Would it have been a real factor in the jury\u2019s deliberations?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\"><em>Evidentiary hearing (August, 1995). </em>The trial judge, as directed, conducted an evidentiary hearing. Principal witnesses called by the defendant were Tozeski, Zollo, and defendant\u2019s trial counsel. Tozeski and Zollo between them testified to the robbery, Zollo\u2019s description of the assailant, and so forth consistently with the evidence at the trial. Zollo described the two noncollect telephone calls she received at home at 8 A.M. the morning following the crime. The caller said, \u201cGood morning, sexy\u201d and Zollo answered, \u201cGood morning,\u201d before she realized it was a stranger\u2019s voice. The caller went on to talk about her feet and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>sexy toes, said she had a nice body, and commented on various parts of her anatomy, her basic body shape, and upper torso. Discomfited and insulted, Zollo hung up. The phone rang again, the caller started with, \u201cGood morning, sexy,\u201d and Zollo hung up. She testified that the caller did not refer specifically to any of the contents of her stolen pocketbook, but it was her impression that the caller had the contents before him, in particular a photo taken some years earlier of herself in a bathing suit, a time when she was slimmer and more shapely and sensuous than at present. Zollo also observed that the caller presumably got her home telephone number from material in the pocketbook (her number had been changed recently).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Accordingly, considering the improbability that the defendant could have made the calls from detention, there was a likelihood that the caller was the very assailant who remained at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Zoilo said she had received salacious calls from time to time in the past at work and at home. She attributed these to the fact the shop handled lingerie. She was shaky whether she had signed a victim impact statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Counsel who tried the case for the defendant reiterated in his testimony that he learned about the telephone calls only after verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">On the part of the Commonwealth, the prosecutor \u2014 who served at the trial and on the motion \u2014 took the witness stand and was examined by a colleague. He now gave it as his recollection that he had in fact advised defense counsel of the telephone calls before verdict, and further, that the matter was somehow laid before the judge (although nothing of the sort appeared in the trial transcript). He was blurry and indefinite about a victim impact statement. Taken in cross-examination, the prosecutor was reminded of his duty to tell the truth and was confronted with the transcript of his remarks at the time of sentencing. The prosecutor responded, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how I could have said that\u201d (at sentencing).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>Judge\u2019s negative conclusion. </em>In his \u201cFindings of fact, rulings of law, and order on defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial,\u201d the judge reviewed the Commonwealth\u2019s case at trial and acknowledged its weakness \u2014 take the inconsistency between Zoilo\u2019s description of the assailant and the defendant\u2019s actual appearance. The judge accepted that Zoilo had signed a victim impact statement (now lost) of whose content defense counsel was informed after, not before, the verdict. The judge appeared to agree that the prosecution was at fault in failing to make timely disclosure of the telephone calls which figured as exculpatory material and probably as part of Zollo\u2019s witness statement (see note 4, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Analyzing the substance of the calls, what stuck with the judge was that, according to Zollo\u2019s testimony, the caller did not describe specifically any items contained in the pocketbook, the bathing suit picture or anything else. When Zollo assumed or inferred, because of the caller\u2019s talk of her bodily features and his possession of her telephone number, that he had access to the pocketbook and might therefore be the assailant, she was making, the judge said, an \u201cunsupported assumption.\u201d The judge also said the question whether the defendant himself could have made the calls from detention \u201cwas not fully resolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The judge thus concluded in effect that only (1) where the caller specifically described items in the pocketbook, and (2) it was shown there was no remaining likelihood that the defendant could have made the calls from detention, would evidence of the telephone calls, if admitted at trial and heard by the jury, figure as a real factor in their deliberations or raise a substantial risk that they would reach a different conclusion. On this basis the judge ruled against a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\"><em>Present appeal. </em>The judge might have observed that his rigid formula had once in fact been complied with. The prosecutor at sentencing reported that, according to Zollo, the caller described some of the contents of the pocketbook. This measurably fulfilled the first part of the judge\u2019s formula. As for any likelihood that it was the defendant who was the caller, this must be counted so slight as to be negligible. We would have to assume that on the night, sometime before his arrest, the defendant committed to memory Zollo\u2019s telephone number, together with an appreciation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>of her bodily proportions, and then accomplished a feat of telephoning her twice from detention.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> So the second part of the formula was in substance satisfied. And we need to recall that the prosecutor was reporting Zollo\u2019s recollection of the calls as of some months, not years, after the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The judge, however, fastened on Zollo\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing in 1995, and we follow suit. Zollo then said it was her impression that the caller had access to the contents of the pocketbook, notably the photo or photos and the telephone number. This would not do under the judge\u2019s strict formula, but we submit that the formula was arbitrary and was not sensitive to how a jury might go about deciding the case. Our goal is to divine how a jury would react if they heard Zollo\u2019s statement of her impression. It is not a question of the weight a judge would assign to this information; rather the jury must be taken as the reagent. As the court said in <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass, at 411:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">\u201cThe law of the Commonwealth thus preserves, as well as it can in the circumstances, the defendant\u2019s right to the judgment of his peers. The issue, we think, is not what, if any, impact the late disclosed evidence has on the judge\u2019s personal assessment of the trial record. After all, the goal is to determine what could have happened if the prosecution had fulfilled its pretrial duty to disclose the exculpatory evidence and the jury had seen [that evidence].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">How the jury would react is of course a matter of speculation, but we think there is good ground to believe that the jury would attend seriously to Zoilo\u2019s impression or inference that a person, very likely not the defendant,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was in possession of the contents of the pocketbook and thus fell under the suspicion of being the perpetrator. Indeed, the judge in colloquy with counsel recognized that the jury might take just that line. The judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u201cNow, if she [Zoilo] felt that way, why don\u2019t you think the jury would feel the same way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">\u201cYou decide the case on inferences, don\u2019t you? I mean, the jury could decide \u2014 couldn\u2019t they infer, just draw the same inference that she drew?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">This reaction and line of thought was the more likely because, apart from the information withheld by the Commonwealth, the case was a weak one for conviction. With the scale teetering in balance on the basic circumstances of the crime, it would be quite natural for the jury to pay attention to collateral factors and even to make them decisive. Regarding the bearing of the weakness of the Commonwealth\u2019s case upon the allowance of a new trial based on new evidence (including exculpatory evidence previously withheld), compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>376 Mass. 1, 3 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>382 Mass. 1, 9 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallarelli, </em>399 Mass. 17, 22 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 435, 441-442 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trung Chi Truong, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 668, 674-675 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">We are by no means saying that Zollo\u2019s testimony, if heard by the jury, would necessarily persuade them to acquit. The jury might consider the possibility (also a possibility where the judge\u2019s formula is strictly applied) that the defendant, having committed the crime, discarded the pocketbook which happened to be picked up and then exploited by a stranger. Conceivably the caller was just one of Zollo\u2019s mashers. But justice requires that a jury on retrial shall receive the information about the telephone calls and appraise and decide. See <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass, at 413-415:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">\u201cOur standard recognizes the role of the jury. It also does not mandate, as a condition of the granting of a new trial, that a judge conclude that a reasonable doubt would have been created if the undisclosed evidence had been before the jury. It is enough that, on a full and reasonable assessment of the trial record, the absent evidence would have played an important role in the jury\u2019s deliberations and conclusions, even though it is not certain that the evidence would have produced a verdict of not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Finally, we say that a new trial seems quite appropriate where the Commonwealth withheld exculpatory evidence until after verdict, then used it in dubious fashion to try to increase the sentence, then attempted to claim that it had in fact disclosed the evidence t\u00f3 defense counsel before verdict, then gave an indefinite account of the material document, which it lost or could not produce.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">We are mindful that the views of the motion judge on an issue of new trial, especially when he or she was also the trial judge, are entitled to much respect. This, however, is an instance where the criteria expressed by the judge in denying the motion were not suited to the situation and in our opinion led to error.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The judgment is reversed, the verdict is set aside, and the case will stand for a new trial if the Commonwealth is so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-14\">The judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for required findings of not guilty on three related indictments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\">As appeared in the eventual evidentiary hearing, the defense trial counsel was nonplussed by the prosecutor\u2019s late disclosure and did not react except to ask the judge to limit the sentence to the basic guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Thus the sentence for the armed robbery would run in part alongside another sentence that expired in June, 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In a pretrial conference report, the Commonwealth had promised \u201cmandatory\u201d disclosure of exculpatory evidence, and, under \u201cdiscretionary\u201d disclosure, the disclosure of written witness statements. The latter could be viewed as a \u201cspecific\u201d rather than general request for exculpatory material. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallarelli, 399 </em>Mass. 17, 21-22 (1987) (request for scientific reports and police reports considered specific). Failure to disclose a statement by Zollo would thus count more heavily against the Commonwealth than a delinquency related to a general request. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 405 (1992). For purposes of the present appeal, we need not insist on the distinction, as the case for a new trial is strong in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The panel might have added, and we now do, that as carried out, the photographic and one-on-one identifications were not reassuring.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b185-9\">We omit discussion of witnesses called by the defendant at the evidentiary hearing in an effort to show that one Troy Neely might have committed the crime with which the defendant was charged. Neely more nearly resembled Zollo\u2019s description of the perpetrator than did the defendant, and his modus operand! \u2014 attacks on lone women \u2014 looked like the perpetrator\u2019s. The recurrent purse snatchings in the area did not abate when the defendant was arrested in January. 1992. Neely was arrested in January. 1993, charged with a series of recent purse snatchings; these crimes ceased with his arrest. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the year\u2019s difference of time, besides other factors, made attribution of. the instant offense to Neely difficult to sustain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b187-8\">We have of record a paper dated March 20, 1992, from the Worcester house of correction which outlined the policy of the institution regarding telephone calls by inmates. The paper, dealing also with other subjects, called for authorization by higher authority, which apparently was given on January 12, 1993, but the telephone policy strikes us as having been ongoing. In short, the policy would not admit of the defendant\u2019s being able to make the two telephone calls at 8 A.M. on January 17, 1992. (This matter can be readily clarified at retrial.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b187-9\">See discussion at note 7, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
