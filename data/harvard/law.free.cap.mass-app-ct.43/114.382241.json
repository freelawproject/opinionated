See <em>Sciaba Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 181, 181 n.2 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b141-6\">Dreben, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATp\">On January 1, 1993, two masked persons dressed in black with silver faces broke into George Allison\u2019s apartment in Haverhill, assaulted him with mace, and shot his two dogs. At the time, law enforcement officers from Massachusetts and New Hampshire were actively involved in a narcotics investigation in cooperation with the Federal Drug Administration. The investigation targeted marihuana dealers in New Hampshire and in the Haverhill area, as well as suppliers in Arizona, California, Colorado, and Texas. The victim of the home invasion, George Allison, had cooperated with the officers, and they believed that the home invasion may have been related to their ongoing narcotics investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">On April 13, 1993, two State troopers, one from Massachusetts and one from New Hampshire, visited Rita Disorbo, who, they were told, had information about the January 1 incident. While at her apartment, they persuaded her to make two calls to the defendant at his home. When the defendant received the calls, he was unaware that police officers were in Disorbo\u2019s apartment, listening on an extension telephone and tape recording the conversation with her, albeit reluctant, consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Subsequently, the defendant was indicted and convicted of a series of crimes arising from the home invasion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The evidence at trial included the testimony of the two State troopers recounting admissions made by the defendant in his telephone conversations with Disorbo.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">The defendant appeals from his convictions, relying in large part on his claim that the officers\u2019 eavesdropping, without a warrant, violated both the Massachusetts wiretap statute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, and his expectation of privacy under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. He also asserts prejudicial evidentiary error and conflict of interest and ineffectiveness on the part of his trial counsel. We reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed two separate motions in limine \u201cto exclude tape recorded conversation\u201d and \u201cto suppress the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>tape recording and the tape recorded conversation between the defendant and Rita [Disorbo] . . . The first motion claimed that a purported authorization for the tape recording by a Federal Drug Enforcement agent was invalid and violated the defendant\u2019s Federal constitutional rights \u201cas well as Article Fourteen of the Massachusetts [Declaration] of Rights\u201d and the \u201csurveillance statute of the Massachusetts General Laws.\u201d The stated grounds of the second motion were that the statements attributed to the defendant in the telephone calls were involuntary and the product of coercion. At a pretrial hearing on these motions, the Commonwealth informed the judge that it intended to offer only the testimony of Disorbo and the State troopers but not the tape recording. Thereupon the judge declared the motion to exclude the tape recorded conversation moot, and that he would endorse it with the notation \u201cno action necessary.\u201d No objection was made to this disposition. The judge denied the motion to suppress after hearing evidence on the question of voluntariness. He issued written findings and rulings in which he found the telephone conversdtions to be voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Based on his determination that the only two witnesses testifying at the hearing on the motion to suppress, Rita Disorbo and State Trooper Thomas Coffey, were credible, the judge concluded as follows. The two troopers, acting on information they had received, visited Disorbo at her residence to ask her about the invasion. They informed her that if she would not cooperate, they would subpoena her to testify before the grand jury. Although she hesitated at first, she told them that the defendant had been living with her at the time of the incident and had told her that he and others had participated in it. At the troopers\u2019 request, Disorbo reluctantly agreed to place a telephone call to the defendant while they listened on an extension telephone in her apartment and also recorded the conversation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One of the troopers dialed the defendant\u2019s number, and Disorbo, without disclosing that the troopers were present, told the defendant that the police had been asking about the home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>invasion. The defendant told her to say nothing, and after informing her that nobody knew about the incident, ended the phone call. Asked by the troopers to call the defendant a second time, Disorbo did so and told him that the police wanted to speak with her and that she was nervous. He told her not to worry, that Allison could not recognize him, and only the participants, his girlfriend, and Disorbo knew who had been involved in the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">On the day of trial, prior to jury selection, the judge expressed his understanding that the troopers heard the conversation because a suction device had been attached to the ear portion of the extension phone which had been connected to a tape recorder. He asked the defendant\u2019s counsel whether he was arguing that the device was <em>\u201ca </em>violation of [G. L. c.] 272, \u00a7 99, the eavesdropping statute,\u201d to which defendant\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cNo, your Honor, not at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">At trial, the only witnesses were Allison, who described the incident but was unable to identify the participants; Rita Disorbo; her husband, Paul Chambers, whom she had married subsequent to the April eavesdropping; and the two troopers. Chambers, Disorbo\u2019s then boyfriend, had been incarcerated from September 1992 until March 15, 1993. While Chambers was in jail, Disorbo had a relationship with the defendant. It ended after Chambers was released, at which time the defendant moved out of Disorbo\u2019s apartment. Both Disorbo and Chambers testified that the defendant had admitted to them that he had participated in the invasion, Disorbo basically repeating at trial the testimony she had given at the hearing on the motion to suppress. Disorbo and Chambers also stated that the defendant had offered them money not to testify against him. The two troopers related the conversations they had overheard in Disorbo\u2019s apartment, in much greater detail than Disorbo\u2019s account \u2014 refreshed perhaps by the tape recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The main focus of the defendant\u2019s appeal is that the testimony of the State troopers obtained by their warrantless eavesdropping should have been excluded, both on the basis of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, the wiretap statute, and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Counsel claims that there can be no doubt that the troopers\u2019 testimony immeasurably bolstered Disorbo\u2019s and Chambers\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Although trial counsel alluded to both the statute and art. 14 in his written motions, and although his primary focus at trial was to keep the defendant\u2019s statements away from the jury and to preclude the troopers from testifying as to what they had overheard,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> appellate counsel recognizes that trial counsel may have insufficiently objected on the statutory and State constitutional grounds. Accordingly, he argues that the admission of the troopers\u2019 testimony created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice and that trial counsel was ineffective as his failure to pursue these grounds cannot be explained as a tactical decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We agree that the troopers\u2019 testimony corroborating the testimony of Chambers and Disorbo was immensely important to the prosecution. This is underscored by the prosecutor\u2019s closing in which he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">\u201cNow, what about the identification evidence, because that is, of course, the key in this case. Now, I\u2019d suggest to you the central fact is the telephone conversation. I want to focus on that because, you know, you can say all you want about Rita Chambers and Paul Chambers and cast some arrows at them with respect to their believability, their credibility, perhaps, but is there really any dispute with respect to the content of the telephone conversation, because that\u2019s when these people come together. And you have Trooper Tom Coffey and you have Trooper Robert Quinn who, in addition to Rita Chambers, told you what that telephone conversation was. And I suggest to you that in that telephone conversation the defendant made admissions indicating his direct involvement in this home invasion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The prosecutor later reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">\u201cNow, if you had those two people standing alone, you might well want to question, you know, their background or whatever. But what I\u2019m suggesting to you is put those two witnesses and their direct admissions, their direct observations, together with that telephone call conversation. And, if you put those three things together, the telephone conver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>sation and the testimony of those two witnesses, doesn\u2019t it all go into one piece and tell you that, yes, those two witnesses are telling the truth, because it fits with that telephone call conversation wherein the defendant makes admissions to Trooper Coffey and Trooper Quinn? And, then, the credibility of these other two witnesses, I suggest to you, is less of an issue.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">We examine whether there has been a statutory or art. 14 violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">1. <em>Interception under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99. </em>\u201cFor purposes of the statute, interception is defined as the use of an intercepting device to secretly hear or record, or aid another to secretly hear or record, the contents of any wire or oral communication. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>384 Mass. 271, 275 (1981), cert, denied, 454 U.S. 1147 (1982). A telephone conversation is within the statutory definition of \u00a7 99 B 1 and 2, and the use of Disorbo\u2019s extension (and recording equipment to enable both troopers to listen simultaneously) was an \u201cintercepting device\u201d within \u00a7 99 B 3. See <em>Campiti </em>v. <em>Walonis, </em>611 F.2d 387, 392, 395 (1st Cir. 1979). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vieux, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 526, 533 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">As in <em>Thorpe, </em>the defendant\u2019s primary argument for suppression of the conversation pursuant to \u00a7 99 P 2 is that the Commonwealth has not satisfied its burden under \u00a7 99 B 4 to show a nexus with organized crime. A number of interrelated provisions of \u00a7 99, as amended by St. 1968, c. 738, \u00a7 1, must be examined in connection with this claim. The first section is \u00a7 99 B 4, which, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">\u201c[I]t shall not constitute an interception for an investigative or law enforcement officer ... to record or transmit a wire or oral communication if the officer . . . has been given prior authorization to record or transmit the communication by ... a party [to the conversation] and if recorded or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>transmitted in the course of an investigation of a <em>designated offense </em>as defined herein.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">A \u201cdesignated offense\u201d is defined in \u00a7 99 B 7 and includes several described crimes<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cin connection with organized crime as defined in the preamble\u201d to \u00a7 99. The preamble, \u00a7 99 A, states, in part, that \u201c[organized crime . . . consists of a continuing conspiracy among highly organized and disciplined groups to engage in supplying illegal goods and services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">At a suppression hearing, the burden is on the Commonwealth to show \u201c[a]t the minimum . . . that the decision to intercept was made on the basis of a reasonable suspicion that interception would disclose or lead to evidence of a designated offense in connection with organized crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>384 Mass, at 280-281. As set forth in the testimony at the hearing on the motion to suppress, the troopers were in the midst of a multi-State narcotics investigation, and they believed that the Allison break-in might be related to that investigation at the time they interviewed Disorbo, and they so informed her. These circumstances met the Commonwealth\u2019s burden. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Price, </em>408 Mass. 668, 671 n.2 (1990). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarabek, </em>384 Mass. 293, 296 (1981). That the troopers\u2019 belief later proved erroneous does not retroactively vitiate the reasonable suspicion made in good faith at the time of the eavesdropping.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, the eavesdropping was not in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 P 2, and any failure of trial counsel to rely on that statute did not harm the defendant. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vieux, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">2. <em>The defendant\u2019s right of privacy under art. 14. </em>Relying principally on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass. 61 (1987), the defendant claims that the warrantless monitoring by the police of his telephone conversations with Disorbo violated art. 14.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A privacy interest is protected under art. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>14 \u201cwhen it is shown \u2018that a person [has] exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy,\u2019 and when that \u2018expectation [is] one that society is prepared to recognize as \u201creasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[389 U.S. 347, 361 (1967)] (Harlan, J., concurring).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass, at 68. There is no doubt that the defendant had such a subjective expectation; the only question is whether Massachusetts law, in contrast to Federal law, recognizes as reasonable the privacy interest invaded here. The cases decided by the Supreme Judicial Court, as discussed below, strongly indicate that a warrant is required. Accordingly, we hold that the warrantless police initiation and monitoring (and recording) of the two telephone calls in this case, unbeknownst to the defendant, was not permissible under art. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u201cIt is by now firmly established\u201d that in some circumstances art. 14 affords more substantive protection to individuals than that which prevails under the Constitution of the United States. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. 782, 787 n.10 (1996). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass, at 68 n.9. Thus, a \u201cconclusion that the defendant does not enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment does not compel a similar conclusion regarding the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy under art. 14.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>407 Mass. 827, 834 (1990). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Panetti, </em>406 Mass. 230, 233-234 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">More specifically, Massachusetts has not adopted the Federal view that surveillance with the consent of one party to a conversation usually passes constitutional muster. The Supreme Judicial Court has rejected the rationale for that position. The Federal basis for upholding warrantless electronic surveillance with the consent of one party is that \u201cwhen one speaks one voluntarily assumes not only the risk that one\u2019s listener may repeat what one says to others, but also the risk that the listener may be recording or monitoring the conversation for broadcast to others.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>384 Mass. at 282, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>401 U.S. 745, 751 (1971), and other cases. The court in <em>Thorpe </em>noted that this \u201cassumption of the risk\u201d approach has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>been criticized and that at least two State Supreme Courts \u2014 Michigan<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and Alaska \u2014 had, at the time, interpreted State constitutional provisions to bar warrantless monitoring and recording without the consent of the speaker. <em>Id. </em>at 283, and authorities cited. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Glass, </em>583 P.2d 872, 881 (Alaska 1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>583 P.2d 886, 887 (Alaska 1978) (recording of telephone conversations with the consent of a police informant without defendant\u2019s knowledge violated Alaska Constitution); <em>State </em>v. <em>Blow, </em>157 Vt. 513, 518-519 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Quoting from opinions in accord with Justice Harlan\u2019s dissent in <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>401 U.S. at 787-789, as well as from the dissent itself, the court in <em>Thorpe </em>was much concerned with the possible chilling effect on First Amendment values if one suspected that conversations were being transmitted for the ears of other than one\u2019s intended audience. \u201c[W]ords would be measured a good deal more carefully and communication inhibited.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cOur laws must ensure that the ordinary, law-abiding citizen may continue to engage in private discourse, free to speak with the uninhibited spontaneity that is characteristic of our democratic society.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>384 Mass, at 284, quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Beavers, </em>393 Mich. 554, 566, cert, denied, 423 U.S. 878 (1975). <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Turning to the governmental intrusion in the case before it, the court proceeded to \u201cassess the nature of the particular form of warrantless surveillance and its likely impact on the individual\u2019s sense of security that is the concern of art. 14\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d 384 Mass, at 285. The factual circumstances were that a police officer, known to the speaker as a police officer and sought out by him, recorded eight telephone conversations and two face-to-face conversations between the speaker and the officer. Holding that there was no constitutional violation, the court concluded that \u201cfree speech and privacy values are [not] unduly threatened by the risk that when one speaks to a known police officer he may be recording the conversation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Nevertheless, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>court cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">\u201c[I]t is apparent'from the above reasoning of other jurisdictions that the better future course, and the most secure course constitutionally, is for law enforcement officials to procure warrants in cases where probable cause for surveillance can be shown, and even in cases where it does not appear that the statutes require a warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">After <em>Thorpe, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court decided <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass, at 70-71 &amp; n.ll, which involved face-to-face conversations in private homes transmitted to, and recorded by, police. Because one party, an informant, had consented to the interception, the conversations were not unlawful under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, nor under Federal law. The court, however, squarely rejected the Federal position that the consent of one participant was sufficient to justify the warrantless surveillance. \u201cThe vice of the consent exception is that it institutionalizes the historic danger that art. 14 was adopted to guard against.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 71. The surveillance was held to be in violation of art. 14, despite its constitutionality under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and its meeting the requirements of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fini, </em>403 Mass. 567, 573 (1988), concerned surveillance similar to the transmissions in <em>Blood, supra. </em>The \u201cmagnitude of the unconstitutional intrusion\u201d was so significant that \u201chalf measures of deterrence [were] not enough.\u201d Despite the oft-employed practice of permitting unlawfully obtained evidence to be used for impeachment purposes, the court in <em>Fini </em>not only considered the evidence inadmissible in the government\u2019s case-in-chief but also held that it must be excluded for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>407 Mass, at 833, the defendant, relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, supra, </em>attempted to suppress telephone message records under art. 14. The defendant had arranged through a client of Allied (an answering service) for the answering service to take messages for the defendant on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the client\u2019s telephone line. In refusing to suppress the messages, the court carefully pointed out that the defendant chose a method of receiving telephone messages in which <em>both </em>the defendant and any caller were well aware of the involvement of a third party, an answering service. <em>Id. </em>at 834. Even in such a case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">\u201cIt may be that under art. 14 exposure of information to another party might not compel the rejection of a claim of a reasonable expectation of privacy, particularly in light of the fact that the third party here, Allied [the answering service], considered the telephone message records to be confidential. However, ... the defendant knew that his messages were being taken not on his own telephone line but on [the telephone line of the answering service\u2019s client]. This arrangement subjected the defendant\u2019s messages to exposure, not only to the employees of [the answering service] but also to anyone entitled to examine the telephone message records of the [client].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 835.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The <em>Cote </em>court distinguished <em>Blood </em>by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">\u201c[W]e addressed a situation involving the surreptitious recording of conversations held in private homes in which at least one party to the conversation was unaware of the fact that their words were being recorded. In the present case, <em>both </em>the defendant and any callers who left a message for him at [the answering service] intended that their words be recorded. Therefore, our analysis in <em>Blood </em>does not apply to the facts of this case.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">While the dissenters in the present case lay stress on the difference between the face-to-face discourse held impermissible in <em>Blood </em>and the telephone conversations here, we do not consider the inability of a telephone speaker to control completely the listening environment a conclusive difference \u2014 at least where, as here, without any exigent circumstances, and without a warrant, the police officers induced a reluctant caller to engage the defendant in his home in what would seem to him to be most private telephone conversations and then listened in and recorded the conversations. Considering the \u201cvital role that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the . . . telephone has come to play in private communication,\u201d <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. at 352, this serious governmental intrusion is contrary to the expectation of privacy which Massachusetts is prepared to recognize and which is reflected in our cases. Moreover, even if society is more wary in its expectations, as suggested by the dissenters, we would find this secret surveillance impermissible without a warrant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">\u201cSince it is the task of the law to form and project, as well as mirror and reflect, we should not, as judges, merely recite the expectations and risks without examining the desirability of saddling them upon society. The critical question, therefore, is whether under our system of government, as reflected in [art. 14], we should impose on our citizens the risks [of police eavesdropping] without at least the protection of a warrant requirement.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>401 U.S. at 786 (Harlan, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We conclude a warrant was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Having reached this conclusion, we also consider the intrusion so significant, cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fini, </em>403 Mass, at 573, the officers\u2019 testimony so crucial in the context of the trial, and the failure of counsel to object so devoid of tactical explanation that this is one of the exceptional cases where the defendant has met his heavy burden of showing that there is here a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> , <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AvI\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-11\">The defendant was convicted of armed burglary (G.

Here, the art. 14 issue, although probably not sufficiently raised at trial with reference to the eavesdropping officers, is being raised on the defendant\u2019s direct appeal where the concerns of finality expressed in <em>Amirault </em>are inapposite.

Further, the transmitted conversations in <em>Blood </em>took place within a \u201ccircle of known listeners.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77. In stating that \u201cwe need not reconsider the question of the constitutionality of [the statutory one-party consent exemption] in other circumstances, [citing] <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>384 Mass. 271, 285-286 (1981), cert, denied, 454 U.S. 1147 (1982),\u201d <em>id. </em>at 66 n.6, <em>Blood </em>implicitly recognized that telephone conversations stand on different constitutional footing and have been accorded different treatment by our statute and prior decisions. It is significant that the Alaska and Vermont cases relied on by the majority do not involve eavesdropping on an extension telephone with the consent of one of the participants. Moreover, the Alaska decisions are grounded, in part, on the \u201cbroader protection\u201d afforded by a right to privacy expressly set forth in an amendment to the Alaska Constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Glass, </em>583 R2d 872, 878-879 (Alaska 1978). <em>State </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>583 P.2d 886, 887 (Alaska 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra, </em>is our only decision addressing privacy rights in telephone conversations under art. 14. After first concluding that the warrantless recording by a known police officer of his telephone conversations with the defendant fell within the G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4, statutory exception for law enforcement officers, 384 Mass, at 281, the court determined there was no violation of art. 14, because \u201cfree speech and privacy values are [not] unduly threatened by the risk that when one speaks to a known police officer he may be recording the conversation.\u201d 384 Mass, at 285.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <em>Thorpe </em>decision left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>untouched the analysis in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>354 Mass. 212, 221-222 (1968), cert, denied, 394 U.S. 960 (1969), where, on facts similar to the present case, the court concluded that there was \u201c[n]o illegal search or other violation of any constitutional . . . provision\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where police listened on an extension telephone and the'speaker\u2019s conversation was recorded with the permission of the receiving party. <em>Id. </em>at 222.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, I discern no explicit indication in either <em>Thorpe </em>or <em>Blood, </em>each resting on narrow footing, that art. 14 provides a greater right of privacy in <em>telephone conversations </em>than the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution in the particular circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In any event, I examine anew the defendant\u2019s claimed expectation of privacy. As the majority points out, any subjective expectation of privacy that he may have had in the circumstances must also be \u201cone which society could recognize as reasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass, at 68. The expectation of privacy espoused by the majority, however, reflects an idealization of the nature of telephonic communications and a rejection of our common experience with multiparty lines, telephone systems comprised of multiple extensions, cordless telephones, and cellular \u201cphones,\u201d all of which may, and occasionally do, subject our conversations to uninvited and unknown listeners.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In sharp contrast to face-to-face conversations among known listeners in private homes, telephone communications commonly are transmitted externally from the physical confines of the speaker to a receiver outside of the speaker\u2019s control. A telephone speaker, therefore, cannot control the listening environment as one may do in face-to-face conversations with selected listeners in a home or other private setting. \u201cA defendant who speaks incriminating words over the telephone runs the risk that the person with whom he talks may be an informer (see <em>Hoffa </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>United States, </em>385 U.S. 293, 302-303 [1966]) or that the conversation [as in <em>Rathbun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U.S. 107, 109-111 (1957)] may be overheard on an extension telephone. ... He also should be held to take the risk that his words may be recorded by his listener.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>354 Mass, at 221-222. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>720 F.2d 227, 228 (1st Cir. 1983), cert, denied, 464 U.S. 1073 (1984). It follows that a person\u2019s expectation that his spoken words will remain private should decline as his control of the listening environment diminishes. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Panetti, </em>406 Mass. 230, 234-235 (1989) (indicating that a subjective expectation of privacy against warrantless eavesdropping is \u201cmore reasonable\u201d under art. 14 when conversing with others in one\u2019s home than when the conversation is in a motel or hotel room). See Comment, 24 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 1130, 1136 (1990) (\u201cThe emerging trend in this area is that privacy is protected only within the areas where one maintains virtually exclusive control\u201d). Because eavesdropping, with one party\u2019s consent, over a telephone extension occurs within a listening environment that is significantly less controlled by the speaker than in the <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood </em>circumstance of a face-to-face communication in the speaker\u2019s home, I discern no occasion to extend the protection of art. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The rejection in <em>Blood </em>of the \u201cone-party consent\u201d rationale in the circumstances of that case does not control expectation of privacy analysis in other circumstances; specifically, I perceive no mandate for the extension of additional art. 14 protection to telephone speakers. Accordingly, I believe that the defendant\u2019s privacy claim is governed by the well-settled proposition developed under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence that \u201clistening in to a telephone conversation on an extension, with the consent of one party, does not violate the rights of the other party . . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>720 F.2d at 228, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>401 U.S. 745, 753 (1971). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>384 Mass, at 282. See <em>Rathbun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U.S. at 111 (\u201cEach party to a telephone conversation takes the risk that the other party may have an extension telephone and may allow another to overhear the conversation. When such takes place there has been no violation of any privacy of which the parties may complain\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Lastly, I am troubled by the majority\u2019s interpretation of the \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice\u201d standard. By adverting to that principle, designed for sparing use in instances of unpreserved error, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967), the majority implicitly concludes, as do I, that defense counsel did not adequately preserve the right of privacy issue for ordinary \u201charmless error\u201d appellate review. In the absence of objection, appellate focus, in contrast to the majority\u2019s approach, normally and logically next settles upon whether counsel\u2019s failure to object amounted to constitutionally ineffective assistance. That test, in the circumstance of claimed erroneous admission of evidence, permits \u201cbut for\u201d review; that is, the case is assessed without the offending evidence. See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984). Reversal is required if counsel\u2019s performance was substandard and \u201cdeprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). Given the majority\u2019s view of the damaging impact of the eavesdropping testimony upon the defendant\u2019s case, I can only conclude that they avoided this test on the basis of a determination that the ordinary fallible lawyer would not be expected to argue for a departure from settled Federal constitutional law, even if the change is implicitly foreshadowed by State appellate decision, as they claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In rushing to the next logically applicable test \u2014 whether there exists a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice \u2014 the majority, however, blinks away a settled appellate principle dictating that highly incriminating, but unobjected to, evidence is not removed from the appellate calculus even when it is obtained in violation of constitutional protections against unreasonable searches. That principle, firmly embedded in the first element of miscarriage analysis established by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 21 n.22 (1986), and recently endorsed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 650-651 (1997), is not limited to collateral review, as the majority would have it, but merely differentiates among cases in which the offending evidence overwhelmingly establishes the defendant\u2019s guilt, as here, and cases in which that evidence is not conclusive. Moreover, the recent conflation of the ineffectiveness of counsel and miscarriage standards for purposes of collateral review in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619, 624 n.4 (1994), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number><em>Amirault, supra </em>at 652 n.24, apparently raising the burden for defendants on new trial motions in criminal cases, reasonably cannot be construed as .lowering that burden on direct appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The court in <em>Thorpe, </em>citing reasoning of other jurisdictions, cautioned that \u201cthe better future course, and the most secure course constitutionally,\u201d would be to procure warrants even in instances where it appears the statute does not require one. <em>Id. </em>at 286. <em>Thorpe </em>cited with approval the decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Beavers, </em>393 Mich. 554, cert, denied, 423 U.S. 878 (1975), as reflecting one of two jurisdictions interpreting their constitutional provisions to bar \u201cwarrantless monitoring and recording without the consent of the speaker.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283.

I concur completely in the dissenting opinion of Justice Jacobs, but add some remarks to underscore what I think is a misunderstanding in the majority opinion of the effect of recent opinions of the Supreme Judicial Court on the meaning of \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice\u201d and the relationship between that concept and \u201cineffective assistance of counsel,\u201d two analogous but theoretically distinct vehicles for obtaining appellate consideration of alleged trial errors not preserved for appellate review by appropriate motions or objections at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The misunderstanding arises from a sentence in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619, 625 n.4 (1994), repeated by way of dictum in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bart B., </em>424 Mass. 911, 914 (1997), to the effect that, \u201cif an omission of counsel does not present a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice in a situation such as this, there is no basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under either the Federal or the State Constitution.\u201d Since we all \u2014 majority and dissenters alike \u2014 assume that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is theoretically available to a defendant who, like the defendant in this case, seems guilty beyond any question, the majority draw the inference that a claim of substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice is also available to a plainly guilty defendant. In effect the majority treat the <em>Curtis </em>sentence as having vitiated what this court said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 21 (1986) \u2014 a formulation seemingly accepted and endorsed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 650-651 (1997) \u2014 that the first condition for application of the substantial risk of a miscarriage principle is that the case present a genuine question of the guilt or innocence of the defendant. The result is that the majority have produced what I believe is the first case in our jurisprudence to apply the miscarriage of justice standard to reverse the conviction of a defendant who seems guilty beyond doubt of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">For the reasons stated by Justice Jacobs, the majority is, in our view, misreading the import of the sentence in <em>Curtis. </em>The principle of the <em>Curtis </em>decision is that all \u201ccollateral\u201d attacks on convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u2014 those brought after the processes of direct appeal, including consideration of the original motion for a new trial, have been completed \u2014 should be turned aside unless the conviction poses a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass, at 625. That decision made clear that it was only discussing \u201cthe standard of review that an appellate court generally should apply in a postappeal, collateral attack on convictions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 621; and, again, \u201cOur attention here is on the denial of a new trial motion filed after a conviction has received appellate review, and not with new trial motions considered before a conviction has been reviewed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623. Footnote 4 of the <em>Curtis </em>decision must be understood in that context. It is discussing <em>belated </em>claims of ineffective assistance of counsel \u2014 those made <em>after </em>direct appeal, or after consideration of a new trial motion. This reading is consistent with Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(c)(2), 378 Mass. 901 (1979) <em>(\u201cWaiver. </em>All grounds for relief claimed by a defendant [by way of a new trial motion] shall be raised by the defendant in his original or amended motion. Any grounds not so raised are waived unless the judge in his discretion permits them to be raised in a subsequent motion, or unless such grounds could not reasonably have been raised in the original or amended motion\u201d). Appropriate allowance is thus made in the rule for the fact that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel often cannot be raised on direct appeal, see <em>Earl </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>356 Mass. 181, 183-184 (1969) (concerning claims of error that require consideration of facts outside the record), or even on an original new trial motion (if the defendant is represented thereon by trial counsel); but, subject to those adjustments, even a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be raised by the first reasonably available procedural vehicle for review or be treated as waived. Constitutionally based claims such as ineffective assistance of counsel are not different in this respect from claims of error generally. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>409 Mass. 110, 112 (1991) (\u201cThe rule of waiver \u2018applies equally to constitutional claims which could have been raised, but were not raised\u2019 on direct appeal or in a prior motion for a new trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deeran, </em>397 Mass. 136, 139 [1986]\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass, at 634 &amp; n.13; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagliardi, </em>418 Mass. 562, 565 (1994), cert, denied, 513 U.S. 1091 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. at 18-19. Were it otherwise, claims for reversal based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>ineffective assistance could \u201cbe made years after the conviction and appeal when the trial judge may well no longer be sitting,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass, at 624 n.3, and when it may well be no longer feasible for the prosecution to reassemble its witnesses. Following the <em>Curtis </em>decision, a belatedly raised claim of ineffective assistance, like other belated claims, even if considered by the trial judge, will not result in reversal unless the defendant can meet the traditional substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice standard applicable to waived claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Two principles emerge from reviewing the line of decisions that Justice Cutter invoked in deciding <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 564 (1967) (\u201cwe employ the rarely used power referred to in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conroy, </em>333 Mass. 751, 756-757 [1956]\u201d). The first is that use of the miscarriage standard to reverse a conviction historically lay in the discretion of the court. It was always referred to as a power of the court, not a right of the defendant. By definition, it enabled the court to reverse notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s failure to preserve his rights. The second is that the question whether to exercise the discretion favorably to the defendant turned on an appraisal of the <em>entire </em>record. For example, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacGregor, </em>319 Mass. 462, 463 (1946), the court said: \u201cIt is assumed that in appropriate instances this court has and will exercise the power to set aside a verdict or finding in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice when a question affecting substantial rights has not been properly raised by exception at trial. An examination of the record here discloses no reason for the exercise of that power.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Or, earlier, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>264 Mass. 324, 336-337 (1928): \u201c[T]his court has and will exercise the power to set aside a verdict in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice when a decisive matter has not been raised at the trial. A careful examination of this entire record discloses no reason for the exercise of that power.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Or, earlier still, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dascalakis, </em>246 Mass. 12, 23, 25, 27 (1923): \u201c[I]n appropriate instances the court has and will exercise the power to set aside a verdict in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice when a decisive or pertinent point affecting substantial rights has not been raised by exception at the trial. ... It is enough to say that a careful examination of the entire record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>shows no ground to doubt the correctness of the trial judge in denying the motion [for a new trial] for this reason [alleged ineffectiveness of counsel].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The <em>Miranda </em>decision, 22 Mass. App. Ct. at 21, derived the first criterion or condition, that there be a genuine question of guilt or innocence, from the historical underpinnings of the power as one that was purely discretionary in character, was rarely used, and would not be exercised unless the court was convinced by the entire record that a miscarriage of justice might result from allowing the conviction to stand. We had and still have no doubt that miscarriage of justice was used with its every day-language connotation: the concern was that an innocent defendant might have been convicted as a result of improperly admitted or excluded evidence or misleading instructions. Compare <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Zant, </em>499 U.S. 467, 494-495, 502 (1991) (no miscarriage of justice without a colorable showing of factual innocence). Cf. <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Carrier, All </em>U.S. 478, 496-487 (1986) (procedural default excused in extraordinary cases on showing of actual innocence).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Unlike substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, which was invoked in discretion, ineffective assistance of counsel is a rights-based remedy, deriving from the constitutional right to the assistance of counsel in framing one\u2019s defense; it must be considered as an available remedy, consequently, though the defendant be \u201c \u2018apprehended in flagrante delicto\u2019 and the \u2018evidence of . . . [his] guilt [be] overwhelming.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 93 (1974), quoting from the report of a special master. The conditions for application of the principle \u2014 that counsel\u2019s representation fall measurably below the standard of the ordinary, fallible lawyer and that his inadequacies deprive the defendant of an available, substantial ground of defense, <em>id. </em>at 96 \u2014 will not normally be made out if counsel\u2019s alleged failure or omission is attributable to tactical choice, unless the tactical choice is itself manifestly unreasonable. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>374 Mass. 722, 728 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The unnecessary loss of a substantial ground of defense and the absence of a tactical reason for the loss parallel the second and third conditions for application of the miscarriage doctrine, as set out in <em>Miranda, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. at 21 (result might have been different but for the error, and the error is not attributable to tactical choice). The factors that differentiate the two doctrines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>are that the substantial risk analysis focuses on the likelihood that an innocent defendant might have been wrongly convicted, while ineffective assistance analysis focuses on the quality of legal representation the defendant received. The first stems from a concern for justice. The second is concerned with the vindication of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to meaningful assistance of counsel in shaping a defense. An omission of counsel that results in the admission of highly incriminating evidence makes the case more apt for ineffective assistance analysis, because it underscores counsel\u2019s inadequacy; but it correspondingly makes the case less apt for the application of miscarriage of justice principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">It is doubtless true that, as observed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass, at 624 n.3, the concept of a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice has been expanded since the <em>Freeman </em>decision and used more frequently, probably in response to increased regard for fundamental fairness to defendants and increased impatience with observing the punctilio of sometimes complex procedural rules. But in applying miscarriage analysis to a plainly guilty defendant, the majority here cut the doctrine loose completely from its historical moorings and, to my mind, have misapplied it. Equally important, they may well have consigned the <em>Saferian </em>standard to desuetude. If a defendant is entitled as of right to reversal simply because his counsel omitted to interpose proper objections to highly incriminating evidence, and the omission is not explainable as reasonable tactical choice, then it is made quite superfluous to prove the core element of Saferian: that counsel\u2019s representation betray \u201cserious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention,\u201d otherwise stated as \u201cbehavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer.\u201d 366 Mass, at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Given the unsettled state of the law concerning the one-party consent rule, the majority are probably right in declining to tax the defendant\u2019s trial counsel with \u201cserious incompetency\u201d for not saving the right objection to admission of the intercepted telephone conversation. It does not follow that the conviction should be reversed anyway. Whatever else may be said of the conviction of this defendant, it is certainly not a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
