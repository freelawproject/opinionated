L. c. 208, \u00a7 34B (three counts). On appeal, he alleges that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">We recite the pertinent facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>398 Mass. 63, 64-65 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-15\">The defendant and complainant had been husband and wife. A judgment of divorce nisi was entered on September 15, 1989. That judgment subsequently was modified on September 11, 1992. The modification dealt exclusively with the circumstances under which the defendant would be allowed to visit with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>minor children, all of whom were in the sole legal custody of the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">At the same time as the judge modified the divorce judgment, he purported to issue a protective order pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The order provided, inter alia, that the defendant was not to enter the victim\u2019s residence. No expiration date was inserted on the form, leaving the following printed language in effect: \u201cIf no expiration date is entered the order is PERMANENT\u201d (capitalization in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Approximately one and one-half years later, the defendant entered upon the complainant\u2019s property three times over a two and one-half week period to talk with his children. While he did not attempt to enter the complainant\u2019s house on any of these occasions, the defendant conceded at trial that if the protective order were valid, he had violated its provisions. However, the defendant argued that the order was unlawfully issued, and in any event, had expired at the time of the alleged violations. The trial judge rejected both of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The question for review, as framed by the parties, is whether the judge\u2019s order was properly issued and was unexpired at the times of the putative violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\"><em>Validity of order. </em>General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 34B, permits a judge of the Probate Court, after a hearing and findings as required by the statute, to issue a protective order \u201cduring the pendency\u201d of an action \u201cfor divorce, or for nullity of marriage or of separate support or maintenance\u201d requiring a \u201chusband or wife to vacate forthwith the marital home for a period of time <em>not exceeding ninety </em>days\u201d (emphasis added). If the order is to be extended there must be an additional hearing and findings by the judge, and, if appropriate, an extension to the order, but only for a <em>\u201ccertain </em>period of time\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">The plain meaning of the statute permits a judge, before the entry of a judgment between the parties to a divorce, annul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>ment, or separate support action, to make an interim and temporary decision as to who shall reside in the marital home. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We have previously discussed the \u00a7 34B framework in <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 951, 952-953 (1983). There, in deciding whether a particular protective order had been properly issued, we observed that \u201cthe Legislature has shown substantial intention that \u00a7 34B (wholly apart from other statutory provisions, e.g., c. 208, [\u00a7 18], or c. 209, \u00a7 37) is to govern . . . orders to a <em>spouse </em>to vacate the <em>marital domicile </em>[before entry of a divorce decree]. The section directs that such orders be granted only when the judge\u2019s findings satisfy the statutory criteria set out in \u00a7 34B, <em>and the order must be initially limited to a ninety-day </em>period\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 952. We also suggested that the statute may not be applicable when, as here, there has been a divorce judgment and a division of property. <em>Id. </em>at 953. See <em>Dee </em>v. <em>Dee, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 320, 323 (1973) (\u201cnothing in the language or in the legislative history of [G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34B] suggests that it was intended to permit anything other than an interim order of sixty<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> days\u2019 total duration entered in advance of a hearing on the merits of a libel [complaint] for divorce\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Here, there was no basis for a \u00a7 34B order because there was no divorce action pending. Even were the order effective when signed, it could not have been valid at the time of the alleged violations. Protective orders issued pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34B, are effective only for an initial period of ninety days. See <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. at 952-953. See also <em>Dee </em>v. <em>Dee, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. at 322-323. To extend an order beyond that term, a second hearing is required. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34B (\u201cand upon further motion for such additional periods of time\u201d). Nowhere in the record is there any evidence of such a hearing. The order, even if initially valid, would have expired on or about December 9, 1992 \u2014 long before the first of the alleged violations on May 17, 1994. The fact that the order purported to be permanent does not alter this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding was improperly denied. The judgments are reversed, and the findings are set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-10\">The Commonwealth contends that the \u00a7 34B order was issued pursuant to an action for support and maintenance. Given the facts just recited, the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion appears not to be accurate. But the issue is of no consequence because \u00a7 34B applies equally to actions for divorce and those for support and maintenance, and we are not referred to anything in the record appendix or the supplemental record appendix which establishes any <em>pending </em>action for divorce or separate support.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Similarly, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 18, authorizing temporary orders which prohibit restraints on the personal liberty of a spouse, is limited to pending actions for divorce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\">The statute subsequently was amended to extend the maximum term to ninety days.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
