On July 16, 1987, the board of selectmen of the town notified Watkinson that it had unanimously voted to appoint him \u201cSupervisor of Highway Services, your term to expire on June 30, 1990.\u201d At a meeting of the selectmen held May 22, 1990, the selectmen voted, two to one, \u201cnot to reappoint Clinton Watkinson as Supervisor of Highway Services.\u201d The minutes of the meeting of the selectmen record that Watkinson \u201ccalled [the two selectmen voting in favor of the motion] \u2018sickies\u2019 and [he] stated that \u2018the fight has just started.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">On February 19, 1992, Watkinson requested in writing that the county board return all of his accumulated total deductions as a member of the retirement system. Above Watkinson\u2019s signature, the request states in part, \u201cIn consideration of such payments, all other rights and privileges to which I was entitled as a member of such Retirement System are hereby surrendered and I understand that upon such payment my membership in the Retirement System will terminate.\u201d On February 21, 1992, a check in the amount of $21,145.93 was delivered to Watkinson in response to his written request.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">More than two years later, on May 4, 1994, Watkinson applied to the county board for relief under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Among the issues identified by the county board to be addressed by the parties were (i) whether the removal of Watkinson\u2019s accumulated contributions following his dismissal barred him from seeking redress, (ii) whether Watkinson was removed or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>discharged rather than not being reappointed, and (iii) whether Watkinson\u2019s claim was barred by laches, election of remedies,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> waiver, or estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">On July 26, 1994, without any discussion of the issues it had identified as bearing on Watkinson\u2019s claim, the county board (after a hearing) simply concluded that Watkinson was a \u201cmember in service at the time of his removal or discharge and otherwise meets the statutory criteria of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2) . . . [and] that his removal or discharge was not effective, since the head of his department failed to comply with the statutory mandate to file a fair summary of the facts upon which his removal or discharge was based.\u201d See note 3, <em>supra. </em>Thereupon the county board reinstated Watkinson to the office of supervisor of highway services without loss of compensation. The record appendix does not include the transcript of the hearing before the county board, and the evidence upon which the county board based its decision is not before this court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The final paragraph of the decision of the county board states as follows: \u201cAny party aggrieved by this decision may appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 30A and G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The county board evidently was unaware of the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>347 Mass. 298, 300-301 (1964). <em>Barrett </em>held that where the subject of the controversy was the \u201cremoval or discharge\u201d of a member, the police commissioner had no right of appeal under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16, because the \u201cmatter on which the [police commissioner] . . . purported to appeal was one subject to review by the district court. . . .\u201d See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 16(3) &amp; 16(4), second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>par.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See also <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>397 Mass. 255, 257 (1986). Since the county board found that Watkinson had been removed or discharged, and therefore Watkinson could have brought a petition in the district court in the event of an unfavorable decision by the county board, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>the advice of the county board that Swansea could proceed under \u00a7 16 was plainly mistaken.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Georgetown </em>v. <em>Essex County Retirement Bd., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 272, 273 (1990) (indicating that when c. 32, \u00a7 16, is not available, the proper method of judicial review is an action in the nature of certiorari [G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4] in the Superior Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Counsel for the town took the advice of the county board,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and on August 5, 1994, filed a claim of appeal with CRAB. Adopting the order of dismissal of the town\u2019s appeal issued by the administrative magistrate on the authority of <em>Barrett, supra, </em>CRAB correctly concluded that it had no jurisdiction to hear the town\u2019s appeal because Watkinson had obtained a hearing before the county board under \u00a7 16(1) and (2) \u2014 making the \u201cmatter\u201d one which was \u201csubject to review by the district court.\u201d See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(4), second par. The town\u2019s appeal was thereupon dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Finally, the judge of the Superior Court, acting on the town\u2019s application for declaratory relief,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> agreed with the reasoning of CRAB, and went on to consider whether declaratory relief under G. L. c. 231A could be granted when the sixty-day limitations period for a writ in the nature of certiorari (the appropriate procedural remedy \u2014 see <em>Georgetown, supra </em>at 273) had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>already expired. He decided that there were no special circumstances that would justify resort to c. 231A to reach a result prohibited by the limitations period stated in G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">While we agree with CRAB and with the judge that CRAB had no jurisdiction to hear the town\u2019s appeal, we nevertheless conclude that there are \u201cspecial circumstances of public import\u201d which warrant relief under c. 231 A. See <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport </em>v. <em>DeCarolis, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 348, 352-353 (1992), and cases cited. Most important is the fact that the mistake of the county board in advising the town of its rights of appeal \u201cwas inexplicable and serious.\u201d <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Metropolitan Dist. Commn., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 455, 462 (1992) (State board of retirement gave mistaken advice to the plaintiff regarding his rights of appeal).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The town acted reasonably in relying on the board\u2019s advice, see <em>ibid., </em>and the fact that the town\u2019s right to proceed appropriately by way of certiorari had in the meantime expired made the board\u2019s mistake decisively worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Second, there is here a risk of a miscarriage of justice in a matter involving the public interest. This is not a case involving a dispute between private parties; it involves a municipality seeking to adjudicate the rights of the town in an appropriate manner. Thus, \u201cmore persons than the parties to the case\u201d will be affected by the outcome. <em>School Comm. of Franklin, </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ., </em>395 Mass. 800, 807 (1985), quoting from <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>364 Mass. 444, 450 (1973). Nor is it self-evident that Watkinson will prevail upon a careful review of the events in this case. It appears from the record that Watkinson\u2019s appointment may have expired without any renewal, and that he was not \u201cremoved or discharged\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 16(2), see <em>Costello </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Chelsea, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 822, 824-827 (1989). Further, Watkinson withdrew his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>total deductions, resigned his membership in the system, and surrendered all his rights and privileges as a member two years prior to seeking relief as a member under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">These events present genuine issues which the county board correctly identified as important to the adjudication of Watkinson\u2019s claim; they are worthy of careful analysis and thoughtful resolution. Yet the decision of the county board, inadequate on its face, has evaded all administrative and judicial review. These circumstances are sufficient to warrant the unusual relief that may and should be provided by proceedings for a declaratory judgment, notwithstanding the expiration of the limitations period for a writ of certiorari.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Accordingly, the judgment for the defendant Watkinson is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Watkinson had filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings or in the alternative, for summary judgment. The judge treated Watkinson\u2019s motion as one falling under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 (1979), and the parties, correctly, do not contest that procedure. See <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>405 Mass. 29, 30 (1989). We note that the county board has filed a brief in this appeal, although it did not present a motion directed to dismissing the appeal against it. That point is of no consequence in view of the result we reach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Section 16(2), as appearing in St. 1982, c. 630, \u00a7 21, provides that \u201c[t]he removal or discharge of any member . . . shall not become effective unless and until a written notice thereof containing a fair summary of the facts upon which such action was based has been filed with the board. The procedure set forth in subdivision (1) relative to . . . notice, hearing if requested, and the filing of a certificate of findings and decision . . . shall apply to all proceedings involving such removal or discharge. Unless the board shall find that such removal or discharge was justified, such member' shall forthwith be restored to his office or position without loss of compensation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b430-8\">This referred, no doubt, to a Federal action Watkinson brought in 1991 under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1994), which resulted, in 1996, in the allowance of the town\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b430-9\">The town states in its brief that the transcript of the county board hearing, which has been transcribed from a tape recording, was not part of the record either before CRAB or the Superior Court since \u201cthe County Board did not advise counsel for the Town of its existence until the day of the hearing in the Superior Court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\">The parties agree that at the conclusion of the hearing before the county board, counsel for the county board expressed his uncertainty as to \u201cwhat the Town\u2019s remedy is ... if the Board finds in favor of Mr. Watkinson.\u201d That uncertainty would seem to have been resolved when the county board subsequently issued its decision advising the parties regarding their rights of appeal, as stated in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Section 16(4), second par., as appearing in St. 1987, c. 697, \u00a7 48, provides: \u201cOn matters other than those subject to review by the district court as provided in subdivision (3), . . . any person when aggrieved . . . may appeal to the contributory retirement appeal board . . . .\u201d Subdivision (3) provides that any member aggrieved by his removal or discharge may bring a petition in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The advice to appeal under G. L. c. 30A was also mistaken. As we noted in <em>Georgetown </em>v. <em>Essex County Retirement Bd., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 272, 273 n.2 (1990), a county retirement board is not an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Counsel to the town suggest in their brief that they accepted the advice on the theory that an appeal to CRAB was the only place where the town \u201ccould have gone under <em>both </em>c. 30A and c. 32, \u00a7 16.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b431-10\">The town also stated a claim under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 \u2014 the usual mode of review of decisions by CRAB. See <em>Namay </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 462 (1985). But since CRAB had no jurisdiction to hear the town\u2019s appeal, c. 30A review would gain the town nothing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The court in <em>MacDonald </em>made no mention of the fact that the State board of retirement is an \u201cagency,\u201d see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(2), and was bound by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(8), as inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1, which provides that parties to an agency proceeding \u201cshall be notified ... of their rights to review or appeal the decision within the agency or before the courts . . . .\u201d Even though the county board is not an \u201cagency,\u201d see note 8, <em>supra, </em>the practice among administrative agencies to provide written notice of rights of appeal has become so pervasive \u2014 as this case illustrates \u2014 that the parties to litigation have come to expect such advice, and to rely on it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\">In <em>Bermant </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Belchertown, </em>425 Mass. 400, 403 (1997), the Supreme Judicial Court held that a declaratory judgment \u201cwas not an alternate . . . remedy to a writ of certiorari to review the decision of a local licensing authority.\u201d Ordering the issuance of a license, the court said, \u201cwould amount to a usurpation by the court of the licensing power [of the licensing authority].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In this case the licensing power of a local licensing authority is not at stake.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
