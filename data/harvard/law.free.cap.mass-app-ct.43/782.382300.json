The jury returned not guilty verdicts on three counts alleging indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen and not guilty on four counts alleging soliciting a child to pose in a state of nudity. The defendant was found guilty of two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen and four counts of soliciting a child to pose in a state of nudity.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">On appeal, the defendant raises one issue \u2014 that the prosecutor\u2019s comments in his closing argument, some of which were subject to an objection, constituted reversible error. \u201cIn analyzing a claim of improper argument, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks must be viewed in the light of the \u2018entire argument, as well as in light of the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury and the evidence at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamrini, </em>392 Mass. 427, 432 (1984), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bourgeois, </em>391 Mass. 869, 885 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The Commonwealth presented the following evidence at the trial. The defendant and his wife, Lisa, lived next door to the Jones<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> family. It was the Commonwealth\u2019s theory at trial that the defendant and his wife engaged in sexual conduct with two of the Joneses\u2019 daughters, Ruth, who was just under two years old, and Mary, who was about two years and seven months old at the time the first alleged sexual conduct took place.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Lisa testified as a witness for the Commonwealth that she first baby-sat for the Jones children three times in one week in September, 1992, and again in December, 1992. In January, 1993, Lisa agreed to baby-sit for Ruth and Mary in the Joneses\u2019 apartment two or three times per week. The incidents that formed the basis of the various counts occurred on one occasion in January, 1993, and one occasion in February, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">According to Lisa, while she was baby-sitting the two girls in January, 1993, the defendant came to the Joneses\u2019 apartment with \u00e1 Polaroid instant camera. Lisa testified that, under duress from the defendant, she photographed him performing various sexual acts on the two young girls; the defendant photographed Lisa engaging in sexual acts with two-year-old Ruth; and the defendant took a photograph of Mary posed in a state of nudity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Similar incidents occurred on one occasion in February, 1993. After each incident, the defendant put the Polaroid pictures in an envelope and placed the envelope underneath some books inside a cabinet in their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Sometime during the second week in April, the defendant and Lisa had an argument after Lisa told him that she wanted a divorce. Because she was afraid that the defendant would bring the incriminating photograph of her performing a sexual act on Ruth to the police, Lisa took the photographs, called her next door neighbor, one Laurie Seymour, and asked her to hide the pictures. Lisa instructed Seymour not to look at the photographs or show them to anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Seymour testified as a witness for the Commonwealth. She testified that about three days after she hid the envelope containing the pictures, she looked at them out of curiosity. Two of the pictures depicted the defendant engaged in a sexual act with a small child; the third photograph showed Lisa engaged in a sexual act with the same child. Seymour put the pictures back in the envelope and returned the envelope to the hiding place. About April 23, 1993, Lisa telephoned Seymour and requested that Seymour return the envelope with the photographs. Seymour did so and she and Lisa burned the photographs. Sometime in May, Seymour called \u201cthe authorities\u201d regarding the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">On May 4, 1993, Lisa also spoke with someone at the Department of Social Services (DSS) regarding the pictures. Lisa also told the defendant that she had notified DSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">On May 6, 1993, the defendant, who was a taxicab driver, picked up Lisa and one Mandy Leo in his cab. Mandy was a friend of both Lisa and the defendant. After driving around for a while, the defendant stopped at a park in Worcester. The defendant asked Mandy to stay in the cab so that he and Lisa could talk privately. Once out of the cab and walking in the park, the defendant asked Lisa why she had gone to DSS. He also told her that when they went to Juvenile Court (apparently DSS had filed a care and protection petition) she should tell the court that she had lied about the pictures. Lisa responded that she could not because DSS \u201cknew the whole truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">Mandy testified that she overheard the defendant urge Lisa \u201cto lie, ... to tell [DSS] that she [had] lied and made the whole thing up.\u201d Mandy also testified that she heard Lisa tell the defendant, \u201cI can\u2019t, Jim, too many people know the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>The police executed a search of the defendant\u2019s apartment and seized an instant Polaroid camera, which Lisa identified as the one used to take the pictures of the children. After the Commonwealth rested, the defendant also rested without putting on any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues that his convictions must be reversed because the prosecutor, in his closing argument, (1) \u201cengaged in an attack upon defense counsel\u2019s integrity and trial conduct so sustained, pervasive and flagrant that it constituted a total deprivation of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel, interfered with the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial by an unbiased jury, and deprived the defendant of the right to be presumed innocent,\u201d (2) made improper comments on the defendant\u2019s exercise of his right not to testify, (3) made improper comments on matters not in evidence, (4) made wrongful references to matters excluded from evidence, and (5) made improper attacks upon the defendant\u2019s character and appearance before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">1. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s alleged attacks on defense counsel\u2019s integrity and trial conduct. </em>In his closing argument, defense counsel attacked the credibility of each of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses by summarizing their testimony and then pointing out repeatedly what he perceived as discrepancies and contradictions in their testimony. That tactic is proper. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murchison, </em>418 Mass. 58, 60 (1994) (\u201cThe credibility of witnesses is obviously a proper subject of comment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">A prosecutor may properly respond to defense counsel\u2019s closing argument to the extent necessary to correct an erroneous impression created by defense counsel. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, 399 </em>Mass. 514, 519 n.9 (1987). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 380-381 (1995). Further, a prosecutor \u201cmay make a fair response to -an attack on the credibility of a government witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chavis, </em>415 Mass. 703, 713 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">Here, the prosecutor told the jury that defense counsel in summarizing the testimony of each of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses had \u201cmisconstrued the evidence\u201d and, while the prosecutor did not think that this was \u201cpurposefully done, . . . it was [nevertheless] improper . . . .\u201d The prosecutor then proceeded to summarize the testimony of each of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses as he saw it and suggested to the jury that, contrary to defense counsel\u2019s argument, there were no discrepancies or contradictions in the testimony of the witnesses. At least twice after summarizing the evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>witnesses, the prosecutor resorted to the use of rhetorical questions (\u201c[Defense counsel], where is the discrepancy?\u201d). Defense counsel objected, and the judge sustained the objection. \u201cAs a general rule, . . . rhetorical questions should not be used in closing argument where they could be perceived by the jury as shifting the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof to the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Habarek, </em>402 Mass. 105, 111 (1988). We have reviewed both objections that were sustained and hold that, in light of the defendant\u2019s closing argument and in the context in which the questions were asked, the prosecutor\u2019s rhetorical questions could not have been perceived by the jury as shifting the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof to the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Valentin, 420 Mass. 263, 274 (1995) (\u201c[T]he thrust of the [prosecutor\u2019s] argument was plainly apparent, and the jury could not have understood it for anything more than a rhetorical effort on the part of the prosecutor to explain\u201d why the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses was indeed credible).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">\u201cAlthough the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were \u2018enthusiastic rhetoric, strong advocacy, and excusable hyperbole,\u2019 they did not cross the line between fair-and improper argument.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 107 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>414 Mass. 618, 628 (1993). Therefore, in view of the prosecutor\u2019s entire argument and the context in which the challenged comments were made, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor made improper comments on defense counsel\u2019s integrity and trial conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">2. <em>Other claimed errors. </em>The defendant claims that at one point in his closing argument the prosecutor referred to a matter that had been excluded from evidence as a result of an objection by defense counsel that was sustained by the judge. The prosecutor stated that defense counsel had told the jury that Lisa had \u201cnever told anybody . . . details about being sexually abused during the marriage.\u201d The prosecutor then noted that defense counsel had objected to the admission of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>so \u201c[h]ow can he get up after having made the objection and say to you there is no evidence of that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">\u201cNo attorney shall refer in closing argument to evidence which has been excluded, nor may he or she invite an inference from the exercise of a party\u2019s right to have evidence excluded.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>373 Mass. 569, 575 (1977). The prosecutor should not have mentioned that defense counsel had objected to the prosecutor\u2019s question, an objection that had been sustained; the error, however, was harmless because the excluded evidence had come in later when Lisa testified that she had told her parents and the police that she had been sexually abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The defendant argues that in closing argument the prosecutor improperly asked why defense counsel had not asked Lisa how \u201cshe came up with the dates as to when [the incidents occurred].\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s argument was in response to defense counsel\u2019s argument that Lisa \u201cnever explained to you how she came up with the dates of mid January and mid February. She never gave you an answer.\u201d However, defense counsel had asked the question, which Lisa had answered. Apparently, the prosecutor had forgotten that defense counsel had asked the question and defense counsel also forgot in his closing argument that she had indeed given an answer to the question. Any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">The defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly referred to the defendant\u2019s \u201cdemeanor\u201d in his closing argument when the prosecutor stated that \u201cLisa was afraid of this man. Look at him.\u201d The prosecutor could properly refer to the defendant\u2019s size in comparison to Lisa\u2019s. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>399 Mass. 527, 530 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">3. <em>Judge\u2019s focused curative instruction. </em>Any error in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was cured by the judge\u2019s particularly strong, forceful, specific instructions to the jury. She repeatedly told the jury about the role of counsel and the function of closing arguments. The judge also warned the jury to \u201cdisregard any opinions that counsel may have expressed about the positions of other counsel or the position that either counsel may have taken during the course of this trial about the way in which other counsel presented or viewed the case <em>....\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>\u201cWe have said that, \u2018[a] certain measure of jury sophistication in sorting out excessive claims on both sides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>may fairly be assumed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass, at 107, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 743 (1990), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, 399 </em>Mass, at 517. We note that the jury returned not guilty verdicts on seven counts. Accordingly, we conclude that, although the prosecutor \u201csailed close to the wind,\u201d the remarks did not prejudicially affect the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-9\">The names of the family and the two victims are pseudonyms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b809-10\">The defendant\u2019s wife pleaded guilty to several counts alleging sexual misconduct in connection with the incidents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s use of rhetorical questions interfered with the defendant\u2019s exercise of his privilege not to testify. Because of the context in which the rhetorical questions were asked, the argument is without merit. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>379 Mass. 878, 892 (1980), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Armedo-Sarmiento, </em>545 F.2d 785, 793 (2d Cir. 1976), cert, denied, 430 U.S. 917 (1977) (the questions were not \u201cof such a nature that a jury would naturally and necessarily construe them to be directed to the failure of the defendant to testify\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
