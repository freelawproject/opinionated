L. c. 151B, and Title VH of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq. (1994). The jury found the defendants not liable on the discrimination counts but awarded Carter damages on her retaliation claim under c. 151B.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The principal issues raised by the parties\u2019 cross appeals are whether Carter\u2019s retaliation complaint was timely filed and whether the trial judge\u2019s jury instructions were erroneous under <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437 (1995). We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Carter, an African-American, began her employment with the Department of Correction (department) in 1978, as a corrections officer at MCI-Framingham. She was promoted to the rank of sergeant in 1982, and to the rank of captain in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">While at Framingham, Carter achieved satisfactory performance evaluations. In 1986, she was transferred to the Long-wood Treatment Center (Longwood), a minimum security institution for inmates with substance abuse problems. At Long-wood, she was under the supervision of Ollie Langlois until his transfer to the Old Colony Correctional Center in 1987. Langlois had a good working relationship with Carter, and he found her to be competent and conscientious. While working under Langlois\u2019s supervision, Carter presented no disciplinary problems and received satisfactory performance evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">After Langlois\u2019s transfer, Sergio Allendes became the deputy superintendent at Longwood as well as Carter\u2019s immediate supervisor. At that time, the defendant Robert Priest was a program director, and he too was supervised by Allendes. Again, while working with Allendes, Carter received satisfactory evaluations. Allendes left Longwood in June, 1989, and the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>David MacDonald appointed Priest the deputy superintendent. Priest thereby became Carter\u2019s supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">About a month after becoming Carter\u2019s supervisor, Priest issued three verbal warnings and one written warning to her about inaccuracies in the inmate count. These warnings resulted in a two-day suspension, effective July 10, 1989.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This was the first time in Carter\u2019s career with the department that she found herself unable to perform her duties to the satisfaction of her supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">When, on July 6, 1989, MacDonald handed Carter written notice of her suspension,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> they had a discussion during which MacDonald advised Carter that a permanent position as sergeant would be coming up soon and that she should give it consideration. He informed her that she was weak, that she lacked managerial ability, and that those officers for whom she was responsible would make more mistakes which, in turn, would lead to her termination. At MacDonald\u2019s suggestion, Carter wrote a letter requesting that she be allowed to resume her former position as sergeant. She also asked MacDonald if, because of pressure and stress, she could take some time off from work. MacDonald granted Carter a short leave, and she was due to return to work on July 17, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">On July 11, 1989, Carter filed a complaint with the MCAD alleging that Priest, a white male, had engaged in \u201cdiscriminatory treatment against [her] with the support of. . . MacDonald, [a] white male,\u201d that Priest had \u201cengaged in a pattern of verbal humiliation, harassment, and undue criticism of [her] performance in order to justify a future termination of [her] employment,\u201d that Priest had relied upon minor discrepancies in her \u201cshift reports\u201d to justify her suspension from work for two days, that no other manager had been subjected to this type of treatment, and that she had been \u201cforced to request a transfer to a lower position by [her] supervisor who told [her] that [her] failure to do so would result in [her] termination.\u201d She also reported that MacDonald and Priest \u201chave created a very hostile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>working environment and numerous persons have witnessed the disparate treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Carter did not return to work on July 17, 1989. Instead, she obtained a stress leave from the department\u2019s stress unit and did not return to Longwood until September 5, 1989. While on leave, Priest telephoned her at home on at least three occasions, each time demanding to know when she intended to return to work and threatening her with disciplinary action. He also demanded that she produce documentation of her medical condition even though the department\u2019s policy did not require documentation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">By July 25, 1989, Carter had retained counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On that date, Carter and her attorney met with MacDonald and an attorney for the department for the purpose of resolving Carter\u2019s claims of discrimination. According to Carter, that meeting ended with an agreement to a second meeting. She testified that at the first meeting there was no discussion concerning a change in her job responsibilities. Such a discussion did take place during the second meeting on August 10, 1989. Attorneys were not present at this meeting. Carter testified that at this time, MacDonald raised the possibility of her returning to work with reduced responsibilities, that there were to be daily meetings to review her progress, and that she would assume her former responsibilities as captain one by one. He presented Carter with a handwritten agreement setting out these proposals. However, Carter refused to accept any of the conditions proposed by MacDonald without first speaking with her attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">MacDonald testified that the meeting on July 25, 1989, closed with an \u201cagreement to look into [Carter] returning as a captain and putting together a formal training program where she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>wouldn\u2019t be overwhelmed and she would assume one duty at a time.\u201d It was his position that the handwritten agreement which he presented to Carter at the second meeting and which she refused to sign was merely documentation of what had been agreed to at the earlier meeting with counsel present. In any event, Carter never signed the agreement presented to her by MacDonald.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Thereafter, Carter withdrew her prior request for demotion and returned to work on or about September 5, 1989'. Her duties were changed drastically and were no longer consistent with the rank of captain. All her previous responsibilities had been taken from her, and she was now in charge of inmate counts, housekeeping, and urine testing. Additionally, she was required to report daily to Priest. At any time when Priest was absent from Longwood, she was required to \u201ccross-train\u201d or work at another institution. Priest would not allow her to speak at staff meetings, and he conveyed her work assignments to her through her subordinates. Without notice to or consent from Carter, Priest changed her 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift to 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. In making that shift change, and contrary to normal practice, Priest had Carter replacing a correction officer rather than a person in a management position.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In another incident, Priest demanded that Carter, contrary to department policy, inform him as to the medical reasons for another employee\u2019s medical leave. When Carter refused to do so, explaining that the female employee had confided in her about an extremely personal matter, Priest reported to MacDonald that Carter had violated a direct order. MacDonald refused to accept Carter\u2019s explanation for her refusal to comply with Priest\u2019s order, and he told her to gather her possessions and leave Longwood. There was evidence to show that under department policy, an employee taking medical leave was only required upon his or her return to provide medical documentation of fitness to work. The department did not require an employee to disclose the reason for the needed medical leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Carter was able to arrange a transfer to the Old Colony Correctional Center where she once again worked with Langlois. When he became the director of security at Bridgewater Treatment Center, Carter again arranged a transfer to go with him. About a year later Langlois received another promotion and left Bridgewater for MCI-Norfolk. There were no disciplinary incidents involving Carter during the eighteen-month period that she worked with Langlois.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>After Langlois\u2019s departure from Bridgewater, Henry Lavalley became Carter\u2019s supervisor. Thereafter, Carter was disciplined for various missteps which, when also made by male employees, would go unnoticed by her supervisor. On December 31, 1991, Carter left her post forty minutes early, an act for which she was suspended without pay for five days. Carter was ultimately transferred to the Southeastern Correctional Center where she was employed, as a captain, at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">1. <em>Timeliness of the retaliation </em>charges.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> An action cannot be brought in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 9, unless it is preceded by the filing of a complaint of unlawful discrimination with the MCAD within six months of the occurrence of the discriminatory event. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5. The Superior Court action may be commenced ninety days after the filing of the complaint with the MCAD, or sooner if MCAD permission is obtained, but not later than three years after the alleged unlawful discrimination. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9. See also <em>Cherella </em>v. <em>Phoenix Technologies, Ltd.., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 919 (1992); <em>Tardanico </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 443, 444-445 (1996). The requirement that the \u00a7 9 action be preceded by the MCAD complaint \u201chas a dual purpose. First, it is meant to provide the agency with an opportunity to investigate and conciliate the claim of discrimination. Second, the filing requirement provides notice to the defendant of a potential suit.\u201d <em>Conroy </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>758 F. Supp. 54, 57 (D. Mass. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Carter filed her discrimination complaint with the MCAD on July 11, 1989. On August 25, 1989, she notified the MCAD that she and the defendants were attempting to resolve their differences and requested a stay of the MCAD action for a period of ninety days. The retaliatory acts against Carter were alleged to have occurred between August 28 and December 31, 1989. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>However, the MCAD complaint was not amended until October 15, 1991, and the Superior Court action was not brought until August 28, 1992. It has been the defendants\u2019 position from the outset of the Superior Court action that Carter\u2019s amendment of her complaint with the MCAD and her Superior Court action were time barred under both G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 9. We consider first the amendment to the MCAD complaint.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Preliminarily, it is not clear that an amendment to the MCAD \u00a7 5 complaint was a necessary prerequisite to filing a \u00a7 9 complaint encompassing retaliation in the Superior Court. There is Federal authority for the proposition that \u201cit [is] unnecessary for a plaintiff to exhaust administrative remedies before she can bring to court a retaliation claim not previously made known to the administrative agency, but arising out of a charge filed earlier with that agency.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Mitre Corp., </em>949 F. Supp. 943, 948 (D. Mass. 1997). See <em>Gupta </em>v. <em>East Tex. State Univ., </em>654 F.2d 411, 413-414 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Hartshorne Pub. Sch. Dist. No. 1, </em>864 F.2d 680, 682 (10th Cir. 1988), and cases therein cited. Although we think these decisions persuasive, we need not determine whether we should follow the Federal reasoning. See <em>Lynn Teachers Union, Local 1037 </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>406 Mass. 515, 521-522 n.7 (1990). Irrespective of whether there was any need to amend the original charge made pursuant to \u00a7 5 in order to bring it within the scope of the \u00a7 9 Superior Court action, we see no error in the MCAD\u2019s order allowing the amendment for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Authorization for amendment of MCAD complaints is found in 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.03(5) (1986). As relevant, that section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">\u201c(a) A complaint or any part thereof may be amended . . . to clarify and amplify allegations made therein. An amendment alleging additional acts constituting unlawful discriminatory practices related to or arising out of the subject matter of the original complaint may be permitted by leave of the Commissioner. Amendments shall relate back to the original filing date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">\u201c(b) Amendments may be made pursuant to 804 CMR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>1.03(5) by the Investigating Commissioner or the Complainant at any time prior to the issuance of a notice of public hearing as provided for in 804 CMR 1.15(4). The complaint may be amended thereafter by the Hearing Commissioner or the Complainant with leave of the Hearing Commissioner. In each instance a copy of the amended complaint shall be served upon the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The amendment in the present case was allowed by the investigating commissioner who also served a copy of the amendment upon the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">There can be no serious claim that the alleged retaliation was not related to or arising out of the subject matter of the original complaint, and the defendants do not advance one. Rather, it is their position that allowance of the amendment was unfair in that it was contrary to the dual purpose of the requirement that a \u00a7 9 action be preceded by a \u00a7 5 complaint, that is, conciliation and notice. See <em>Conroy </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>758 E Supp. at 57. They argue that although the MCAD was put on notice of settlement efforts by Carter\u2019s request of August 28, 1989, for a stay of the agency proceedings, it nonetheless allowed the amendment without first conducting an independent investigation or providing the defendant with an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">There is no force in the defendants\u2019 claim that the allowance of the amendment frustrated the conciliation purpose of the filing requirement. The original charge of discrimination was still before the investigating commissioner when the amendment was allowed on October 15, 1991. Although action on that charge had been stayed at Carter\u2019s request for the purpose of exploring settlement, we think that the investigating commissioner reasonably could conclude, some fourteen months later, that settlement efforts had proved futile. Further, there was a ten-month time lag between the amendment and the filing of the \u00a7 9 complaint in the Superior Court. Not only is there nothing in the record to show when or what action, if any, the MCAD took on the charges, as amended, there is also nothing to show that, subsequent to the amendment, the defendants still wished to conciliate their differences with Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Notwithstanding any surprise the defendants may have experienced upon receiving notice of the amendment, they do not point to (and we do not find) anything in the regulations which requires that they be given notice and an opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>be heard on the propriety of any order allowing an amendment to a complaint. Nor is such a right implicit in \u00a7 5. The notice interest at stake in that provision pertains to notice of the scope of the potential action that can be brought under \u00a7 9. That interest could not have been frustrated by allowance of the amendment almost ten months prior to the filing of the Superior Court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Turning to Carter\u2019s \u00a7 9 complaint, which was filed in the Superior Court on August 29, 1992, the defendants argue that the statute requires the complaint to be brought \u201cnot later than three years after the alleged unlawful practice occurred.\u201d They claim that the statute began to run as of the date of the first discriminatory act in July, 1989, rather than as of the date of the last act in December, 1989. The trial judge, however, concluded that because Carter\u2019s claim for retaliation was necessarily and reasonably related to her original claim of discrimination, the acts forming the basis of the retaliation claim, which occurred in December, must be considered as part of the alleged unlawful practice. Put another way, the trial judge construed the words \u201cunlawful practice\u201d in \u00a7 9 to comprehend continuing violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">In respect to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Federal decisions discuss two types of continuing violations, serial and systemic. See <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>910 F. Supp. 1399, 1413-1417 (N.D. Iowa 1995), and cases and authorities therein collected. The theory of continuing violations of the serial type has been described in the following terms: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>Mack </em>v. <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., </em>871 F.2d 179, 183 (1st Cir. 1989). See <em>Sabree </em>v. <em>United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners, </em>Local <em>No. 33, </em>921 F.2d 396, 399-400 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u201c[T]he theory recognizes that some acts are imbricated, i.e., they involve an interlinked succession of related events or a fully-integrated course of conduct. Although the limitations clock generally starts with the commission of a discriminatory act, a true \u2018continuing violation\u2019 rewinds the clock for each discriminatory episode along the way. See <em>Velazquez </em>v. <em>Chardon, </em>736 F.2d 831, 833 (1st Cir. 1984); <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>607 F.2d 1014, 1018 (1st Cir. 1979), cert, denied, 445 U.S. 929, 100 S.Ct. 1317, 63 L.Ed.2d 726 (1980). B. Schlei &amp; P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law, 235 (2d ed. Supp. 1987). Thus, if the later violations in the series are within the prescriptive period, an employee may pursue them despite the fact that earlier acts, forming part and parcel of the same pattern, have grown stale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The MCAD\u2019s determination, which we accept, that the retaliatory acts alleged by Carter were sufficiently related to justify amendment of her complaint under 804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 103(5)(a) (1986), see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Hartshorne Pub. Sch. Dist. No. 1, </em>864 F.2d at 682, establishes the overlap required for a finding of a serial continuing violation. See <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors of La. State Univ., </em>715 F.2d 971, 981 (5th Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The defendants also appear to recognize this. They did not argue that the acts were too unrelated to allow amendment of the complaint, and they do not argue that the acts do not constitute a continuing violation. Rather, they rely upon Federal decisions which hold that the theory of a continuing violation applies only to the limitations period for the filing of an agency complaint and does not extend the time in which the civil court action must be commenced. See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>St. Paul Postal Serv., </em>720 F.2d 524, 525 (8th Cir. 1983), cert, denied, 465 U.S. 1083 (1984) (\u201cA claim of continuing discrimination does not in any way affect the complainant\u2019s obligation to file an action in district court within thirty [now ninety] days of receipt of the agency\u2019s final decision disposing of his complaint\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">These Federal decisions do not support the defendant\u2019s argument. Under the Federal statute of limitations, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) (1994), the event which triggers the running of the limitation period is notice of the agency\u2019s decision. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>General Servs. Admn., </em>425 U.S. 820, 829-832 (1976); <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Bentsen, </em>41 F.3d 1195, 1197-1199 (7th Cir. 1994). The theory of a continuing violation would have ho relevance to such an event. Where, however, the triggering event is the occurrence of the alleged unlawful practice, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(l) (1994) (\u201cwithin one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred\u201d), the theory applies. See <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>910 F. Supp. at 1413-1414 &amp; nn. 4 &amp; 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">In <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>384 Mass. 198, 207-208 (1981), the court held that there was \u201c[n]othing in the wording\u201d of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 5, that conflicted with the continuing violation rule promulgated by the MCAD, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>804 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.03(2),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or which required that the statutory six-month limitation period be computed as of the date of the earliest unlawful act. See <em>Lynn Teachers Union, Local 1037 </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>406 Mass, at 520. Section 5 provides that \u201c[a]ny complaint filed pursuant to this section must be so filed within six months after the alleged <em>act </em>of discrimination\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5, as appearing in St. 1983, c. 628, \u00a7 4. It would be anomalous to recognize the applicability of the continuing violation rule in respect to \u00a7 5, while precluding its application to \u00a7 9. To conclude otherwise could prevent private enforcement under \u00a7 9 of claims of continuing violations on the basis that they became time barred during the MCAD proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">2. <em>Judgment notwithstanding the verdict. </em>It is the defendants\u2019 contention that they were entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the basis of an estoppel. They claim that those actions which Carter alleged to be retaliatory had been mutually agreed upon at the parties\u2019 second meeting on August 10, 1989, as a condition of her return to work in the position of captain.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The evidence precludes the contention that as matter of law the parties had reached agreement on August 10, 1989. The agreement itself is not only unsigned, it reflects that Carter refused to sign and that she wished to discuss the matter with her therapist.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The matter was never reported settled to the MCAD, and Carter testified at trial that she never entered into any agreement with the defendants. The defendants\u2019 reliance upon <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Gordon Flesch Co., </em>793 F.2d 858 (7th Cir. 1986), is, therefore, misplaced. In that case, an oral settlement agreement between the parties had been reached. The question before the court was whether that agreement was binding upon the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ties in a Title VII action, notwithstanding a State law requirement that a settlement agreement must be in writing to be binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Nor were the defendants entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the basis that their actions were indisputably the product of their good faith belief that Carter had agreed to them. They argue that Carter had requested to be demoted to sergeant and that the proposals upon which they believed she had agreed were designed to retrain her so that she ultimately would be capable of performing as a captain. Their argument is made, however, on the basis of the evidence taken in the light most favorable to them. But see <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. 813, 820-821 (1997), and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Carter not only testified that she had withdrawn the request for demotion which MacDonald had suggested she make, but the purported agreement itself reflects that her \u201c[Ijetter requesting demotion to sgt. has been withdrawn.\u201d Further, although the agreement states that Carter had to accept the terms therein proposed, daily meetings and reduced responsibilities, \u201cbefore reporting to work as Capt.,\u201d the agreement and Carter\u2019s testimony show that she returned to work without having accepted any of the terms recited in the purported agreement. Although there was also evidence to show that Priest had kept written reports of his daily progress meetings with Carter and that she had signed her name to those reports, Carter testified that her signature was no more than an acknowledgment of what in fact had occurred rather than indication of her assent to what was being done. According to Carter, she continued to question her new responsibilities, her lack of authority, her performance evaluations, and her disparate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Carter also related how she found it particularly demeaning that, although her responsibilities had been reduced greatly upon her return to work, one of the duties of a captain which she was allowed to retain was supervision of housecleaning. Although the defendants argue there was undisputed evidence to show that this was a supervisory duty involving no physical labor, that it was one of the many responsibilities of a captain, and that Carter\u2019s duties were gradually increased, the argument misses the mark. Carter\u2019s claim was that her duties should not have been reduced in the first place and that the reduction, alleged to be retaliatory, was particularly demeaning because of the nature of the duty left to her until her supervisors determined that she was capable of doing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to withstand the defendants\u2019 motions for a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Compare <em>MacCormack </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>423 Mass. 652, 663-664 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">3. <em>Excluded evidence of state of mind. </em>Sergio Allendes was questioned on direct examination by Carter about two of his written evaluations of her, in which he noted that she was behind schedule in meeting a performance goal involving laboratory reports of various tests performed on the inmates. In particular, he was asked whether Carter\u2019s performance in that area could have been affected by the fact that the institution recently had entered into a contract with a new laboratory. He replied that he had no memory of the \u201cspecifics\u201d which formed the basis of the evaluation. He also had no memory of the \u201cspecifics\u201d of another evaluation in which he wrote that Carter had to develop her written communication skills and her ability to delegate.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">On cross-examination by the defendants, Allendes stated that he never saw MacDonald treat Carter or any other employee in a discriminatory or demeaning manner, that he had daily staff meetings during which he could see that Carter and Priest did not get along with each other, that both \u201cwere very territorial.\u201d He also related that he gave daily assessments of Carter\u2019s and Priest\u2019s performance to MacDonald.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">At no time did the defendants ask Allendes what he told MacDonald about Carter during those daily meetings. However, on cross-examination of MacDonald, the defendants asked him to relate what Allendes was telling him \u201con a day-to-day basis\u201d about Carter\u2019s performance. Carter\u2019s objection to the question was sustained. MacDonald was then asked whether he, at some time, had made a judgment that Carter was having problems performing as a captain. MacDonald answered that after two years of experience, Carter should have been more proficient in the performance of her duties. Instead, her mistakes were becoming more repetitious. It was not until MacDonald added that Allendes \u201cwas becoming more frustrated with her supervision\u201d that Carter interrupted with an objection. The trial judge sustained the objection on the stated basis that MacDonald could not describe Allendes\u2019s feelings about Carter\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The argument on appeal, which was never put to the trial judge, is that the excluded evidence was relevant to a crucial issue, MacDonald\u2019s state of mind and motive in taking the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>tions that he did against Carter. This claim might be persuasive had the trial judge\u2019s rulings been made in respect to Allendes\u2019s, account of his daily statements to MacDonald. \u201cThe state of mind exception to the hearsay rule allows the admission of extrajudicial statements to show the state of mind of the <em>declarant </em>if it is relevant to a material issue in the case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borodine, </em>371 Mass. 1, 7-9 (1976).\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 396, 398 (1984). Irrespective of the truth of any disparaging statements Allendes might have made to MacDonald \u00e1bout Carter\u2019s performance, such statements could be deemed relevant to whether MacDonald had a basis other than retaliation for his actions. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>416 Mass. 831, 837 (1994), and cases therein cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 949 (1992). However, the defendants chose not to ask the declarant, Allendes, about his statements, apparently preferring to ask MacDonald for his version of those statements to show a legitimate basis for his actions. We do not consider the defendants\u2019 assertion that Allendes\u2019s inability to remember \u201cspecifics\u201d made him an unavailable declarant. Allendes\u2019s inability to remember pertained only to the \u201cspecific\u201d bases for two of his written evaluations. There is nothing to show that he could not remember, even in a general way, what he told MacDonald about Carter\u2019s performance. In these circumstances, there was no abuse of discretion or other error of law in the trial judge\u2019s rulings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">THE PLAINTIFF\u2019S CROSS APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">On appeal, Carter claims error in the jury instruction on her burden of proof.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The stated basis for her objection to the instruction was that, although it was consistent with <em>St. Mary\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>Honor Center </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502 (1993), State law entitled her to recover damages if she established a prima facie case and showed that the defendants\u2019 articulated reasons for their actions were a pretext, and that she was not required also to prove more, that the pretext was, in fact, a sham covering discrimination. See <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, 371 </em>Mass. 130, 138 (1976); <em>Brunner </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster Engr. Corp., </em>413 Mass. 698, 700 (1992). In noting Carter\u2019s objection, the trial judge expressed the view that the subsequent <em>St. Mary\u2019s </em>decision had become State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Almost four months after the trial, the Supreme Judicial Court reaffirmed that \u201cMassachusetts is a pretext only jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass, at 443. The defendants do not argue that the instructions are consistent with <em>Blare. </em>Rather, their argument is essentially a claim that <em>Blare </em>applies only on motions for summary judgment. A similar argument was disposed of in <em>Handrahan </em>v. <em>Red Roof Inns, Inc., ante </em>13, 18-19 &amp; n.13 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">It is not enough, however, for Carter simply to show error in the instructions. She must also show prejudice from the error,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and we find none. In his instructions, the trial judge told the jury that they were to answer, as to each defendant, whether that defendant \u201cdid . . . intentionally discriminate against the plaintiff . . . because of her race and/or sex while she worked at the Longwood Treatment Center\u201d either by disparate treatment (discipline) or by retaliation. For each defendant, the jury answered \u201cno\u201d as to discrimination by disparate treatment and \u201cyes\u201d as to \u201cdiscrimination by retaliation.\u201d The jury were also informed that a yes answer to any one or more of those ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>tions required them to then determine the \u201camount of fair and reasonable compensation\u201d to be awarded Carter. The jury fixed the amount at $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Because of the trial judge\u2019s instructions on damages, we do not think it reasonably can be said that the award might have been greater had the jury found discrimination by disparate treatment in addition to retaliation. He instructed that there were two components to an award of reasonable compensation, lost wages and emotional distress. As to the latter, he went on: \u201cIn that category we consider shock, anxiety, embarrassment, mental anguish resulting from the discrimination, the intentional discrimination by reason of disparate treatment in the area of discipline and/or retaliation .... You and you alone determine what the lost wages would be, what the pain and suffering or the emotional distress award would be. You add them together and you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s a single figure for a damage award. There is no yardstick, jurors, in this area. You use your common sense, your sense of fair play, your background and experience with all of life\u2019s events to reach a damage award, guided by the fact that it must be limited to lost wages and/or pain and suffering, emotional distress, resulting from any intentional discrimination in the areas of disparate treatment, that is discipline, and/or retaliation that you find to have occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">In instructing the jury on how to arrive at a figure for damages, the trial judge did not suggest that the jurors were to assign a dollar value to each of the various elements of distress to be considered, e.g., shock, anxiety, embarrassment, etc., then add those figures up to arrive at the amount assigned for emotional distress. Rather, he instructed them to consider the over-all distress suffered by Carter, whether it be from disparate treatment or retaliation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Based upon the instructions on damages and the form of the questions put to the jury for their determination, to which no objections were lodged, we see no prejudice to Carter by reason of any error in the instructions on her burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-12\">Carter raises no issue concerning the jury\u2019s verdict for the defendants on her Title VII claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Under the department\u2019s \u201cprogressive discipline\u201d policy, a verbal warning preceded a written warning followed by a formal written warning and suspension and, finally, termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Under the department\u2019s rules and regulations, only the superintendent had the authority to impose a suspension.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\">At trial, Carter presented evidence of three incidents of disparate treatment.

That motion was denied by a judge other than the trial judge on the basis of existing disputed material facts. The matter was again raised immediately prior to trial, but the trial judge declined to reconsider the prior ruling notwithstanding his authority to do so. The question was ultimately decided on the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict which, as to this issue, the trial judge treated as a motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Review of the MCAD order allowing the amendment is open to us under <em>Christo </em>v. <em>Edward G.
