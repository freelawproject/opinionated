(Red Roof), discriminated against her on the basis of her handicap.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4. Following a jury trial, a jury awarded the plaintiff $1,705,000 in damages; that amount was comprised of $55,000 in back pay, $600,000 in front pay, $50,000 for emotional distress, and $1,000,000 in punitive damages. The defendant then filed motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (n.o.v.), new trial, and remittitur. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motions for judgment n.o.v. and new trial but allowed its motion for remittitur, reducing the front pay award by $112,200 and the punitive damage award by $900,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judgment was subsequently entered for the plaintiff in the amount of $732,700.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both parties appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">We first consider the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial judge erred in denying its motion for judgment n.o.v. The defendant asserts that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of discrimination under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(16).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">In bringing a claim for handicap discrimination under this section, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case. <em>Tardanico </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 443, 447 (1996). Once the plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate reason for its actions. <em>Ibid. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Thereafter, the burden shifts back to the employee to show that the employer\u2019s asserted reason was not the true reason, but rather a pretext.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[I]f the fact finder concludes that the plaintiff has proved that the employer\u2019s reasons are a pretext,[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] then the plaintiff prevails.\u201d <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437, 446 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">From the evidence presented at trial, the jury could have found the following facts. The plaintiff, an epileptic, began working for the defendant as a housekeeper in 1983. At that time, she did not disclose her epilepsy to the defendant because she feared that she might be fired. From December, 1983, through December, 1990, the plaintiff received favorable performance evaluations and, on several occasions, was generally noted as being a good employee. The plaintiff, however, was often criticized for her inability to clean her assigned rooms in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">On the morning of April 10, 1991, the plaintiff suffered an epileptic seizure while at her brother\u2019s home. Since the plaintiff was scheduled to work that day, her sister-in-law called the defendant and spoke with one of its female employees. She told the woman that the plaintiff had had a \u201cgrand mal seizure,\u201d and requested that she relay this information to the plaintiff\u2019s boss. The woman agreed to do so. When the plaintiff returned to work the next day, her boss, Brian Thompson, requested a note from her doctor. The plaintiff subsequently obtained a doctor\u2019s note indicating that she could return to work. The note, which contained the heading \u201cNeurological Services,\u201d made no mention of the plaintiff having had a seizure. On April 16, 1991, the plaintiff told Thompson that she needed to leave work early because her medication had made her tired.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">On April 11, 1991, Annie M. Cowles, a former coworker of the plaintiff, filed a complaint against the defendant with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>her complaint, Cowles alleged that the defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her epilepsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">On May 27, 1991, the plaintiff received a disciplinary warning for failing to complete her room assignments. Three days later, the plaintiff received a second warning for not completing her rooms in the allotted time frame. At that time, the plaintiff was warned that if she fell behind again she would be terminated. On June 4, 1991, the plaintiff was fired after she failed, once again, to finish cleaning her assigned rooms within the allotted time.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">1. <em>Evidence of discrimination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">a. <em>Prima facie case. </em>Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, we think that the plaintiff met her initial burden of establishing a prima facie case. \u201cTo establish the prima facie case of unlawful employment discrimination on the basis of handicap pursuant to G. L. c. 151B, a plaintiff who has been terminated from employment must show that: (1) [s]he suffers from a handicap; (2) [s]he is a \u2018qualified handicapped person\u2019; and (3) [s]he was fired solely because of [her] handicap.\u201d <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. 813, 821 (1997), and cases cited. Here, the plaintiff introduced sufficient evidence on each of the required elements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">b. <em>Defendant\u2019s articulated reason. </em>It is undisputed that the defendant articulated a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. It was the defendant\u2019s contention at trial that it terminated the plaintiff because she routinely failed to clean her assigned rooms within the allotted time. According to the defendant, each housekeeper was expected to comply with a thirty minute per room requirement (\u201cthirty-minute rule\u201d). The defendant contended that, in an effort to become more competitive, it began to enforce strictly its thirty-minute rule. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The defendant stated that, after implementing this stringent enforcement policy, the plaintiff continued to have difficulty completing her room assignments. The defendant introduced evidence that the plaintiff was given two warnings, and was not terminated until she failed for a third time to comply with the thirty-minute rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">c. <em>Evidence of pretext. </em>Although the evidence is slim, the jury reasonably could have found the defendant\u2019s asserted reason to be a pretext. Based on the evidence, the jury could have disbelieved the defendant\u2019s claim that the thirty-minute rule was an established company policy. The plaintiff indicated that the first time she learned of the thirty-minute rule was May 30, 1991, the date she received her second disciplinary warning.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although some of the plaintiff\u2019s evaluations refer to a company standard, none mentions a thirty minute per room requirement. Moreover, the housekeeping handbook contains no mention of the thirty-minute rule. In fact, Thompson, during cross-examination, acknowledged that the thirty-minute rule was not \u201cper se\u201d in the handbook.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">There was also conflicting evidence as to when the thirty-minute rule was implemented. According to Thompson, the thirty-minute rule was already in place when he returned to Framingham in February, 1990.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, Patricia V. Freeman, the head housekeeper at that time, indicated that the thirty-minute rule was not implemented until some time after Thompson arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The timing of the enforcement of the thirty-minute rule as to this plaintiff is also suspect and could support an inference that the defendant\u2019s real motive was discrimination. The defendant asserts that the plaintiff\u2019s difficulties in timely completing her room assignments were long-standing. Yet despite this recurring criticism, her reviews throughout her employment with Red Roof were generally good. Moreover, prior to her disclosure of her handicap, she never received a warning for failing to complete her assignments, nor was she ever disciplined on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>The defendant\u2019s explanation that the sudden stepped-up enforcement of the thirty-minute rule in May, 1991, was motivated by economic concerns also could have been rejected by the jury. Thompson testified that toward the beginning of 1991, the company began to focus on controlling costs, and that in January or February of that year, there was emphasis placed on lowering the number of minutes spent cleaning each room. However, when asked whether there was an increased focus on enforcement of the thirty-minute rule during this time period, 1990 to 1991, Gregg Weisz, another employee of the defendant, testified that he could not recall such an increase. The defendant contends that Weisz\u2019s testimony did not contradict that of Thompson\u2019s because Weisz at that time worked at a Red Roof Inn in Salem, New Hampshire. However, there was evidence that both the Framingham and Salem locations were controlled by the same regional director, Mark G. Workman. Therefore, the jury could have concluded that, if there were such a shift in direction, Weisz would have been aware of it. Based on this somewhat equivocal evidence, the jury could have disbelieved some or all of the testimony of the defendant\u2019s agents that their real motivation in strictly enforcing the thirty-minute rule was to contain costs. See <em>Finney </em>v. <em>Madico, Inc., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 46, 51 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">On the foregoing evidence, the jury could reasonably have concluded that the thirty-minute rule was not a well-established company policy, as the defendant contended, but rather a new rule implemented and enforced only after the defendant learned of the plaintiff\u2019s handicap. Accordingly, the trial judge correctly denied the defendant\u2019s motions for a directed verdict and for judgment n.o.v.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">2. <em>Jury instructions. </em>The trial judge instructed the jury that \u201conce the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and shows that the employer\u2019s articulated reasons are pretext . . . the plaintiff is entitled to recover for illegal discrimination under Chapter 151B.\u201d The defendant argues that the judge erred in not instructing the jury<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that the plaintiff must prove not only that the employer\u2019s asserted reasons are a pretext, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>but also that they are a pretext for discrimination.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See note 6, <em>supra. </em>Essentially, the defendant asks this court to depart from the teachings of <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., supra, </em>wherein, in dicta, at 446, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">\u201cCombined with establishment of a prima facie case by a preponderance of the evidence, a showing of pretext eliminates any legitimate explanation for the adverse hiring decision and warrants a determination that the plaintiff was the victim of unlawful discrimination. The plaintiff need not conclusively exclude all other possible explanations for the decision and prove intent beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Acknowledging that the <em>Blare </em>case was an appeal from a grant of summary judgment, we nonetheless believe that we are constrained, even in the face of thin evidence of pretext, to follow the language of Blare.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As the judge\u2019s instructions flowed from and were consistent with the teaching of <em>Blare, </em>we cannot rightly say the judge committed reversible error in this regard.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>3. <em>Evidentiary rulings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">a. <em>Admission of expert testimony. </em>To assist the jury in assessing the amount of punitive damages, the plaintiff, over the defendant\u2019s objection, was permitted to introduce expert testimony concerning the value of Red Roof. Michael Bradley, an \u201cexpert\u201d in the hotel industry, testified that the $620,000,000 which a buyer paid to acquire Red Roof in 1993 was probably a fair price. The defendant does not challenge Bradley\u2019s qualifications as an expert. Instead, the defendant maintains that the plaintiff failed to provide an adequate foundation for his testimony. Specifically, the defendant contends that \u2014 since Bradley was not involved in the actual purchase and was not privy to the specifics of the transaction \u2014 there was no basis for him to evaluate Red Roof\u2019s worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">We agree with the trial judge that the defendant\u2019s objection went to the weight and not the admissibility of the evidence Although Bradley\u2019s testimony with regard to the purchase price was based exclusively on published reports, the plaintiff did not object to its admission. Once the $620,000,000 figure came in without objection, we think that there was a reasonable basis for Bradley to assess whether the buyer paid a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>price for its acquisition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion. See <em>Giannasca </em>v. <em>Everett Aluminum, Inc., </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 2Q8, 211 (1982) (\u201cThe admission of expert testimony rests in large part in the sound discretion of the trial judge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">b. <em>Exclusion of agency finding. </em>The defendant next argues that the trial judge erred in excluding from evidence the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination\u2019s (MCAD) finding of lack of probable cause. See and compare <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Health, </em>419 Mass. 356, 364 (1995) (MCAD finding considered on summary judgment). Specifically, the defendant maintains that it was error for the judge to exclude the MCAD finding because it was \u201crelevant to the supposed \u2018egregiousness\u2019 or \u2018recklessness\u2019 of Red Roof\u2019s conduct\u201d and thus, could have made a difference in the jury\u2019s assessment of punitive damages. The defendant, however, did not articulate this contention below. On the plaintiff\u2019s pretrial motion in limine the defendant argued that the MCAD finding should have been admitted because it was relevant to whether the plaintiff could prove her claim of discrimination by a preponderance of evidence. Although the defendant referred to punitive damages during a colloquy between defense counsel and the judge, the defendant\u2019s remarks were addressed to the judge and centered on whether he should permit the jury, in light of the MCAD finding, to consider punitive damages at all.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cHaving stated specifically the basis of [its] objection, the defendant], in fairness, ought not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>to be permitted to urge other gro\u00fands in this court.\u201d <em>Kagan </em>v. <em>Levenson, </em>334 Mass. 100, 107 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Moreover, the judge\u2019s ruling merely prohibited the use of the MCAD finding in the defendant\u2019s opening. See note 16, <em>supra. </em>As such, it was preliminary in nature. The docket fails to disclose the final resolution of the motion in limine, and merely indicates that the motion was \u201callowed as to any mention in the defendant\u2019s opening.\u201d It does not appear from the record on appeal that the disputed evidence was ever proffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The defendant also argues that the trial judge erred in permitting the plaintiff to introduce evidence that it contested her unemployment compensation claim. However, the defendant did not object below, and has waived the issue for review. See <em>Freyermuth </em>v. <em>Lufty, </em>376 Mass. 612, 616 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">4. <em>Damages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">a. <em>Punitive damages. </em>The jury awarded the plaintiff $1,000,000 in punitive damages. Thereafter, the trial judge, concluding that the amount was excessive, reduced the award to $100,000. On appeal, the defendant maintains that the trial judge erred in allowing the jury to consider punitive damages because there was no evidence to suggest that its conduct was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>intentional or reckless.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We disagree. There was evidence presented at trial from which the jury could have concluded that, upon learning of the plaintiff\u2019s condition, the defendant endeavored to bring about the plaintiff\u2019s termination. Although the evidence of discrimination was less than overwhelming, we agree with the trial judge that it was sufficient to warrant submitting the issue of punitive damages to the jury. See <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>424 Mass. 758, 767 (1997) (punitive damages are appropriate \u201cwhere a defendant\u2019s conduct warrants condemnation and deterrence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">b. <em>Front pay. </em>The jury awarded the plaintiff $600,000 in front pay. Thereafter, the trial judge, concluding that the amount was excessive, reduced the award to $487,800. Although the judge found that the jury might have credited the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that she intended to work for the defendant for the rest of her life, and that the front pay reflected the jury\u2019s calculation of the plaintiff\u2019s salary and benefits over a thirty-year period, he concluded that the jury had failed to take mitigation into account. Noting that the plaintiff had been able to secure seasonal employment at a country club, the judge determined that the plaintiff would be able to mitigate her damages by obtaining part-time employment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The judge then recalculated the award to reflect the likelihood that tihe plaintiff would be able to obtain, at least, seventeen weeks of full-time employment per year. Accordingly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>judge reduced the award by $112,200, the judge\u2019s estimate of the plaintiff\u2019s part-time wages over a thirty-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The defendant raises several contentions regarding the front-pay award. First, the defendant argues that the trial judge erred in not considering whether reinstatement was a viable option. Under Massachusetts law, \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s rejection of an objectively reasonable offer of reinstatement terminates an employee\u2019s eligibility for an award of damages based upon lost pay accruing after such a rejection.\u201d <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Electro Switch Corp., </em>402 Mass. 385, 389-390 (1988). Here, however, there was no evidence that the defendant offered to reinstate the plaintiff. A plaintiff is not required \u201cto make a request for reinstatement as a prerequisite to a claim for front pay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390. Thus, the defendant\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">In addition, the defendant argues that, since front pay is equitable in nature, the trial judge, not the jury, should have determined whether the plaintiff was entitled to receive front pay. We disagree. The award of front pay in cases brought under c. 15IB is compensatory in nature. <em>Id. </em>at 387-388.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Although we think that the issue of front pay was properly before the jury, we agree with the defendant that the front pay award, even as remitted, is excessive, and lacks adequate support in the record. Cf. <em>doCanto </em>v. <em>Ametek, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 776, 787 (1975). \u201c[D]amages may not be determined by speculation or guess, must be causally related to the defendant\u2019s, wrongdoing, and the plaintiff should not be made more than whole.\u201d <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Electro Switch Corp., supra </em>at 388 (citations omitted). Here, as noted by the trial judge, there is no evidence to suggest that the plaintiff will be unable to obtain comparable full-time employment in the future. In fact, both the plaintiff and her therapist indicated that the plaintiff did not plan to pursue full-time employment until <em>after </em>the conclusion of the trial. In the circumstances, an award of thirty years of front pay, even as remitted, is highly speculative. \u201c[T]he greater the period of time upon which a front pay award is calculated in a case involving an at-will employee the less likely it is that the loss of future earnings can be demonstrated with any degree of certainty or can reasonably be attributed to the illegal conduct of the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388-389. We conclude, therefore, that the trial judge failed to reduce the front pay award sufficiently to reflect the likelihood that at some point in the future the plaintiff will obtain full-time employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Accordingly, we remand the case to the Superior Court for recomputation of the front-pay damages in a manner not inconsistent with our opinion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See in this regard <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins </em>&amp; Wheeler, 424 Mass, at 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-10\"> Annie Cowles, a coworker, joined the plaintiff in this action.

The Supreme Judicial Court, however, appears to favor the position taken by the dissent in that case. \u201cThe dissent reasoned that a showing of pretext entitles the plaintiff to a determination of discrimination. Otherwise, \u2018under the majority\u2019s scheme, a victim of discrimination lacking direct evidence will now be saddled with the tremendous disadvantage of having to confront, not the defined task of proving the employer\u2019s stated reasons to be false, but the amorphous requirement of disproving all possible nondiscriminatory reasons that a factfinder might find lurking in the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blare, </em>419 Mass, at 444, quoting from <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center </em>v. <em>Hicks, supra </em>at 534-535 (Souter, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Similarly unavailing is the defendant\u2019s companion argument that <em>Blare </em>is inapposite here because the plaintiff herself introduced a different nondiscriminatory explanation for the defendant\u2019s conduct: i.e., the defendant\u2019s desire to employ lower wage workers.- The defendant contends that, even if the jury found that this was the true reason for the plaintiff\u2019s discharge, they, in light of the judge\u2019s instructions, would have been obligated to find for the plaintiff.

In eight months he eliminated two of his highest paid workers, saving approximately $5,700 in labor costs in Susan\u2019s firing alone.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">It is important to note that the plaintiff argued that the savings in labor costs was a secondary benefit of the plaintiff\u2019s termination, not a reason for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">During deliberations, the jury requested additional instructions, asking the judge the following question:</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">\u201cIf the articulated reason for termination is not agreed upon, . . . does the reason hidden by a pretext have to be handicapped?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">The defendant argues that this question indicates that at least some members of the jury were considering the savings in labor costs as an alternative nondiscriminatory reason for the plaintiff\u2019s firing. Without speculating on the many possible meanings of the jury\u2019s question, the judge\u2019s response, to which both parties agreed, was appropriate. In his response, the judge told the jury that they must determine if the defendant\u2019s asserted reason was a pretext. In addition, the judge reminded the jury that \u201cthe plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion on the ultimate issue of discrimination.\u201d The trial judge\u2019s carefully crafted response stayed true to the teachings of <em>Blare </em>while emphasizing that the burden of proving discrimination remained with the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b47-6\">During voir dire, Bradley indicated that he had extensive experience (twenty-six years) in the hotel industry. Bradley testified that, in his opinion, Red Roof has an excellent reputation in the industry, and a tremendous customer base. Bradley further indicated that he was familiar with the buyer\u2019s methods of evaluation. Later, when testifying before the jury, Bradley detailed his experience in the development, acquisition, and disposal of hotel properties. Bradley informed the jury of the techniques he uses in evaluating hotel properties, and indicated that Red Roof\u2019s buyer employs the same techniques. In addition, Bradley stated that he had recently worked for one of Red Roof\u2019s northeast competitors, and that that experience helped him to assess whether the buyer paid fair market value for Red Roof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b47-7\">After the trial judge indicated that the defendant would not be allowed to refer to the MCAD finding during its opening, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"AFr\">Defense Counsel: \u201cWell, Your Honor, I think the other issue, I guess, although it is not in front of the Court right now, it would certain- ly tend to be limiting and request that no charge on punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>damages in this case. I think in the \u2014 in an investigation by a state agency which found not only no cause, but found no probable cause would be another factor to indicate that the jury should consider no punitive damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">The Judge: \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem there. I don\u2019t know how I am going to rule on punitive yet, until the evidence unfolds, but I don\u2019t have a problem using that decision to help me make my judgment about a punitive damage instruction. I just do have a problem about putting it in front of the jury and I [am] going to ask \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">Defense Counsel: \u201cA final comment, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">The Judge: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">Defense Counsel: \u201cWould just be that I think that the arguments of plaintiffs counsel go more to the weight or consideration that this jury should give that decision as opposed to whether or not it is fundamentally admissible and the jury can consider it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-14\">The Judge: \u201cAll I am going to ask you is not mention it in the opening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-15\">Defense Counsel: \u201cThank you, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b49-6\">On appeal, Red Roof does not contend that the punitive damage award, as remitted, was excessive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The judge reasoned as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\u201cThis is not a case where the plaintiff, as a result of the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct, is physically or emotionally incapable of ever working again; nor is this a case where the plaintiff is approaching retirement age and will not likely be able to secure suitable employment before reaching retirement such that a front pay award through to retirement age might be appropriate. Here, both plaintiff and her therapist testified that upon the trial\u2019s conclusion, plaintiff would be able to pursue new employment opportunities with reasonable diligence. The jury\u2019s award of lifetime front pay is thus in direct conflict with the weight of the evidence adduced at trial as to plaintiff\u2019s ability to comply with her ongoing duty to .mitigate. Such an award fails to reasonably calculate plaintiff\u2019s lost future wages in light of uncontroverted evidence that plaintiff is capable and is likely to secure employment commensurate with her basic skills throughout her working life.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Deciding the case as we do, it is not necessary to address the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the trial judge erred in remitting the damages. Similarly, we need not reach the defendant\u2019s appeal from the trial court\u2019s postjudgment order allowing the plaintiff\u2019s motion to redact portions of the record. The documents redacted did not influence this court\u2019s decision. We note, however, that as part of the record below, the documents were properly included in the record appendix. See Mass.R.A.P. 8(a), as amended, 378 Mass. 932 (1979). The plaintiff\u2019s request for appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
