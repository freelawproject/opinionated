L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A(\u00bf&gt;), and Bums additionally of possession of a firearm and possession of ammunition, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7\u00a7 10(a) and <em>(h), </em>as in effect prior to St. 1996, c. 20.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both defendants appeal. The Commonwealth moves to dismiss Bums\u2019s appeal for failure to file timely the notice of appeal required by the Rules of Appellate Procedure. We allow the Commonwealth\u2019s motion. Middleton contends that the judge erroneously: (1) denied his motion to suppress evidence seized from his car pursuant to a search warrant; (2) allowed the Commonwealth to exercise impermissibly its peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors who were presumably Jewish; and (3) denied his motion to dismiss his indictments because of the Commonwealth\u2019s destruction of .potentially exculpatory evidence. We affirm the judgment as to Middleton.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">We summarize the facts that the jury could have found at trial: On the evening of July 9, 1992, the then fourteen year old victim, DeVaughn Woods, who lived on Hansborough Street in the Dorchester section of Boston, was shot while walking near the corner of Brookview Street and Blue Hill Avenue in Dorchester. Bums, armed with a silver handgun, shot the victim \u2014 hitting him once in the back \u2014 from the passenger-side window of a black Dodge Daytona automobile driven and owned by Middleton. The victim was rushed to a nearby hospital. Although he survived, he is paralyzed from the waist down.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">At trial, the defendants asserted that they were not the assailants. Woods, however, identified Middleton as the driver and Burns as the shooter in photographic arrays before trial and again in court during trial. Although a witness to the shooting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Jennifer Goodon, identified Bums as the shooter in court during trial, she did not definitively identify him in the pretrial photographic array.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">1. <em>Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal of defendant Burns. </em>The Superior Court jury found Bums guilty on October 22, 1993, and the judge sentenced him on November 18, 1993. On January 13, 1995, Bums filed a \u201cMotion to File Notice of Appeal Nunc Pro Tunc\u201d in the Superior Court. Supporting this motion, trial counsel submitted an affidavit stating that he had prepared a timely notice of appeal in November 1993, but upon \u201crecently checking] the defendant\u2019s file in the Clerk\u2019s Office [he] discovered that the Notice of Appeal had not been filed.\u201d Without comment, the trial court allowed the defendant\u2019s motion. The Commonwealth now moves to dismiss Bums\u2019s appeal as having been untimely filed contrary to Mass.R.A.P. 4(b) &amp; (c), as amended, 378 Mass. 929 (1979), &amp; 14(b), as amended, 378 Mass. 939 (1979). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Rule 4(b) provides that a notice of appeal \u201cshall be filed with the clerk of the lower court within thirty days after the verdict or finding of guilt or within thirty days after imposition of sentence.\u201d Additionally, rule 4(c) states that \u201c[u]pon a showing of excusable neglect, the lower court may extend the time for filing the notice of appeal by any party for a period not to exceed thirty days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by this rule.\u201d Finally, rule 14(b) provides that, \u201cfor good cause shown,\u201d an <em>appellate court or single justice </em>may extend the time set forth in rale 4(c); \u201cbut neither the appellate court nor a single justice may enlarge the time for filing a notice of appeal beyond one year . . . from the date of the verdict or finding of guilt or the date of imposition of sentence, whichever date is later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Thus, when read together, these rules provide that, although a lower court may enlarge the time for filing a notice of appeal up to sixty days after the verdict, finding of guilt, or imposition of sentence, only an appellate court may extend the time beyond sixty days, and even it cannot extend the time beyond one year from the verdict, finding of guilt, or imposition of sentence. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>392 Mass. 420, 421-422 (1984). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowie, </em>404 Mass. 119, 120, 122 &amp; n.8 (1989). See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass.R.A.R 4, Mass. Ann. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Laws, Rules of Appellate Procedure, at 40-41 (Law Co-op. 1990). See also Mass.R.A.P. 2, 365 Mass. 845 (1974) (permitting flexibility in requirements of appellate rules \u201cexcept as otherwise provided in Rule 14[b]\u201d); Mass.R.A.P. 3(a), as amended, 378 Mass. 927 (1979) (\u201c[fjailure of an appellant to take any step <em>other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal </em>shall not affect the validity of the appeal\u201d [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Here, the defense filed its \u201cMotion to File a Notice of Appeal Nunc Pro Tunc\u201d in the Superior Court fourteen months after the imposition of the defendant\u2019s sentence. Such a motion is unrecognized by the relevant procedural rules or our case law. Even if we were to treat it as a motion to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal, it exceeds the authority of the trial court under rule 4(c). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowie, supra </em>at 120. And even if it had been properly filed with this court, it still would have exceeded the outer limits of our authority under rule 14(b). <em>Cowie, supra </em>at 122 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Contrary to Burns\u2019s argument, <em>Samuels </em>v. <em>Sufa Corp., </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 922 (1995), does not help him here. The outcome in <em>Samuels </em>turned on facts in its record which supported the attorney\u2019s assertion that he timely filed a notice of appeal and that he had done all that was required to be done \u201cwithin the period of time dictated by the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 923. Similar facts do not exist here. Moreover, unlike counsel in <em>Samuels, </em>counsel here bore an added duty imposed by Superior Court Rule 65, as amended (1990), in criminal cases, which provides that after defendant is advised of his right to appeal, \u201cdefendant\u2019s counsel shall be responsible for perfecting and prosecuting the appeal unless such counsel is [allowed to withdraw].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Nor do we read <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>425 Mass. 182 (1997), to change the result here. Although every defendant has \u201ca clear statutory right to an appeal . . . [and] a clear constitutional right to the assistance of counsel in that appeal,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 184, <em>Frank </em>dealt with ineffective assistance of counsel <em>after </em>the timely filing of a notice of appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 183. Where, as here, the difficulty is the failure to file a timely notice of appeal, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowie, </em>404 Mass. 119, controls, and nothing in <em>Frank </em>suggests otherwise. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, supra </em>at 185, citing with approval <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowie, supra </em>at 122-123. Accordingly, the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal of Bums is allowed. We turn to the issues raised by Middleton.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>2. <em>Sufficiency of affidavit supporting search warrant. </em>On July 13, 1992, four days after the shooting, Boston Police Detective John Martel applied for a warrant to search Middleton\u2019s 1985 black Dodge Daytona. Supporting the application, Detective Martel submitted an affidavit stating the factual basis for his belief that there was probable cause to search the car for evidence related to the shooting. The affidavit contained eight numbered paragraphs. Three of the paragraphs, containing facts supplied by the victim, described the shooting, the victim\u2019s statement at the scene that he had been shot by \u201cRicky\u201d who lived on Callender Street, a confrontation between the victim and Middleton several days before the shooting, and the victim\u2019s identification of Middleton and Bums in photographic arrays as the driver of the black car and the shooter, respectively. One paragraph set forth facts provided by unnamed witnesses at the scene of the shooting stating that \u201cRicky Middleton\u201d was the driver of the black Dodge Daytona from which the victim was shot. Another paragraph detailed an anonymous phone call to police stating that the caller had overheard a conversation between \u201cRicky\u201d and Mario Bums bragging about having shot \u201ca Hansborough dude on Blue Hill Avenue.\u201d The three remaining paragraphs discussed Middleton\u2019s alleged involvement in another shooting several weeks earlier and why the detective thought the information in the affidavit supported the issuing of a warrant to search the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Because the sources of some of the information in the affidavit were several untested confidential informants, Middleton, relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 374-376 (1985), now argues that the affidavit did not establish probable cause to search his car. We are not persuaded by this argument. Regardless of the veracity of the unnamed witnesses and the anonymous caller, which, the defendant asserts, failed to satisfy the familiar two-pronged test set forth in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964), and <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969), the information supplied by the victim and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom provided probable cause to search the car. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagranksi, </em>408 Mass. 278, 280 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">3. <em>Destruction of evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">a. <em>Fingerprints. </em>Middleton contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s destruction of three latent fingerprints taken from his car deprived him of his right to a fair trial because it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201cpotentially exculpatory\u201d evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Determining whether the Commonwealth\u2019s destruction of evidence requires dismissal of the indictment or a new trial requires a defendant to establish \u201ca \u2018reasonable possibility, based on concrete evidence rather than a fertile imagination,\u2019 that access to the [evidence] would have produced evidence favorable to his cause.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>401 Mass. 749, 754 (1988), <em>S.C., </em>416 Mass. 707 (1993), cert, denied, 513 U.S. 835 (1994), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neal, </em>392 Mass. 1, 12 (1984). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maimoni, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 321, 330 (1996). Here, the defendant has made no such showing. Beyond suggesting that there is something fishy about the Commonwealth\u2019s explanation of why it destroyed the fingerprints, the defendant points to no \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d showing that access to the fingerprints would have excluded him as the driver or suggested the presence of another. Accordingly, we conclude the judge correctly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on this ground. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>420 Mass. 622, 628-629 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">b. <em>Investigator\u2019s notes. </em>The defendant also urges that the Commonwealth improperly destroyed original investigatory notes, thus violating a discovery order of another Superior Court judge. In substance, the discovery order, which was delivered orally from the bench and restated several times in slightly different variations, required the Commonwealth to provide the defendant \u201cany material and relevant evidence\u201d including \u201cdocuments, statements of person or reports of physical or mental examinations of any person, or of scientific tests or experiments that are within the possession, custody or control of the district attorney\u2019s office or [the] police department.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Responding to the court\u2019s order, the principal detective in the case prepared a summary, which was given to the defendant, containing his notes originally written on various \u201clined sheets, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>. . . napkins, [and] . . . any piece of scrap paper [the detective] had in his pocket.\u201d Apparently concluding that the summary of the notes supplied to the defendant by the Commonwealth satisfied the earlier discovery order, the trial judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on this ground. The defendant\u2019s arguments that the trial judge erred and that the Commonwealth acted in bad faith are unpersuasive. On the record before us, and absent meaningful argument to the contrary, we conclude that the Commonwealth complied with the discovery order.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">4. <em>Peremptory challenges. </em>After the judge conducted the general voir dire of the venire, fifteen venirepersons were seated in the jury box. The Commonwealth then exercised four peremptory challenges, removing potential jurors with the surnames Kronenberg, Alford, Downing, and King. These persons were replaced in the jury box and defendant Burns then exercised four peremptory challenges. Again, the seats were filled and the Commonwealth exercised another peremptory challenge to a potential juror with the surname Abraham.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Counsel for Burns immediately requested that the Commonwealth be required to give its reason for the challenge. Supporting his request, counsel asserted that this was the second potential juror \u201cwith a Jewish surname\u201d \u2014 Kronenberg being the first \u2014 to be challenged by the Commonwealth, and it was his experience \u201cover the years\u201d that \u201cwhen someone does have a Jewish surname . . . they are being challenged.\u201d Attempting to clarify the objection as it related to this case, the judge framed it as one concerning the religious affiliation of the two jurors, and treated the objection as an attempt to invoke the principles set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, cert, denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979). Concluding that <em>Soares </em>had not been properly invoked on the record before her, the judge did not require the Commonwealth to state reasons for the challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Defendant Middleton did not object or join in Burns\u2019s objection. He now, however, argues that the Commonwealth impermissibly exercised two peremptory challenges to exclude jurors Kronenberg and Abraham because of their religious affiliation or national origin. <em>Soares </em>prohibits national origin or creed as a basis for juror exclusion. <em>Ill </em>Mass, at 489. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Somerstein, </em>959 F. Supp. 592, 595 (E.D.N.Y 1997). However, because Middleton did not object to the Commonwealth\u2019s exercise of its peremptory challenges at trial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>issue is not properly before us. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>418 Mass. 769, 770 (1994) (defendant objected); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carleton, </em>418 Mass. 773, 774 (1994) (same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 564, 566 (1991) (same). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>12 F.3d 1427, 1431 (7th Cir. 1994); Gertner &amp; Mizner, The Law of Juries 4-55 (1997). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, supra </em>at 492 n.37 (nonobjecting codefendant granted new trial pursuant to court\u2019s <em>power </em>under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E). Nor is this a case where the judge properly raised the issue sua sponte, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtiss, </em>424 Mass. 78, 80 (1997), or in which Burns\u2019s objection at trial suffices to preserve the issue for Middleton because a separate objection would have been futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Were we to reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s argument, we would conclude that, on the record before us, he has not satisfied his initial burden of showing impropriety. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>418 Mass, at 771. That is to say, the defendant asserts a conclusion, but he does not make the showing needed to establish the applicability of the factors set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, supra </em>at 490, or the fact-specific holding of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carleton, supra </em>at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal of defendant Bums is allowed, and the Superior Court judgment as to defendant Middleton is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-11\">The defendants were acquitted of armed assault with intent to murder, G.L. c. 265 \u00a7 18(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Goodon chose two photographs from the array as depicting the shooter.

See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). Usually, such an omission would prevent our review. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bernier, supra. </em>However, because the transcript of the hearing containing the discovery order has been provided by the Commonwealth, we address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
