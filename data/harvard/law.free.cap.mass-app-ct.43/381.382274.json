App. Ct. 473, 476 (1993). The judge declined to do so. In the circumstances, this was error, and we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">It is not necessary to give a <em>Pressley </em>charge every time a witness makes an identification. \u201cThere may be cases in which the parties are so well known to each other or so closely related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>that under sufficient lighting and with appropriate physical proximity, the identification by the victim is either true or the victim is lying.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pressley, supra </em>at 619. We proceed, therefore, to consider <em>first, </em>whether there was an identification at all in this case \u2014 the trial judge at the charge conference seemed to think not \u2014 and <em>second, </em>whether the evidence admitted of the possibility of an honest mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In summary, the evidence was as follows. Hector Esparra, standing on his porch, noticed a bicycle that made him think there was \u201ca kid out there playing around in the building.\u201d He investigated. What he saw was a man trying to work his way into a basement apartment with a screwdriver. Esparra did not see the man\u2019s face but noted that he was wearing a black and red hooded sweater. Esparra telephoned the police. Officer Greg Judge of the Holyoke police arrived within minutes. Esparra pointed to the basement apartment area. The police officer followed that direction and spotted four pry marks and wood slivers at the apartment door. Nearby he found the defendant crouched in a comer of the well leading to the basement apartment. A pat-frisk produced three screwdrivers tucked in the front of the defendant\u2019s pants. The defendant explained that he had sought the refuge of the comer to smoke a marihuana joint, which he swallowed when he saw the police. The police found no evidence to support Rosado\u2019s story. As for the screwdrivers, the defendant said he had been repairing his sister\u2019s stereo.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">1. <em>Did Esparra make an identification of the </em>defendant? After apprehending the defendant, Officer Judge brought him up from the well and placed him in his cruiser. At trial the officer was allowed to testify that he had gone to Esparra and asked him whether the defendant was the individual Esparra had seen and reported and that Esparra indicated \u201cyes.\u201d That hearsay was received under the exception applicable to identification statements made close in time to the criminal event. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>390 Mass. 62, 71 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 685, 690 (1991). It will be recalled that Esparra saw the defendant only from the back but the hearsay exception for identification applies as well to identification made on the basis of clothing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, supra </em>at 690. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 618, 620-623 (1997). The judge was cognizant of the evidentiary issue, because when defense counsel objected to the police officer\u2019s testifying to what Esparra <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>said, the judge ruled: \u201cI think he\u2019s being asked for identification, that\u2019s an exception to the hearsay rule. If that\u2019s what the answer is, I will permit it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">When Esparra was on direct examination at trial, he was asked: \u201cYou indicated to them the man the police had was wearing the same clothes as the individual you saw fooling with the door of [the basement] apartment?\u201d Esparra answered, \u201cRight.\u201d To tins degree, identification of the defendant by Esparra was part of the evidence in the case, even though Esparra made no direct identification at trial. In declining to include a <em>Pressley </em>charge, the trial judge, somewhat contrary to the view he had taken when he allowed the police officer to testify about what Esparra had said or indicated, said: \u201cThe eyewitness didn\u2019t indentify him, the eyewitness said really he had seen a colored jacket on, well he was the guy. Furthermore, in your closing argument [defense counsel\u2019s] you didn\u2019t suggest that he wasn\u2019t there.\u201d There was no question that the defendant was \u201cthere.\u201d The question was whether he was the same man Esparra had seen, a proposition that was highly likely, but not inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">2. <em>Did the identification admit of the possibility of an honest mistake by </em>Esparra? In view of the quick response of the police, it is a bit puzzling why Esparra testified to a time interval of fifteen minutes before the police arrived. That, however, was the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and Esparra ascribed the time lapse to his having to go elsewhere to make his telephone call. That time interval admits of the possibility that the defendant came into the well after somebody else had attempted a burglary and been frightened off. The arresting officer testified to the defendant having worn a dark jacket, a description consistent with but not the same as a black and red sweater. The defendant\u2019s explanation of what he was doing in the basement well was less than plausible, and his possession of screwdrivers was, in the circumstances, highly suggestive. The short duration of time between Esparra having noticed something going on and the apprehension of the defendant reduces the likelihood of the apparent burglar having slipped away and the defendant having slipped into the well. When \u201call is said and done,\u201d however, we are not able to say with assurance that the error could not have influenced the jury. <em>Kotteakos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764-765 (1946). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983). As defense counsel asked for a <em>Pressley </em>instruction, he was, in the circumstances, entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>have it. While there was sufficient evidence to warrant a finding of guilt without Esparra\u2019s identification, we cannot know whether Esparra\u2019s connection of the defendant with what he had earlier seen may have been a determinative factor when the jurors deliberated. Accordingly, we reverse the judgments and set the verdicts aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
