The board contends that the refunds, which represent a portion of the total amount of management fees that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the board paid to an investment management company, should be logged in its books as investment income to show a net positive return on the investment funds that the company handled for the board. The defendants, the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB) and the Public Employee Retirement Administration (PERA), contend otherwise. According to them, the refunded management fees are just that: uninvested money that was paid back to the board, dollar for dollar, by the investment management company for the board\u2019s overpayment of management fees. In other words, the board did not, according to CRAB and PERA, actually <em>make </em>money on that portion of its funds; it merely received a refund of its own uninvested principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The amount in this particular case is small: $27,000 in refunds received by the board in 1991 for management fees that it paid to the company in 1987, plus $11,000 in interest on those fees. But we are told that the stakes are actually much higher. Significantly greater refunds from that particular company, totaling well over $1,500,000, are also in the pipeline. In addition, some twenty other local retirement boards have had their investment funds managed by that company, and they, too, are due to receive, or have already received substantial refunds of management fees. CRAB and PERA further point out that the various retirement boards around the Commonwealth are rated by PERA according to their individual performances in investing their members\u2019 pension funds. Allowing the board to show as investment income or a return on investment fees that have been refunded to it, according to CRAB and PERA, would throw PERA\u2019s rating system into disarray by distorting the board\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">PERA\u2019s and CRAB\u2019s position in this controversy is memorialized in CRAB\u2019s administrative decision of March 21, 1994, which the board appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. In a memorandum of decision, a Superior Court judge reasoned that the refunded management fees \u201ccan be characterized as a penalty, or a make good [by the investment management company]\u201d; but that, however characterized, the refunds were the result of the board\u2019s initial decision to invest with the company and should, therefore, show up as a return on that investment. The judge reversed CRAB\u2019s decision and entered judgment in the board\u2019s favor that the total amount of the refund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>was, in fact, a return on the board\u2019s investment with the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">We affirm CRAB\u2019s decision and, in so doing, reverse the judgment of the Superior Court. Refusal to allow the board to include refunded administrative fees and interest thereon as a return or yield on the board\u2019s investments was not arbitrary or capricious within the meaning of the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and was consistent with PERA\u2019s over-all statutory responsibility to prescribe reasonable and uniform benchmarks for measuring individual retirement boards\u2019 returns on their invested pension funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\"><em>Factual background. </em>Beginning in about 1986, the board retained Aetna Life Insurance Company (Aetna) to manage a significant portion of the board\u2019s pension funds. The board paid Aetna management fees representing a percentage of the total amount of pension funds that Aetna was going to handle. The management fees were paid out of the board\u2019s investment income account. Aetna, in turn, redirected portions of the management fees in the form of commissions to one Carmen Elio and various investment companies controlled by Elio. When the matter of such \u201csplit\u201d commissions and Elio\u2019s investment activities in general came under the scrutiny of the Attorney General and the United States Attorney, Aetna, although it admitted no wrongdoing, agreed in September, 1991, to refund to the board (and to other retirement boards) a portion of its management fees as \u201can accommodation\u201d and \u201cto avoid even the appearance of impropriety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Aetna\u2019s first refund to the board in 1991 was for $38,000 ($27,000 for management fees paid for 1987, plus $11,000 interest, more or less, on those fees). That payment was followed in 1992 by another payment to the board of $1,117,000, and in 1993, by a third payment of $586,276. Like the first payment, the 1992 and 1993 payments included a substantial amount in interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">In February, 1992, acting pursuant to its authority under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 21(1)(\u00ab), as appearing in St. 1982, c. 630, \u00a7 25, to \u201cprescribe and supervise methods of accounting and record-keeping\u201d for the Commonwealth\u2019s public retirement systems, PERA issued a memorandum to all local retirement systems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>that had received refunds from Aetna, including the board, instructing them that the refunds were to be regarded as a miscellaneous cash receipt and should be logged according to PERA\u2019s accounting manual as, \u201cInvestment income received, reimbursement of management fees.\u201d PERA\u2019s memorandum further instructed that, while the refunded money could be restored to the board\u2019s investment income account from which it had originally been paid, the money should <em>not </em>be counted in the board\u2019s books or in its annual report to investors as a return on invested pension funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The board asked PERA to reconsider its decision to exclude the refunds from the calculation of its return on investment. PERA declined, but it did tell the board that the 1991 PERA investment report would include a special notation that the investment return records did <em>not </em>include Aetna\u2019s refunds of management fees. Pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(4), the board sought review by CRAB of PERA\u2019s decision. CRAB assigned the matter to an administrative magistrate from the Division of Administrative Law Appeals (DALA) who, after a hearing, ruled in favor of the board. Specifically, the magistrate found that PERA\u2019s decision was arbitrary and inconsistent with its prior and subsequent interpretation of its own rules and regulations. The magistrate also found that PERA\u2019s instructions to the board on how it should account for the refunds amounted to an exercise of discretionary authority by PERA respecting the management and control of pension funds, thus making PERA a fiduciary of the board and potentially liable to it for any investment losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In its final administrative decision on the matter, CRAB reversed several of the magistrate\u2019s rulings, including the one that PERA had acted as' a fiduciary. More important, CRAB affirmed PERA\u2019s original ruling that the refunded management fees that the board received in 1991 were not the result of investment activity by the board in that year and, therefore, could not be treated as a return on investment. The Superior Court judge, in turn, vacated CRAB\u2019s decision as arbitrary and capricious and reinstated the magistrate\u2019s decision in favor of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>Under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), a reviewing court may set aside the agency\u2019s decision if the decision is unsupported by substantial evidence, or is arbitrary, capricious, or \u201cnot in accordance with law.\u201d See <em>Retire-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>merit Bd. of Somerville </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 673, 676-677 (1995). When reviewing an agency decision, a court \u201cmust give \u2018due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard Johnson Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 487, 492 (1987), quoting from G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). An agency such as PERA \u201chas considerable leeway in interpreting a statute it is charged with enforcing.\u201d <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>397 Mass. 386, 392 (1986) quoting from <em>Grocery Mfrs. of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 75 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">PERA is charged by statute with over-all responsibility to administer the public employee retirement system. For example, PERA is given authority under G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 50(a), as inserted by St. 1982, c. 630, \u00a7 2, to \u201cpromulgare] rules and regulations governing administrative procedures, financial operations, [and] records and reports of the\" retirement boards . . . .\u2019\u2019As part of its over-all statutory duty to establish benchmarks for measuring individual retirement boards\u2019 return on their investments, PERA produces an annual report in which individual boards are ranked against each other. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 21(6)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">An agency such as PERA may ordinarily elect to carry out its statutorily delegated duties either by promulgating rules and regulations, or it may proceed, as in this case, through individualized determinations. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>383 Mass. 675, 679-680 (1981). PERA\u2019s exercise of its oversight and administrative responsibilities is not confined by statute to rule making. See G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 50; G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 21(4) (PERA must promulgate rules and regulations only when it deems necessary).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">PERA has formulated no precise rule or regulation to deal with this unusual situation. Nor has PERA previously adjudicated the question here presented. Apparently, PERA\u2019s accounting manual contains no specific method as to how these refunds should be accounted for. When it instructed the board on how to proceed, PERA improvised the designation \u201creimbursement of management fees,\u201d and also agreed to add a special notation to its 1991 report concerning the refunds by Aetna. In effect, the board accuses PERA of making it up as it went along \u2014 and of issuing rulings contradictory to or inconsistent with PERA\u2019s own prior practices. The board points out, for instance, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>PERA considers the receipt by an individual retirement board of legislatively appropriated money pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 22(8), in the form df an incentive or bonus for that board\u2019s decision to invest its pension funds in the State-created Pension Reserve Investment Trust (PRIT), to be a return on that board\u2019s investment in PRIT. A PRIT bonus, according to PERA, is the direct result of a board\u2019s investment decision and, so, is properly countable as investment income.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The board also points to a letter it received in 1992 from PERA\u2019s commissioner which states that the interest paid to the board pursuant to G. L. c. 35, \u00a7 24, by one of the board\u2019s late-paying governmental unit members could be placed in the board\u2019s investment income account. The commissioner\u2019s rationale was that the interest, which he characterized as a \u201cpenalty,\u201d was intended \u201cto compensate the [board] for lost investment income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">These two examples, the board implies, point toward agency precedent that <em>any </em>income or cash payment an individual board receives as the result of an investment decision is countable as a return or yield on investment. In the eyes of the board, PERA\u2019s and CRAB\u2019s current position amounts to an unexplained departure from PERA\u2019s precedent for which there is due a more convincing statement of reasons explaining why the board\u2019s situation has been treated differently. See generally 2 Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 11.5 (3d ed. 1994); Celia, Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7 422 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">As to PERA\u2019s 1992 response to the board\u2019s inquiry concerning allocation of interest received pursuant to G. L. c. 35, \u00a7 24, a single, two sentence letter from PERA\u2019s commissioner hardly constitutes the sort of formal agency decision making that a.dds up to agency precedent. Contrast <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>367 Mass. 92, 103-104 &amp; n.5 (1975), where inconsistent orders entered on the same issue in numerous formal agency adjudications over a period of several years prompted the reviewing court to vacate the agency\u2019s decision and to remand the matter to the agency for a statement of reasons for its decision. More important, however, the commissioner\u2019s letter merely advises the board as to which account the \u201cpenalty\u201d should be credited. The letter says nothing about actually counting the penalty as a return on the board\u2019s investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">In addition, PERA\u2019s position on PRIT bonuses is not at odds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>with its position on the unanticipated refund of administrative fees that were never actually available for investment. A PRIT bonus, which follows directly on the heels of an investment decision, appears calculated as an incentive that yields an immediate return on a participating board\u2019s investment and, so, is properly counted as such. By contrast, money refunded to the board \u2014 while arguably the indirect result of its initial decision to invest with Aetna \u2014 was never invested and, therefore, could not show up now on the board\u2019s books as a return on investment. The money was simply paid out to Aetna by the board as a fee for service. Amounts paid out as overhead expenses including, as here, the purchase of professional services and amounts categorized as invested capital are well understood accounting distinctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">PERA is given authority under statute to tell individual retirement boards how to account for cash receipts, so as to achieve uniformity and comparability of investment results. Unless they are manifestly unreasonable, PERA\u2019s directives should be adhered to in order to put all of the State\u2019s public retirement boards on the same footing and to allow for ready comparisons of investment results. We will not second guess PERA\u2019s directives, even if they are susceptible of reasonable debate \u2014 particularly where the directive here in question is to be applied even-handedly to all boards affected by Aetna refunds.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">We turn, finally, to PERA\u2019s and CRAB\u2019s remaining claim on appeal: that when PERA instructed the board as it did, it did not act as a fiduciary to the board within the meaning of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree. PERA did not exercise discretionary authority over the board as to how the board should manage, invest, or dispose of its pension funds. PERA acted in a ministerial capacity pursuant to its statutory responsibility to establish uniform accounting and record keeping procedures. Stated another way, PERA simply instructed the board on how the refunds from Aetna should be treated for accounting purposes. The relationship between PERA and the board was not fiduciary in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed, and a new judgment is to be entered affirming the decision of the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b369-9\">While only the 1991 payment is before us, our decision will obviously affect the proper accounting of the 1992 and 1993 payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The relevant provision of G.
