The defendant first made his request prior to trial and repeatedly asked counsel about the status of the motion. Although counsel told the defendant that he would file the motion, he never did so. After the trial was over, or perhaps earlier, counsel informed the defendant that he had filed the motion but that it had been denied. Subsequent to an evidentiary hearing, the trial judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on the ground that counsel\u2019s failure to move for forensic testing of the knife was based on trial tactics. We remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In order to determine the validity of the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, \u201ca discerning examination and appraisal\u201d of the factual circumstances of the case is required. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 690 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The charges against the defendant grew out of a vicious melee on October 9, 1993, between the defendant and the alleged victims, Donald Hurld and James Richard, in front of a bar on West Broadway in the South Boston section of Boston. All three had been drinking; Hurld had also ingested cocaine. Each was injured during the fight by a sharp cutting instrument, Hurld very seriously.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The Commonwealth\u2019s account of the incident, presented primarily through the testimony of Richard and Hurld, was that after they and their friend Jeffrey Baird had left the bar at about 2 a.m., and while they were seeking to hail a taxi, a car driven by the defendant and containing a woman passenger came to the curb. Richard paid a compliment to the woman, and when she smiled in response, the defendant attacked Hurld. Hurld did not hear the compliment. When he saw the defendant screaming at the woman in a \u201cwild maniacal state,\u201d Hurld testified, he turned away to avoid an altercation. What he remembered next was leaning against the vehicle, believing his face to have been cut open, and \u201cfeeling the sea air inside [his] whole face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Baird saw Hurld, his face slashed and bleeding, banging the defendant against the car. Richard, hearing bodies crashing against the car, turned and saw Hurld and the defendant fighting. The defendant was flailing his hands. Seeing Hurld\u2019s face was bloody and that he was pointing to the defendant, Richard ran to the defendant and grabbed his right shoulder. He claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>that the defendant had a straight-edged razor with a four-to-six inch blade with which he cut Richard\u2019s head. Having had three years of Korean karate, Richard gave the defendant \u201ca turning side kick to the head\u201d knocking him to the ground. The defendant got up and, after more fighting, Richard threw the defendant into the street. From a distance, the defendant threatened Richard whereupon Richard reached into his pocket, unsheathed a knife and said, \u201cLet\u2019s party now.\u201d Richard never used the knife as the defendant ran away, frightened, with Richard in pursuit. Richard dropped behind and saw that the defendant had stopped approximately at the police station on Silver Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Richard returned to the scene of the struggle, heard that Hurld \u201cwasn\u2019t going to make it,\u201d and \u201clost control.\u201d As \u201cI couldn\u2019t catch [the defendant] I took it out on his motor vehicle. ... I gave the passenger side window a side kick that made the window explode. ... I took my knife back out of my pocket and I punctured all four tires.\u201d By this time the police had arrived and, seeing Richard, ordered him to drop the knife. When he refused, one officer cracked Richard\u2019s wrist with a bat or flashlight, and only then did he let go of the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The defendant\u2019s version of the events differed sharply. The defendant\u2019s passenger, Elizabeth Schallmo,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> testified that while she was still in the car, two men were standing nearby on the sidewalk. \u201cOne of the men said, look at the tits on her. And the other man asked me if I was ever fucked by a real man.\u201d Because the men were leaning against the car, Schallmo asked the defendant to walk her to her door. He asked the men to move, they asked him what he was going to do about it, and then they threw him against the hood of his car. Shouting for help, he punched back, and the three men ended on the ground fighting. Schallmo screamed; she saw the defendant running toward her chased by Richard holding a knife and yelling that he was going to kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The defendant\u2019s testimony supplemented Schallmo\u2019s. The two alleged victims, high on drugs, wouldn\u2019t let him open the car door and shoved him against the car and punched him. After he started punching back, he saw that Richard had a buck knife which he tried to grab. While Richard and he were wrestling for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>the knife, Hurld was punching the defendant. In the course of the defendant\u2019s pulling at Richard\u2019s wrist, the knife came down across Hurld\u2019s face. The defendant also testified that after he broke free, when he saw Richard coming at him again, he ran to the police station. When he stopped and turned, he saw Richard wiping the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Only one weapon was recovered \u2014 Richard\u2019s knife. Based on the defendant\u2019s statement and Richard\u2019s irrational behavior at the scene, including his refusal to drop the knife, the police placed Richard under arrest. After further investigation, Richard was released, and the defendant was indicted on the charges set forth in note 1, <em>supra. </em>He was found not guilty on the mayhem charge, the charges of armed assault with intent to murder, and the assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon against Richard, but was found guilty of the charge of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon upon Hurld.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">After his conviction, the defendant moved for a new trial on the ground that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Accompanying the motion were two affidavits, one of the defendant and one of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Counsel\u2019s affidavit was to the following effect. Counsel had had discussions with the defendant prior to trial and had been asked by him to file a motion for forensic testing of the knife that was recovered from Richard. Although counsel told the defendant that he would file such a motion, he did not do so. The defendant considered the testing important because if his blood or the blood of Richard or Hurld were found on the knife, it would lend credibility to the defendant\u2019s testimony that it was the only knife present during the incident and that this knife was the one that had caused the injuries to the three men.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commonwealth\u2019s theory at trial, as stated in counsel\u2019s affidavit, was that the defendant had another knife in his possession that caused the alleged victims\u2019 injuries, but such a knife was not located. The Commonwealth never had Richard\u2019s knife tested, and it was the only weapon introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The trial judge granted a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The defendant\u2019s trial attorney testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>saw the defendant numerous times prior to trial and that the issue of the filing of a motion for testing of the knife was discussed more than once. The defendant had made it clear to counsel that he wanted the motion filed. Although initially counsel had tried to talk the defendant out of it, counsel indicated \u201cat least once\u201d that he would file the motion. He acknowledged that \u201cit would have been very significant\u201d if there were blood on the knife and he believed he had told the defendant (although it is not clear when this occurred, and it may have been after trial) that the motion had been filed and denied. Pressed on cross-examination by the Commonwealth at the motion hearing, counsel stated that his \u201copinion not to have the knife tested was based on tactics of trial\u201d but on redirect examination explained that that was not the reason for not filing the motion. When asked whether he had decided not to file the motion because \u201cthat\u2019s the way you felt the case should be handled even though the client told you that he wanted the motion filed,\u201d he answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">A. \u201cNo. I answered [the prosecutor\u2019s] question that in my opinion it was better not to test the knife for tactical reasons. Mr. Conley felt otherwise. And I didn\u2019t file the motion not because I was overriding Mr. Conley\u2019s instructions to me, but because I got bogged down in other aspects of the trial. So I just didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">Q. \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re basically testifying that you kind of forgot?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">A. \u201cIt was not uppermost in my mind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The judge then asked a number of questions, as set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> seeking to determine whether the failure to file the motion was a strategic decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The defendant testified that after reading the victims\u2019 account of the events in the grand jury transcripts, he discussed with counsel \u201cthe fact that there was only one weapon \u2014 the victim, Jamey Richardson\u2019s knife.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">\u201cAnd I said if Jamey Richardson says he didn\u2019t cut anyone with that knife then my blood and Hurld\u2019s blood shouldn\u2019t be on that knife. And he said correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">\u201cI said, well, you know, let\u2019s have the knife tested. I\u2019m sure, I\u2019m positive that our blood would be on that knife somewhere. He said, well, I want you to think. He said if the blood isn\u2019t on the knife then, like, there might be some problem with your story. I said I don\u2019t have anything to think about. I said I want you to file a motion to have that knife tested immediately.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">Q. \u201cAnd what did he tell you in response to that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">A. \u201cHe said, are you sure? I said, I\u2019m positive. I want you to do it immediately.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>The judge\u2019s memorandum denying the motion stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">\u201c[Djefendant\u2019s trial counsel . . . testified that his reason for not moving for forensic testing of the knife was based on strategic considerations. In his opinion, forensic testing was not crucial to the defendant\u2019s case, and he believed that it was better trial strategy not to have the knife tested. The defendant argued that he requested his attorney to file such a motion prior to trial; and at one point, his attorney assured him he would do so. Ultimately, however, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel decided that the better strategy was to exploit the police failure to conduct forensic testing as a basis for showing that the investigation was ineptly conducted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">\u201cThe court, therefore, finds that the failure to move for forensic testing was based on trial tactics, and not attorney ineptitude.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">In the conduct of a defendant\u2019s trial, certain decisions sometimes called \u201cpersonal\u201d or \u201cfundamental\u201d ones, <em>Jones </em>v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 751 (1983), are for the defendant alone, e.g., whether to plead guilty, to waive the right to trial by jury, to testify in one\u2019s behalf, to take an appeal, or to waive the right to counsel. Others, often called strategic or tactical matters, rest ultimately in counsel, with the degree of required client consultation and participation dependant on the circumstances. See generally 2 LaFave, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 11.6 (1984); 1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice \u00a7 4-5.2 and commentary (2d ed. 1980). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 645 n.19, 652 n.24 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">That the decision not to file the motion for a forensic examination of the knife could be characterized as a trial tactic does not, for that reason, render the decision immune from scrutiny. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>374 Mass. 722, 729 (1978). The defendant may prevail if he shows that counsel\u2019s performance fell \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer\u201d and has also \u201clikely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass, at 96. Where tactical or strategic decisions of counsel are at issue, the review is conducted \u201cwith some deference to avoid characterizing as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>unreasonable a defense that was merely unsuccessful.\u201d Rather than merely unreasonable, the \u201cchallenged tactical judgments must be \u2018manifestly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>409 Mass. 266,.272-273 (1991), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>374 Mass, at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The decision challenged here is the decision not to investigate the knife despite the strong request of the defendant. The Supreme Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 690-691, bears directly on this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">\u201cRepresentation of a criminal defendant entails certain basic duties. Counsel\u2019s function is to assist the defendant. . . . From counsel\u2019s function as assistant to the defendant derive the overarching duty to advocate the defendant\u2019s case and the more particular duties to consult with the defendant on important decisions and to keep the defendant informed of important developments in the course of the prosecution. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">\u201c[Strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation. In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">\u201cThe reasonableness of counsel\u2019s actions may be determined or substantially influenced by the defendant\u2019s own statements or actions. Counsel\u2019s actions are usually based, quite properly, on informed strategic choices made by the defendant and on information supplied by the defendant. <em>In particular, what investigation decisions are reasonable depends critically on such information </em>. ... [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] <em>In short, inquiry into counsel\u2019s conversations with the defendant </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>may be critical to a proper assessment of counsel\u2019s investigation decisions </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Thus, \u201c[a] claim of failure to interview a witness may sound impressive in the abstract, but it cannot establish ineffective assistance when the person\u2019s account is otherwise fairly known to defense counsel.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Decoster, </em>624 E2d 196, 209 (D.C. Cir.), <em>S.C., </em>598 F.2d 311, cert, denied, 444 U.S. 944 (1979). This reasoning was the basis of the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>409 Mass, at 274, which held that a tactical decision not to interview and call two witnesses was not unreasonable. Since \u201c[c]ommon sense dictates that a defendant\u2019s description of events underlying a criminal charge should be considered reliable . . .,\u201d counsel could reasonably conclude, based on the defendant\u2019s description of events and conversations, that \u201ccalling the witnesses would expose the general inconsistency in the defendant\u2019s position and highlight the general consistency in the complainant\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Where the facts are not known to the attorney, and the information is critical to the client\u2019s defense, counsel may not decline to investigate because he fears the facts may become available to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haggerty, </em>400 Mass. 437, 441 (1987) (counsel ineffective in not hiring an expert to determine if defendant\u2019s actions were the cause of the victim\u2019s death).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">All the more so when the client \u201cinsist[s] that the tests would help establish his innocence.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>114 F.3d 1002, 1011 (9th Cir. 1997). Jones, a habeas corpus petitioner, was convicted of murdering his wife. One of his claims was that if tests were conducted on the clothes he was wearing on the night of the murder, they would show that the blood on his clothing came from the cut on his hand rather than from his wife\u2019s wounds. Despite his requests, his trial lawyer never made any attempt to test the blood on his jeans. The State argued that by not having the physical evidence tested, Jones\u2019s trial counsel \u201cwas able to emphasize before the jury the State\u2019s failure to test the physical evidence, the unfairness of the police investigation, and the existence of reasonable doubt as to whether Jones <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>was the perpetrator.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Noting that this was probably not counsel\u2019s strategy, since he repeatedly indicated his intention to test the evidence, the court held, \u201cEven if failing to test the physical evidence was part of his lawyer\u2019s trial strategy, under the circumstances of this case, where Jones insisted the tests would help establish his innocence, see <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691 (reasonableness of trial strategy must be measured against \u2018counsel\u2019s conversations with the defendant\u2019), we believe it would not be sound and would clearly fall below the <em>Strickland </em>level.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court pointed out that if Jones was correct that the blood on the jeans was his and not his wife\u2019s, \u201cthat would seriously undermine the prosecution\u2019s case, since a crucial State theory is that the murderer would necessarily have been covered in [Jones\u2019s wife\u2019s] blood and could not have exited the house without leaving blood traces.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baynes, </em>687 F.2d 659, 668 (3d Cir. 1982), the court held counsel was ineffective in failing to listen to a voice exemplar the government had obtained from the defendant and to compare it with the government\u2019s intercepted telephone conversation. Counsel explained he was fearful of using the exemplar because he did not want the jury to hear the defendant read the same incriminating words he allegedly spoke on the telephone. He also had a number of additional tactical reasons. The court noted that while the decision whether to utilize a particular item of evidence may be a matter within the reasonable bounds of trial counsel\u2019s discretion, such discretion does not extend to the failure to investigate a critical source of potentially exculpatory evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 666. Had counsel established that it was not the defendant on the intercepted tape, he would probably have been acquitted. \u201cEven were this fact, standing alone, not sufficient to compel the average competent attorney in this jurisdiction to conduct a thorough aural comparison of the voice exemplar with the intercepted recording, we have no doubt that <em>such a duty arose after [the defendant] repeatedly asserted . . . that his was not the voice on the intercepted </em>conversation\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>at 668. Contrast <em>Government of the V.I. </em>v. <em>Weatherwax, </em>77 F.3d 1425 (3d Cir.), cert, denied, 519 U.S. 1020 (1996), where the tactical decision did not involve the defendant\u2019s superior knowledge as to the facts. The tactical decision at stake in that case and upheld by the court was not to inform the judge that a juror had taken a newspaper article containing an unfavorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>article about the defendant into the jury room. The lawyer decided not to do so despite the defendant\u2019s wishes on the ground that he thought the present jury were the most favorable one the defendant could have.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In the case at bar, the defendant testified that he told counsel that he was \u201cpositive\u201d that his blood and that of the alleged victims \u201cwould be on the knife.\u201d That he was insistent that the blood be tested was corroborated by his attorney. There is nothing in the record to suggest that counsel had any reason to believe his client was untruthful.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As to the factual basis of his assertion, there is no doubt that the defendant had superior knowledge. If, as he asserted, his blood and that of Hurld was on the knife, the credibility of the alleged victims would have been seriously weakened, if not destroyed. The government\u2019s case depended almost entirely on their testimony, thus heightening the importance of the investigation. See <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 696; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Decoster, </em>624 F.2d at 210; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>114 F.3d at 1011 (claims based on a duty to investigate must be considered in light of the strength of the government\u2019s case).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">We conclude that in these circumstances, looking at counsel\u2019s action with the required highly deferential scrutiny, see <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, 466 </em>U.S. at 689, counsel\u2019s failure to file the motion for forensic investigation of the knife was \u201cmanifestly unreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Whether the second prong of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>has been satisfied \u2014 that counsel\u2019s failure has \u201clikely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence\u201d, 366 Mass, at 96 \u2014 cannot be determined on the record before us. As in <em>Jones, </em>114 F.3d at 1012, \u201c[a]t this stage in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the proceedings, there is no requirement that [the defendant] provide evidence corroborating his allegations of what the test results will show.\u201d On remand in <em>Jones, </em>the evidence was to be made available to the defendant to develop fully his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. \u201cIn particular, the test results may establish the prejudice required to make out such a claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1009 &amp; n.2. See also <em>Toney </em>v. <em>Gammon, </em>79 F.3d 693, 700 (8th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Accordingly, following the procedure of <em>Jones, </em>we remand the matter to the Superior Court to make the knife available for testing by the defendant and thereafter to conduct an evidentiary hearing to enable him to present his claim of prejudice. In the unlikely event that the judge determines that testing for blood is no longer feasible, by reason of the passage of time or otherwise through no fault of the defendant, a new trial is to be granted and the defendant permitted to describe to the jury the circumstances of his requests for testing and to have the jury instructed that despite his requests, such testing did not occur. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>416 Mass. 707, 716-717 (1993), cert, denied, 513 U.S. 835 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The remaining contentions of the defendant are without merit. At trial the defendant asked for jury instructions on accident and on the failure of the Commonwealth to perform tests on Richard\u2019s knife. Although the judge did not give the instructions, counsel did not object and, subsequent to the judge\u2019s charge, indicated that he was content with the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">There was no error, let alone a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. In defining the offense of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, the only indictment on which the defendant was found guilty, the judge stated that the Commonwealth had to prove that the \u201ctouching was intentional in the sense it was not accidental\u201d and, in summing up the requirements of the offense, repeated that the Commonwealth had to prove \u201cthat the touching was intentional in the sense that it did not happen accidentally.\u201d These instructions \u201cgave the defendant the benefit in substance of the hypothesis of accident.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hakala, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 921, 923 (1986). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>391 Mass. 97, 1 OS-112, cert, denied, 469 U.S. 840 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>30 Mass.

He was acquitted on four of the five charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Schallmo was the defendant\u2019s former girlfriend and the mother of his two children. There was testimony at trial that both Schallmo and the defendant had different partners at the time of the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Richard, it will be remembered, had claimed that he only took out the knife after the struggle, and that the defendant had run away upon seeing it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Judge: \u201cHaving in mind I was the trial judge, [counsel], you did try this case cross-examining the police in what. they failed to do in performing tests on the knife; did you not?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">A: \u201cThat is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">Judge: \u201cYou emphasized the failure of the police to conduct tests; isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">A: \u201cI believe I did, Judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Judge: \u201cYou even filed a motion in the court under [Mass.R.Crim.P. 24, 378 Mass. 895 (1979)] asking that this court instruct the jury on the failure of the Commonwealth to conduct tests on the knife; is that right?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">A: \u201cThat would be <em>Bowden.

He did not find out until much later when he obtained the docket that the motion had not been filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\">The material omitted by the ellipsis is as follows: \u201cFor example, when the facts that support a certain potential line of defense are generally known to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>counsel because of what the defendant has said, the need for further investigation may be considerably diminished or eliminated altogether. And when a defendant has given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless or even harmful, counsel\u2019s failure to pursue those investigations may not later be challenged as unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The <em>Weatherwax </em>opinion, 77 F.3d at 1433-1438, contains a useful discussion of the considerations underlying the constitutional requirement that counsel consult with his or her client.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Counsel is usually protected against a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by a good faith reliance on the client\u2019s account of the facts.
