L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> applies to a tort action against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>psychiatrist brought by a job applicant who was required by the prospective employer to undergo psychological testing, was erroneously diagnosed as psychologically unfit by the psychiatrist, and was consequently passed over for the job on the basis of that diagnosis. Over the jurisdictional objection of the job applicant (appellant Mark T. Lambley), a medical malpractice tribunal entertained the complaint and determined that Lambley\u2019s offer of proof against the psychiatrist (appellee Stuart M. Kameny) was insufficient. We conclude that, although jurisdiction properly lay with the tribunal, the judgment of dismissal must be vacated because the offer of proof was adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The facts underlying the controversy are somewhat more complex than the generality on the jurisdictional issue posed above. In March, 1991, Lambley applied for a position as a reserve police officer with the city of Lynn. Pursuant to rules of the State Department of Personnel Administration (DPA), every applicant for a police position has to undergo psychological fitness screening. In April, 1991, the Lynn personnel director, exercising authority delegated by DPA, informed Lambley that he was to receive his psychological screening from two psychotherapists, Donald Seckler, a psychologist, and a psychiatrist, who turned out to be Dr. Kameny. Seckler and Kameny were aware of the purpose of their evaluation of Lambley and that Lambley would be entitled to an explanation from them of any adverse testing results.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">After interviewing and testing Lambley, <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Seckler and Kameny submitted a joint report to the Lynn personnel director stating that they had diagnosed Lambley as having a \u201cpassive aggressive personality disorder\u201d which was incompatible with police work and recommending that he not be hired.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based upon .their evaluation, the personnel director notified Lambley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>that he was \u201cpotentially psychologically unsuitable\u201d for the police position he sought and was being rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Lambley filed an appeal from his rejection with the State Civil Service Commission, pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 <em>2(b). </em>In July, 1992, after a hearing, the commission overturned Seckler\u2019s and Kameny\u2019s psychological evaluation of Lambley as constituting a \u201ccasual\u201d and \u201ccavalier\u201d analysis unsupported by the testing done, inconsistent with DSM-III-R criteria (see note 4, <em>supra) </em>and in actuality representing a \u201csmokescreen\u201d designed to mask the real reasons for Lambley\u2019s rejection, allegedly questionable incidents in his background rather than his psychological fitness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Supporting that conclusion, Seckler had testified at the hearing before the commission that Lambley\u2019s testing had not in fact supported a diagnosis of passive-aggressive personality disorder. While recognizing that the concerns raised by the background incidents were legitimate and could be overtly considered in subsequent proceedings, the commission ordered Lambley\u2019s eligibility for the police position to be revived.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Lambley subsequently commenced a Superior Court action against Seckler and Kameny, asserting counts for \u201cmedical malpractice/negligence,\u201d \u201cinterference with advantageous business relations\u201d and \u201cdefamation,\u201d and demanding as relief damages for \u201closs of wages, employment opportunities and mental anguish.\u201d The action was referred over his objection for a hearing before a medical malpractice tribunal. There Lambley continued to argue that his claims were not within the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, but also presented an offer of proof, which included, in addition to evidence of Seckler\u2019s recantation before the Civil Service Commission, a report by Steven N. Shapse, a clinical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>psychologist. Shapse concluded, from his review and reevaluation of the tests administered by Seckler and Kameny and their report, that the results of those tests \u201cd[id] <em>not </em>warrant . . . [the] diagnosis\u201d of passive-aggressive personality disorder, which diagnosis he characterized as \u201cunfounded\u201d; and he opined, based upon those results and the criteria of DSM-IH-R, that Lambley did <em>not </em>suffer from any such disorder. The tribunal determined that Lambley\u2019s presentation sufficiently raised a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry as to Seckler but not as to Kameny. Lambley did not post the required bond as to his allegations against Dr. Kameny, and a Superior Court judge accordingly allowed Kameny\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, sixth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">2. <em>The jurisdiction of the tribunal. </em>Lambley asserts that his claims against Dr. Kameny were not within the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction because his three causes of action are not \u201ctreatment related,\u201d the damages sought do not flow from \u201cmedical results,\u201d he was not a patient of Kameny, and his \u201cinterference with advantageous business relations\u201d count charges an intentional tort that does not involve a medical decision, medical malpractice, or a physician-patient relationship. We see no merit in his contentions on this record and conclude that the tribunal\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The first count of Lambley\u2019s complaint, which is expressly labeled \u201cmedical malpractice,\u201d alleges that \u201cKameny . . . and . . . Seckler . . . were negligent in their evaluation and/or examination of the plaintiff in that they . . . failed to exercise the degree of care and skill of the average qualified member of the medical profession practicing a specialty taking into account the advances in the profession . . . [and] [erroneously diagnosed plaintiff\u2019s condition.\u201d These are the classic allegations of an action for medical malpractice. See <em>Brune </em>v. <em>Belinkoff, </em>354 Mass. 102, 109 (1968); Nolan &amp; Sartorio, Tort Law \u00a7 278 (2d ed. 1989); Perlin, Mottla\u2019s Proof of Cases in Massachusetts: Civil \u00a7\u00a7 24.1-24.3 (3d ed. 1992); Prosser &amp; Keeton, The Law of Torts \u00a7 32, at 186-189 (5th ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Although the label attached to a pleading or motion is far less important than its substance, see Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 7.11 (1974); 5 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1196 (2d ed. 1990), here form followed substance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The central issues raised by Lambley\u2019s complaint, which underlie every one of his three counts, are the nature and extent of Kameny\u2019s interview, examination, and evaluation of Lambley; the soundness of Kameny\u2019s methodology; and the accuracy of his conclusions and diagnosis drawn therefrom. These issues are the essence of a medical malpractice case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the damages Lambley seeks \u2014 loss of wages; other economic detriment; and pain, suffering and embarrassment \u2014 are precisely the sort contemplated under the malpractice tribunal scheme. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 60F(a)(2)&amp;(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In short, Lambley\u2019s claims realistically constitute a charge that Dr. Kameny was \u201cnegligent or mistaken in terms of [his] medical judgment\u201d regarding Lambley\u2019s psychological condition; such an impugning of Kameny\u2019s psychiatric judgment would appear to be well within the jurisdiction of a medical malpractice tribunal. See <em>Leininger </em>v. <em>Franklin Med. Center, </em>404 Mass. 245, 248 (1989) (contrasting an evaluation of a psychiatrist\u2019s failure to comply with the civil commitment statute, which did not fall within the competence of a tribunal, with mistakes in \u201cmedical decisions,\u201d including \u201cmedical judgment or treatment,\u201d which do); <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 996, 997 (1990) (the question of tribunal jurisdiction is resolved by analyzing \u201cthe core of [the plaintiff\u2019s] complaint\u201d and is a matter of its \u201csubstance, not the legal theory adopted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The language and purpose of the statute support tribunal jurisdiction. The first words of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, as inserted by St. 1975, c. 362, \u00a7 5, proclaim that <em>\u201c[e]very </em>action for malpractice, <em>error or mistake </em>against a provider of health care[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] shall be heard by a tribunal ...\u201d (emphasis added). The first judicial decision discussing the statute stressed \u201cevery\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d as words of universal application when medical malpractice issues are involved in an action: \u201cThere is no apparent exception.\u201d <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Boston Univ. Hosp., </em>372 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>654, 660 (1977) (also holding, <em>id. </em>at 655 n.4, that \u201c[c]learly, a claim of negligence falls into [the] class of action\u201d described by the words \u201c[e]very action for malpractice, error or mistake\u201d). See also <em>Little </em>v. Rosenthal, 376 Mass. 573, 576-577 (1978) (citing <em>Austin </em>and the sentence just quoted and twice reiterating that the tribunal requirement covers \u201cerror and mistake\u201d by a health care provider, as well as \u201cmalpractice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">A broad reading of those words that brings Lambley\u2019s action within the ambit of \u00a7 60B is also in accord with the remedial purpose of the statute. The tribunal screening mechanism was created to discourage frivolous claims against health care providers, the defense of which would tend to increase malpractice insurance premiums to levels that would create undue financial hardship for providers, causing an increase'in the cost of medical services, or even discourage provider entry into or continuation in practice, all to the public\u2019s ultimate detriment. See <em>Austin, </em>372 Mass, at 655 n.4; <em>Paro </em>v. <em>Longwood Hosp., </em>373 Mass. 645, 647 (1977); <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>376 Mass, at 577; <em>Brodie </em>v. <em>Gardner Pierce Nursing &amp; Rest Home, Inc., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 639, 641 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Consistent with that statutory purpose, even claims not sounding in traditional malpractice \u2014 unlike those involved here \u2014 which directly implicate the professional judgment or competence of a provider have been held subject to tribunal screening. See <em>Salem Orthopedic Surgeons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>377 Mass. 514, 520 (1979) (action for breach of contract to produce specific medical result is so subject); <em>Lubanes </em>v. <em>George, </em>386 Mass. 320, 325 (1982) (action alleging doctor\u2019s performance of surgery without plaintiff\u2019s consent is appropriate for tribunal screening). The courts have consistently generalized the intended sweep of \u00a7 60B as encompassing \u201call treatment-related claims,\u201d whatever their label or underlying legal theory. <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, 376 </em>Mass, at 576.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To exclude the challenge to professional diagnosis that is the essence of Lambley\u2019s action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>from the screening process would result in the legislative purpose being \u201cpartially thwarted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Lambley nonetheless maintains that, since he was not a patient of Dr. Kameny, no physician-patient relationship existed and, therefore, his claims should not have been transferred to the tribunal. It is true that an oft-repeated tenet of tribunal jurisprudence is that a medical malpractice plaintiff must demonstrate the existence of a doctor-patient relationship, as well as physician performance not conforming to good medical practice and resulting damage. <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine, </em>380 Mass. 186, 193 (1980). <em>Rahilly </em>v. <em>North Adams Regional Hosp., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 717 (1994). That formula, however, relates to the test for evaluating the sufficiency of a plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof in order to raise a legitimate question of liability for judicial inquiry. No Massachusetts case had held the existence of a formal doctor-patient relationship to be a sine qua non of tribunal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Assuming, however, without deciding, that such a relationship or its equivalent is a jurisdictional prerequisite, if sufficiently existed here. The essence of the doctor-patient relationship is the undertaking by a physician to diagnose and/or treat the person being diagnosed or treated with reasonable professional skill. The law imposes on the practitioner a duty of care to the extent of conforming to certain prevailing standards of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>reasonable professional conduct for the protection of those on whom he practices from foreseeable risks. See <em>Small </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>128 Mass. 131, 135 (1880); <em>Riggs </em>v. <em>Christie, </em>342 Mass. 402, 405-406 (1961); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 282, 289, 299A; Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 30, at 164, \u00a7 53, at 356-358; Seavey, Principles of Torts, 56 Harv. L. Rev. 72, 75-76 (1942); Annot., What Constitutes Physician-Patient Relationship for Malpractice Purposes, 17 A.L.R.4th 132 (1982). Cf. <em>Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R., </em>248 N.Y. 339, 344-345 (1928). Although the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Bus. Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 508, 522 n.21 (1984), noted that \u201c[w]hen an employer retains a physician to examine employees, generally no physician-patient relationship exists between the employee and the doctor,\u201d it nonetheless emphasized that \u201c[pjhysicians in such a situation . . . must still exercise reasonable care and skill in their relationship with the employees,\u201d thereby rejecting the view that no duty to the examinee is imposed in the examining physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The court in <em>Bratt </em>found support for its pronouncement of a duty of due care on the part of a physician, even in the absence of a technical physician-patient relationship, in <em>Harriott </em>v. <em>Plimpton, </em>166 Mass. 585 (1896), a case which is essentially analogous to Lambley\u2019s and applies the principles discussed above. There, the defendant physician examined the plaintiff at the request of the plaintiff\u2019s prospective father-in-law after the latter had received reports that the plaintiff \u201chad a disease and was not fit to marry.\u201d The defendant misdiagnosed the plaintiff as having a venereal disease, which resulted in the breaking of the plaintiff\u2019s engagement. In setting aside a jury verdict against the plaintiff on his negligence action against the physician, the court, <em>id. </em>at 588, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">\u201cHaving undertaken for compensation to be paid by another to examine the plaintiff, and to report whether he was diseased, the defendant was bound to have the ordinary skill and learning of a physician, and exercise ordinary diligence and care, and if he- failed, and the plaintiff was injured because of his want of such skill and learning, or his want of such care, the defendant was answerable to him in damages. In our opinion, the fact that the purpose of the examination was information, and not medical treatment, is immaterial, and the breaking of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s marriage engagement in consequence of the wrong diagnosis was not too remote a damage to sustain the action.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>West, </em>165 Md. 245 (1933), and <em>Kleber </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>39 Misc. 2d 712 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1963) (both holding that lack of a doctor-patient relationship does not prevent recovery for professional negligence against mental hospital physicians who misdiagnosed plaintiffs as insane, leading to their institutionalization); and <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>845 P.2d 530 (Colo. 1993) (a physician to whom the plaintiff was referred for examination at the request of defendants in a vehicular accident suit, pursuant to the Colorado version of Mass.R.Civ.P. 35, 365 Mass. 793 (1974), owed the plaintiff a duty to exercise the due care and professional skill of a reasonable physician, and an action lay against him for want of professional due care even though no physician-patient relationship existed).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">In our view, the duty to exercise reasonable professional care and skill recognized in <em>Bratt </em>and <em>Harriott </em>is practically indistinguishable from the duty owed by a physician to his conventional patient, at least with respect to the tortious, as opposed to the contractual, consequences of the relationship. It would be irrationally anomalous, as well as inconsistent with legislative intent, to hold (as Lambley urges) that a plaintiff who can recover in negligence against an examining physician who violates his duty of exercising professional due care by misdiagnosing, and causing foreseeable harm<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to, the plaintiff need not first submit his action to the screening tribunal merely because he is not a voluntary, paying patient of the examining physician in the traditional sense. Substance and reality, not form and theory, must prevail. The tribunal, therefore, rightly rejected Lambley\u2019s challenge to its jurisdiction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">3. <em>Sufficiency of the offer of proof </em>The tribunal erred, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>however, as Lambley alternatively contends, in deciding that his offer of proof was insufficient<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> with respect to Dr. Kameny.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Apparently overlooking the frequent judicial admonitions that an offer of proof is to be given an \u201cindulgent reading in favor of the plaintiff;\u201d <em>Kilmartin </em>v. <em>Lowell Gen. Hosp., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902 (1986); that the standard for considering expert testimony is \u201can extremely lenient one,\u201d <em>Halley </em>v. <em>Birbiglia, </em>390 Mass. 540, 543 n.4 (1983); and that the evidence, including all permissible inferences therefrom, is to be taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, see <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Lea, </em>403 Mass. 430, 434-435 (1988); <em>St. Germain </em>v. <em>Pfeifer, </em>418 Mass. 511, 516 (1994), the tribunal misapplied the \u201cdirected verdict\u201d standard to be used in evaluating the evidence before it. The question to be answered was: is there, upon any rational view of the evidence, and from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances from which a reasonable inference of Kameny\u2019s professional negligence could be drawn in Lambley\u2019s favor? <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, 376 </em>Mass, at 578. We have no difficulty in determining that Lambley\u2019s offer presented a litigable issue as to Kameny\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Seckler\u2019s disavowal, under oath, of the diagnosis that he and Kameny had jointly made should itself have been sufficient to establish an issue appropriate for judicial inquiry. If substantiated, it would have reasonably supported (although not compelled) an inference that Kameny\u2019s shared opinion about Lambley\u2019s alleged disorder was similarly medically unsound. It was not the tribunal\u2019s function to appraise the weight or credibility of such evidence. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Avedikian, </em>412 Mass. 481, 483 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Even without Seckler\u2019s acknowledgment of misdiagnosis, Shapse\u2019s twelve-page, single-spaced opinion (to which was attached his curriculum vitae reflecting extensive credentials in the general field of psychotherapy) provided the requisite sufficiency. It not only concluded that Dr. Kameny\u2019s diagnosis of Lambley reflected a misreading of the tests results, was unsupported by the authoritative DSM-DI-R whose standards Kameny had misapplied, and was \u201cunfounded,\u201d but went further by opining that Lambley did not in fact suffer from the passive-aggressive personality disorder Kameny had purported to find. It was not required of Shapse to state his opinion as to Kameny\u2019s perceived deficiencies in any particular form or by use of any magic words. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 106, 111 (1997). The clear import of the opinion is that Kameny\u2019s examination and testing of Lambley fell below the requisite standard of care and his medical judgment was mistaken. That was enough. Shapse\u2019s detailed report, fairly read, presented more than conclusory assertions, and provided evidence from which a reasonable juror could infer sub-par professional conduct on Kameny\u2019s part.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Avedikian, </em>412 Mass, at 484; <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Baystate Med. Center, </em>415 Mass. 202, 207 n.6 (1993); <em>Rahilly </em>v. <em>North Adams Regional Hosp., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 718 n.6; <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>42 Mass.

His argument ignores reality \u2014 he was examined by Kameny for the sole purpose of Kameny\u2019s providing a medical diagnosis and opinion as to Lambley\u2019s psychological status, the results of which would be communicated to Lambley \u2014 as well as the cases holding that medical malpractice is a tort which covers actions against medical professionals, including psychiatrists, for improper diagnoses that result in damages. See <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Ruble, </em>307 Mass. 562, 566 (1940); <em>Vartanian </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>311 Mass. 249, 253-254 (1942); <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine, </em>380 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Mass. 186, 193-194 (1980); <em>Stepakoff v. Kantar, </em>393 Mass. 836, 838-841 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Lambley cites <em>Thomasson </em>v. <em>Diethelm, </em>457 So. 2d 397, 399 (Ala. 1984), and <em>Midtown Community Mental Health Center </em>v. <em>Estate of Gahl, </em>540 N.E.2d 1259, 1262 (Ind. App. 1989), for the proposition that a malpractice plaintiff must be a patient of the defendant physician for the tribunal to screen the case. Those decisions are, however, distinguishable because, in contrast to the breadth of the first sentence of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, the governing statutes in both States expressly defined malpractice in terms of the duty of care owed to a \u201cpatient.\u201d Although courts in a few jurisdictions have held that the existence of a duty of care by a physician is predicated on an explicit physician-patient relationship, and have accordingly held that physicians engaged by prospective employers to examine job applicants either owe the examinee (as opposed to the employer) no duty at all or only a duty to avoid injury to the examinee in the course of the examination, see Annot., Physician\u2019s Duties and Liabilities to Person Examined Pursuant to Physician\u2019s Contract With Such Person\u2019s Prospective or Actual Employer or Insurer, 10 A.L.R.Sd 1071 (1966), that is not the law in Massachusetts. Here, such physicians must exercise reasonable care and skill in examining and diagnosing an examinee referred by a third party. See <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Bus. Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 508, 522 n.21 (1986), and discussion <em>infra </em>at 284-285.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b311-8\">On this record it is impossible to assert that Kameny should not reasonably have foreseen that a misdiagnosis of Lambley\u2019s psychological condition would directly harm him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Lambley\u2019s additional contention against tribunal jurisdiction, that his counts for interference and defamation, which rely on precisely the same facts as his \u201cmedical malpractice/negligence\u201d count, are intentional torts which did not result in medical injuries, has no merit. See <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. at 997 (adopting a legal theory of intentional tort does not preclude tribunal jurisdiction if the core of the complaint is improper treatment by the physician), and the discussion, <em>supra </em>at 281-282, regarding the intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>comprehensive scope of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, whenever malpractice or treatment-related claims are involved in an action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Generally supporting our conclusion that tribunal jurisdiction in the instant circumstances does not depend on a conventional physician-patient relationship are: (1) the abolition of the requirement of privity in tort actions, see <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Yardley &amp; Co., </em>319 Mass. 92, 96, 98, 103-104 (1946); and (2) the provisions of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, which accord any person who communicates with a psychotherapist, including a psychologist or psychiatrist, for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment with respect to the person\u2019s mental or emotional condition (such a person being defined by the statute as a \u201cpatient\u201d) the privilege of refusing to disclose and preventing the disclosure of any such communications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\">A medical malpractice plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof must establish that the defendant did not conform to accepted medical standards. <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine, </em>380 Mass, at 193.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The tribunal, couching its decisions in the statutory formula, did not explain why Lambley\u2019s offer was nonetheless sufficient as to Seckler, whose professional relations with, testing of, methodology applied to, and conclusions regarding Lambley were exactly the same as Kameny\u2019s. The most plausible reason appears to be Seckler\u2019s admission before the Civil Service Commission that he had indeed misdiagnosed Lambley. To the extent the tribunal may have deemed Lambley\u2019s supporting expert opinion from clinical psychologist Shapse, who expressly criticized both Seckler and Kameny, to be effective against psychologist Seckler but not against psychiatrist Kameny, it would have been mistaken. See <em>Heyman </em>v. <em>Knirk, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 946, 947-948 (1994); note 17, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\">We, of course, express no opinion on the substantive merits of Lambley\u2019s claim against Kameny, who the trial evidence may show did not deviate from accepted standards of care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Dr. Kameny\u2019s arguments in favor of the tribunal\u2019s decision are that Shapse\u2019s opinion does not expressly state the applicable standard of care or that Kameny\u2019s different opinion deviated from it, and that Shapse, as a psychologist, was not qualified to address the standard of care applicable to a psychiatrist. The preceding discussion in section 4 demonstrates the fallacy of Kameny\u2019s first contention. As to the second, it has long been accepted that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s medical expert need not be practicing in the same area as the defendant, let alone be a specialist in that area.
