His father, Albert Lighter, had a similar policy issued by Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Insurance Company (Lumbermens), that had a higher per person limit of $250,000. During the pendency of the underlying tort action against Thomas Dargis, Lighter settled his claim for $15,000 and received payment in that amount, representing the full proceeds available under a policy from Dargis\u2019 liability carrier, Liberty Mutual Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Company. By agreement dated May 30, 1990, Lighter released Dargis from all further liability with the consent of his insurance carrier. He did not, however, obtain Lumbermens\u2019 consent, thus provoking the present action for declaratory judgment (G. L. c. 231 A) seeking to establish his entitlement to UIMC under his father\u2019s policy and to direct the parties to arbitration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">A judge of the Superior Court determined, after a bench trial, that Lumbermens was not obligated to pay the underinsured benefits because it was materially prejudiced by Lighter\u2019s failure to give prompt notice of the claim. We conclude that Lighter is entitled to collect UIMC benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The facts are not in dispute. On February 15, 1989, Lighter was injured when his automobile was struck by the vehicle driven by Dargis. Lighter suffered serious injury to the lumbar region of the spine. There is no dispute that Dargis caused the accident. On April 21, 1989, Lighter retained counsel to represent him in the prosecution of his tort claim. The same counsel represented Lighter when he settled the claim in May, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">On November 20, 1991, Lighter notified Lumbermens of the accident and his intention to initiate a claim for UIMC benefits under his father\u2019s policy. Because the amount Lighter received in settlement ($15,000) exceeded the amount of UIMC available under his own policy ($10,000), G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L(2), precluded Lighter from recovery under his policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result, Lighter pursued recovery under his father\u2019s policy, which, as the judge found, the anti-stacking provisions of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, did not affect. Lumbermens denied coverage on the ground that Lighter failed to give prompt notice of the claim, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>required by the terms of the insurance contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge found that Lumbermens had carried its burden of demonstrating that it was materially prejudiced because it was not given the opportunity to investigate Dargis\u2019 assets before settlement. The judge concluded that, had notice been timely, Lumbermens may have chosen to withhold consent to settlement. The record fails to support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">On appeal, Lighter argues that Lumbermens failed to prove prejudice because it did not demonstrate that Dargis, in fact, had any assets from which it could recover. An insurance company may only deny UIMC because of the injured\u2019s failure to provide timely notice to the company if that delay materially prejudiced the company. <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>American Cas. Co., </em>419 Mass. 138, 142 (1994). Standing alone, length of time is insufficient to satisfy a showing that delay in notification materially prejudiced an insurer. <em>Darcy </em>v. <em>Hartford Ins. Co., </em>407 Mass. 481, 486 (1990). This is true even if the delay could be fairly characterized as \u201cextreme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485. See also <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Grange Ins. Assn., </em>34 Wash. App. 151, 163-164 (1983) (no presumption of prejudice where injured waited five years to notify insurer). Rather, delay is a relevant factor to be considered in combination with other facts or circumstances. <em>Darcy, </em>407 Mass, at 486.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The insurer bears the burden of identifying precisely how the delay has caused it to suffer prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 486-487.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In addition to finding a delay of two years and nine months from the date of the incident, the judge ruled that, as matter of law, Lumbermens suffered material prejudice because Lighter\u2019s settlement with and release of Dargis, without notice, deprived it of the opportunity to withhold consent to settlement. Liberty paid all of Dargis\u2019 liability coverage to Lighter, who released Dargis from further claims against him. A UIMC provider may choose to withhold consent \u201cin order to protect its statutory and contractual repayment rights.\u201d <em>Maclnnis </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number><em>Co., </em>403 Mass. 220, 227 (1988). General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 113L(4), inserted by St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 5, provides that an insurer making a payment under UIMC \u201cshall, to the extent thereof, be entitled to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment resulting from the exercise of any rights of recovery of such person against any person or organization legally responsible for the bodily injury for which such payment is made.\u201d A release of the tortfeasor from any obligation in return for a settlement amount, prior to the insurer\u2019s having made any payment to the injured party, defeats the insurer\u2019s right to repayment. See <em>Pace </em>v. <em>Cage, </em>419 So. 2d 443, 444 (La. 1982); <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Clothier, </em>338 N.W.2d 256, 262-263 (Minn. 1983); <em>Charest </em>v. <em>Union Mut. Ins. Co., </em>113 N.H. 683, 687 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">While it is true that the settlement destroyed Lumbermens right to repayment, a right to repayment is meaningless if the tortfeasor has no substantial assets from which to recover. The judge concluded that Lumbermens proved the late notice resulted in material prejudice because, \u201c[tjhere was evidence that Dargis had assets with which to settle the claim without insurance company involvement.\u201d The judge based this conclusion on her finding that, during a telephone conversation a few days after the accident, \u201cDargis expressed his interest in settling the matter without the involvement of their respective insurance companies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">A reviewing court will only deem a finding of fact by the trial judge clearly erroneous if, after reviewing the evidence, it \u201cis left with the firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Nylander </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>423 Mass. 158, 159 n.5 (1996). Here, the judge\u2019s finding of prejudice stumbles on a failure of proof. The judge based her conclusion that Dargis had assets solely on evidence of a telephone conversation between the plaintiff and Dargis. However, during the course of the trial on cross-examination of the plaintiff, the judge-excluded the substance of the conversation. As culled from the record, the questioning proceeded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">Q: \u201cAnd did you speak with Mr. Dargis at the time of the accident?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">A: \u201cBriefly. We had exchanged papers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">Q: \u201cAll right, and at some point did he contact you by telephone?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>A: \u201cYes, he had \u2014 yeah. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">The Judge: \u201cCounsel, where are we going with this? . . . Get to the issue of assets. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">Mr. Ferg: \u201cI\u2019m going to suggest that his testimony would be that Mr. Dargis said Gee, can we keep our insurance companies out of this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">The Judge: \u201cMaybe he had money to pay. Leads me to believe he\u2019s got independent means to pay, so I\u2019ll let it in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">Q: \u201c <em>What was the substance of the telephone conversation!\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">Ms. Kirby: <em>\u201cObjection.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">The Judge: <em>\u201cHearsay!\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-11\">Ms. Kirby: <em>\u201cYes.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-12\">The Judge: <em>\u201cSustained.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">The defendant makes no argument that exclusion of this testimony was error. So we are left without any evidence that supports the judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion. Furthermore, nothing else in the record reveals that Lumbermens was precluded from conducting an investigation of Dargis\u2019 assets had it chosen to do so. We think that this is a case where, in spite of a settlement that extinguished Lumbermens\u2019 right to repayment, there is no proof of prejudice. <em>Maclnnis, </em>403 Mass, at 226-227.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">The judgment is modified by striking the provisions relating to Lumbermens and substituting a declaration and order that the plaintiff is entitled to underinsurance benefits under the Lumbermens\u2019 policy issued to his father and the parties shall proceed to arbitration on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> According to the policy, \u201cThe determination as to whether an injured person is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or operator of a responsible auto will be by agreement between us and the injured person. The amount of the damages, if any, will be determined in the same way. Arbitration will be used if no agreement can be reached.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b442-9\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 113L(2), as amended through St. 1988, c. 273, \u00a7 46, states: \u201cthe term \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 shall also include protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of insured motor vehicles ... to which a bodily injury liability bond or policy applies at the time of the accident and its bodily injury liability bond amount or policy limit is less than the policy limit for uninsured motor vehicle coverage and is insufficient to satisfy the damages of persons insured thereunder and only to the extent that the uninsured motor vehicle coverage limits exceed said limits of bodily injury liability subject to the terms of the policy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The notice provision in the policy reads, in relevant part, as follows: \u201cWe, or our agent, must be notified promptly of the accident or loss by you or someone on your behalf.
