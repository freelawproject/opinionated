SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b324-22\">Three separate insurance carriers are potentially at risk in this case for the tortious conduct of J. Robert Lee, III. We are asked to review the district court\u2019s determination that all three policies should be construed as providing primary coverage for the costs to defend Lee and to settle various claims against him. The district court held that an excess or \u201cumbrella\u201d insurance policy \u201cdropped down\u201d into a pool of unexhausted and readily available primary insurance. The court then apportioned liability among the three insurers according to a Louisiana formula that divides each insurer\u2019s maximum policy coverage by the aggregate coverage afforded by all three policies. <em>Truehart v. Blandon, </em>696 F.Supp. 210 (E.D.La.1988). Because we conclude that the district court misapplied Louisiana\u2019s doctrine of \u201cmutual repugnan-cy\u201d and erroneously gave operative effect to the umbrella policy\u2019s \u201cdrop down\u201d provision, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-24\">The relevant facts in this case are not in dispute. On the night of February 23, 1986, a yachting accident took the life of 24-year-old Victor Truehart. Peter Blan-d\u00f3n had entrusted the nighttime operation of his 41-foot yacht \u201cBuccaneer\u201d to his companion, J. Robert Lee, III, while Blan-d\u00f3n went below deck. Shortly after assuming control of the helm, Lee collided with the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway Bridge, sinking the vessel. Of the eight passengers on board, seven survived by clutching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>a small, overturned dinghy for 4-5 hours before rescue. The survivors, however, never located Victor Truehart, presumed thrown from the yacht upon initial impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Victor\u2019s father, Donald Truehart, and others brought a wrongful death action under general maritime law. The plaintiffs sued the yacht <em>in rem, </em>Peter Bland\u00f3n as owner of the vessel, Blandon\u2019s yacht insurer United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company (USF &amp; G), J. Robert Lee as operator of the vessel, and Lee\u2019s insurers, The North River Insurance Company (North River) and United States Fire Insurance Company (U.S. Fire).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Pursuant to admiralty jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(1), the case was tried without a jury. During trial, the defendants and their insurance carriers settled plaintiffs\u2019 claim for 153,00o.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial continued, however, concerning the issue of liability as between defendants Bland\u00f3n and Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The district court found Lee liable for negligently operating the yacht and Blan-d\u00f3n liable for negligently entrusting the vessel to an \u201cobviously inexperienced person\u201d at night.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 696 F.Supp. at 214. The court held the operator (Lee) 75 percent at fault, and the owner (Bland\u00f3n) 25 percent at fault, for all damages and related costs of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The district court found that Bland\u00f3n was covered solely by USF &amp; G\u2019s $300,000 yacht liability policy but that three policies extended protection to Lee. The court reasoned that Blandon\u2019s USF &amp; G policy covered Lee because he operated the \u201cBuccaneer\u201d at the direction of the owner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, Lee separately owned a $100,000 homeowner\u2019s policy from North River and a $1,000,000 \u201cumbrella\u201d or excess insurance policy from U.S. Fire. The final $53,-000 settlement reached with the plaintiffs, and the $29,241.34 in stipulated litigation expenses for Lee, failed to exhaust any single policy at risk in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">The district court rejected U.S. Fire\u2019s argument that its umbrella or catastrophic policy provided excess insurance if, and only if, Lee\u2019s liability exceeded primary coverage of $400,000 ($300,000 from Blan-don\u2019s USF &amp; G policy and $100,000 from Lee\u2019s North River policy). Instead, the district court held that an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in U.S. Fire\u2019s excess policy, coupled with a \u201cdrop down\u201d clause<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in that policy, transformed U.S. Fire into a primary insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">In so holding, the district court calculated an aggregate pool of $1,400,000 in primary insurance coverage from all three policies. Applying principles of Louisiana insurance law, the court held each insurer proportionally liable in accordance with each policy\u2019s maximum coverage: USF &amp; G incurred 3/14 liability, and North River and U.S. Fire (Lee\u2019s insurers) were jointly responsible for the remaining 11/14.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-16\">North River and U.S. Fire do not challenge the district court\u2019s application of the Louisiana rule concerning apportionment of separate insurance underwritten by multiple carriers for claims against a single tort-feasor. Instead, they question the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>construction of U.S. Fire\u2019s umbrella policy as providing primary insurance coverage. The application of the Louisiana formula yields a dramatically different result if U.S. Fire is treated as an umbrella insurer and its $1,000,000 policy is excluded from the primary pool: 3/4 liability for USF &amp; G, 1/4 liability for North River, and none for U.S. Fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">U.S. Fire believes itself to be at no risk for claims against Lee because $400,000 in unexhausted primary insurance coverage is readily available. However, U.S. Fire today finds itself principally responsible for claims and litigation costs against Lee because of the particular mechanics of Louisiana\u2019s insurance apportionment rules and a $1,000,000 policy that dwarfs all other available insurance. Similarly, North River finds itself responsible for an undivided 11/14 share of all claims and costs against Lee, as compared to the more agreeable 1/4 share that results if U.S. Fire is treated as a true excess insurer. Not surprisingly, this appeal is limited to the single issue of whether the trial judge erred in holding U.S. Fire to be a primary insurer under the terms of its umbrella policy issued to Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Our first task is to determine the applicable law governing our interpretation of U.S. Fire\u2019s policy. U.S. Fire\u2019s yacht policy insures against certain maritime risks and losses. Consequently, we conclude that it provides maritime insurance within the meaning of <em>Wilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>348 U.S. 310, 75 S.Ct. 368, 99 L.Ed. 337 (1955). We have previously interpreted <em>Wilburn Boat </em>as requiring the application of state insurance law principles if there is no specific and controlling federal rule. <em>See, e.g., Transco Exploration Co. v. Pacific Employers Ins. Co., </em>869 F.2d 862, 863 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Ingersoll-Rand Fin. Corp. v. Employers Ins., </em>771 F.2d 910, 911-12 (5th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1046, 106 S.Ct. 1263, 89 L.Ed.2d 573 (1986). We are aware of no such federal rule here.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">In identifying the appropriate state law to apply, we look to the state having the greatest interest in the resolution of the issues. <em>See Transco, </em>869 F.2d at 863. We believe that the district court correctly applied Louisiana law since, as noted by the court, the vessel owner was a Louisiana resident, the vessel was moored in Louisiana, and the accident occurred in Louisiana. <em>See USF &amp; G v. Williams, </em>676 F.Supp. 123, 125 (E.D.La.1987). Moreover, because the \u201cinterpretation of a contract is a question of law, including the question whether the contract is ambiguous,\u201d <em>Ross v. Western Fidelity Ins. Co., </em>872 F.2d 665, 668 (5th Cir.1989), we will apply <em>de novo </em>review to the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Accord Reid v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., </em>784 F.2d 577, 578 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">The district court\u2019s analysis first focused upon Blandon\u2019s USF &amp; G and Lee\u2019s North River policies. Each policy included an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause claiming secondary liability and purporting to be excess \u201cover any other valid and collectible insurance.\u201d The court interpreted Louisiana law as requiring the abrogation of mutually repugnant \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses and the ratable allocation of damages among insurers. <em>See Williams, </em>676 F.Supp. at 128 n. 28.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The parties do not contest the district court\u2019s interpretation of Louisiana law regarding the mutual repugnancy doctrine for primary insurance or the treatment of USF &amp; G and North River as co-primary insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The district court proceeded to consider U.S. Fire\u2019s umbrella policy, noting that it too contained an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause as well as a \u201cdrop down\u201d provision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Unlike USF &amp; G\u2019s and North River\u2019s policies, however, U.S. Fire\u2019s policy expressly limited its contractual liability to \u201cthe ultimate net loss in excess of the insured\u2019s [Lee\u2019s] Retained Limit.\u201d \u201cRetained Limit\u201d is defined in the policy as the greater of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">(a) the total of the applicable limits of the underlying policies listed in the Schedule of Underlying Insurance [North River], and the applicable limits of any other underlying insurance available to the insured [USF &amp; G]; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">(b) an amount stated as \u201cRetained Limit\u201d in the Declarations as a result of any one occurrence not covered by the policies listed in the Schedule of Underlying Insurance or any other insurance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Only North River\u2019s $100,000 policy is listed in the Schedule of Underlying Insurance; USF &amp; G\u2019s unlisted $300,000 policy is other insurance available to Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The district court agreed that U.S. Fire intended to provide umbrella coverage, at least with respect to North River\u2019s $100,-000 policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, it failed to treat U.S. Fire as an excess insurer because of what the district court believed to be the combined effect of the policy\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d and \u201cdrop down\u201d clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">Admitting that the treatment of \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses between primary and umbrella policies is \u201cnot without doubt\u201d under Louisiana law, the district court held that the clauses in USF &amp; G\u2019s primary policy and U.S. Fire\u2019s excess policy were mutually repugnant and thus ineffective. For reasons not entirely evident to us, the district court accepted appellees\u2019 argument that striking the repugnant clause from U.S. Fire\u2019s policy necessarily transformed it into primary insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">The district court reached this conclusion despite its recognition that all three policies, each bearing \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses, were not mutually repugnant when viewed together. In fact, it admitted that U.S. Fire successfully underwrote an excess policy with respect to North River\u2019s policy. 696 F.Supp. at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">It appears that the court <em>separately </em>held USF &amp; G\u2019s and North River\u2019s policies \u2014 and subsequently USF &amp; G and U.S. Fire\u2019s policies \u2014 to be mutually repugnant. It then proceeded to treat all three to be co-primary insurers \u201c[d]espite the clear intent as between North River\u2019s policy and U.S. Fire\u2019s policy, that the latter be an excess as to the former....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-16\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s analysis misapplied the doctrine of mutual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>repugnancy and leads to untenable consequences. No Louisiana court has spoken to the precise excess insurance issue involved in this case, but we expect that such a court would not endorse the district court\u2019s interpretation of Louisiana insurance law which we review here.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In the first place, we find the \u201cdrop down\u201d clause of U.S. Fire\u2019s policy to be inoperative for the simple reason that unexhausted, underlying insurance is readily available with North River\u2019s $100,000 policy alone, or in combination with USF &amp; G\u2019s $300,000 policy. The plain language of the policy indicates that the \u201cdrop down\u201d provision comes into play only if primary insurance is <em>unavailable. </em>That not being the case, U.S. Fire\u2019s policy is not at risk, as claims against Lee fail to exceed $400,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Moreover, it is logical to assume that affordable and socially desirable catastrophic insurance would be difficult to obtain in Louisiana if we were loosely to allow transformation of umbrella policies because of boilerplate \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in primary policies. Consequently, we are not convinced that Louisiana would allow a standard \u201cother insurance\u201d clause in the policy of an unrelated third party (Blandon\u2019s yacht policy) to define whether U.S. Fire should be treated as an excess or primary insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The doctrine of mutual repugnancy appears to proscribe transformation of a primary policy into an excess policy if the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause would defeat the primary coverage originally contemplated by the parties and lead to absurd, unintended gaps in insurance protection. We find no benefit in applying the doctrine to achieve a dramatically different result: transforming a true umbrella policy into a primary policy where there is sufficient underlying insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">But for Blandon\u2019s decision to carry primary yacht insurance with USF &amp; G, U.S. Fire, under the district court\u2019s analysis, would have been an excess insurer \u2014 not a primary carrier \u2014 and thus not exposed to risk. According to the district court\u2019s reasoning, the mere presence of an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause in U.S. Fire\u2019s policy was sufficient to destroy its status as only an excess insurer. We find this outcome to be contrary to well-settled principles of Louisiana insurance law.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">The appellees summarily conclude that USF &amp; G\u2019s and U.S. Fire\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions are mutually repugnant without explaining why the clauses of the nonconcurrent policies cannot be reconciled with one another. We conclude, to the contrary, that the appellees\u2019 position, if adopted, would unduly expand Louisiana\u2019s doctrine of mutual repugnancy and would lead to the kind of untenable result that initially led to the doctrine\u2019s judicial development. As noted by the district judge <em>a quo </em>in a previous opinion, \u201cthe mere existence of [\u201cother insurance\u201d] clauses in two policies does not necessarily mean the two clauses are mutually repugnant.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>676 F.Supp. 123, 128 n. 28 (citing <em>Offshore Logistics Servs., Inc. v. Mutual Marine Office, Inc., </em>462 F.Supp. 485, 492-94 (E.D.La.1978)). The clauses\u2019 plain language must be irreconcilable with one another in order to be deemed repugnant. <em>See Graves v. Traders &amp; Gen. Ins. Co., </em>252 La. 709, 214 So.2d 116, 117-18 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">We recognize that \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in a true excess or umbrella policy may be irreconcilable with another umbrella policy, both of which are at risk because primary insurance is unavailable or exhausted. <em>See Dean v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>518 So.2d at 1117-18 (finding \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in competing true excess policies mutually repugnant). This position is consistent with the treatment of competing co-primary insurers such as USF &amp; G and North River. But where, as in this case, the primary insurance is sufficient, there is no gap in insurance coverage even if each \u201cother insurance\u201d clause is given full effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">Moreover, the doctrine of mutual repug-nancy requires only that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses be given no operative effect. The doctrine has never been used in Louisiana as an instrument to transform a true excess insurance policy into a primary insurance policy where primary insurance is unexhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">In adopting this position, we avoid stretching Louisiana\u2019s doctrine of mutual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>repugnancy beyond its present \u2014 and evidently intended \u2014 scope. We also avoid reshaping Louisiana\u2019s catastrophic insurance law by giving primary insurers the ability to tap into umbrella policies through the use of boilerplate \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses. At the same time, we reaffirm the Louisiana principle that overlapping bargained-for insurance coverage involving co-primary (or co-umbrella) insurers will not be defeated by boilerplate \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In summary, we find U.S. Fire to be an umbrella insurer not at risk in light of the ample primary coverage from USF &amp; G and North River. We also find that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses have no operative impact upon the nature of U.S. Fire\u2019s coverage of Lee. Using Louisiana\u2019s insurance apportionment rule applied by the district court, we hold USF &amp; G to be %, and North River <em>Vt, </em>responsible for all claims against Lee and for his related litigation expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">We REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for entry of judgment in accordance herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\">.
