The plea agreement provided that appellant would be sentenced under guidelines promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission. The district court, however, believed that the act establishing the Sentencing Commission, <em>see </em>Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-473, \u00a7 211, 98 Stat. 1987, was unconstitutional. In accepting appellant\u2019s plea, therefore, the court indicated that it would sentence appellant under the prior law (an indeterminate sentencing scheme monitored by the United States Parole Commission). Before the sentencing hearing took place, however, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Sentencing Reform Act, <em>see Mistretta v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989); thus, when appellant appeared for sentencing, the court advised him that he would be sentenced under the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">A presentence report, prepared by the court\u2019s probation officer pursuant to the Sentencing Commission\u2019s guidelines, provided the format for the sentencing hearing. When the hearing began, the court asked appellant whether he had gone over the report with his attorney, and appellant replied that he had. The court then asked appellant\u2019s attorney whether the appellant had any objections to the report\u2019s factual recitations or the manner in which the probation officer had applied the guidelines to the facts of appellant\u2019s case. Counsel stab ed that appellant had no objections. Later in the hearing, prior to the imposition of sentence, counsel asked the court to impose the \u201cminimum sentence within the [guideline] range\u201d specified in the report, <em>i.e., </em>a prison term of fifty-one months. The court rejected counsel\u2019s request and imposed a prison sentence of sixty-three months, the maximum sentence permitted by the guideline range. The court also ordered that appellant\u2019s term of incarceration be followed by a three-year term of supervised release, as required by the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Appellant asks us to vacate his conviction and sentence because the court, in accepting appellant\u2019s guilty plea, (1) indicated that it would not sentence him pursuant to the guidelines and (2) failed to inform him that if he were sentenced to prison, a term of supervised release would be imposed. We refuse to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Appellant was arrested the day after the robbery. Shortly after he was taken into custody, he gave the FBI a full confession. Plea negotiations ensued, and appellant entered into a plea agreement in which he stipulated that he robbed the savings bank, after handing the teller a note stating \u201cthis is a hold up\u201d and that he had \u201ca gun under my rain jacket,\u201d and that the bank\u2019s surveillance camera had photographed him as he committed the crime. Appellant also stipulated, as noted above, that he be sentenced under the guidelines. Appellant now says that he would not have pled guilty had he known that the court would reverse the position it took at the plea hearing and follow the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Appellant of course knew that an intervening Supreme Court decision concerning the constitutionality of the Sentencing Reform Act might compel the district court to follow the guidelines. Thus, when the court announced that it would follow <em>Mistretta </em>and adhere to the guidelines, appellant and his attorney made no objection. We therefore reject appellant\u2019s argument that he would not have pled guilty had he known that the court would impose a guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">Turning to appellant\u2019s second point, it is clear that the district court erred in not informing appellant at the plea hearing that appellant, if sentenced to prison, would be subject to a term of supervised release. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1) required the court, in taking appellant\u2019s plea, to determine that he understood, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-12\">(1) The nature of the charge to which the plea is offered, the mandatory minimum penalty provided by law, if any, and the maximum possible penalty provided by law, including the effect of any special parole term or term of supervised release. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">The statute appellant violated in this case, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), provides a maximum penalty of imprisonment of not more than twenty years. Thus, appellant\u2019s of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>fense was a Class B felony. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(1)(B) (Supp. V 1987). When an accused is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for the commission of a Class B felony, the guidelines require that a court impose a term of supervised release of three to five years. <em>See </em>Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5D3.2(b)(l) (Jan. 15, 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Although the court erred in failing to inform appellant of this penalty, we need not vacate appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence unless appellant\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights\u201d have been affected. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(h) (\u201cAny variance from the procedures required by this rule which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\u201d) On the facts of this case, we are convinced that no substantial right of the appellant was affected. At sentencing, the district court advised appellant, as the presentence report had informed him previously, that the guidelines prescribed a term of imprisonment and a mandatory term of supervised release. Neither appellant nor his attorney objected, and the court proceeded to impose the prescribed penalty. Appellant\u2019s own conduct therefore indicates that he was not harmed by the district court\u2019s oversight at the plea hearing; accordingly, we refuse to grant him relief now.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
