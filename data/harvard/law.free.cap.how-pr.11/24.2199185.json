The demurrer admits the truth of this allegation; and if it did not, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to set out the act of incorporation. <em>(Stoddard </em>agt. <em>Onondaga Ann. </em>Conf., 12 <em>Barb. </em>573.) Nor are we to intend, as a matter of law, that this company is a foreign corporation, especially as it is stated that it is doing business within this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">It is said, that a corporation, under the general law of 1848,' <em>(Laws of </em>1848, <em>chap. </em>40,) should be sued with the addition of the officers, as <em>\u201c </em>President, directors,\u201d &amp;c. But it does not appear that this company -was formed under that law; and if it was, that act does not prohibit the adoption and use of a corporate name, like that by which the defendants are sued in this case. (\u00a7 2; <em>and see Ang. and A. on Corp. </em>79, <em>and chap. </em>18.) We are not to presume, on demurrer, that this is a wrong name.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">The complaint does not allege that the goods and chattels _ were <em>sold </em>and delivered at the special instance and request of the defendant; and one ground of demurrer is, that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. But when the sale is stated to have been made directly to, the defendant, the words \u201c sold and delivered \u201d -would seem to imply a contract between the parties. <em>(See Emery </em>agt. <em>Fell, </em>2 <em>T. R. </em>28 ; Buller, J.; <em>Brown </em>agt. <em>Garnier, </em>6 <em>Taunt. </em>389; 2 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>55, <em>n. </em>o.; 1 <em>M. </em>&amp; <em>Gr. </em>266, <em>n. b.; Berry Lernaindes, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>1 <em>Bing. </em>338; 1 <em>Saund. R. </em>264, <em>a. n. a.; Allen </em>agt. Patterson, 3 <em>Seld. </em>479.) And if so, it can hardly be necessary to allege that the goods were sold and delivered at the request of the defendant. <em>(Id.) P</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">I am aware that this has been doubted; and in some editions Mr. Chitty adds, <em>\u201csed qucere. </em>(2 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>55, <em>n.o., 5th Am. ed.; Dumford. </em>agt. <em>Messiter, 5 M. &amp; Sel. </em>446.) And there was a request by the defendant in <em>Allen </em>agt. Patterson, (3 <em>Seld. </em>476.) But where there is a contract for the sale and delivery of goods to the defendant, into which both parties, of course, must have voluntarily entered, and which has been so far executed that the defendant has received the goods, it is not very apparent how it can be necessary to allege that such contract was made at the request of the defendant. I am inclined to think such allegation is not necessary in a count for goods sold and delivered ; though it may be prudent to insert it.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">But the objection that several causes of action have been improperly united in one count, seems to be well taken. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 144, 167; <em>Benedict </em>agt. Seymour, 6 <em>Howard\u2019s Pr. R. </em>298.) There is at'least too much doubt to grant this motion. The common counts may, in fact, be contained in one count, by stating that the defendant -was indebted in a sum large enough to cover all the sums the plaintiff claims to recover; if it be further alleged that, in consideration of such indebtedness, the defendant promised to pay such sum. All may be put into one count, though there be distinct and different considerations, if the indebtedness in one sum, and one promise, be alleged. <em>(Bailey </em>agt. Freeman, 4 <em>John. R. </em>280; <em>Nelson </em>agt. <em>Swan, </em>13 <em>id. </em>483; <em>Rooke </em>agt. <em>Rooke, Cr. Jac. </em>245; <em>Morse </em>agt. Morse, 11 <em>M. </em>&amp; <em>W. </em>831; 2 <em>Saund. R. </em>122, c. <em>n. </em>2 &amp; <em>b.; </em>1 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>301.)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">In the case now under consideration, the pleader intended there should be but one count, and that sets out the sale and delivery of so much wood on the first of March, 1855, at a fixed price, and amounting to a fixed sum; and also the sale and delivery of so many pieces of lumber on the 28th of August, 1854, at a fixed price and sum; and interest is claimed on one, and on part of the other of said sums, from different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>dates; and there is a further allegation that, <em>\u201c </em>on account of said goods and chattels, the defendant is, and remains, indebted \u201d in a'sum consideraba less than the aggregate amount. But no promise to pay that or any other sum is stated. There was not in <em>Allen </em>agt. <em>Patterson, supra; </em>but' in that case there was but one sale and delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Here the whole claim, it is true, is for goods and chattels sold and delivered; but there were two contracts of sale; and each transaction\u2014as to consideration, time, quantity, price, sum of the price and interest thereon\u2014is stated separately, but yet in one count, <em>(Jourdain </em>agt. <em>Johnson, 2 Cr. M. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>564;) <em>Galway </em>agt. <em>Rose, </em>(6 <em>M. </em>&amp; <em>W. </em>291,) goes a great way; but in that case, and also in <em>Bailey </em>agt. <em>Freeman, </em>and <em>Moss </em>agt. <em>James, </em>.above cited, and in <em>Webber </em>agt. <em>Twill, </em>(2 <em>Saund. R. </em>121, <em>a,) </em>there was a promise to pay; and no doubt there was in <em>Nelson </em>agt. <em>Swan, (supra. And see </em>2 <em>Saund. R. </em>121, c <em>note </em>2 &amp; <em>b.) </em>No promise was alleged in <em>Allen </em>agt. <em>Patterson, </em>but this point did not arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">At any rate, if there should be no amendment of the complaint, this question had better be disposed of by a direct adjudication upon the demurrer; which is a much better way of trying the validity of pleadings, where there is any room for doubt, than by an application to a judge for judgment because of frivolousness. It should be a strong case to authorize an interference in this summary manner. <em>(Van Santf. Pl. </em>433; <em>Gra. Pr. </em>759 ; 1 <em>Whitt. Pr. </em>468.)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
