All of those questions the superior court, which made the order, can determine for itself, whenever that question shall arise before that tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">It is sufficient for all the purposes of this motion to say, that that court possesses ample power, by process of attachment, to enforce its own orders. That remedy is open to the relator here, provided the order made by the superior court is one which the mayor was bound to obey. In such case the remedy of the relator \"is simple, direct, and effective \u00bf and being so, the most proper form in which to enforce the rights of the applicant, is the one in which his proceedings have been initiated. The powers of another tribunal should not be invoked, unless-the court having original jurisdiction should, from want of proper authority, <em>be </em>unable to enforce its own orders or decrees. Even if this order is to be regarded as the order of the \u25a0judge at chambers, and not that of the superior court, yet by ^ 802 of the Code, the judge is vested with full and ample authority to enforce obedience, if obedience is the duty of the mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">If, on the other hand, as the respondent contends, the order itself is not binding\u2014a question I leave to be solved by the* superior court\u2014then, manifestly, no writ of mandamus should issue from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">I base a denial of the motion upon the single ground,, that the order, if binding upon the mayor, can be promptly enforced1 by the court, or judge by whom it was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">The motion must be denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
