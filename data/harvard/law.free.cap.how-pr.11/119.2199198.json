Appeal having been taken to the general term, and the suit revived by the executors of Thursby, but no stay of proceedings. The defendants alleged that the sheriff of New-York had levied upon property of Thursby sufficient to satisfy the judgment, and that the sheriff of Kings pretended he had made a levy upon property sufficient to satisfy the debt. That the defendants had filed their complaint in this court for a review of the finding of the referees, upon which the judgment was entered, on the ground of an accidental omission on the part of Thursby to prove before them certain alleged bad bebts, amounting to about $10,000; and in that suit they had prayed for an injunction against the enforcement of the judgment; and that the - sheriff of Kings county had advertised the real estate of John Thursby for sale on the 5th of November, and his personal estate on the 22d of October, 1853.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-6\">The plaintiff denied the allegation as to bad debts, and alleged that an order for a stay of proceedings of the sheriff of New-York had once been obtained by default; and, before the stay was vacated, John Thursby had re-possessed himself of the property levied upon by the sheriff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-7\">N.
