Suydam, &amp;c. agt. Charles Suydam and others.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b526-9\">Under \u00a7\u00a7 390 and 391 of the Code, a <em>party </em>to the suit may, <em>after issue joined, </em>be called and examined either, 1st. At the trial; or, 2d. Out of court, on giving five days\u2019 notice to attend and be examined; or, 3d. Under an <em>order </em>that he attend in less than five days and be examined.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b526-10\">He may also be examined <em>conditionally, </em>upon an order m^de for that purpose, (2 JR. S. 390, 391,) or on <em>commission, </em>just when any third person might be so examined, and not otherwise.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b526-11\">Whether a party, as a <em>married woman, </em>could be so <em>examined\u2014quere ?</em></headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-12\"><em>New- York Special </em>Term,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AP9\">Nov., 1855.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-13\">The plaintiff seeks to examine one of the'defendants, on five days\u2019 notice, under \u00a7 391 of the Code. The cause is not at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>issue. Tjhe party sought to he examined resides in the state, and is not about to depart\u2014nor is she sick or infirm.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-5\">Larocque &amp; Barlow, <em>for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-6\">--5 <em>for defendants.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b527-7\">Cowles, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ASG\">She objects that, before issue joined, she cannot be required to attend for examination. Whether she is right in this objection depends upon the construction to be given to \u00a7\u00a7 390 and 391 of the Code. .</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">By \u00a7 390, a party to a suit may be examined at the instance of the adverse party, in the same way and under the same circumstances that permits any third person to be so examined. That is, he may be called <em>at the trial. </em>He may be examined <em>before </em>or <em>after issue, conditionally; </em>in other words, <em>de bene, </em>under 2 <em>R. S. </em>391, 392, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, if sick or infirm, or about to depart from the state. And he may also be examined on commission, just as any third person may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Section 390 is somewhat modified by \u00a7 391, in this particular. If the adverse party so desires, the opposite party may be required on five days\u2019 notice\u2014or even on shorter notice, by order to attend and be examined, instead of attending <em>at the trial, </em>and being there used as a witness. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">This examination of the witness, under the five days\u2019 notice, is a mere substitute for the examination <em>at the </em>trial, and can, therefore, be only taken <em>after issue joined. </em>With the single exception, that after issue joined, a party may be called, on this five days\u2019 notice, to submit to an examination to be read on the trial, or may be actually called to the stand, <em>at the trial, </em>at the option of the adverse party, there is no distinction between the time and manner of examining a party to <em>the </em>suit and any third person as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">In order to he clearly understood, it may be stated thus:\u2014 Under \u00a7\u00a7 390 and 391 of the Code, a party to the suit may, <em>after issue joined, </em>be called and examined, either,</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">1st. At the trial; or,</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>2d. Out of court, on giving him five days\u2019 notice, to attend and be examined ; or,</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">3d. Under an order that he attend in less than five days, to be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">He may also be examined <em>conditionally, </em>upon an' order made for that purpose, just when any third \"person might be so examined under 2 <em>R. S. </em>390, 391; and he may also be examined on commission, just when any third party might be so examined, and not otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">In this case, issue not having been joined, the party called cannot be required to attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Whether, as a married woman, she could be examined in the mode proposed, I will not now discuss, as the plaintiff\u2019s motion, for the reas'ons above given, must be denied</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">This seems right.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Wm. Mitchell.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
