These proceedings are a substitute for the creditor\u2019s bill, and are merely auxiliary to the ordinary legal method of enforcing the satisfaction of a judgment. To be sure, the Code, like the former law, contemplates that the ordinary remedy should be exhausted, before a recourse shall be had, in the first instance, to the supplemental remedy, and for this reason requires that an execution shall be returned unsatisfied, or that, after an execution has been issued, the defendant has property, which he unjustly refuses to apply towards the satisfaction of the judgment. But, this is not inconsistent with the right, after supplementary proceedings are commenced, also to issue another execution, if the judgment can be more readily or effectually satisfied in this way.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">After filing a creditor\u2019s bill under the old system, the complainant might have taken out a new execution upon his judgment, and levy upon the property of the defendant; and should such property be insufficient to satisfy his judgment, he would not have been compelled to elect either to dismiss his bill, or abandon his execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In the case of <em>Salt </em>agt. Lawson, decided March 30, 1852, (4 <em>Sand. S. C. R. </em>718,) it was held, in the superior court, that these rules of the court of chancery were as applicable to the examination of a debtor under the Code, as to the proceeding by a creditor\u2019s bill. In this view I am inclined to concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Motion to discharge order denied without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
