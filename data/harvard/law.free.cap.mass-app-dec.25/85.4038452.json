One report raises a procedural issue, wherein the plaintiff (who has a finding) claims to be aggrieved by alleged error of the trial court in refusing to dismiss the defendant\u2019s claim for report and draft report, on the grounds that the defendant failed to comply with Rule 28 of the District Courts (1952), relating to the requirements of said rule as to the time of filing a draft report with the clerk\u2019s office with reference to the time of sending notice and copy thereof to opposing counsel and the trial judge. The other report raises a substantive issue wherein the defendant claims to be aggrieved by alleged error of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>judge in the disposition of the requests for rulings and the subsidiary findings and the finding in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We shall first .consider the procedural question, for in the event that the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the defendant failed to comply with Rule 28 is sustained, then the defendant\u2019s claim for report and draft report are not properly on the files of the court and we do not reach the questions raised by the defendant. See <em>Wind Innersole </em>&amp; <em>Counter Co., Inc. v. Gelick, </em>317 Mass. 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The report relating to the procedural issue sets forth the following sequence of events. At the trial the defendant duly filed requests for rulings, and after notice of a finding for the plaintiff, on <em>November </em>28, 1961, the defendant duly filed a claim for a report. On <em>December </em>7, 1961, at 6:00 p.m. the defendant mailed from Boston the original draft report to the .clerk\u2019s office at Dedham, and on the same day a few moments later, he mailed a copy of his draft report to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel at Boston, and a copy to the trial judge. The draft report to the clerk\u2019s office was placed in a mail box \u201cwith post office schedules for regular pick-up twenty-four hours a day.\u201d The copies mailed to counsel and to the judge were simultaneously placed in a mail box \u201cwith post office schedules for no pickups after 5:15 p.m.\u201d The original draft report was received and filed with the clerk\u2019s office in Dedham on <em>December </em>8, 1961, at 9:00 a.m. The trial judge received his copy sometime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>after 1:00 p.m. of the same day, with the post mark on this envelope, <em>\u201cDec. </em>8, 1961, 1:00 p.m.\u201d There was no direct evidence when the plaintiff\u2019s counsel received his copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the defendant\u2019s draft report and at the hearing on said motion the defendant filed the following request for ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\"That if the court finds that the original draft report was filed (with the clerk\u2019s office) before the plaintiff\u2019s attorney actually received the copy, the plaintiff\u2019s motion must be dismissed as a matter of law . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The court granted the defendant\u2019s request and denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss, whereupon the plaintiff duly claimed a report and filed a draft report on the court\u2019s dismissal of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The pertinent provisions of Rule 28 are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">\"A copy of such draft report shall be delivered or mailed postpaid by the party requesting the report to the trial Justice and to the adverse party before the close of the next business day after such filing,\u201d (of the draft report).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">The requirements of this Rule, as in the statute and the rules governing a bill of exceptions, are judged with strictness, and unless there has been literal compliance, the right to appellate review is lost. <em>Famigletti v. Neviackas, </em>324 Mass. 70; <em>Saunders v. Shoe Lace Co., Ltd., </em>293 Mass. 265; <em>Check</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number><em>away v. Cashman Bros. Co., </em>305 Mass. 470. An analysis of the decisions on this point compels the conclusion that the draft report must be filed with (received by) the clerk of court before the copy is received by opposing counsel. This may be accomplished, as the rule states, by delivering the same personally or by mailing postpaid. If the party seeks to deliver through the post office and is willing to take the chance that it (copy) will actually reach the opposing party or his counsel after the report has reached the clerk\u2019s office, there is compliance, if, in fact, the sequence set out in the rule actually occurs. As bearing on this sequence, the Court said, in the <em>Checkaway </em>case, (cited supra) . . When the notice was mailed it did not speak the truth for the report has not been filed, but it spoke the truth at the time of delivery . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">From the facts in the instant case (they are not controverted) the trial justice rightly determined that the clerk\u2019s office actually received the draft report before the copy was received by the judge, and while there was no direct evidence as to when the plaintiff\u2019s counsel received his copy, the court .could properly infer from the sequence of the respective mailings that the same was true as to the receipt of the opposing counsel\u2019s copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We conclude that the court\u2019s ruling was correct. The defendant\u2019s draft report is, therefore, properly on the files of the court, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>we now proceed to the defendant\u2019s claim of error on the trial of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In this action of contract the plaintiff seeks to recover for \u201cmoney had and received by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s use.\u201d The following is a summary of the evidence. After a two week trial period, on May 1, 1960, the plaintiff employed the defendant as a \u201clead man\u201d to .canvas home owners to install the plaintiff\u2019s products, \u201cmaterials for exteriors of houses.\u201d The \u201cleads\u201d would be turned over by the plaintiff to \u201ca closer\u201d, and upon the closing of the sale, the defendant would be entitled to a commission of ten percent of the total contract price. The defendant was to work on a \u201cdrawing account against commissions,\u201d of $100.00 per week, to be advanced by the plaintiff; that all other \u201clead men\u201d worked under the same arrangement; that the defendant did not \u201cexpressly agree\u201d to repay any of the advances except from the commissions earned; that the plaintiff did not \u201cconsider\u201d the amounts advanced to the defendant as a salary but \u201cconsidered\u201d the amounts as drawn against commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The evidence further indicates that each week the defendant was shown a written account kept by the plaintiff, which indicated how the advances corresponded to the commissions to that point; that at these weekly meetings the defendant was \u201csilent\u201d as to the accounting and he did not deny \u201cowing\u201d the plaintiff the difference. The defendant was credited with total sales of $21,480.00, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>he received from the plaintiff the sum of $3,458.00, leaving a deficiency of $1,310.00, which is the amount of this suit; that after the termination of the employment in February, 1961, the plaintiff and the defendant met, and the defendant stated \u201che appreciated getting $100.00 per week and would make it up later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The parties duly filed requests for rulings among which and pertinent to the issues are the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\n<em>Plaintiff's Requests:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">1. \u201cThat if the court finds that the plaintiff paid to the defendant a draw against commission earned and not a salary then the defendant owes the plaintiff the sum of money stated in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">2. \u201cThat money advanced or loaned is due on demand where there is no stipulated date of payment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">3. \u201cThat a finding for the plaintiff is warranted upon all the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Requests:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">4. \u201cThat upon all the evidence the court must find for the defendant as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-12\">5. \u201cThat the plaintiff has the burden of proof by a fair preponderance of the evidence that a special agreement was entered by the parties at the time of the employment that any overdrawn commissions be paid from a source other than the commissions earned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-13\">The court denied the defendant\u2019s requests, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u201callowed\u201d all the plaintiff\u2019s requests, and found the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">\u201cI find that the defendant had a drawing account against commissions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">That the plaintiff made weekly advancements to the defendant; that such advancements were in the nature of loan to be repaid the plaintiff to the amount in excess of commissions earned at time defendant ceased to be in the employ of the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The court found for the plaintiff on the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The question underlying this case rests upon a determination of the nature of the understanding of the parties as to the obligation of the defendant with respect to the repayment of any deficiencies between advances and .commissions. Were these advances made with the understanding that the plaintiff was to look alone to the commissions for their repayment, or were they to be paid back by the defendant in any event? See, <em>Luce v. Consolidated Ubero Plantations Co., </em>195 Mass. 64. The trial court found that the defendant was obligated to repay them as a loan, and the issue before us is whether on the evidence the justice was warranted in so finding, and whether there was any error in his disposition of the requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">It is our opinion that there was ample evidence to warrant the finding, and that there was no error in the disposition of the requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The evidence that the defendant did not \u201cexpressly agree\u201d to repay . . ., and that the plaintiff did not \u201cconsider\u201d the amounts advanced to the defendant as a salary leads us to the conclusion that there was no express agreement at the time of the employment as to repayment. Both parties used the words \u201cadvances against commissions\u201d (this is generally called a drawing account). See <em>Boyer v. Bowles, </em>310 Mass. 134, and in our opinion, these words do not, <em>per se, </em>imply the source of funds to repay any deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">It is settled in the law of contracts that where there is no express agreement governing a term or a condition of an agreement, or where the intent of the parties appears doubtful, the subsequent course of dealing and conduct of the parties may be considered in determining whether there is such implication as is tantamount to an express agreement. <em>Boyer v. Bowles, </em>cited supra. In the instant case there was no meeting of the minds on this issue at the time of the hiring, and if the matter rested there, the defendant would not be required to repay at all events. But the matter did not rest there. The subsequent conduct of the parties, to wit: weekly meetings at which accountings were had, with the defendant silent and not denying owing the plaintiff the difference, clearly justifies the conclusion that whatever ambiguity existed at the time of the hiring, the defendant knew later (within a week) that the plaintiff expected repayment, as if a loan. If the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>fendant felt this was not his \u201cunderstanding\u201d or \u201cagreement\u201d he could then terminate the employment without any liability to repay. This he did not do. He continued accepting advances after he knew that he was expected to repay, and in fact, according to the testimony of the plaintiff, the defendant, at a meeting after his employment terminated, promised to repay.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b100-8\">Ritvo, Gordon &amp; Rosenberg, of Boston, for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b100-9\">Richard A. Hubbard for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In view of the foregoing we conclude that the subsidiary findings and the ultimate findings were warranted, and as such they are final and must stand. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7108; <em>Sohon v. Odd Fellows Building Association, </em>255 Mass. 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Defendant\u2019s request for ruling numbered 5, was properly denied because it did not state a correct proposition of law, since the obligation to repay, as was found in this case, may be implied from the conduct of the parties after the employment began. The disposition of the other requests was proper, and we see no occasion to deal with them separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Reports Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
