That he the said David Combs attained the age of twenty-one years, but died before he arrived at the age of twenty-eight years, and without heirs of his body, he never having been married.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-7\">That after he arrived at the age of twenty-one years, and before the age of twenty-eight years; he made and executed his last will and testament, dated the 31st December, 1794, in due form of law, to pass real estate, and among other things therein, willed and devised as follows : \u201c Secondly, I give and bequeath to my beloved father Joseph Combs, all my estate both in lands and movables; likewise my part of a pew in the new meeting house, during the term of his natural life; and after the decease of my said father Joseph Combs, it is my will and desire that the whole of my estate, both real and personal, be equally divided among the children of Doctor James English, them, their heirs and assigns forever.\u201d (Pro <em>ut </em>said will.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-8\">That upon the death of said David Combs, in the year 1794, his father Joseph Combs went into possession, and continued in possession up to bis death, on the day of 1836. That after the death of said Joseph Combs, the executors of James English, dec. the second, (who was one of the children of Doctor James English, named in the will of David Combs,) obtained a decree in Chancery, for the sale of the real estate of James English second, dec., to carry into effect the will of the said James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>English, dec. That the executors of said James English, dec. exposed to public sale, all the right, title and interest of said James English second, dec. in the farm in controversy, as a portion of the real estate of James English, dec. the second. And the same was struck off to the lessor of the plaintiff, and a deed from the executors duly made therefor, agreeably to law. (Pro <em>ut </em>same.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-5\">That said James English second, dec., one of the children of Doctor James English, was living at the date of the will of David Combs, and at his death ; but died during the lifetime of Joseph Combs, on the 7th day of May, 1834, leaving one child, who died an infant prior to the sale to the lessor of the plaintiff, and the death of said Joseph Combs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-6\">It is further admitted by the parties, that Doctor James English the first, named in the will, after the death of David Combs, to wit, on the 13th day of July, 1811, did obtain for a valuable consideration, from William Stoney and Elizabeth his wife, formerly Elizabeth Hendricks, the grand-daughter named in the will of David English, dec. the first, a release to, him, of all their rights and interest in the premises in <em>controversy\u2014{pro ut </em>the same)\u2014after the said Elizabeth had come of age and had lawful heirs of her body.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\">That the said Doctor James English the first, died leaving seven children, (some of whom were born after David Combs\u2019 death,) his heirs at law, to wit: David, John, Hannah, Mary, wife of Thomas Hobert, and Rebecca, wife of Stillman E.

We claim under the will of David English, and Elizabeth Hendricks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-6\">Second. If our title under the will of David English is not good; then we claim under the will of David Combs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-7\">First. Under David English\u2019s will. He died seized\u2014this will dated 1778, provides as follows, viz: <em>(pro </em>withe will and codicil.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-8\">David Combs entered under the will and died after he was 21, and before he had heirs of his body. Elizabeth Hendricks and husband, after his death, and after she attained the age of 21, and had heirs of her body, conveyed to Jas. English, 1st. He died leaving the defendants, and James English, 2d. his heirs at law. Jas. English seconds, executors, under order of Chancery, sold to plaintiff\u2014plaintiff therefore stands in the place of one of the children of J. English, 1st. and if he had title, we have; and if E. Hendricks had title, Dr. English first, had title. The first question then is, what title Elizabeth Hendricks took under the will of Dr. English.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-10\">The will gives D. Combs a fee simple with executory devise, if he lived to 21 and had lawful issue of his body, then an indefeasible estate in fee simple; but if he died before 21, or had lawful issue, then to Elizabeth Hendricks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-11\">He did die after 21, and before, issue\u2014the devise over, then took effect, and as Elizabeth Hendricks lived to 21 and had issue, she had indefeasible estate in fee simple.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-12\">Second. But if the Court should be of a different opinion and that the word \u201c or \u201d in the will of David English, meant <em>\u201c </em>and,\u201d then we claim under the will of D. Combs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-13\">The provisions in this will are <em>(pro ut </em>the same.) David Combs died before 28. Joseph Combs entered under will, and lived till 183-. Dr. Jas. English the 2d, one of the children of Dr. English 1st, was living at the death of D. C. and died in life time of Jos. Combs, the tenant for life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-14\">The question is, what estate Dr. E. 2d took u-nder the will of D. Combs. For if he had any estate, then the plaintiff holding as purchaser under him, is entitled to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-15\">What estate then did Dr. English take under will of D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Combs? IIg was one of the children of 1). E. 1st, living <em>ai </em>the time of the death of D. C. and dead before Jos. Combs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-4\">The defendants will not contend that D. C. could not devise by reason of the clause in I). E.\u2019s will, restraining him from selling before 28.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-5\">First. Because it would strike their title from under them, as well as from under us.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-6\">Second. This only restrains him from aliening in his life time, not from devising.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-7\">Third. If it did, the clause is void, as contrary to the nature of the estate, 4 <em>Kent, </em>131.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-8\">What estate then passed by the will of 13. C. to the children of 13r. Joseph English, the first?</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-9\">We say that it was a vested remainder in those children of Dr. J. E. who were living at tlie death of the testator, subject to be opened to let in children born before the death of Jos. Combs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-10\">Defendants say it was a contingent remainder, not vested till the death of Joseph Combs, and then only in those then living.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-11\">It is a remainder of some kind, 4 <em>Kent. </em>203.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-12\">This is a devise of lands, not a bequest of personal estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-13\">It is a vested remainder. At the death of the testator, he had a right to make it either vested or contingent as he saw fit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-14\">Whether it was vested or contingent therefore, must depend upon his intention as evidenced by his will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-15\">A vested remainder is a present right of future enjoyment, 4 <em>Kent, </em>202.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-16\">The court will construe the interest to be a vested remainder, unless the contrary clearly appears, 4 <em>Kent, </em>203; and again, they will vest it at the earliest opportunity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-17\">Now what is the exact phraseology of this will ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-18\">What is the natural import of the language of the will ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-19\">It goes to the children, in the present tense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-20\">The future time is descriptive of the estate conveyed, not of the objects to whom given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-21\">Suppose the language had been, \u201c I give it ,to A for life, remainder to C\u2019s children.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-22\">It is a present gift to persons in esse.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-23\">The natural language, if it was intended to be contingent, would have been \u201c then living,\u201d which are not there.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Again, if it was intended to be contingent, then contingent as to all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-5\">If then they all died, the devise failed when it purports to convey the whole, and no devise over.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-6\">Again, it says, <em>\u201c </em>equally to be divided between them share and share alike \u201d\u2014now if contingent, they all might die, or one might die, how then divide ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-7\">If this had been to them by name, it would undoubtedly have vested, for it would be the technical language of a vested remainder, after estate for life, 2 <em>John. </em>288.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-8\">But the difference, say our opponents, is, if the children are dead, they don't answer the description\u2014neither do they where they are named, and die.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-9\">The testator did not mention their names, because he contemplated future born children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-10\">The only difference between the two forms of expression, is, the general devise to children, lets in those born after the death of the testator, and before the tenant for life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-11\">1 <em>Rop.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atr\">The word <em>\u201c </em>or <em>\u201d </em>in the will and in the codicil of David English, must be understood to mean <em>\u201c </em>and,\u201d in order to carry out the intention of the testator. He certainly did not mean, that if his grandson, the primary object of his bounty, died before he was 21 years of age, leaving lawful issue, the devise over should take effect. If the testator used the word \u201c or \u201d intelligently, then he intended that if his grandson died before he attained the age of 21, though he had lawful issue, then he should take only a life estate ; or if he lived to be 21, and died at last without such issue, then the devise over should take effect. But this could not have been his meaning. The devise in the will is plainly to David Combs in fee; then follows the devise over, \u201c if my grand-son happens to die before he arrives at the age of 21 years, or (happens not) \u201c to leave heirs of his body lawfully begotten,\u201d then to his grand-daughter Elizabeth Hendricks and her heirs forever. Thus shewing an intention, in the first place to give the property to his grand-son in fee; and secondly in the event of his dying under age, and without issue, then to his grand-daughter, in fee. By the codicil, the testator annexes a similar limitation to this latter devise,'and proyides, that in case the property comes to his grand-daughter, and she should die under age, <em>or </em>without lawful issue (undoubtedly meaning as before, <em>and </em>without lawful issue) to David English son of David English, late of Englishtown, deceased, and David English, son of Jonathan English, deceased, their heirs and assigns forever.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>The devise to David Combs, then, could not fail, unless he not only died without lawful issue, but also under the age of 21 years. Both events did not happen. He lived until he was 21 years of age. He took then, upon the authority of <em>Den </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>2 <em>South. </em>413, and the cases there cited, not an estate tail, but a fee simple, with a limitation over to Elizabeth Hendricks, by way of executory devise. Bat as the event upon which the devise over, was to take effect, never did happen, and never could, after the devisee attained the age of 21 years, the estate, then became absolute in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">If therefore, the lessor of the plaintiff has title to any portion of the premises in question, it must be under the will of David Combs. He devised all his estate, real and personal, to his father Joseph Combs, for the term of his natural life, and then over, in the following words, viz: \u201c after the decease of my father, it is my will that the whole of my estate, real and personal be equally divided among the children of Dr. James English, them, their heirs and assigns forever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Dr. J. English, at the date of D. Combs\u2019 will, had several children, who are named in the case; among the rest, one, named James English 2d. This son was living when D. Combs died, but died during the life time of Joseph Combs the tenant for life, leaving one child, who died an infant, prior to the acquisition of the title set up by the lessor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Upon the death of James English 2d, (which happened on the 7th of May, 1834) his executor sold, under a decree in chancery for the, better execution of his will, all his title and interest in the premises in question, as a part of his real estate. The lessor of the plaintiff became the purchaser at that sale, and hence claims title to some portion of the premises in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Whether Jas. E. 2d, had any interest in the premises, depends upon the question whether the remainder, under the will of David Combs, was a <em>vested </em>or <em>contingent </em>remainder. If contingent only, the lessor of the plaintiff, acquired nothing by his purchase: but if the remainder was a <em>vested </em>one, then he has title to the share of Jas. E. 2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Upon this point there is in my opinion, no room to doubt. The remainder vested immediately upon the death of the testator, in the children of Janies English the 1st, who were then living and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>opened as occasion required, to take in such as were born after-wards and previous to the death of the tenant for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Provost et al. </em>4 <em>Johns. </em>61, the case was much stronger in favor of contingencies; and yet Van Ness, Kent, Thompson and Yates, Justices, against Spencer, Justice, held it to be a vested remainder. In that case, the words, were \u201c Immediately after her death, I give the same unto and among all and every such child and children, as the said Christiana <em>shall have lawfully </em>begotten at the time of her death, in fee simple, to be equally divided, &amp;c.\u201d The words upon which the dissent of Spencer, Justice, was based, (and I am inclined to think with good reason,) were, \u201c <em>shall have </em>lawfully begotten, at the time of her death.\u201d Thus pointing to a class of persons, who might be in existence upon the happening of a certain event\u2014It was not given to Christiana\u2019s children; but to such child or children as <em>should have </em>been begotten by her at the time of her death. It was equivalent (perhaps) to saying, \u201c to such child or children as she might have <em>living </em>at the time of her death.\u201d The time of her death, seems to have been named as the period, when the persons, who were to take, should be ascertained ; for the testator could not have intended, by the use of these words, any thing so absurd, as to exclude children begotten by her, after her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">But in this case, there are no words creating any such doubt, or susceptible of any such criticism. They are, \u201c and after the decease of my father, to be equally divided among the <em>children </em>of Dr. James English, &amp;c.\u201d \u25a0 This is equivalent to saying, \u201c I give the land to my father and to the children of Dr. James E.; my father to have it during his life, and after his death, to be divided among the children of Dr. J. English.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The cases cited by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, I think fully sustain him; at least such of them as I have examined. While those cited on the part of the defendants, although they may be good law, have no application, in my opinion, to case under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Ford, J., and White, J. concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Dayton, J. and Neviits, J. gave no opinion, having been of counsel in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">\n<em>Judgment for plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">Cited in <em>Den, Hopper v. Demurest, </em>1 <em>Zab. </em>539; <em>Den, Holcomb </em>v. <em>Lake, </em>4 <em>Zab. </em>688; <em>Den, Holcomb </em>v. <em>Lake, </em>1 <em>Dutch </em>611; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Rake, </em>2 <em>Dutch. </em>591.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
