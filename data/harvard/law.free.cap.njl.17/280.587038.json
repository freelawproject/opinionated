If our title under the will of David English is not good; then we claim under the will of David Combs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-6\">First. Under David English\u2019s will. He died seized \u2014 this will dated 1778, provides as follows, viz : <em>(pro ut </em>the will and codicil.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-7\">David Combs entered under the will and died after he was 21, and before he had heirs of his body. Elizabeth Hendricks and husband, after his death, and after she attained the age of 21, and had heirs of her body, conveyed to Jas. English, 1st. He died leaving the defendants, and James English, 2d. his heirs at law. Jas. English seconds, executors, under order of Chancery, sold to plaintiff \u2014 plaintiff therefore stands in the place of one of the children of J. English, 1st. and if he had title, we have; and if E. Hendricks had title, Dr. English first, had title. The first question then is, what title Elizabeth Hendricks took under the will of Dr. English.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-9\">The will gives D. Combs a fee simple with executory devise; if he lived to 21 and had lawful issue of his body, then an indefeasible estate in fee simple ; but if he died before 21, or had lawful issue, then to Elizabeth Hendricks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-10\">He did die after 21, and before issue \u2014 the devise over, then took effect, and as Elizabeth Hendricks lived to 21 and had issue, she liad indefeasible estate in fee simple.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-11\">Second. But if the Court should be of a different opinion and that the word '&gt;\u2018 or\u201d in the will of David English, meant \u201cand,\u201d then we claim under the will of D. Combs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-12\">The provisions in this will are <em>(pro tit </em>the same.) David Combs died before 28. Joseph Combs entered under will, and lived till 183-. Dr. Jas. English the 2d, one of the children of Dr. English 1st, was living at the death of D. C. and died in life time of Jos. Combs, the tenant for life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-13\">The question is, what estate Dr. E. 2d took under the will of D, Combs. For if he had any estate, then plaintiff holding as purchaser under him, is entitled to recovei\u2019.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-14\">What estate then did Dr. English take under will of D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Combs ? He was one of the children of D. E. 1st, living at the time of the death of D. C. and dead before Jos. Combs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-4\">The defendants will not contend that D. C. could not devise by reason of the clause in D. E.\u2019s will, restraining him from selling before 28.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-5\">First. Because it would strike their title from under them, as well as from under us.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-6\">Second. This only restrains him from aliening in his life time, not from devising.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\">Third. If it did, the clause is void, as contrary to the nature of the estate, 4 <em>Kent, </em>131.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-8\">What estate then passed by the will of D. C. to the children of Dr. Joseph English, first ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-9\">We say that it was a vested remainder in those children of Dr. J. E. who were living at the death of the testator, subject to he opened to let in children born before the death of Jos. Combs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-10\">Defendants say it was a contingent remainder, not vested till the death of Joseph Combs, and then only in those then living.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-11\">It is a remainder of some kind, 4 <em>Kent, </em>203.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-12\">This is a devise of lands, not a bequest of personal estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-13\">It is a vested remainder. At the death of the testator, he had a right to make it either vested or contingent as he saw fit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-14\">Whether it was vested or contingent therefore, must depend upon his intention as evidenced by his will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-15\">A vested remainder is a present right of future enjoyment, 4 <em>Kent, </em>202.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-16\">The court will construe the interest to be a vested remainder, unless the contrary clearly appears, 4 <em>Kent, </em>203; and again, they will vest it at the earliest opportunity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-17\">Now what is the exact phraseology of this will ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-18\">What is the natural import of the language of the will ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-19\">It goes to the children, in the present tease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-20\">The future time is descriptive of the estate conveyed, not of the objects to whom given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-21\">Suppose the language had been, \u201cI give it to A for life, remainder to C\u2019s children.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-22\">It is a present gift to persons in <em>esse.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-23\">The natural language, if it was intended to be contingent, would have been \u201cthen living,\u201d which are not there.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Again, if it was intended to be contingent, then contingent as to all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-4\">If then they all died, the devise failed when it purports to convey the whole, and no devise over.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-5\">Again, it says, \u201cequally to be divided between them share and share alike\u201d \u2014 now if contingent, they all might die, or one might die, how then divide ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-6\">If this had been to them byname, it would undoubtedly have vested, for it would be the technical language of a vested remainder, after estate for life, 2 <em>John. </em>288.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-7\">But the difference, say our opponents, is, if the <em>children are </em>dead, they dont answer the description \u2014 neither do they where they are named, and die.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-8\">The testator did not mention their names, because he contemplated future born children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-9\">The only difference between the two forms of expression, is, the general devise to children, lets in those born after the death of the testator, and before the tenant for life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-10\">1 <em>Rop.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AI2\">The word \u201cor\u201d in the will and in the codicil of David English, must be understood to mean \u201cand,\u201d in order to carry out the intention the testator. He certainly did not mean, that if his grandson, the primary object of his bounty, died before he was <em>21 </em>years of age, leaving lawful issue, the devise over should take effect. If the testator used the word \u2018or*intelligently,then he intended that if his grandson died before lie attained the age of <em>21, </em>though he had lawful issue, then he should take only a life estate; or if he lived to be <em>21, </em>and died at last without such issue,'then the devise over should take effect. But this could not have been his meaning. The devise in the will is plainly to David Combs in fee <em>; </em>then follows the devise over, \u201cif my grand-son happens to die before he arrives at the age of <em>21 </em>years, or (happens not) \u201cto leave heirs of his body lawfully begotten,\u201d then to his gra,n&amp;-daughtcr Elizabeth Hendricks and her heirs forever. Thus shewing an intention, in the first place to give the property to his grandson in fee; and secondly in the event of his dying under age, and without issue, then to his grand-daughter, in fee. By the codicil, the testator annexes a similar limitation to this latter devise, and provides, that in case the property comes to his grand-daughter, and she should die under age, <em>or </em>without lawful issue (undoubtedly meaning as before, <em>and </em>without lawful issue) to David English son of David English, late of Englishtown, deceased, and David English, son of Jonathan English, deceased, their heirs and assigns forever.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>The devise to David Combs, then, could not fail, unless he not only died without lawful issue, but also under the age of 21 years. Both events did not happen. He lived until lie was 21 years of age. lie took then, upon the authority of <em>Den v. Taylor, </em>2 <em>South. </em>413, and the cases there cited, not an estate tail, but a fee simple, with a limitation.over to Elizabeth Hendricks, by way of executory devise. But as the event upon which the devise over, was to take effect, never did happen, and never could, after the devisee attained the age of 21 years, the estate, then became absolute in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">If therefore, the lessor of .the plaintiff has title to any portion of the promises in question, it must be under the will of David Combs. He devised all bis estate, real and personal, to his father Joseph Combs, for the term of his natural life, and then over, in the following words, viz : \u201cafter the decease of my father, it is my will that the whole of my estate, real and personal be equally divided among the children of Dr. James English, them, their heirs and assigns forever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Dr. J. English, at the date of D. Combs\u2019 will, had several children, who arc named in the <em>case; </em>among the rest, one, named James English 2d. This son was living when D. Combs died, but died during the life time of Joseph Combs the tenant for life, leaving one child, who died an infant, prior to the acquisition of the title set up by the lessor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Upon the death of James English 2d, (which happened on the 7th of May, 1834) his executor sold, under a decree in chancery for the better execution of his will, all his title and interest in the premises in question, as a part of his real estate. The lessor of the plaintiff became the purchaser a,t that sale, and hence claims title to some portion of the premises in .question.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Whether Jas. E. 2d, had any interest in the premises, depends upon the question whether the remainder, under the will of David Combs, was a <em>vested </em>or <em>contingent </em>remainder. If contingent only, the lessor of the plaintiff, acquired nothing by his purchase: but if the remainder was a <em>vested </em>one, then he has title to the share of Jas. E. 2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Upon this point, there is in my opinion, no room to doubt. The remainder vested immediately upon the death of the testator, in \u25a0the children of James English the 1st, who were then living an/J <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>opened as occasion required, to take in such as tv ere born after-wards and previous to the death of the tenant for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In <em>Doe v. Provoost et al. 4 Johns. </em>61, the case was much stronger in favour of contingencies; and yet Yan Ness, Kent, Thompson and Yates, Justices, against Spencer, Justice, held it to be a vested remainder. In that case, the words, were ^Immediately after her death, I give the same unto and among all and every such child and children,as the said Christiana <em>shall have </em>lawful<em>ly </em>begotten at the time of her death, in fee simple, to be equally divided, &amp;c.\u201d The words npon which the dissent of Spencer, Justice, was based, (and I am inclined to think with good reason,) were, <em>\u201cshall have </em>lawfully begotten, at the time of her death.\u201d Thus pointing to a class <em>of </em>persons, who might be in existence upon the happening of a certain event. \u2014 It was not given to Christiana\u2019s children; but to such child or children as <em>should have </em>been begotten by her at the time of her death. It was equivalent (perhaps) to saying, \u201cto such child or children as she might have <em>living </em>at the time of her death. The time of her death, seems to have been named as the period, wdien the persons, who were to take, should be ascertained; for the testator could not have intended, by the use of these words, any thing so absurd, as to exclude children begotten by her, after her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">But in this case, there are no words creating any such doubt, or susceptible of any such criticism. They are, \u201cand after the decease of my father, to be equally divided among the <em>children </em>of Dr. James English, &amp;c.\u201d This is equivalent .to saying, \u201cI give the land to my father and to the children of Dr. James E.; my father to have it during his life, and after his death, to be divided among the children of Dr. J. English.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The cases cited by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, I think fully sustain him ; at least such of them as I have examined. While those cited on the part of the defendants, although they may be good law, have no application, in my opinion, to case under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Ford, J., and White, J. concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Daxton, J. and Nevitjs, J. gave no opinion, having been of counsel in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">\n<em>Judgment for Plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
