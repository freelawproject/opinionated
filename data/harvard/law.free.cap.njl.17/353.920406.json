B. Chetwood, pro se ipso,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeH\">moved to dismiss the writ of Error in this case, (which he alleged, had been sued out for delay,) on the ground, that the same had not been returned under the hand and seal of the Judge of the Circuit Court; but only under the seal of the court, annexed to the usual certificate of the clerk, that, the transcript sent up, with the writ, was a true copy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-12\">Mr. <em>Whitehead, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUD\">insisted that upon recurring to the files of the court, it would be found, that the practice had been both ways. Sometimes the Judges of the Common Pleas had affixed their own hands and seals to the return ; and sometimes there was nothing but the usual certificate of the clerk under the seal of the court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b367-13\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AtL\">The first three sections of the statute, respeit.ng writs of error, <em>Elm. Dig. </em>159, the last of which directs that the writ of error shall be returned under the signatures and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>seals of the Judges to whom it is directed, apply exclusively to writs of error directed to the Supreme Court, and returnable into the Court of Appeals in the last resort in all causes of law. The statute is silent upon this subject, as respects writs of error out of and returnable to this court; and in the absence of any specific rule directing the mode in which such writs, when directed to the Circuit Court, or Court of Common Pleas shall be returned, we are of opinion that the return in this case, is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\n<em>Motion denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
