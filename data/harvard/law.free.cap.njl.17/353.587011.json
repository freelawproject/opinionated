The statute is silent upon this subject, as respects writs of error out of and returnable to this court; and in the absence of any specific rule directing the mode in which such writs, when directed to the Circuit Court, or Court of Common Pleas shall be returned, we are of opinion that the return in this case, is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\n<em>Motion denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
