He cited, <em>Tilling. Adams on Ejectment, </em>320. <em>(vide Rugles\u2019 Adams on Ejectment, </em>323.) <em>Thrustout v. Troublesome, </em>2 <em>Str. </em>1099. <em>Doe. v. Law, Bl.

Take a rule on the plaintiff to show cause on the first day of next term, why proceedings in this action should not be stayed, until the cause pending in the court of appeals shall be determined; and that all proceedings in this action be stayed in the mean time.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
