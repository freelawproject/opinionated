The supreme court explained that an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief must demonstrate by full discussion and analysis that appellate counsel \"has cast an advocate's eye over the trial record and considered whether any ruling made by the trial court, subject to the contemporaneous objection rule, had a significant, adverse impact on shaping the evidence presented to the jury for its consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11870799\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/704/241/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When conducting a review for compliance with\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   , an appellate court must conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the appeal is wholly frivolous.\n   <em>\n    Bradford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436533\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/676/1108/#p1110\">\n    676 So.2d at 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If, after an independent review, the reviewing court determines there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal, it may grant counsel's motion to withdraw and affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence. However, if the court finds any legal point arguable on the merits, it may either deny the motion and order the court-appointed attorney to file a brief arguing the legal point(s) identified by the court, or grant the motion and appoint substitute appellate counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436533\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/676/1108/#p1110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant's appellate counsel asserts that after a detailed review of the record, she could find no non-frivolous issues to raise on appeal. She contends that defendant did not plead guilty under\n   <em>\n    State v. Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9676631\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/584/\">\n    338 So.2d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1976), and thus, there is no ruling of the trial court to challenge. Appellate counsel states that she considered whether to raise that defendant's sentence was constitutionally excessive but felt that the issue was frivolous, as the trial court sentenced defendant to a reduced charge, and defendant was made aware of the sentence he would receive. She notes that defendant faced a sentencing range from 15 to 104 years if convicted of armed robbery with a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The State agrees with appellate counsel that there are no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal and urges that this Court should grant appellate counsel's motion to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   An independent review of the record supports appellate counsel's assertion that there are no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant was properly charged and appeared at each stage of the proceedings against him. As noted by appellate counsel, defendant did not preserve his right to challenge any of the trial court's pre-trial rulings on appeal pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State v. Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to defendant's guilty plea under\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the State provided the requisite factual basis at the time of the plea. The record further reflects that defendant was aware\n   he was pleading guilty to the charge of accessory after the fact to first degree robbery. The trial court advised defendant of his right to a jury trial, his right to confrontation, and his privilege against self-incrimination. Defendant acknowledged that he understood he was waiving those rights by pleading guilty, and he acknowledged that his plea of guilty was a knowing, intelligent, free, and voluntary act by him as evidenced by his signature on the waiver of rights form. Defendant was informed by the court of the maximum sentence, as well as the actual sentence he would receive, if his plea was accepted. The record indicates that the trial court accepted defendant's plea as a knowing, intelligent, free, and voluntary act. Finally, because defendant's sentence was imposed in conformity with a plea agreement set forth in the record at the time of the plea, defendant is now precluded from seeking review of that sentence.\n   <em>\n    State v.
