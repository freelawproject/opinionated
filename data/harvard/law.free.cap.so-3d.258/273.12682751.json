When a property owner fails to timely pay his or her property taxes, the county will auction off the property for the amount of unpaid taxes. At that point, the property owner has two years to redeem the property. If he or she fails to do so, the property is forfeited to whoever wins the auction. But for a tax sale to be valid, the chancery clerk must strictly follow Mississippi Code Section 27-43-3's notice requirements. These statutory notice procedures further Mississippi's long-standing policy of protecting landowners from losing property in tax sales.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the statute mandates that when a clerk is unable to notify the landowner, he or she must diligently search and inquire for a new or different address to provide notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. Here, the property owner failed to timely pay his taxes or to redeem them within two years of the tax sale of his property. The owner objected to the sale, asserting that he was deprived of his property without the statutorily required prior notice. What our review shows is that the chancery clerk's first notice was returned undelivered. At that point, by statute, the clerk was required to diligently search for a different address for the property owner. But despite having another address readily available in the county's land records, no notices were ever mailed to that address before the redemption period ended. Thus, the clerk's search and inquiry did not strictly comply with the statute. We must therefore reverse and render.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. In 2006, Alan Osborne bought fifty acres off Highway 3 in Warren County, Mississippi. In 2012, Osborne failed to timely pay his property taxes. And on August 26, 2013, his property was auctioned off for the unpaid taxes to Rachael Cook. When the redemption period ended on August 26, 2015, Osborne had not redeemed the property. Several days later, Osborne visited the chancery courthouse. While paying property taxes for his employer, Osborne asked about his own property. He was told by a deputy clerk that the redemption period had expired. The clerk's office issued Rachael Cook a tax deed on September 11, 2015, which she filed the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Osborne was unable to negotiate a deal with Cook to obtain his once-owned property. So Osborne filed a complaint to set aside the tax sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In it, he claimed the Warren County sheriff never personally served him nor did he receive any notice by certified mail from the clerk's office. Cook answered and responded with her own counterclaim to confirm title in herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. After Osborne's property was sold at auction, the chancery clerk's office was required to provide him notice-by personal service, certified or registered mail, and by newspaper publication-of when his right to redeem the property would expire.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-43-3\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-43-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2017). Thus, the clerk's office needed Osborne's physical and mailing addresses. But when\n   the chancery clerk sent a \"courtesy notice\" to Osborne in February 2015 to 8435 Highway 3, C/O P.O. Box 820258, Vicksburg, MS 39182-0258, the notice was returned to the clerk's office marked \"not deliverable as addressed.\" Despite this, the clerk continued to use that very same post-office-box address for every subsequent notice that was mailed, certified or otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. When the statutory notice sent in March 2015 and personal service by the sheriff were ineffective, the clerk was required by statute to perform a diligent search and inquiry to locate another address for Osborne. The deputy clerk responsible for redemption notices testified that she reviewed the tax collector's records. She also testified that she reviewed court and land records and prior tax sales for Osborne's address. Still, after doing so, the clerk's office continued to send future notices to the same post-office-box address, an address from which the very first notice-the courtesy notice-was returned \"not deliverable as addressed.\" This address was continually used for mailings, though Warren County land records contained a deed of trust filed March 10, 2011, which listed Osborne's address at 8435 Highway 3, Redwood, MS 39156. In fact, the deed conveying the subject property to Osborne listed the correct address for the property as 8435 Highway 3, Redwood, MS 39156. This particular address is also listed in three deeds of trust recorded in the chancery clerk's office before 2015. However, no notices were ever mailed to that address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Even so, the chancellor found that the chancery clerk diligently searched and inquired about Osborne's location and complied with Mississippi Code Section 27-43-3. So the chancellor affirmed the tax sale, confirming title in the Highway 3 property to Rachael Cook. Osborne now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. Osborne is by no means blameless here and is quite unsympathetic. He frequently failed to pay his property taxes on time. And he did not update his address with the clerk's office. He also gave rather dubious testimony-claiming that he moved from the Highway 3 property the same day the sheriff attempted to serve him. However, this Court has been clear that before the State may deprive a citizen of his or her property, certain statutory requirements and procedures must be met. And compliance with those statutes is strict. Based on the record before us, we must reverse. While the chancery clerk did take certain steps to locate Osborne, the clerk continued to use the post-office-box address from which the very first notice had been returned as \"not deliverable as addressed.\" This was done even though another address for Osborne was readily attainable in court filings. Thus, we find a diligent search and inquiry was not conducted as required by the statute. We therefore reverse and render.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9. We will not disturb a chancellor's findings unless they are manifestly wrong, clearly erroneous, or apply the wrong legal standard.\n   <em>\n    McNeil v.

Diligent Search and Inquiry\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10. Osborne's complaint is that the clerk was not diligent in the search and inquiry. He points out that notices were sent to his post-office box and not to the Highway 3 address. And he further argues that his correct Highway 3 address-which furthermore was wrongly identified as being in Vicksburg instead of nearby Redwood-was easily discoverable\n   from a recent deed of trust in the county's land records. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11. When an owner fails to pay his or her taxes, their property is auctioned off. Mississippi Code Section 27-43-3 sets out the notice requirements and steps the clerk must take to try to notify landowners their property will be forfeited unless redeemed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A landowner has two years from\n   the date of the tax auction to redeem their property.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-45-3\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-45-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2017). Section 27-43-3 requires redemption notices to be given by personal service, certified or registered mail, and by appropriate newspaper publication.\n   <em>\n    DeWeese Nelson Realty, Inc. v. Equity Servs. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7574524\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/502/310/#p312\">\n    502 So.2d 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 312 (Miss. 1986). If personal service is not obtained and certified mail is returned undelivered, the clerk must then make a diligent \"search and inquiry\" to locate the record landowner.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-43-3\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-43-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The clerk must file an affidavit documenting the specific search and inquiry undertaken and must keep the affidavit as a permanent record.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-43-3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12. This Court has held that \"[s]tatutes dealing with land forfeitures for delinquent taxes should be strictly construed in favor of the landowners. Any deviation from the statutorily mandated procedure renders the sale void.\"\n   <em>\n    Reed v. Florimonte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8185044\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/987/967/#p973\">\n    987 So.2d 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 973 (Miss. 2008) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Roach v. Goebel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9094648\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/856/711/#p716\">\n    856 So.2d 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 716 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) ). Mississippi's public policy is to protect landowners from losing property in tax sales.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13. The deputy chancery clerk responsible for sending Osborne notices and conducting searches, testified at trial. And she explained that she keeps a record of her actions and searches in a workbook. These records are later transcribed to a form affidavit, which here were attested to by another deputy clerk. But the initial clerk maintained that she had examined \"everything that [she had] access to,\" including recently recorded deeds, a phone directory, court and clerk records, and tax collector records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14. While Osborne also takes issue with what he claims are incomplete and noncompliant affidavits-affidavits that were either largely blank or signed after the redemption period had ended-we need not address the affidavits here. Rather, we focus on the records the deputy clerk had access to. When courtesy notices to delinquent property owners were sent in February 2015, the specific notice to Osborne was returned as undeliverable. Rather than note that the 8435 Highway 3, C/O P.O. Box 820258, Vicksburg, MS 39182-0258 address was a bad address, the clerk instead continued to use this post-office-box address for\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   subsequent notice to Osborne. But the county land records showed several deeds, and a March 10, 2011 deed of trust with Osborne's address listed as 8435 Highway 3, Redwood, MS 39156. This was easily discoverable. Yet the clerk made no attempt to send notice by certified mail to that address. Thus, after review, we find the required search and inquiry was not diligent as required by the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hart v. Catoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9598638,9598774\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/390/1001/\">\n    390 So.2d 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1002 (Miss. 1980) (clerk's search and inquiry was not diligent when owner's name and address were readily available in public records but were unused by the clerk's office).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9094648\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/856/711/#p716\">\n    856 So.2d at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (clerk's search and inquiry was not diligent when a homestead application and corresponding address were available but unused by clerk's office).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 15. There is testimony that a deputy chancery clerk personally handed Osborne a certified notice that had been returned to the clerk's office, and the record shows that Osborne did sign the return receipt. But putting aside the conflicting testimony over\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   Osborne signed the return receipt and whether he actually\n   <em>\n    received\n   </em>\n   the notice, the fact remains that the statute does not allow service in this manner. Rather, the statute dictates that notices be sent by certified or registered mail. We recognize this is a hard-line approach, but the redemption-notice statute must be followed strictly.\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8185044\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/987/967/#p973\">\n    987 So.2d at 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because it was not here, we must reverse and render the chancellor's judgment affirming the tax sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16. A deed of trust in the county land records listed a different address for Osborne than the one used by the chancery clerk's office for redemption notices. This record was readily available. So when redemption notices were returned to the clerk's office undelivered and marked \"not deliverable as addressed,\" a diligent search and inquiry would have revealed the different address. Thus, the search and inquiry was not diligent as required by statute. We must therefore reverse the chancellor's judgment affirming the tax sale and confirming title in Rachael Cook and render a judgment in Osborne's\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   favor, setting aside the tax sale as void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17.\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND RENDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   WALLER, C.J., RANDOLPH AND KITCHENS, P.JJ., KING, COLEMAN, BEAM, CHAMBERLIN AND ISHEE, JJ., CONCUR.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Reed v.
