(collectively,\n   \"Defendants\"), with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the following reasons, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a medical malpractice case that arises as a result of treatment rendered to the decedent, Roy Pierce (\"Mr. Pierce\"), at University Medical Center in New Orleans in late December of 2012 and early January 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Pierce originally presented to LSU Interim Public Hospital on December 27, 2012, for an outpatient EGD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On admission, he was awake, alert, and able to communicate and give consent for medical treatment. He complained of abdominal pain, fatigue, dark urine, and shortness of breath. The initial workup of Mr. Pierce showed that he was anemic, in renal failure, hyponatremiac,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and had elevated BUN/creatinine levels. A CT of his abdomen and pelvis showed a large mass in his bladder with a fistula (tunnel) to his colon. Rather than immediately performing the EGD, Mr. Pierce was admitted for a comprehensive workup and placed under the care of Defendant Dr. Ogitani. As part of this comprehensive medical workup, he was referred to Interventional Radiology for placement of a Perm-A-Cath (central line) for hemodialysis, which was scheduled for the morning of January 3, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The deposition testimony of Dr. Benjamin Cooper (\"Dr. Cooper\"), an Interventional Radiology Fellow, reflects that on the evening before the procedure was scheduled, Dr. Cooper was advised that Mr. Pierce was medically stable and able to consent to the treatment. However, overnight, from January 2, 2013 through January 3, 2013, Mr. Pierce's vital and mental status severely deteriorated. Medical records indicate that Mr. Pierce's blood pressure dropped by over 20 points from 4:46 p.m. on January 2, when it was 93/64, pulse 112, to 5:57 a.m. on January 3, when it was 71/46, pulse 83. He was also unable to walk without assistance, and at one point he fell while being assisted from the bathroom to the bed. He was assisted to the floor by the nurse, and then back to bed with the aid of three nurses and one transport employee. The nurse's notes reflect that the physician was on the unit and present while Mr. Pierce was assisted back to bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Despite this acute change in status, the Defendants did not change the treatment plan or render different treatment, such as a transfer to the Critical Care unit, but instead adhered to the original plan to go forward with the central line. Thus, on the morning of January 3, 2013, Mr. Pierce was sent on a gurney to the Radiology Department with a hospital escort (described as \"Transport,\" essentially a porter), who was neither a registered nurse nor a doctor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   What happened next is unclear from the record. Plaintiff alleges that Mr. Pierce was parked and left alone and unattended in the hallway-acutely hypotensive and in an altered mental state, until he was found by Dr. Cooper, alone and unattended, at approximately 8:00 a.m. on January 3, 2013. Defendants argue that there is no evidence that Mr. Pierce was left unattended,\n   and in support of this, reference portions of Dr. Cooper's deposition testimony that were not included in the record on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, whether or not Mr. Pierce was left unattended in his severely deteriorated state is simply not clear from the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The deposition testimony does establish that upon finding Mr. Pierce, Dr. Cooper called for Defendant Davis Ogitani, M.D., the primary care doctor assigned to Mr. Pierce, and had an emergency consent executed to place the central line so that Mr. Pierce could receive treatment for his deteriorating condition. Mr. Pierce went into cardio-pulmonary arrest as they were transferring him to the radiology table, and heroic efforts to resuscitate him were futile. Mr. Pierce died on the table in the radiology suite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In his deposition, Dr. Cooper also testified that it was unusual for someone incapable of consenting to be sent to radiology, that the change in the patient's condition overnight had not been conveyed to him, and as a result the patient was \"not in the place where that patient should [have been] in that moment.\" Dr. Cooper also testified that he agreed with the statement that Mr. Pierce should not have been transported to the radiological suite in the condition he was in, because he was unstable, and further testified that Mr. Pierce's blood pressure reflected a dangerously hypotensive state. He also stated that he could not say one way or the other whether Mr. Pierce would have had a better chance of surviving if he had been in the ICU rather than the radiology suite. As well, he acknowledged that the medical record doesn't indicate that Mr. Pierce was transported or attended by anyone other than a standard escort (transport employee).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Subsequent to Mr. Pierce's death, a request for review of the Plaintiff's malpractice claims was filed before a medical review panel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   An opinion was rendered by the medical review panel on April 20, 2016, concluding that none of the Defendants deviated below the standard of care, and that the decedent was properly monitored, and all physician orders were timely and appropriately followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 16, 2016, Plaintiff (Mr. Pierce's widow) filed a petition for damages. On October 18, 2016, Defendants, University Medical Center New Orleans and University Medical Center Management, filed for summary judgment. Shortly thereafter, Defendants Ogitani, Conkerton, and Johnson also filed a motion for summary judgment. The motions were originally set for hearing on December 2, 2016, but were continued at Plaintiff's request to March 3, 2017, and then to May 19, 2017. They were then continued without date to allow Plaintiff to conduct further discovery. On October 23, 2017, the summary judgments were re-set for December 1, 2017. Prior to that hearing, on November 29, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion to continue the summary judgment hearing, as well as a statement of material facts in dispute, asserting a single material fact in dispute, as follows: \"Whether the defendants ... breached the standard of care when they transported and abandoned Roy Pierce in the hallway outside of the Radiology suite when he was in an acutely decompensated, mentally altered hypotensive state.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On\n   November 30, 2017, one day before the hearing, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the motions. It is undisputed that no Independent Medical Expert testimony was provided in support of Plaintiff's opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court, ruling from the bench, denied the motion to continue, and granted both summary judgment motions, signing the judgment as to the hospital defendants on December 1, 2017, and as to the remaining practitioner defendants on December 19, 2017. The December 19, 2017 judgment also denied the motion to continue. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff has asserted the following assignments of error on appeal. First, that the district court erred in ruling that an independent medical expert is necessary to establish the standard of care in a medical malpractice case when the breach is objective and apparent and negligence can be reasonably inferred. Second, that the district court erred in ruling that Dr. Cooper was not a medical expert who established the standard of care and its breach, and in ruling that no genuine issue of material fact existed regarding whether or not the Defendants breached their standard of care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, Plaintiff asserts that the district court erred in not granting the Plaintiff a continuance of the hearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment, as discovery had not been completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We review the grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Independent Fire Ins.

R.S. 40:1299.47(G) and (H) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As with any other expert testimony or evidence, the medical review panel opinion is subject to review and contestation by an opposing viewpoint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because in this case Defendants will not bear the burden of proof at trial on the elements of the malpractice claim, they are required only to point to a lack of factual support for one or more elements to prevail on their summary judgment motion. Defendants have attempted to do so by pointing to the lack of medical expert testimony that Defendants violated the standard of care. Further, they point to the Medical Review Panel (\"MRP\") Opinion, which concluded that \"nothing in the record ... indicate[d] that the hospital and/or its employees deviated from the standard of care,\" and that \"[t]he patient was properly monitored,\" as un-rebutted prima facie proof of this contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Notwithstanding the conclusions of the MRP Opinion, in the instant case, we find that on the record before us, a genuine issue of material fact remains that prevents us from resolving the question of whether expert medical testimony was required to prove that a breach of the standard of care occurred. The evidence submitted simply does not conclusively establish whether Mr. Pierce, after severely decompensating overnight, was left unattended for a period of time in the hallway outside the radiology suite, and if so for how long, and all doubt must be resolved in Plaintiff's favor. Moreover, if that did in fact occur, and depending upon how long Mr. Pierce was left, such a failure may well be one of such obvious\n   negligence that no expert testimony would be necessary to demonstrate a breach of the standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition, we note that that the portion of the deposition testimony of Dr. Cooper that is in the record supports an inference that the standard of care was not met. For instance, Dr. Cooper testified that it was unusual for someone incapable of consenting to be sent to radiology, that the change in the patient overnight had not been relayed to him, and as a result the patient was \"not in the place where that patient should [have been] in that moment.\" Dr. Cooper also testified that he agreed with the statement that Mr. Pierce should not have been transported to the radiological suite in the condition he was in, because he was \"unstable,\" and in fact, he testified that Mr. Pierce's blood pressure reflected a dangerously hypotensive state. While Defendants' opposition references purported testimony to the contrary from Dr. Cooper, it is not included in the record provided to us (and thus presumably was not considered by the district judge).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Accordingly, with respect to Plaintiff's first two assignments of error, we agree that the district court erred in ruling that an independent medical expert was necessary to establish the standard of care in this case, and that it was breached, because a fact issue remains about what actually occurred with Mr. Pierce and whether it was so egregious that expert testimony was unnecessary. Therefore, on the record before us, we conclude that summary judgment on those issues was not appropriate. Having so found, we pretermit consideration of the question whether Dr. Cooper was qualified as an expert and whether the trial court erred in denying a continuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We recognize, however, that in addition to proving a breach, Plaintiff must also prove that the breach was the cause of her husband's death. We acknowledge that this will be very difficult to prove without expert testimony, unless the evidence ultimately shows that Mr. Pierce's abandonment was for such a period and under such circumstances that a lay jury could infer causation as well as an expert could.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pfiffner\n   </em>\n   , 94-0924 at p. 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7466753\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/643/1228/#p1233\">\n    643 So.2d at 1234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, this is not a determination we can make on the record before us. In addition to the dearth of facts in the record regarding what actually happened to Mr. Pierce after he was transported to the hallway outside of the radiology suite, the MRP Opinion did not address causation, nor did the district court (either at the hearing or in its signed judgment). Dr. Cooper's testimony on this point was scant and equivocal. On this record, and resolving all doubt in favor of the Plaintiff (as we must), we simply cannot conclude that summary judgment is appropriate at this juncture. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   BELSOME, J., CONCURS IN THE RESULT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   LOBRANO, J., CONCURS IN THE RESULT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   JENKINS, J., DISSENTS WITH REASONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   BELSOME, J., CONCURS IN THE RESULT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   I agree with the majority's decision to reverse and remand to the trial court.

First, no discovery cutoff, expert designation, or trial deadlines were established. Next, the Plaintiff took steps to conduct additional discovery and has indicated what additional discovery is needed. Finally, the discovery issue was raised with the trial court in the Plaintiff's motion to continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Notably, the Defendants filed two separate motions for summary judgment, each within ten days of answering the lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motions for summary judgment were continued several times. Significantly, during the last continuance, the parties agreed to continue the summary judgment hearing without date to allow for additional discovery. However, the Defendants re-set their motions without notification to the Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Civil District Court Local Rules require litigants to certify that discovery is complete before obtaining a trial date. However, when discovery is not complete, the trial court may set a pre-trial scheduling order to allow a sufficient amount of discovery to be completed before trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civil District Court Local Rule 9.14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is\n   evident that the rule intends to afford litigants a fair opportunity for discovery and to present a case, in conformity with La. C.C.P. art. 966(A)(3). However, the discretionary nature of the rule leads to inconsistent application among the courts below. Certainly, a uniform rule would safeguard the discovery protections afforded under the law. Recognizing the absence of uniformity in setting discovery deadlines below and the parties' agreement to continue the hearing without date until discovery was complete, I find that additional time for discovery is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Under these circumstances, summary judgment was premature.
