Watts,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a petition against Golden Nugget alleging damages for injuries allegedly resulting from a slip and fall on a wet floor in the lobby of the casino on December 28, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Watts alleged injuries to her right shoulder, neck, and back.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Golden Nugget filed a motion for summary judgment alleging that the accident occurred outside the casino, on the boardwalk, while it was raining such that Ms. Watts could not show that the walkway was a hazard or defective and/or that Golden Nugget's negligence or fault caused the incident in question. In support of its motion, Golden Nugget attached the transcript of Ms. Watts' deposition. Golden Nugget also attached the video surveillance that was taken of the incident. The affidavit of Justin Yelverton, Golden Nugget's Risk Manager, was also attached to the motion for summary judgment. Yelverton authenticated the surveillance video. Yelverton stated that it was raining most of the day on the date of the accident, December 24, 2014, and that Golden Nugget received no complaints or other notifications prior to or after Ms. Watts' alleged accident that anyone had slipped and fallen on the boardwalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. Watts opposed the motion for summary judgment. She attached the following documents to her writ application: (1) photographs of her shoulder purporting to show the surgical site necessitated by injuries allegedly sustained in the accident in question; (2) several photographs purporting to show the boardwalk where she fell; and (3) photographs of the shoes that Ms. Watts was allegedly wearing at the time of the accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Watts alleged that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding \"whether the space between the non-wooded slippery board walk[ ] created an unreasonable risk of harm in the dark after it had been raining on the defendant['s] hotel property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The motion came for hearing on November 20, 2017. Counsel for Golden Nugget objected to introduction of the photographs offered by Ms. Watts in support of her opposition to the motion. The trial court overruled the exception stating that the objection might be appropriate if the proceedings moved beyond the summary judgment stage but that it did not need to \"necessarily rule on admissibility at this moment.\" At the hearing, Ms. Watts offered the entire record into evidence and refined her argument to include an assertion that the accident may have occurred even if it was not raining because of the surface and the gap between the brick and the boardwalk. The trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [T]his is a close case. It's one that really could go either way. You know, I actually probably lean in favor of granting the motion for summary judgment; however, just because of the time.... [I]f I were\n   to grant the motion for summary judgment[,] and then writs were taken[,] and if I end up getting reversed at the appellate court, you know, sometime in the next six, eight months, ... then I would have to find another place[,] and I'd have to find another date to set this matter for trial....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court then denied the motion for summary judgment in open court on November 21, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A written judgment was signed on November 30, 2017. On November 30, 2017, Golden Nugget timely filed its notice of intent to apply for writs. Golden Nugget asked the trial court to stay the proceedings pending this court's review of the denial of its motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the request for a stay and set a return date of January 3, 2018. This writ application was timely filed. Ms. Watts filed her opposition to the writ application on March 21, 2018. Golden Nugget filed a reply to the opposition on April 11, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before the granting of the stay, trial was scheduled to begin on December 11, 2017.

Ms. Watts admitted that the shoes she was wearing were old. There are two photographs taken by Ms. Watts' nephew on the night of the incident that are attached to Ms. Watts' deposition. The quality of the reproductions is poor, but no hole or gap is noted where Ms. Watts marked that she fell.

The trial court also pointed out that there were \"some discrepancies between the pictures that were attached to the [deposition] of Ms. Watts\" which did not show any kind of gap and the pictures introduced as part of the opposition to the motion for summary judgment. The trial court stated: \"for purposes of summary judgment, in looking at those pictures, it could be that the pictures that were shown at the deposition were not the correct pictures and that these are.\" The discrepancies in the pictures were the basis of the trial court's finding that there was \"a genuine issue of material fact with\n   regard to whether there was a hole there or not at the time Ms. Watts was walking in that area which could have been what actually caused her to fall rather than the wet or slippery surface of the boardwalk.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Counsel for Ms. Watts admitted that the photographs were not verified at the hearing: \"we are going to have Mr. Marshal Simien come in to testify[,] if we get beyond this point[,] as to the photographs taken -- taking of the photographs, timeline, all the rest of that.\" In\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v.

The plaintiff did not introduce an affidavit or testimony by any person familiar with the photographs, the photographer or otherwise, in order to lay the foundation that the photographs were actually depictions of the plaintiff's vehicle or that the depictions were accurate. Accordingly, we agree that the lack of verification deems the photographs inadmissible at the summary judgment hearing.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Similarly, it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to admit the photographs submitted by Ms. Watts into evidence and consider them because they were indisputably undated, unauthenticated, and unverified by any affidavit or deposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(A)(4) ; La.Code Evid. arts. 802 and 901(A).

Ms. Watts did not present any countervailing evidence to show that there was a condition that presented an unreasonable risk of harm or that Golden Nugget failed to exercise reasonable care.
