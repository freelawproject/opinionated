For the reasons that follow, we find that the judgment lacks the required decretal language, and is not a final appealable judgment. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal without prejudice and remand this matter to the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On May 27, 2011, Smith filed a petition for damages against B-3 and Blair. Smith alleged that B-3 and/or Blair owned and operated the apartment complex where Smith lived. Smith further alleged that, in \"June or July of 2010,\" she sustained injuries when she slipped and fell in a puddle of algae on the ground, which formed as a result of a leak in her apartment's air conditioner. According to Smith's petition, B-3 and Blair are liable for negligence. On September 22, 2014, St. Roch was added as a defendant via a supplemental and amending petition, in which Smith alleged that St. Roch and/or B-3 and/or Blair owned and operated the apartment complex\n   where Smith lived and, consequently, are liable for negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 19, 2015, Smith filed a motion for summary judgment against B-3 and Blair on the issue of negligence. On August 28, 2015, summary judgment was denied. On August 8, 2017, Smith filed a second motion for summary judgment against B-3 and Blair on the issue of negligence. The motion did not seek summary judgment against St. Roch. On December 20, 2017, the district court granted summary judgment. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We must first consider whether we have jurisdiction to review this appeal. As this Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Moulton v.

The judgment does not name the party against whom the ruling is ordered and merely states that judgment is rendered \"against the defendants.\" It does not specify which defendants are cast in judgment or provide any degree of fault for each defendant as a percentage. The judgment also does not specify what relief is granted; rather, the judgment merely states that it grants \"the relief prayed for in said Motion and Memorandum.\" As a result, one must look to extrinsic documents or pleadings in order to discern what the district court's ruling entails. The absence of this necessary decretal language means that the judgment is not final and appealable.
