Family Dollar Stores of Louisiana, Inc. (\"Family Dollar\"); S &amp; S Janitorial Services, LLC (\"S &amp; S\"); and SMS Assist, LLC (\"SMS\") (collectively, \"Employers\"), appeal the January 30, 2017 judgment of the Workers' Compensation Judge (\"WCJ\") awarding wage and medical benefits, penalties and attorney's fees to appellee, Angela Jackson. Employers also appeal the WCJ's March 22, 2017 judgment denying the Employers' Motion for New Trial. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 12, 2015, Ms. Jackson filed a Disputed Claim for Compensation (the\n   \"Claim\") with the Office of Workers' Compensation (\"OWC\"). Ms. Jackson reported that, on October 22, 2014, between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m., she was injured at a Family Dollar store in New Orleans. Ms. Jackson stated that a shelf of bottled water fell on her ankle causing a fracture and requiring surgery. The Claim identified Family Dollar as her statutory employer, and alleged that Family Dollar had not paid wage benefits, and had not authorized medical treatment. Ms. Jackson sought penalties and attorney's fees for Family Dollar's arbitrary and capricious denial of benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 20, 2015, Family Dollar filed an Answer to Claim and Third-Party Demand against S &amp; S, seeking a defense and indemnity pursuant to an \"Affiliate Master Service Agreement\" (the \"Agreement\") in which S &amp; S contracted to provide floor care services to Family Dollar stores in Louisiana. According to the Third-Party demand, S &amp; S was obligated under the Agreement to obtain workers' compensation insurance for its employees who performed floor preparation and cleaning. In the Answer, Family Dollar denied that Ms. Jackson was an employee at the time of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 28, 2015, Ms. Jackson filed a Supplemental Disputed Claim for Compensation (\"Supplemental Claim\") naming S &amp; S and SMS as additional defendants. Ms. Jackson alleged that S &amp; S was her employer at the time of the accident, and that SMS was the general contractor of the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 18, 2015, SMS filed an Answer to Ms. Jackson's Supplemental Claim, along with a Third-Party Demand against S &amp; S based on the Agreement's provision requiring S &amp; S to obtain workers' compensation insurance. In the Answer, SMS also denied that Ms. Jackson was an employee on the date of the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 5, 2015, S &amp; S filed an Answer to Ms. Jackson's Claim and Supplemental Claim, also denying that Ms. Jackson was an employee of S &amp; S at the time of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A trial was held on January 4, 2017. On January 30, 2017, the WCJ rendered the following judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 On October 22, 2014, Ms. Jackson was a direct employee of Becky Tolito and Tolito Services Company, LLC; and a statutory employee of S &amp; S, SMS, and Family Dollar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Ms. Jackson was injured on October 22, 2014 at the Family Dollar store on S.

Carrollton Avenue fell on top of her leg and ankle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Ms. Jackson properly sought and received medical treatment for the ankle injury after the accident at Biloxi Regional Medical Center and follow-up treatment at Bienville Orthopedic Specialists, LLC with Dr. Yakaterina Karpitskaya, and again at Memorial Hospital in Gulfport.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 The employers shall pay all outstanding medical bills for services rendered to Ms. Jackson as they relate to the injuries she received on October 22, 2014 totaling $92,278.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Ms. Jackson was a recipient of Medicaid benefits at the time of her injury on October 22, 2014, and that those Medicaid benefits were utilized during her treatment for the injuries sustained on October 22, 2014. Employers are liable under La. R.S.23:1205 to reimburse Medicaid for any and all amounts paid for services rendered to Ms. Jackson as a result of the October 22, 2014 accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Ms. Jackson was paid $50.00 per store as compensation for working. As a result of the accident, Angela Jackson was rendered temporarily total disabled (\"TTD\") from October 22, 2014 until April 30, 2015 pursuant to La. R.S. 23:1221(1). The minimum compensation rate in effect at the time of the accident was $168.00/per week. The total TTD figure for 27.28 weeks at $168.00/per week is $4,584.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Ms. Jackson carried her burden of proof that she was entitled to supplemental earnings benefits (\"SEBs\") pursuant to La. R.S. 23:1221(3) and she is entitled to SEBs until such time as earning capacity is demonstrated at the rate of $168/per week from May 1, 2015 and until such a time not to exceed a maximum of five hundred and twenty weeks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Employers failed to reasonably controvert this claim and/or establish that there were conditions over which they had no control when they failed to pay this claim; penalties are assessed against the employers in the amount of $2,000.00 pursuant to La. RS. 23:1201(F) for failure to timely pay indemnity benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Employers failed to reasonably controvert this claim and/or establish that there were conditions over which they had no control when they failed to pay this claim; penalties are assessed against the employers in the amount of $2,000.00 pursuant to La.

R.S. 23:1201(F) for their failure to pay indemnity benefits and medical benefits timely or otherwise. Employers failed to establish they reasonably controverted this claim and/or that there were conditions over which they had no control when they failed to pay this claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 This matter shall be dismissed with prejudice, reserving all of Ms. Jackson's future rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On February 9, 2017, Employers filed a Motion for New Trial, which the WCJ denied on March 22, 2017. Employers appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On August 28, 2017, Ms. Jackson filed a Motion to Dismiss Appeal, pursuant to La. R.S. 23:1310.5(C), because Employers did not post an appeal bond, which is required when there has been an award of workers' compensation benefits. On January 5, 2018, this Court granted Ms. Jackson's motion, dismissed the appeal, and remanded this matter for the setting of a bond.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Ms. Jackson testified that she was an employee of Tolito and was being paid $50.00 in cash per job. Amos Mays, Ms. Jackson's boyfriend who worked for Tolito, testified that Ms. Jackson was working for Tolito on October 22, 2014 sweeping the floors when the shelf of bottled water fell on her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Jackson's initial evaluation at the Therapy Center at Biloxi Regional Medical Center dated December 16, 2014 states that \"[p]atient was sweeping at work when a shelf full of packaged water fell on top of her leg and ankle causing tibial/fibula fracture that required surgical repair.\" On the other hand, in the medical records from the emergency room at Biloxi Memorial Hospital, the nurse's notes state that Ms. Jackson said she was shopping at Family Dollar at the time of the accident. At trial, however, Ms. Jackson denied ever making this statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In the WCJ's Written Reasons for Judgment, she stated that the \"facts surrounding this matter will turn on the credibility of the parties.\" According to the WCJ, she gave \"great weight and credibility\" to Ms. Jackson in determining the issue of whether she was in the course and scope of employment at the time of the accident. The WCJ noted Ms. Jackson's testimony that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 In May 2014, Ms. Jackson was in search of employment and asked Mr. Mays' employer, Becky Tolito, about employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 Approximately one week before the accident, she accompanied Mr. Mays and Ms. Tolito to a jobsite in Mississippi to learn and observe the work necessary for employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 Although Ms. Jackson was only supposed to observe and learn, she ended up working and was paid $50.00 for the job.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 There was no paperwork executed at the beginning of Ms. Jackson's employment, only the oral agreement to work and get paid per store cleaned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 On October 22, 2014, Ms. Jackson accompanied Ms. Tolito, Mr. Mays, and another individual to New Orleans to start a job at the Family Dollar store on S. Carrollton Avenue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022 When they arrived at the store, Ms. Jackson went to the back of the\n   store and began to sweep the floors to prepare them for cleaning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   To refute Ms. Jackson's testimony, the Employers rely on the trial testimony of Ms. Tolito, who said that she was with Ms. Jackson on October 22, 2014, and that Ms. Jackson was a visitor who was shopping in the Family Dollar store at the time of the accident. Ms. Tolito denied that Ms. Jackson was an employee of Tolito.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In the court's reasons for judgment, the WCJ discredited Ms. Tolito's testimony, stating that she was \"unwilling to believe that Angela Jackson traveled all the way from Mississippi to shop at the Family Dollar Store in New Orleans, Louisiana.\" The WCJ also pointed out that Ms. Tolito \"could provide no further evidence to prove that Angela Jackson was a customer on the night of October 14, 2014 in the Family Dollar Store.\" Without any corroboration of Ms. Tolito's testimony, the WCJ concluded that Ms. Jackson was an employee of Tolito on October 22, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We find that the WCJ's evaluations of credibility are reasonable. Where, as here, the trial court's \"findings are reasonable in light of the record reviewed in its entirety, an appellate court may not reverse.\"\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

R.S. 23:1221(1)(C). We decline to follow the First Circuit cases cited by Employers, which require that the employee offer expert medical testimony.

She was discharged following\n   her surgery on heavy pain medication. The records show that Ms. Jackson continued with physical therapy until February 3, 2015, at which time she had to discontinue therapy because of lack of insurance coverage. When therapy ended on February 3, 2015, Ms. Jackson was continuing to have significant problems. The physical therapy notes from February 2, 2015 state: \"Pt ambulates without AD today with normal gait pattern but will demonstrate antalgic gait pattern after prolong[ed] walking.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The therapist's note on the last day of therapy, February 3, 2015, indicates that the pain goal was to decrease pain during functional activities once Ms. Jackson became weight bearing. The therapist's examination on February 3, 2015 reflects that Ms. Jackson was still experiencing moderate pain with palpation, that her strength in the right ankle was 4 out of 5, and that she had decreased range of motion, strength, and functional mobility, and had edema and pain. On February 3, 2015, Ms. Jackson was still on crutches. The therapist noted on this last visit that exacerbating factors included walking and that her standing and dynamic gait balance could not be assessed because she was still non-weight bearing on the right foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   At trial, Ms. Jackson testified that she had not worked since the accident, but had tried to find work in Gulfport and Biloxi, Mississippi, and in California. She stated that she had applied at fast food restaurants such as McDonald's and KFC, and she also went to a labor staffing agency.

The WCJ also took note that Ms. Tolito could provide no further evidence that Ms. Jackson was a customer on the night of October 22, 2014. The WCJ pointed out that, although counsel for Employers referred to a videotape that purportedly showed that Ms. Jackson was shopping, the videotape was not introduced at trial. The WCJ further stated that \"[i]t would have been helpful if the other individual present on the night of October 22, 2014 would have provided testimony as to the events occurring that night and the status of [Ms.] Jackson's employment with ...

Employers also failed to produce any documentation indicating that an investigation of the incident occurred. As such, we find that the WCJ was not clearly wrong in awarding Ms. Jackson $2,000.00 in penalties for failure to pay medical benefits, and $2,000.00 in penalties for failure to pay indemnity benefits. We further find the WCJ was not manifestly erroneous in awarding Ms. Jackson $3,000.00 in attorney's fees for the arbitrary and capricious denial of Ms. Jackson's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In this matter, conflicting evidence was presented on the issue of whether a work-related accident occurred.
