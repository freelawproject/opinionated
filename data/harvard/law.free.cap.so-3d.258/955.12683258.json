He also challenges the denial of his Motion for New Trial. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties, Elizabeth Melancon and Darielle Russell, are the parents of two minor children, O.T.R. (born 3/22/09) and S.G.R. (born 3/26/12). The parties were never married. On June 12, 2015, they entered into a stipulated judgment, providing that Elizabeth would have sole custody of the minor children, with Darielle to have one telephone call per week with the children. The record reveals Darielle was incarcerated at the time the parties entered into this judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 10, 2016, Darielle filed a Motion to Modify Child Custody, in which he indicated that he was no longer incarcerated and that joint custody would be in the best interest of the children. On December 12, 2016, the trial court approved a \"Court Form Stipulation,\" providing that Elizabeth would maintain sole custody of the children, pending further orders of the court. It further provided that Darielle would have supervised visitation with the children, with his mother present at all times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, on February 6, 2017, Elizabeth filed an Answer and Reconventional Demand, seeking to maintain sole legal custody of the children. In her pleading, she asserted that she has been the primary caretaker of the children due to Darielle's \"drug abuse and violent lifestyle.\" Elizabeth asserted that Darielle has an extensive criminal history, as well as a history of domestic violence against her. She also requested that Darielle be ordered to resume payment of his child support obligation, which was suspended during his incarceration, and that he be ordered to make payments toward his child support arrears, which exceeded $21,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 13, 2017, the trial court held a hearing on Darielle's Motion to Modify Custody and Elizabeth's Reconventional Demand, as well as other motions not at issue on appeal. At the hearing, Darielle testified that he was released from jail in December of 2015, and that he is currently employed. Darielle testified that he has a good relationship with his daughters, who were ages eight and five at the time of the hearing, that he has never abused them, and that he was seeking joint custody. He admitted that he has smoked marijuana in the past, but he indicated that he took a drug test a few days before this hearing and it was \"clean.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On cross-examination, Darielle acknowledged that he has failed to pay child support since he was released from jail, claiming \"I don't know where [Elizabeth] stays at.\" He also admitted that he did not pay child support prior to his incarceration because he was not talking to Elizabeth, and that he has not paid child support in at least five years. Darielle acknowledged that his visitation with the children pending this hearing was ordered to be supervised, and he denied that he ever exercised his visitation without his mother being\n   present.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Darielle testified that he has never hit Elizabeth or threatened her with harm. He admitted that he was incarcerated in 2015 because he had shot someone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Elizabeth testified that she has experienced domestic abuse at the hands of Darielle on more than one or two occasions. She recalled an incident in 2009 when she was pregnant during which Darielle pushed her out of the door and slammed the door on her stomach, causing her to be hospitalized for complications with her pregnancy. Elizabeth also testified regarding an incident in 2009, during which she was driving with Darielle and baby O.T.R. as passengers. She stated that they got into an argument and Darielle put his hands around her neck and slammed her head against the window. Then, as she drove over some railroad tracks, Darielle put her car in neutral, causing the car to stop on the tracks. She stated that after \"struggling a little bit,\" she was able to put the car in drive and leave the railroad tracks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Elizabeth also testified regarding an incident in December of 2010, when Darielle hit her three or four times in the face while she was holding O.T.R., causing her face to hit O.T.R.'s cheek. She also testified about an incident in May 2012 when Darielle broke into her parent's house through a kitchen window, and she had to leave the house and go down the street to her uncle's house to call the police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Elizabeth testified about an incident when O.T.R. was one or two years old, where Darielle put his hands around her neck and threatened to hit her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Elizabeth also testified that on many occasions, Darielle has threatened to kill her, and she has filed for protective orders several times. She testified about threatening text messages she received from Darielle, and the printouts from several text messages were admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Elizabeth testified that S.G.R. has told her that Darielle said he shot someone because they were \"messing\" with him. She believes the girls are scared of Darielle, and she has obtained mental health treatment for O.T.R. for anxiety and other emotional issues that have arisen since he was released from jail and \"got back into their lives.\" According to Elizabeth, O.T.R. has also expressed that she is afraid she may go to jail if she makes a bad choice. Elizabeth requested that the trial court deny Darielle's Motion to Modify Custody \"due to the instability and the violence and the drugs\" she believes he would bring into the children's lives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found that Darielle has a history of perpetuating family violence on Elizabeth, triggering the application of the Post-Separation Family Violence Relief\n   Act, La. R.S. 9:361\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"PSFVRA\"). In accordance with the provisions of the Act, the trial court awarded sole custody to Elizabeth, with Darielle to have supervised visitation every Saturday from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., as well as specified holidays. The trial court ordered that the supervisor for visitation shall be a police officer or other competent professional, and not a relative, friend, therapist, or associate of Darielle. Finally, the trial court ordered that unsupervised visitation shall only be allowed if it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Darielle has successfully completed a court-approved domestic abuse intervention program of at least 26 weeks which follows the Duluth model, that Darielle is not abusing alcohol or psychoactive drugs and poses no danger to the children, and that unsupervised visitation is in the children's best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 21, 2017, Darielle filed a Motion for New Trial, asserting that the trial court erred by applying the provisions of the PSFVRA in this matter, when Elizabeth did not specifically plead a cause of action under the PSFVRA in her Reconventional Demand. The trial court denied the Motion for New Trial without a hearing. Darielle now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW AND DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal, Darielle sets forth two assignments of error. In his first assignment of error, he asserts that the trial court erroneously awarded sole custody of the minor children to Elizabeth pursuant to La. R.S. 9:362 and La. R.S. 9:364 of the PSFVRA, when Elizabeth did not specifically plead for relief under this Act in her Answer and Reconventional Demand. In support of his argument, he cites caselaw, including\n   <em>\n    Glover v. Med. Center of Baton Rouge\n   </em>\n   , 97-1710 (La. App. 1 Cir. 6/29/98),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11826463\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/713/1261/\">\n    713 So.2d 1261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , providing that a trial court may not decide controversies that the litigants have not raised or grant relief the parties have not demanded. He also complains that he objected during the hearing when Elizabeth sought to introduce evidence of domestic violence, but the trial court overruled his objection, stating the evidence could be admitted to assess the fitness of each party. Finally, Darielle asserts he was denied due process by Elizabeth's failure to plead for relief under the PSFVRA, and he was \"blindsided\" by Elizabeth's request for relief under this Act during her closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Elizabeth responds that the provisions of the PSFVRA apply in the event that the trial court finds a history of family violence, regardless of whether the litigant requests relief under this specific Act. She further asserts that Darielle was put on notice that his history of family violence would be presented at the hearing. Additionally, Elizabeth argues that Darielle did not meet his burden of proving that joint custody would be in the best interest of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Darielle seeks modification of the parties' consent judgment awarding sole custody to Elizabeth. When a party seeks to modify a consent judgment, rather than a considered decree, the party seeking modification of the judgment must prove: 1) there has been a material change in circumstances since the custody decree was entered; and 2) the proposed modification is in the best interest of the children.\n   <em>\n    Evans v. Lungrin\n   </em>\n   , 97-541 (La. 2/6/98),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11854510\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/708/731/\">\n    708 So.2d 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 738 ;\n   <em>\n    Theriot v.

Darielle's release from prison was a material change in circumstances occurring after the consent judgment was rendered. Thus, at trial, it was Darielle's burden to prove that a change to joint custody was in the best interest of O.T.R. and S.G.R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The PSFVRA is found in La. R.S. 9:361\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   This Act was created to protect\n   victimized parties when domestic disputes arise in the course of separation and divorce.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

R.S. 9:364(A) creates a presumption against awarding sole or joint custody to a parent with a history of perpetuating family violence. It further provides that \"[t]he court may find a history of perpetuating family violence if the court finds that one incident of family violence has resulted in serious bodily injury or the court finds more than one incident of family violence.\" Family violence \"includes but is not limited to physical or sexual abuse and any offense against the person as defined in the Criminal Code of Louisiana, except negligent injuring or defamation, committed by one parent against the other parent or against any of the children.\" La. R.S. 9:362(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   La.

App. Unpub. LEXIS 812, pp. *4-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the present case, we find no merit to Darielle's argument that he was denied due process by Elizabeth's failure to specifically plead for relief under the PSFVRA. The record before us clearly shows that allegations of domestic violence were at issue throughout the proceedings in this case. In Elizabeth's Answer and Reconventional Demand, while she did not specifically ask for relief under the PSFVRA, she did specifically allege domestic violence as a ground for maintaining sole custody in her favor. Further, the record shows Elizabeth filed Petitions for Protection of Abuse, sought restraining orders against Darielle, and alleged various acts of violence by Darielle since this litigation commenced. Accordingly, we fail to\n   see how Darielle could have been \"blindsided\" by Elizabeth's request for relief under the PSFVRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Considering that Elizabeth specifically raised the issue of domestic violence in her Answer and Reconventional Demand as a ground for sole custody, and considering the testimony and evidence presented at trial, we find that the trial court did not err by applying the provisions of the PSFVRA in this matter. Darielle was clearly put on notice that domestic abuse was an issue in this proceeding, and the trial court specifically found a history of family violence. A trial court's determination of domestic abuse is entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Dufresne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8206125\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/992/579/#p585\">\n    992 So.2d at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this matter, the trial court's determination was supported by the testimony and evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, we note that even if the PSFVRA was not applicable, Darielle failed to meet his burden of proving that a change to joint custody was in the children's best interest. Accordingly, this assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In his second assignment of error, Darielle contends that the trial court erred by refusing to hold a hearing on his Motion for New Trial, even though it was timely filed. He contends that the trial court's failure to hold a hearing on his motion denied him the reasonable opportunity to place before the trial court all of the facts bearing on the issues involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although La. C.C.P. art. 1976 refers to a hearing on a motion for new trial, a well-settled jurisprudential exception has developed under which a trial court may summarily deny a motion for new trial, \"in the absence of a clear showing in the motion of facts or law reasonably calculated to change the outcome or reasonably believed to have denied the applicant a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    Autin v.

However, Elizabeth did not appeal the trial court's judgment or file an answer to the appeal requesting this relief. The failure either to cross-appeal or to answer the appeal precludes this Court from considering Elizabeth's assignments of error. See La. C.C.P. art. 2133 ;\n   <em>\n    Petrie v.

In fact, the violence often escalates, and child custody and visitation become the new forum for the continuation of the abuse. Because current laws relative to child custody and visitation are based on an assumption that even divorcing parents are in relatively equal positions of power, and that such parents act in the children's best interest, these laws often work against the protection of the children and the abused spouse in families with a history of family violence. Consequently, laws designed to act in the children's best interest may actually effect a contrary result due to the unique dynamics of family violence.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    1992 La.
