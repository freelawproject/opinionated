The main issue presented by this case is whether NRG Wholesale Generation's proffered expert used an acceptable method to determine the \"true value\" of its power plant in computing ad valorem tax. NRG's expert used a mixture of the sales-comparison approach, the income approach, and the cost approach to determine the true value of the facility. Lori P. Kerr, the tax assessor for Choctaw County,\n   and Choctaw County, Mississippi (collectively, the \"County\"), contend that Mississippi law mandates a trended historical cost-less-depreciation approach to calculate the true value of industrial personal property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court found in favor of the County and excluded NRG's proffered expert testimony. NRG claims the circuit court abused its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. NRG also argues that the circuit court erred in denying its motion to change venue. NRG asserts that, because many of the jurors\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   the county officials named as defendants in this case, a fair trial in Choctaw County was impossible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. We hold that the Mississippi Department of Revenue (the \"DOR\") regulation controlled and that NRG's expert applied an unacceptable method to determine true value. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in excluding NRG's proffered expert testimony. Additionally, because NRG was afforded a fair and impartial jury, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to change venue. We affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. NRG owns a power plant located in Choctaw County. In calculating the ad valorem tax, the Choctaw County Tax Assessor determined that the true value of the facility was $467,213,070. Having itself appraised the true value of the facility at $110,000,000, NRG appeared before the Choctaw County Board of Supervisors (the \"Board\") in protest. Upon reconsideration, the Board discovered a calculation error and found that the true value of the facility was actually $559,974,970, or $92,761,900 more than the tax assessor's initial valuation. NRG appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. NRG designated Mark R. Simzyk as its valuation expert and submitted his report. In calculating the true value of the facility, Simzyk first determined the value of the facility under the sales-comparison approach, the income approach, and the cost approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He then reconciled the three results, finding the true value of the facility to be $180,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. After the close of discovery, the County moved to exclude Simzyk's expert testimony. The County argued that Simzyk utilized methods for determining the true value of industrial personal property different from the method mandated by state law and regulation. NRG countered that, since the circuit court must hear NRG's tax appeal anew, Simzyk's appraisal would assist in determining the true value of the facility. NRG asserted that the County ignored the clear language of Mississippi Code Section 27-35-50 (Rev. 2017), which defines \"true value\" as encompassing all approaches to value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. In its order granting the County's motion to exclude Simzyk's expert testimony, the circuit court noted that no DOR regulations allowed a taxpayer to use a method other than the one prescribed by\n   state law and regulation. Allowing Simzyk to testify to an appraisal based on a method other than the method prescribed by the DOR would contradict the guidelines established for expert witnesses, such as\n   <em>\n    Daubert v.

When asked by the circuit court, seventy-two members of the venire admitted they knew the tax assessor. Following the court's voir dire examination, NRG moved for a change of venue, contending that most of the venire knew the tax assessor. In response, the County pointed out that knowing a party is different from being biased. The circuit court took the motion under advisement to be renewed at the close of voir dire. Upon renewal, the circuit court overruled NRG's motion for a change of venue. The circuit court concluded that a majority of the venire could be fair and that those who could not were to be struck for cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A twelve-member jury with two alternates was sworn in. After a four-day trial, the jury found for the County. The circuit court entered judgment on March 27, 2017, awarding the County $533,827.80 together with 8 percent interest per year.

Exclusion of Expert Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 12. NRG contends the circuit court erred in excluding its proffered expert testimony. It argues that, since this appeal stems from a trial de novo in the circuit court, the DOR regulations do not apply. This Court disagrees. NRG ignores well-established DOR regulations and misinterprets its proffered authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 13. NRG cites Mississippi Code Section 11-51-77.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It provides that \"[a]ny person aggrieved by a decision of the board of supervisors ... as to the assessment of taxes ... may ... appeal to the circuit court of the county.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-51-77\">\n    Miss.

In\n   <em>\n    Lenoir\n   </em>\n   , this Court held that the requirement of filing a bill of exceptions with the circuit court to appeal the decision of the board of supervisors under Mississippi Code Section 11-51-75 was superseded by the timely filing of a complaint with the circuit court under\n   Section 11-51-77.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7468197\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/641/1124/#p1132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This Court observed that, under Section 11-51-77, \"cases appealed to the circuit court from the board of supervisors are tried 'anew.'

NRG is correct that Section 11-57-77 applies and that a tax appeal is tried in the circuit court without consideration of the actions of the tax assessor or board of supervisors. But NRG goes too far in arguing that trying the case anew would exclude not only the proceedings of the board of supervisors, but also the underlying substantive statutes and regulations. The\n   <em>\n    Lenoir\n   </em>\n   Court simply stated that a trial de novo requires a new trial by the circuit court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7468197\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/641/1124/#p1132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The circuit court reviews only the decision of the board of supervisors, not the board's proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7468197\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/641/1124/#p1132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nowhere in\n   <em>\n    Lenoir\n   </em>\n   does the Court equate \"proceedings\" with the underlying law or regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 15. NRG also relies on\n   <em>\n    Rebelwood, Ltd. v.

There, this Court cited Mississippi Code Section 27-35-50(2) and discussed the \"three statutorily-authorized approaches to value: the cost approach, the income capitalization approach, and the market data or competitive sales approach.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7571140\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/544/1356/#p1360\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But NRG fails to consider the rest of the statute, which continues that the DOR determines the approach or approaches used and that, \"for differing types of categories of property, differing approaches may be appropriate.\" Miss. Code. Ann. \u00a7 27-35-50(2).\n   <em>\n    Rebelwood\n   </em>\n   dealt with a federally subsidized apartment complex, which is classified as Class II real property.\n   <em>\n    Rebelwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7571140\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/544/1356/#p1360\">\n    544 So.2d at 1358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . NRG's facility is classified as an industrial personal property. The entirety of Section 27-35-50(2) makes clear that different classifications of property use different methods of determining true value as determined by the DOR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 16. NRG also cites the\n   <em>\n    Rebelwood\n   </em>\n   Court's observation: \"Rarely is the day when a competent appraisal may be based on a single approach.\" But this approach is outdated. After\n   <em>\n    Rebelwood\n   </em>\n   , the Legislature enacted Mississippi Code Section 27-35-50(4)(d). This statute mandates that the tax assessor use only one prescribed method, not a combination of methods, to determine the true value of affordable rental housing. Miss. Code. Ann. \u00a7 27-35-50(4)(d) (Rev. 2017). This Court upheld Section 27-35-50(4)(d) as constitutional in\n   <em>\n    Willow Bend Estates, LLC v. Humphreys County Board of Supervisors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867537\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/166/494/\">\n    166 So.3d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2013). Like in\n   <em>\n    Willow Bend\n   </em>\n   , NRG's expert used a valuation method different from the mandated approach. This Court held that the use of an approach other than the approach prescribed in the statute was not permitted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867537\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/166/494/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because Section 27-35-50 gives the DOR the exclusive authority to determine the method to be used to calculate true value, the DOR's regulation is mandatory and binding, as was the statute in\n   <em>\n    Willow Bend\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 17. Because the DOR mandates the use of the trended historical cost-less-depreciation approach to calculate the true value of property classified as industrial personal property (like NRG's facility) and because NRG's expert did not use this mandated approach, the circuit court did not err in excluding NRG's proffered expert testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Denial of NRG's Motion for a Change of Venue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 18.

NRG argues that the circuit court erred in denying its motion to change venue because a majority of the ninety-one-person venire knew the tax assessor and the Board; therefore, they were not afforded a fair and impartial jury. We disagree. As the circuit court noted, \"there is a big difference\" between merely knowing someone and having a direct connection with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 20. While it is true that many of the jurors stated they\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   the tax assessor and the Board, this does not mean that they were biased.
