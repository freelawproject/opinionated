For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 1, 2015, Tonyel Singleton was involved in an automobile accident with Jamie Lynn Petkovich. No suit was filed against Ms. Petkovich or her liability insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (\"State Farm\"). On August 5, 2016, Ms. Singleton executed a release, in consideration of State Farm's liability policy limits of $15,000.00, which stated, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   the undersigned hereby releases and forever discharges Louis Petkovich, Julie Petkovich, Jayna Petkovich, Jamie Lynn Petkovich and State Farm Mutual, their heirs, executors, administrators, agents and assigns, and\n   <em>\n    all other persons, firms or corporations liable or, who might be claimed to be liable\n   </em>\n   , none of whom admit any liability to the undersigned but all expressly deny any liability, from any and all claims, demands, damages, actions, causes of action or suits of any kind or nature whatsoever, and particularly on account of all bodily injuries, known and unknown, which has resulted or may in the future\n   develop from an accident which occurred on or about the 1st day of July, 2015, at or near, Gretna, LA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Also on August 5, 2016, Ms. Singleton filed a petition for damages against USAA, her uninsured/underinsured motorist (\"UM\") insurer. In due course, on August 4, 2017, USAA filed a peremptory exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   asserting that the clear and unambiguous language of the release, discharging \"all other persons, firms or corporations liable or, who might be claimed to be liable,\" demonstrated Ms. Singleton's intent to release and discharge USAA from the causes of action asserted against it in her petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Singleton filed an opposition to the exception, arguing that the release was a relative simulation\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that by looking outside of the release, specifically to correspondence between Ms. Singleton and State Farm, and between Ms. Singleton and USAA, the true intent of the parties was revealed-that Ms. Singleton released State Farm and its insureds in exchange for State Farm's policy limits and never intended to compromise her claims against USAA. Ms. Singleton also argued that regardless of the intent,\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   is not applicable in this case since USAA was not a party to the release agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following a hearing, by written judgment rendered and signed on September 7, 2017, the trial court granted the peremptory exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and dismissed all claims against USAA with prejudice. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, Ms. Singleton argues that the trial court erred: 1) in granting the exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   based on a compromise raised by a non-party to that compromise; and 2) in refusing to consider extrinsic evidence regarding the intent of the parties to the compromise when there is evidence in the record substantiating that she did not intend to compromise her claim against USAA for UM benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW AND ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under Louisiana law, a release executed in exchange for consideration is a compromise.\n   <em>\n    Tran v.

La. C.C. art. 3071 defines a compromise as a contract whereby the parties, through concessions made by one or more of them, settle a dispute or an uncertainty concerning an obligation or other legal relationship. A compromise settles only those differences that the parties clearly intended to settle, including the necessary consequences of what they express. La. C.C. art. 3076. A compromise precludes the parties from bringing a subsequent action based upon the matter that was compromised. La. C.C. art. 3080.

There, the plaintiff filed suit against the tortfeasor and his liability insurer, USAgencies, and the plaintiff's own UM insurer, State Farm, for injuries sustained in an accident. State Farm was never served and was later dismissed without prejudice from the suit. Subsequently, the plaintiff executed a release agreement, releasing \"USAgencies Casualty Insurance Company, [the tortfeasor], and any and all persons, firms and corporations of and from any and all actions, causes of action, claims or demands for damages ....\" The plaintiff then filed suit against State Farm. In response, State Farm filed a peremptory exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , asserting that the suit should be dismissed because the broad language of the release dismissed all claims arising out the accident, including any claims against State Farm as UM carrier. The trial court granted the exception.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 935-936. On appeal, the majority of this Court found that the broad language of the executed release, which it found was clear and unambiguous, evidenced an intent on the plaintiff's part to settle and dismiss claims against anyone arising out of the accident, including State Farm. Thus, the release operated as a dismissal of the claims against State Farm, and the plaintiff's claims were thus precluded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 938-939.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The majority in\n   <em>\n    Silva\n   </em>\n   adopted the reasoning set forth by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Tran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .

The plaintiff executed a release discharging the driver of the vehicle he was a passenger in and his insurer. The plaintiff then filed suit against the tortfeasor, his employer, and their insurer (\"the defendants\").

The doctor filed an exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   claiming the language of the settlement agreement barred any claims against her and her insurer, and the trial court granted the exception based on the broad language of the release.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7064521\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/16/1234/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7064521\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/16/1234/\">\n    at 1236-1237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, we find, as the other circuit courts of this state have found, that a party asserting\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   based on a compromise agreement must have been a party to the compromise agreement. In the present case, it is undisputed that USAA was not a party to the compromise agreement. USAA was neither named in the compromise agreement, nor did it sign the compromise agreement, nor did it contribute to the proceeds involved in the compromise agreement. Because USAA was not a party to the compromise agreement, it cannot prevail on its exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, based on this \"same parties\" requirement, we find that the trial court erred as a matter of law in granting the exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   filed by USAA, and accordingly, we reverse the judgment that granted the exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and remand the matter for further proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Considering our finding in favor of Ms. Singleton on her first assignment of error, we pretermit any review or discussion of her second assignment of error (that the trial court erred in refusing to consider extrinsic evidence regarding the intent of the parties to the compromise when there is evidence in the record substantiating that she did not intend to compromise her claim against USAA for UM benefits).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial court's judgment that granted the peremptory exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   filed by USAA and remand the matter for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     REVERSED AND REMANDED\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    A contract is a simulation when, by mutual agreement, it does not express the true intent of the parties.
