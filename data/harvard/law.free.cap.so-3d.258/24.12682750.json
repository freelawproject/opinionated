As the facts have not materially changed since that opinion, we adopt the facts set forth therein by reference as though set forth in full herein:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   In this criminal matter, the thirteen-year-old victim, A.G.,\n   <sup>\n    1\n   </sup>\n   was at her house on the morning of April 17, 2014, when her mother, Mitzi Gormanous, left with her older daughter and grandson to go shopping. A.G. did not go shopping because she was punished for inappropriate behavior. When they returned approximately an hour and a half later, A.G. was gone. This was the second time that A.G. had run away according to her mother, and following a brief search, Gormanous called the sheriff's office and reported A.G. as a runaway. A.G. was found later that day when she went to the sheriff's station with Mrs. Judith Knox.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Mrs. Knox was the grandmother of her friend, Alexis Knox, and with whom Alexis lived. A.G.'s trial testimony indicates\n   that on the morning in question, she planned on running away to Alexis's house. As such, she packed a bag with her clothes and began walking towards her destination. As she was walking, Shaikh, who was driving his car, stopped and asked A.G. if she needed a ride. A.G. obliged and asked to be taken to Alexis's house. Since Alexis was not going to be home until later that day, Shaikh and A.G. went to the Dairy Queen drive-through to get food, went to Shaikh's friend's apartment, ran other errands, and finally ended up at Alexis's house. A.G. alleged that during this time, Shaikh kissed her cheek, tickled her, slapped her butt, and professed his love for her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   As a result, Shaikh was charged on June 12, 2014 with one count of simple kidnapping, a violation of La.R.S. 14:45, and one count of indecent behavior with a juvenile, a violation of La.R.S. 14:81. Following a three-day jury trial which began on February 23, 2014, Shaikh was convicted as charged. Shaikh subsequently filed a Motion for New Trial and a Motion for Post-Verdict Judgment of Acquittal Pursuant to Code of Criminal Procedure Article 821, which the trial court summarily denied on April 2, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 13, 2014, Shaikh was sentenced to five years, with two years suspended, on the simple kidnapping conviction. As to the indecent behavior with a juvenile conviction, he was sentenced to seven years with three years suspended. Both sentences were ordered to be served concurrently with Shaikh receiving credit for time served, for a total of four years of incarceration and five years of supervised probation upon release. He was also ordered to pay a fine of $2,500 on each count, plus court costs. The general conditions of probation were ordered, along with $500 to be paid to the Criminal Court Fund, $300 for cost of prosecution, and $300 to the Public Defender's Fund. The fines, fees, and costs were ordered by the trial court to be paid on a twenty-four month payment plan. Shaikh subsequently filed a Motion to Reconsider Sentence which was denied by the trial court on May 4, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <sup>\n    1\n   </sup>\n   The victim's initials are used to protect the victim's identity as required by La.R.S. 46:1844(W).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

He argues that maximum sentences, even if imposed concurrently, are reserved for the most serious of offenses and the worst offenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In this case, Defendant was convicted of indecent behavior with a juvenile, a violation of La.R.S. 14:81, which provides for a sentencing range of imprisonment of not more than seven years, with or without hard labor. La.R.S. 14:81(H)(1). He was also convicted of simple kidnapping, a violation of La.R.S. 14:45, which provides for a range of imprisonment of not more than five years, with or without hard labor. La.R.S. 14:45(B). Defendant received the maximum sentence for each offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With regard to the maximum sentence imposed on the conviction for indecent behavior with a juvenile, the trial court noted at the sentencing hearing that Defendant had no criminal history. It further discussed the range of punishment for the offenses of which Defendant was convicted, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Well, let me dispel that situation. I do not find the evidence-I do not find that that version of events is what happened on this occasion. I heard all of the evidence, and I do not feel that Mr. Shaikh thought that this was a traveling salesperson. I believe that more likely the situation that was described is that Mr. Shaikh saw this young girl walking down the side of the road and made an intentional decision to turn around.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   And, thankfully for this young lady, Mr. Shaikh is a very meek and mild-mannered person who only took this as far as the young victim allowed it to go. And my belief is that it would have gone, on the other hand, as far as-Mr. Shaikh would have taken this as far as the young victim would have allowed it to go.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Now, I'm not going to sentence Mr. Shaikh based upon what he might have done or what he could have done. He was convicted of these two charges based upon the evidence that was presented; and so I'm going to sentence him based upon what he did do, not what he might have done. And I do not believe that that merits the maximum penalty of two maximum sentences run consecutive. It certainly deserves punishment, lengthy prison sentences, to make sure that it doesn't happen again and that Mr. Shaikh understands that this kind of conduct is unacceptable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court imposed the maximum sentence of seven years' imprisonment at hard labor, with three years of Defendant's sentence suspended, on his conviction for indecent behavior with a juvenile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While discussing a maximum sentence imposed on a conviction for indecent behavior with a juvenile, this court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In this case, the defendant fondled the victim's breasts and buttocks. Clearly, society finds such activity inexcusable.

Although there was touching, a pat on the buttocks, a kiss on the cheek, and tickling, the degree of touching was not comparable with the touching in the above cited cases wherein the courts imposed a maximum sentence. Furthermore, there was no testimony indicating that the victim suffered any great psychological injury. In the hour-long videotaped statement given by the victim, she briefly told the interviewer about her afternoon with Defendant. She spent the remainder of the interview discussing her boyfriend. As such, we find that the trial court abused its discretion when it imposed the maximum sentence regarding Defendant's conviction for indecent behavior with a juvenile. We remand the matter to the trial court to render a sentence on the conviction for indecent behavior with a juvenile in conjunction with the\n   <em>\n    Lisotta\n   </em>\n   factors set out above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    DECREE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The sentence imposed on Defendant, Fahim A. Shaikh, for his conviction of indecent behavior with a juvenile is constitutionally excessive. We vacate his sentence and remand the matter to the trial court for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    VACATED AND REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
