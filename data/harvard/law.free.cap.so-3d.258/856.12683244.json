The trial court determined that Randal was a permissive user when he was driving a truck owned by owned by AES Drilling Fluids, LLC, which was covered by an uninsured/underinsured (UM) insurance policy issued by Commerce. The issue raised on appeal is whether Randal's son, Micah Boudreaux, had the authority to give permission to Randal to drive the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Micah worked for AES and was given a truck to use as part of his job. On April 2, 2015, Micah was working on the water well at his house in Lake Charles. His father was living with him at the time, so he asked his father to take the truck and go to Lowe's to get some parts he needed. While at Lowe's, Randal ran into a friend who needed a ride home. Randal was on his way to drop the friend off when he stopped south of the intersection of Common Street and Madeline Street and was rear-ended by Keigan Hanks. Randal alleges\n   he received injuries because of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Randal filed suit against Keigan and her insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. He also filed suit against Commerce, the UM insurer of AES. Subsequently, AES filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal from the lawsuit. Randal then filed a partial motion for summary judgment claiming that he is an insured under the Commerce policy as a permissive driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A hearing on the cross motions for summary judgment was held on November 28, 2017. Denying Commerce's motion for summary judgment and granting Randal's partial motion for summary judgment, the trial court held that Randal was a permissive user under the Commerce insurance policy. Judgment was signed on January 3, 2018, declaring the judgment to be a final judgment. Commerce then appealed the judgment to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A moving party is entitled to summary judgment when it shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is \"entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(A)(3). Summary judgment is favored by law and provides a vehicle by which \"the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination\" of an action may be achieved.

In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the judge's role is not to evaluate the weight of the evidence or to determine the truth of the matter, but instead to determine whether there is a genuine issue of triable fact. All doubts should be resolved in the non-moving party's favor.\n   <em>\n    Hines v.

A fact is material if it potentially ensures or precludes recovery, affects a litigant's ultimate success, or determines the outcome of the legal dispute. A genuine issue is one as to which reasonable persons could disagree; if reasonable persons could reach only one conclusion, there is no need for a trial on that issue and summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9381231\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/876/764/#p765\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9381231\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/876/764/#p765\">\n    at 765-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   On motion for summary judgment, the burden of proof remains with the movant.

In the present case, Commerce did put such a restriction in writing. Commerce presented evidence of its Human Resources Policy 17.0 Driving Rules and Guidelines, which was signed by Micah on August 13, 2014, and stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   It is the policy of AES Drilling Fluids;[sic] LLC that only authorized operators or drivers are allowed to drive company owned or leased vehicles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   All vehicles are primarily for business use. Vehicles are provided for expressed business purposes and can only be operated by the assigned driver, or another approved driver of the company. Any deviation from the above policy by a driver is subject to disciplinary action and/or termination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    I hereby acknowledge that I have read and understood AES Drilling Fluids, LLC's Driving Rules and Guidelines Policy:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Micah also signed another document on August 13, 2014, entitled Authorization for Payroll Deduction for Company Vehicles, which states: \"I,\n   <em>\n    Micah Boudreaux,\n   </em>\n   hereby acknowledge that I have read AES Drilling Fluids, LLC's Company Vehicle Use Policy, and understand its provisions. Furthermore, I declare that I choose to use a company vehicle and allow AES Drilling Fluids, LLC to deduct $80.77 per paycheck, for personal use of the vehicle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   When deposed, Micah agreed that he signed these documents at the training facility in Houston. At the time of his employment with AES, Micah was given the option of receiving $900.00 a month in extra pay for using his own personal vehicle for work travel. Micah explained that he instead opted in for a deduction of $80.77 from his paycheck every two weeks for insurance so he could have personal use of a company truck. He then sold his personal truck. Micah testified that he understood that the truck was his to use as he pleased on his time off. Although Micah agreed that AES was not aware that his father would drive his truck, he did not think he had to get AES's permission for someone to drive his truck when he was not working since he was paying for insurance to use AES's truck personally. After the accident, Micah's employment with AES was terminated for a policy violation of the driving rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We find it reasonably foreseeable that Micah would allow his father, who was living with him, to drive the truck when Micah was using it personally. Even the written policies he signed contemplated personal use. While the restriction noted that the truck was to be used primarily for business, it was not limited strictly to business use. He had personally paid for insurance to have personal use of the truck. It\n   is reasonable to assume that Micah was not to allow anyone else to drive his truck when he was using the truck for business purposes but that it was his truck to use as he liked when he was using the truck for personal purposes. Under these circumstances, it is reasonably foreseeable that Micah would allow someone else to use the truck to run an errand for him. The trial court was correct in finding that Randal had implied permission from AES to use the truck and that the Commerce policy provided UM coverage to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed. Costs of this appeal are assessed to Commerce and Industry Insurance Company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
