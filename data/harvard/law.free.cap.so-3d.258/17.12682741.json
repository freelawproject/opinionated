On June 18, 2013, Defendant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence, arguing that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   rendered his sentence improper. In that motion, he sought to have his sentence vacated and to receive a new sentencing hearing. He filed a second motion on July 10, 2013, seeking to be resentenced pursuant to the next lesser offense. These motions were ultimately dismissed; at the time Louisiana courts did not consider the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   holding to be retroactive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant filed a third motion to correct an illegal sentence on March 3, 2016, in light of the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

After various hearing dates were re-set or continued, and Defendant filed two memoranda in support of his claims, the district court held a hearing on March 27, 2017.

At the time those cases were decided, C.Cr.P. 814 provided for a responsive verdict of \"guilty without capital punishment\" for murder and aggravated rape. C.Cr.P. 817, at that time, also authorized the \"qualified\" verdict of \"guilty without capital punishment,\" in which case the sentence would be life imprisonment. Thus, reasoning that the responsive verdict of guilty without capital punishment was the next authorized verdict for the crime, we remanded for resentencing as if that verdict has been returned, and, under C.Cr.P. 817, life imprisonment was called for.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   The situation has changed. In an attempt to overcome\n   <em>\n    Furman's\n   </em>\n   objections to the death penalty, the legislature amended the murder statute to provide for first and second degree murder, making death mandatory for first degree murder. Likewise, the death penalty for aggravated rape was mandatory. To accomplish this, the legislature amended C.Cr.P. 814 to do away with the responsive verdict of \"guilty without capital punishment\" for first degree murder and aggravated rape. Thus, at the time this crime was committed, November 26, 1974, the only responsive verdicts to a charge of aggravated rape were guilty; guilty of attempted aggravated rape; guilty of simple rape; not guilty. Additionally, C.Cr.P. 817 was amended to delete the provision authorizing the qualifying verdict \"guilty without capital punishment.\" Thus there is no longer any authority for us to remand an aggravated rape case for resentencing to life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   At the time (November 26, 1974) this crime was committed, attempted aggravated rape was punishable by imprisonment for not more than twenty years. R.S. 14:27 D(1). Simple rape carried a penalty of one to twenty years. R.S. 14:43. Thus, following the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Singleton\n   </em>\n   , supra, we remand this case for resentencing of defendant to the most serious penalty for the next lesser included offense. The legislature obviously intended to impose the most serious penalty available under\n   the law.

Thus, in reality, a juvenile who commits a\n   <em>\n    non-homicide\n   </em>\n   offense punishable by life in Louisiana is only promised the possibility of being released on parole. It stands to reason that a juvenile who commits a\n   <em>\n    homicide\n   </em>\n   offense punishable by life imprisonment should be granted no greater relief. As the Attorney General points out, if the mere possibility of being released on parole is sufficient to satisfy the mandatory parole eligibility established in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   for juvenile non-homicide offenders, the mere possibility of being released on parole is more than sufficient to satisfy the chance of parole eligibility after a hearing established in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   for juvenile homicide offenders. As the Louisiana Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Shaffer\n   </em>\n   regarding\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , the mere access to the Board of Parole's consideration satisfies the mandates of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    State v.
