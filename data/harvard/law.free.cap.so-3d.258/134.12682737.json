After our review of the record, and for the reasons that follow, we affirm both the conviction and the sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   By bill of information dated March 13, 2015, Mr. Bibbins was charged with the January 3, 2015 second degree battery of Keith McGuire. At his arraignment on April 8, 2015, Mr. Bibbins pleaded not guilty. At the preliminary hearing, the trial court denied Mr. Bibbins' motion to suppress identification, found probable cause to substantiate the charge against Mr. Bibbins, and set a trial date for June 17, 2015. The matter was continued numerous times (at the requests of both the State and Mr. Bibbins).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Bibbins was tried before a six member jury on March 13-14, 2017 and was unanimously found guilty of the charge. He filed a Motion for New Trial, which was denied on April 17, 2017. Mr. Bibbins then waived the sentencing delays and was sentenced on April 21, 2017 to five years at hard labor with credit for time served. At that time, the State filed a multiple bill of information, and on October 5, 2017, Mr. Bibbins was adjudicated a second felony offender. The trial court vacated his original sentence and re-sentenced him to ten years at hard labor without the benefit of probation or suspension of sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Errors Patent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We have reviewed the record for errors patent and found none.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In second-degree battery cases, the offense requires proof of a specific intent to inflict \"serious bodily harm. Serious bodily injury is defined as injury that involves unconsciousness, extreme physical pain, or protracted and obvious disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty, or a substantial risk of death. Specific intent is defined as that state of mind that exists when the circumstances indicate that the offender actively desired the prescribed criminal consequences to follow his act or failure to act. Therefore, the elements of second-degree battery are: (1) the intentional use of force or violence upon the person of another, (2) without the consent of the victim, (3) when the offender has the specific intent to inflict serious bodily injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The term \"extreme physical pain\" as used in the statute refers to \"a condition which most people of common intelligence can understand; it is considered subjective in nature and susceptible to interpretation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9286509\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/871/1235/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Internal footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The evidence in this matter reflects that, on January 3, 2015, Mr. Bibbins struck the victim, Keith McGuire, who was at a yard sale, which caused Mr. McGuire to suffer a broken jaw, requiring surgery at Tulane Medical Center.

Moreover, unlike\n   <em>\n    Helou\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Broussard\n   </em>\n   , here, the State introduced the victim's medical records, which verified the necessity of corrective surgery, the administration of prescription IV pain medication, hospitalization and recovery.

A fractured jaw, requiring hospitalization and corrective surgery, as well as the administration of intravenous pain medication during the hospitalization, would certainly meet the statutorily required element of \"extreme physical pain\" to those of even \"common intelligence.\" Accordingly, we find that the jury's conclusion that Mr. Bibbins intentionally inflicted serious bodily injury on Mr. McGuire is supported by the record, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, jury could conclude that the State proved the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Self-defense\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mr. Bibbins next contends that the State failed to establish \"that the alleged second degree battery was not justified beyond a reasonable doubt\" given that Mr. Bibbins acted in self-defense.

Mr. McGuire was consistent and unyielding as to what led him to swing at Mr. Bibbins, although he made no contact. According to Mr. McGuire, he was at a yard sale and he observed Mr. Bibbins drive by in his BMW, stop and exit the vehicle. Mr. McGuire was well familiar with Mr. Bibbins, as he had seen him in the neighborhood.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Mr. McGuire's testimony, Mr. Bibbins \"ran up on [him] ... from around the corner ... look[ing] like he was running to try to attack [him].\" Mr. McGuire again testified that \"it looked like he was coming to attack [him]\" and that because he \"can't run cuz' [he has] no cartilage in [his] knees and so, ... when he got close to [him] [he] just tried to swing on him first.\" However, \"[he] missed\" and when \"[Mr. Bibbins] swung he connected.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   When Mr. McGuire was questioned about Mr. Bibbins' claim that he was the aggressor, Mr. McGuire explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   I don't appreciate nobody running up on me and especially a little teenagers....

Attached to its Notice were copies of documents, including police reports substantiating the other crimes evidence. During the course of trial, the trial court indicated that the evidence would be admissible. The trial court advised that, with respect to the other crimes evidence, it would provide an appropriate charge during the jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   At trial, the State introduced evidence through various police officers and detectives of several other arrests and incidents: a February 24, 2008 arrest for possession with intent to distribute marijuana and illegal carrying of a weapon; an April 13, 2008 arrest for shooting during a second-line parade for which he pleaded guilty to aggravated battery and received a five year sentence; a December 17, 2013 arrest for narcotics and parole violations which occurred while Mr. Bibbins was driving a black BMW; four traffic violations (March 27, 2013, December 11, 2014, December 15, 2014 and February 28, 2015) all of which occurred while Mr. Bibbins was driving a black BMW; and an August 3, 2015 shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   At the end of trial, the trial court gave the following instructions to the jury with respect to the other crimes evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   ... the court will read evidence that the defendant was involved in the commission of offenses other than the offense for which he is on trial is to be considered only for a limited purpose and the sole purpose for which such evidence may be considered as to whether it tends to show and then I will say \"identity.\" And again, remember the accused is only on trial for the offense charged. You may not find him guilty of this offense merely because he may have committed another offense....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   After our review of the record, we find that the evidence was properly admitted to prove identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   At trial, Mr. McGuire was clearly reluctant to testify against Mr. Bibbins.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When questioned by the State as to how his jaw became broken, Mr. McGuire testified that \"[s]ome man attacked me.\" At\n   trial, he could not recall making a 911 call on the date of the incident, and, when a recording of the 911 call was played for the jury, in which the caller identified himself as \"Keith McGuire,\" Mr. McGuire was asked if that was the 911 call he made. He replied that he couldn't remember because it was more than two years ago. When asked if he could recognize his voice, Mr. McGuire stated, \"[n]ot really.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On the 911 call, Mr. McGuire was asked whether he could identify the man who struck him, and he replied, \"[n]ot really, I see him around.\" At trial, Mr. McGuire explained this statement in identifying the man who struck him: \"I seen him around the neighborhood. He lives in that neighborhood.\" In the 911 call, Mr. McGuire also indicated that the man who struck him drives a black BMW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   When questioned about his statement identifying the man who struck him as \"Mo,\" Mr. McGuire indicated that he could not recall making that statement to the officer who interviewed him. He also testified initially that he could not recall making an identification from a line-up at his home of the man who struck him. When the audio recording made during that line-up procedure was played for him, Mr. McGuire identified his voice only by saying that he \"guess[ed]\" it was his voice because it \"sound[ed] like [him].\" However, he stated that the recording did not remind him of the line-up procedure because \"it was so long ago.\" While in the recording, he identified the picture of the man who struck him, at trial, when asked if he had made that identification, Mr. McGuire stated \"I don't know. It's two years ago.\" He later testified, again evasively, about who had struck him: \"If that's who I identified, that's who broke my jaw.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Mr. McGuire ultimately admitted that he knew Mr. Bibbins' mother (and, had had a few dates with her) and that she had \"paid [him] off\" so that he would not testify at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Upon further questioning, when asked if he had been able to give the name of the man who struck him to the doctors at the hospital, Mr. McGuire stated \"[n]o. Just the name Mo.\" He then testified that Mo had \"run up on me. And then that's when I swung. Cuz' he was running up on me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Mr. McGuire did not identify anyone other than a man whose nickname is \"Mo\" as the person who struck him. Accordingly, that identity was not clearly established by Mr. McGuire. By way of the other crimes evidence, the State established that the man nicknamed \"Mo\" and who drives a black BMW is Mr. Bibbins; without that other crimes evidence, there is a lack of evidence linking the person nicknamed \"Mo\" with Mr. Bibbins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As concerns the December, 2013 arrest of Mr. Bibbins, New Orleans Police Department (\"NOPD\") Detective Walter Edmonds testified that he arrested Mr. Bibbins at his residence, which he indicated was two blocks away from where Mr. McGuire was struck. When he arrived at the residence, he saw a black BMW. During the course of his investigation, Det. Edmonds learned that the BMW was owned by Mr. Bibbins. This evidence corroborates Mr. McGuire's testimony of having seen Mr. Bibbins in the neighborhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Similarly, the officers who testified as to Mr. Bibbins various traffic violations identified Mr. Bibbins as the driver of a black BMW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As to the 2008 shooting at the second line parade, Sgt. Wayne DeLarge testified that, during his investigation, the perpetrator was identified as \"Mo.\" He learned \"the real identity\" of \"Mo\" when \"the shooting victim identified Mo as one Johnquell Bibbins.\" Likewise, Det. Joseph Jefferson, who was familiar with Mr. Bibbins from previous encounters also testified that \"Johnquell Bibbins goes by the nickname of \"Mo.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As concerns the August 3, 2015 shooting, Detective Joseph Jefferson testified that he learned the identity of the shooting suspect as \"Mo,\" who drove a \"black luxury vehicle.\" He ultimately tied the vehicle and the nickname to Mr. Bibbins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the other crimes and acts into evidence to establish Mr. Bibbins' identity, particularly given the trial court's limiting jury instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Moreover, even if the trial court erred in allowing the evidence, the admission of other crimes evidence is subject to harmless error analysis.\n   <em>\n    State v.

C.E. art. 803(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He argues that\n   the custodian must be able to say that the record, document or recording was made at or near the time it was received, is made and kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and it was the regular practice of that business activity to make and to keep the recordings or record. He further argues that because neither Sgt. Powers nor his department made or kept the incident recalls and 911 records, the recording was not authenticated and its introduction violated the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   At trial, Sergeant Powers testified that he is employed in the Communications Center of the NOPD. In that capacity, he is a custodian of records for incident recall reports and recorded 911 calls. He testified that all 911 calls received by the department are recorded and assigned an item recall number for future investigative purposes. Each call generates an incident recall report which contains information pertinent to the call - the number called, the date the call was made and the name of the caller. These 911 calls are computerized in the regular course of business and can be generated on request. The calls and incident recalls are then routinely turned over to the NOPD, which maintains the evidence through its regular course of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In this case, Sgt. Powers listened to the 911 call and reviewed the incident recall prior to trial. He confirmed the association of the incident report to this case by its item number, indicating that the information in the report corresponded with the 911 call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   More importantly, Mr. McGuire, himself, identified his voice on the 911 calls. Accordingly, there can be no genuine issue as to the authenticity of the calls or the incident recall report. We find no abuse of the trial court's discretion in admitting the 911 call and the incident recall report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In his last assignment of error, Mr. Bibbins maintains that the sentence he received \"is excessive, cruel and unusual punishment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Conceding that he did not receive the maximum sentence available,\n   he nevertheless argues that the minimum sentence (of four years, or at the most, six years) \"was the most appropriate.\" His argument focuses on Mr. McGuire's statement that he forgave Mr. Bibbins for the incident, Mr. McGuire's full recovery, and the fact that no weapons were involved in the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   This Court recently reiterated the well-settled standard for evaluating an excessive sentence claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Louisiana Constitution of 1974, art.

Mr. Bibbins was convicted of second degree battery, which, under La. R.S. 14:34.1, carries a sentence of not more than two thousand dollars or imprisonment with or without hard labor, for not more than eight years or both. His initial sentence of five years at hard labor, thus, fell within the scope of this statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As a second felony offender (and at the time of his October 5, 2017 sentencing), La. R.S. 15:529.1 A(1) provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   If the second felony is such that upon a first conviction the offender would be punishable by imprisonment for any term less than his natural life, then the sentence to imprisonment shall be for a determinate term not less than one-half the longest term and not more than twice the longest term prescribed for a first conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Accordingly, in Mr. Bibbins' case, the statute provided a sentencing range of four to sixteen years. The trial court sentenced Mr. Bibbins to ten years, which is well within the statutory limits, and in fact, is six years below the maximum sentence allowed for a conviction as a second offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Our jurisprudence reflects that, for legal sentences imposed within the range provided by the legislature, a trial court abuses its discretion only when it contravenes the prohibition of excessive punishment in La.
