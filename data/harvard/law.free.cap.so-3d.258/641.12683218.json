James was the owner, CEO, and majority stockholder of SBI. SBI is a holding company which holds 100% of the stock of Sabine State Bank and Trust Company (SSBTC). Prior to James's death, Cynthia owned 1,406 shares of SBI stock. Upon James's\n   death, Cynthia inherited 3,020.5 shares of his stock, making her an owner of approximately 44% of SBI stock. Litigation subsequently ensued between Cynthia and Jim regarding their father's succession and division of the stock.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Succession of Cole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12-802%20%28La.App.%203%20Cir.%2012/26/12%29\">\n    12-802 (La.App. 3 Cir. 12/26/12)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7002570\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/108/240/\">\n    108 So.3d 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 13-257 (La. 3/15/13),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7007297,7007338,7007247\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/109/384/\">\n    109 So.3d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 7, 2016, Cynthia filed a Petition for Purchase of Shares against SBI, alleging that she was an oppressed shareholder under La.R.S. 12:1-1435 (\"oppressed shareholder statute\"). Cynthia sought to have SBI purchase her shares of stock at fair value as defined in the statute. On February 26, 2016, SBI filed a Peremptory Exception of No Cause of Action, arguing that the actions alleged in Cynthia's petition fail to constitute acts of oppression as defined in La.R.S. 12:1-1435. SBI argued that La.R.S. 12:1-1435 does not operate retroactively such that any alleged acts of oppression occurring before January 1, 2015, the date the oppressed shareholder statute became effective, cannot provide a cause of action under the statute. Cynthia filed an opposition memorandum. A hearing on the exception occurred on May 2, 2016, after which the trial court allowed the parties to file post-trial memoranda. On June 30, 2016, the trial court issued an Order with reasons granting SBI's exception, finding that the oppressed shareholder statute constitutes substantive law which can only be applied prospectively. The trial court further ordered Cynthia to file an amended petition, \"alleging only those acts of shareholder oppression that have occurred on or after January 1, 2015[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Cynthia filed a Motion to Certify Judgment as Final and Memorandum in Support, which was granted by the trial court on August 3, 2016. She, thereafter, filed a devolutive appeal, which the trial court granted on August 17, 2016. That record was lodged in this court under Docket Number 16-976. The trial court, however, issued a subsequent Order on October 4, 2016, instructing Cynthia to show cause why the appeal \"should not be dismissed as having been taken from a non-appealable, interlocutory judgment and/or a judgment lacking proper decretal language.\" In response, Cynthia filed a brief with this court on October 18, 2016. On November 16, 2016, this court, on its own motion, dismissed her appeal and held that the trial court's interlocutory ruling was \"incapable of being designated as final pursuant to La.Code Civ.P. art. 1915(B).\"\n   <em>\n    Cole v.

On January 17, 2017, the trial court issued an Amended Judgment granting the peremptory exception in part, dismissing Cynthia's claims for actions prior to January 1, 2015, pursuant to the oppressed shareholder statute, ordering her to amend her petition to allege acts occurring on or after January 1, 2015, and certifying it as a final and appealable judgment.

The oppressed shareholder statute protects minority shareholders in closely held corporations from the improper exercise of majority control by compelling the corporation to purchase their shares. Douglas K. Moll,\n   <em>\n    Shareholder Oppression and the New Louisiana Business Corporation Act\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Loy.%20L.%20Rev.%20461\">\n    60 Loy. L. Rev. 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The pertinent part of La.R.S. 12:1-1435 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A. If a corporation engages in oppression of a shareholder, the shareholder may withdraw from the corporation and require the corporation to buy all of the shareholder's shares at their fair value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   B. A corporation engages in oppression of a shareholder if the corporation's distribution, compensation, governance, and other practices, considered as a whole over an appropriate period of time, are plainly incompatible with a genuine effort on the part of the corporation to deal fairly and in good faith with the shareholder. Conduct that is consistent with the good faith performance of an agreement among all shareholders is presumed not to be oppressive. The following factors are relevant in assessing the fairness and good faith of the corporation's practices:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) The conduct of the shareholder alleging oppression.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (2) The treatment that a reasonable shareholder would consider fair under the circumstances, considering the reasonable expectations of all shareholders in the corporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The lengthy statute further explains the term \"fair value,\" the context of a transaction requiring appraisal, and the procedure\n   that must be utilized when asserting a cause of action under the statute. La.R.S. 12:1-1435.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In this case, the trial court found that the oppressed shareholder statute cannot apply to pre-2015 acts because, in accordance with La.Civ.Code art. 6, it is a substantive law which operates prospectively. In explaining the substantive nature of the statute, the trial court noted in its written June 30, 2016 Order that prior to the enactment of La.R.S. 12:1-1435, \"the legislature had not provided a remedy for shareholder oppression.\" The trial court concluded that the statute constituted a substantive change \"because it created a new right of action by a shareholder against a closely held corporation that engages in oppressive conduct not previously forbidden by statute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On appeal, Cynthia contends that the oppressed shareholder statute is a procedural law which operates retroactively to acts of oppression which occurred prior to January 1, 2015. SBI opposes, arguing that the statute is a substantive law which operates prospectively to acts of oppression occurring after January 1, 2015. As such, we must determine whether the trial court correctly held that La.R.S. 12:1-1435 is a substantive law which operates prospectively rather than a procedural law which operates retroactively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In Louisiana, \"substantive laws create and/or change rights, duties, and rules, while procedural laws provide the avenue by which those rights, duties, and rules are enforced.

Acts No. 328, \u00a7 1, and which became effective on January 1, 2015. The LBCA repealed and reenacted Chapter 1 of Title 12 to make the former Louisiana\n   business law consistent with the American Bar Association Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA). La.R.S. 12:1-101 ; 2014 La. Acts No. 328, \u00a7 1. Neither the oppressed shareholder statute nor the LBCA have expressed an intent regarding the retroactive or prospective application of the law. Therefore, we must employ the second part of the two-part test and determine whether La.R.S. 12:1-1435 was intended to be substantive or procedural.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Based upon our interpretation of the definition of procedural laws, the oppressed shareholder statute is procedural if a remedy for shareholder oppression existed prior to the statute's enactment. In that regard, Cynthia has not cited jurisprudence wherein a shareholder previously enjoyed the right to be paid the value of his or her shares upon proof of oppression, i.e., the right granted by La.R.S. 12:1-1435. Accordingly, that right did not exist prior to the LBCA's enactment because \"the corporation had no obligation to buy back the minority investor's shares.\" Glenn G.

The issue was whether a 1976 amendment to La.R.S. 23:1032, which granted immunity to the employer's executive officers under workers' compensation law, barred a wrongful death action against the executive officers when the decedent's occupational exposures occurred before the statute was amended, although his death from silicosis occurred after the amendment's effective date. The supreme court had to determine whether the statutory amendment, as applied to the facts of the case, operates retroactively. It relied on a formula set out by Planiol for identifying the only two situations when a law applies retroactively as: \"[A] law is retroactive when it goes back to the past either to\n   <em>\n    evaluate the conditions of the legality of an act\n   </em>\n   , or to modify or suppress the\n   <em>\n    effects of a right already acquired\n   </em>\n   .

Thus, the second situation is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   With respect to the first situation regarding the evaluation of the conditions of the legality of a past act, we note: \"Under Planiol's first situation in which a law operates retroactively, when a[n] intervening new law creates a cause of action, and thus attaches new consequences to past events, the retroactivity event is the conduct or activity regulated.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

In this case, shareholders, such as Cynthia, had no cause of action for acts of oppression prior to January 1, 2015. Thus, the oppressed shareholder statute creates a new cause of action against corporations, such as SBI. Application of the statute to SBI's activities which occurred prior to January 1, 2015, is impermissible under the laws of retroactivity. Consideration of SBI's acts prior to January 1, 2015, would attach new legal consequences to SBI's conduct prior to enactment of the statute. This would operate as an impermissible retroactive application of the statute. We, therefore, find that Cynthia's argument fails in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Cynthia further contends that motive and intent are relevant factors to be considered when determining whether a shareholder has been oppressed based upon the statute's requirement that a corporation must \"deal fairly and in good faith with the shareholder.\" La.R.S.12:1-1435(B). Notwithstanding the prohibition against retroactive application of substantive laws, she contends that pre-January 1, 2015 facts relating to oppression, such as motive and intent, can be considered in light of La.Code Evid. art. 404(B) (emphasis added), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Except as provided in Article 412, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of\n   <strong>\n    motive\n   </strong>\n   , opportunity,\n   <strong>\n    intent\n   </strong>\n   , preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident, provided that upon request by the accused, the prosecution in a criminal case shall provide reasonable notice in advance of trial, of the nature of any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial for such purposes, or when it relates to conduct that constitutes an integral part of the act or transaction that is the subject of the present proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In support of this argument, Cynthia cites\n   <em>\n    Monroe Medical Clinic, Inc. v.

The physician plaintiff filed suit on March 5, 1987, and he subsequently resigned as a hospital medical staff member on January 1, 1989. The trial court acknowledged the one-year period for bringing an action for unfair trade practices was peremptive and not subject to prescription. It also addressed the admissibility of events occurring before March 5, 1986, i.e., the beginning of the one-year peremptive period, and after the physician's January 1, 1989 resignation. The trial court held\n   that such events were perempted although they could be introduced into evidence to show motive, intent, or plan under La.Code Evid. art. 404(B)(1). The second circuit affirmed the trial court's holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We find that Cynthia's reliance on the second circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Monroe Medical Clinic\n   </em>\n   is misplaced because it concerns evidence of acts which were barred by peremption; whereas, the instant matter concerns evidence of acts which are barred by retroactivity. Therefore, we find the trial court in this case correctly ordered Cynthia to amend her petition to include only those alleged acts of oppression which took place after January 1, 2015, the effective date of the statute. Cynthia's second assignment or error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The trial court's judgment granting a Peremptory Exception of No Cause of Action in favor of Defendant/Appellee, Sabine Bancshares, Inc., is affirmed.
