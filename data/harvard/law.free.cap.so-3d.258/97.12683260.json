Defendant did not file an answer to the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff obtained a default judgment and confirmed the judgment after a hearing on the matter. The evidence presented at the confirmation hearing in support of Plaintiff's claims consisted of Plaintiff's testimony and the \"Sworn Narrative [Statement] of Treating Dentist,\" Dr. Adrian M. Simms, DDS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff testified at the hearing giving his account of the attack and explaining his injuries. He testified he did not provoke the incident. His injuries required emergency medical treatment at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital immediately following the attack. Plaintiff needed fifteen stitches to repair the damage to his upper lip. He visited his dentist two days after the incident, at which time he says Dr. Simms diagnosed a fracture to the backside of two of his front teeth. He made two additional visits regarding his injuries. According to this testimony, Plaintiff understood that the injury might heal on its own but only time would tell. As of the date of the hearing Plaintiff's injuries were not healed. Plaintiff explained he could not eat solid food for two months and endured \"a great amount of pain and suffering or anguish because of [his] injury\" and was still experiencing some level of pain as of the date of the hearing. He was unable to work his regular job as a private pilot for two months. Plaintiff testified his bill for the emergency room was $1,500 and his \"out of pocket cost\" for the dentist was \"about $1,200.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dr. Simms' written statement sets forth the following undisputed facts which corroborate Plaintiff's testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. Dr. Simms is a doctor of dental surgery and is a \"Master of the Academy of General Dentistry.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2. He treated Plaintiff for injuries described in Plaintiff's petition beginning on January 4, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   3. Plaintiff was \"hit in the mouth with great force.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   4. Plaintiff sustained fractures to two of his teeth referred to as \"# 24 and $25 [sic].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   5. Plaintiff's injuries to his teeth will require treatment at a cost of $2,590.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court awarded a total of $5,394.19 in damages itemized in the judgment as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Special damages, including lost wages, past medical,\n  </blockquote>\n  <pre id=\"p-20\">Past and future dental $2,894.19 General Damages $2,500</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff does not challenge the award of special damages but challenges the trial court's award of general damages asserting the award is abusively low.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 1703 provides: \"A final default judgment shall not be different in kind from that demanded in the petition.

In that case the plaintiff continued to suffer from his injuries a year after the accident and faced dental procedures at an estimated cost of $2,700. We increased Mr. Dubroc's general damage award to $25,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the reasons as stated we affirm the trial court's judgment below except we amend the general damage award to increase it to $10,000.00, this being the lowest amount reasonably within the court's discretion to compensate Plaintiff. All costs of this appeal are assessed against Defendant, Corey Seneca.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED AS AMENDED; RENDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    No documents or exhibits were attached to Dr. Simms' statement, and no certified medical records were introduced nor placed in evidence by trial counsel in support of Plaintiff's testimony. There are uncertified medical bills and a letter from Dr. Simms contained in this record which were attached to Plaintiff's \"Supplemental Memorandum In Support of Default Judgment\" filed on May 10, 2017, months after the confirmation hearing. Uncertified medical bills and a photographic copy of a letter attached to this supplemental memorandum are inadmissible hearsay.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
