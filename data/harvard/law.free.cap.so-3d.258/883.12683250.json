Defendant argues three assignments of error: (1) his constitutional rights were violated when the trial court refused to allow the parties any peremptory challenges in selecting the two alternate jurors; (2) his constitutional rights were violated when the trial court removed a juror and replaced her with an alternate; and (3) his sentences for armed robbery are excessive under the circumstances. Because we find merit to Defendant's second assignment of error arguing that the trial court erred by removing a seated juror and replacing her with an alternate over his objection, we reverse Defendant's convictions and remand for a new trial. We pretermit consideration of the other assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We find the facts regarding the underlying offenses irrelevant to the discussion of whether the trial court committed legal error when it removed a juror and replaced her with an alternate over Defendant's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Jury selection in this criminal proceeding occurred on April 3 and 4, 2017. On April 5, 2017, before any witnesses were sworn, the State informed the court that Defendant had telephoned his cousin and his aunt to find out whether a particular juror, Sharon Antoine, was related to him. The State played a recording of Defendant in open court. While there is no dispute that the contact took place, defense counsel suggested that Defendant's motives were benign. Juror Antoine was questioned in open court; and she advised that she had not been contacted by anyone about the case. Despite the lack of contact, the State argued for Antoine's removal, stating that La.Code Crim.P. art. 796 required her removal before the swearing of the first witness. At that time, the district court elected to remove Antoine and replace her with the first alternate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the hearing on the motion for a new trial, Defendant argued that Antoine's situation had not met the criteria for removal under Article 796. Specifically, he argued that the court had not made a finding of any improper contact with Antoine, but instead removed her due to a concern that Defendant or his family would renew efforts to contact Antoine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v. Tennors\n   </em>\n   , 05-538, pp. 5-16 (La.App. 3 Cir. 2/15/06),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8984692\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/923/823/#p827\">\n    923 So.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 827-33, this court extensively discussed juror disqualification:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court, over defense objection, replaced a juror with an alternate juror, finding the juror \"unable to perform\" his duties due to a prior commitment to officiate at an athletic event. When the court first indicated an intent to accommodate Dr. Howell during voir dire, defense counsel expressed concern that the trial might extend later than expected, but he did not formally object to the court's stated intent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The impropriety of releasing a juror to allow him to fulfill a personal obligation appears to be one of first impression by this court in the context presented.

The defendant contended that it was improper to excuse a juror who was not incompetent. Even though the juror testified that she would not be swayed to change her vote as a result of her supervisor's testimony being offered by stipulation, this court found that the judge could have reasonably concluded that the juror could be affected or biased by the employment relationship.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In the presence of counsel for both the state and defense, but outside the presence of the defendant, the judge, without asking the juror specifics of why he felt he had a conflict of interest, inquired whether the juror could decide the case on the evidence\n   and disregard the alleged conflict.

The trial judge disqualified a juror after determining that the juror had violated the sequestration order by going to the bar in the hotel in which the jury was housed. In determining the correctness of the trial court action, the supreme court stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The next morning the judge conducted a hearing and conscientiously examined that juror and the other jurors to determine the extent of the transgression. The juror claimed that the only person with whom he conversed was the barmaid. The other jurors testified that they had not discussed the case with anyone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Although the juror denied discussing the case or the fact that he was a juror with the barmaid, there is no doubt that the juror willfully disobeyed the sequestration order and was not \"secluded from outside communication.\" Confronted with this situation in a capital case (where sequestration is mandatory), the judge chose to replace the transgressing juror with an alternate. Defense counsel objected to this action and moved for a mistrial based on the juror's misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The trial judge was called upon to decide whether the juror had become disqualified to perform his duties and, if so, what action to take.

Although a judge under some circumstances may have been satisfied that such a showing overcame the presumption of prejudice flowing from a sequestration violation, the judge in this instance determined that the essential fairness of the proceeding could best be preserved by replacing the juror with the properly qualified and duly selected alternate. Moreover, the judge's decision to replace the juror, rather than to declare a mistrial, was largely justified by the facts that the violation had occurred during the evening recess and that the other jurors had denied that they were exposed to any outside\n   influence possibly resulting from the violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The trial court has discretion to utilize the service of an alternate juror, rather than to grant a mistrial, upon a proper finding that this is the best course of action.

In that case, a juror expressed his dissatisfaction with having to miss work to serve as a juror, but after a challenge for cause was denied with the trial judge finding that an economic situation \"was not sufficient grounds for cause,\" he was selected to serve. After the juror failed to remain with other jurors during a lunch recess, and continued to complain that the trial was costing him too much money, the trial judge ordered he be replaced, but also ordered that he must remain for the entirety of the trial. In affirming, the court noted:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Although the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure does not provide a definition of \"incompetent,\" the Louisiana Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of \"incompetent\" in\n   <em>\n    State v.

What is not gleaned is whether a juror's personal business or social obligations, of which the trial court is aware prior to his being sworn, renders that juror, after he has heard all of the testimony, and is to be excused just as deliberations are to begin, \"unable to perform or disqualified from performing his duties.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Dismissal of a juror under these facts is not a recognized or permissible course of action under La.Code Crim.P. art. 789. Dr. Howell's prior commitment to officiate at a football game rendered him neither \"unable to perform,\" nor \"disqualified from performing\" his duties. While the trial court's desire to accommodate jurors is commendable, such accommodation should not preempt a defendant's right to be tried by a properly empaneled jury selected by him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Pursuant to the discussion in\n   <em>\n    Tennors\n   </em>\n   , we find that Antoine was neither \"unable to perform\" nor \"disqualified from performing\" her duties as a juror. The protected principle is that a defendant has a right to be tried by the jury he helped select. The State notes that Defendant took actions that could have tainted the jury through improper contact with Antoine. However,\n   <em>\n    Tennors\n   </em>\n   and the jurisprudence cited therein interpreting La.Code Crim. P. art. 789 do not allow the removal of a qualified juror. Antoine testified that she was not contacted by any member of Defendant's family, and the district court indicated it believed her. The court and the State were concerned that Defendant might make continued efforts to contact Antoine, but Article 789 and the jurisprudence do not allow the removal of a juror due to such an inchoate issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, we find merit to Defendant's assignment of error that the trial court erred by removing a seated juror and replacing her with an alternate over his objection. Accordingly,\n   Mr. Parker's convictions are reversed, and the case is remanded for a new trial. We pretermit consideration of the other assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    CONVICTIONS REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
