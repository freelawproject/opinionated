For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action arises out of flooding that occurred at The Carol Condominium (the \"Carol\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in March 2016 as a result of a ruptured water pipe caused by renovation\n   work being performed in the one of the units.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[V]irtually all of the units and common elements on the floors of the [Carol] below the tenth floor\" sustained water damage due to the broken pipe, including the unit owned by Mr. Ledet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant, Carol Condominium Association, Inc. (the \"Association\"), is a Louisiana non-profit corporation created pursuant to the Louisiana Condominium Act, La. R.S. 9:1121.101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (the \"Act\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   All Carol unit owners are automatically members of the Association, and no other persons or entities are entitled to membership. Each unit owner's membership interest in the Association is equal to his respective percentage of ownership interest in the common elements of the Carol as set forth in the Declaration of Condominium of Carol Condominium (the \"Declaration\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to the Association's By-Laws, the Association is required to \"obtain adequate and appropriate kinds of insurance\" in accordance with the Declaration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   Act also mandates that the Association obtain insurance insuring the condominium property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Declaration specifically provides that \"the [Carol] Property is submitted to the provisions of the [Act].\" Accordingly, the Association purchased a commercial property insurance policy (the \"Policy\") from the Insurers providing coverage for \"direct physical loss of or damage to Covered Property\" at the Carol caused or resulting from any covered cause of loss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only named insured\n   identified in the Policy is the \"Carol Condominium Association, Inc.,\" with a single stated limit of liability for the building, and a separately stated limit for business personal property. There is no separately stated limit of liability for each individual unit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The premiums for the Policy are paid for through the common expenses, which are paid for by each unit owner according to his percentage interest in the common elements. The Policy was in effect from February 1, 2016 to February 1, 2017, including the date the water pipe in the Carol ruptured causing damage to Mr. Ledet's unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Ledet avers that he presented to the Insurers satisfactory proof of loss of the damage sustained to his unit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   While it appears the Association also presented a claim to the Insurers for damages occasioned to the Carol-and that the Insurers adjusted the loss and issued payment to the Association-the Insurers denied payment to Mr. Ledet on his individual claim on the basis that he is not a named insured, an additional insured, or a third party beneficiary under the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 6, 2017, Mr. Ledet filed suit against FabianMartins and its liability insurer, the owners of Unit 10-C and their liability insurer, Mr. Ledet's own personal property insurer,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Association, and the Insurers, seeking damages caused to his unit as a result of the flooding. As against the Insurers, Mr. Ledet claims he is entitled to \"relief and damages for bad faith breach of contract pursuant to Louisiana contract law, La. C.C. art. 1953\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , including but not limited to the amounts owed under the ... Policy\" for the property damage sustained to his individual unit, and for \"pre- and post-judgment legal interest, mitigation costs, inconvenience and aggravation, litigation costs and expenses, statutory penalties, and attorney fees pursuant to the Louisiana Insurance Code Unfair Trade Practices statutes,\" La. R.S. 22:1982 and La. R.S. 22:1973.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In answer to Mr. Ledet's petition, the Insurers averred that they \"were notified of the loss by [the Association] and adjusted same in accordance with the terms of the Policy and Louisiana law.\" The Insurers then filed an exception of no cause of action and/or motion for summary judgment on the basis that Mr. Ledet, who is not a named insured or an additional named insured, has no right under the Policy to sue the Insurers for losses sustained to his individual unit. According to the Insurers, absent proof that Mr. Ledet is a third party beneficiary of the Policy, the \"right to sue [the Insurers] belongs to their insured,\" the Association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In opposition, Mr. Ledet argued that the Act, the Policy, and the Declaration, when read collectively, establish that, under the theory of stipulation\n   <em>\n    pour autrui\n   </em>\n   , he is a\n   third party beneficiary of the Policy. As such, he averred that his petition states a cause of action against the Insurers for breach of the Policy and bad faith claims adjusting. Alternatively, Mr. Ledet argued that, as a \"beneficiary of an express contractual insurance trust administered by the Association as trustee,\" he is entitled to enforce the Association's rights under the Policy in order to protect his interest in the insurance proceeds owed by the Insurers for damage to his unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Insurers' exception and motion came for hearing on October 19, 2017. Following oral argument, the trial court took the matter under advisement. On November 28, 2017, the trial court issued judgment in favor of the Insurers, granting their motion for summary judgment and dismissing with prejudice Mr. Ledet's claims against them, incorporating the following written reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   After careful consideration of the applicable law, memoranda, and exhibits submitted by the parties, the Court finds that, under the policy at issue herein, there is no clear expression of intent to benefit the Plaintiff, and any benefit which may accrue to the Plaintiff is merely incidental to the contract. Thus, the Plaintiff is not a third party beneficiary and has no standing to assert a claim under the policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   From this judgment, Mr. Ledet filed the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In his sole assignment of error, Mr. Ledet contends the trial court erred in failing to find that, although he is not a named insured or an additional named insured, the Association's Policy contains \"manifestly clear, certain, and direct stipulations of insurance coverage and other benefits in his favor as the owner of a condominium unit insured by the [P]olicy,\" and thus, under a theory of stipulation\n   <em>\n    pour autrui\n   </em>\n   , he is a third party beneficiary of the Policy to the extent of his [undivided .6643] interest in the insurance proceeds owed by the Insurers for damage to his unit. Alternatively, Mr. Ledet avers the trial court erred in failing to find that he is a beneficiary of an \"express contractual insurance trust\" administered by the Association as trustee for the benefit of the unit owners, including himself, and as such, he is entitled to enforce the Association's rights under the Policy in order to protect his interest in the insurance proceeds that are owed by the Insurers for damage to his condominium unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   It is well settled that the appellate review of summary judgment is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , using the same criteria governing the trial court's consideration of whether summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Hebert v.

Based upon our\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, we find that the Policy, when considered together with the mandates of the Act and the Declaration, lacks a manifestly clear stipulation of coverage intended by the parties to benefit individual unit owners, including Mr. Ledet, so as to give them a direct right of enforcement against the Insurers. As the Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   , \"[a] person may derive a benefit from a contract to which he is not a party without being a third party beneficiary.\"\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8469902\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/939/1206/#p1211\">\n    939 So.2d at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such is the situation in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Act mandates that any loss covered by the Policy \"\n   <em>\n    shall be adjusted\n   </em>\n   with the [A]ssociation,\" and that any proceeds for that loss \"\n   <em>\n    shall be payable\n   </em>\n   to any insurance trustee\n   <em>\n    designated\n   </em>\n   for that purpose, or otherwise\n   <em>\n    to the [A]ssociation\n   </em>\n   ....\" [Emphasis supplied.] La. R.S. 9:1123.112(D). Also, section 13(a) of the Declaration requires that the Policy \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be written in the name of, and the proceeds thereof\n   <em>\n    shall be payable to\n   </em>\n   ... the Association, as the [designated] trustee for each of the Unit Owners ....\" [Emphasis supplied.] Thus, pursuant to the express provisions of the Act and the Declaration, it is clear that all property losses sustained by the Carol must be adjusted with the Association-not with individual unit owners-and that all proceeds recoverable under the Policy for those losses must be paid to the Association, as the designated trustee-not to the individual unit owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Further, while recognizing that the Policy covers property owned by the Association as well as property that may be owned by a unit owner, we disagree with Mr. Ledet's contention that the Policy's loss payment provisions stipulate a benefit in his favor because those provisions provide the Insurers with the\n   <em>\n    option\n   </em>\n   to adjust losses directly with unit owners. To the contrary, we find these provisions give to the\n   <em>\n    Insurers\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    exclusive\n   </em>\n   right to either adjust and settle covered losses directly with the Association (which is in accord with the Act and the Declaration)\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   with the unit owners. Our review of the entire Policy has revealed no provision which\n   <em>\n    entitles\n   </em>\n   the unit owners to receive direct payment for losses that may include their individual units. Moreover, it is clear from the Policy's unambiguous language that the Insurers are not\n   <em>\n    obligated\n   </em>\n   to pay directly to Mr. Ledet any part of the indemnity that may be due for the loss he claims to have sustained. Thus, even though the Policy benefits Mr. Ledet and other third party unit owners by providing coverage for certain types of property that may belong to them, we find that its express language, which confers\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   upon the Insurers the power to regard all contractual obligations due under the Policy as extending only to the named insured (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the Association), specifically negates the existence of a stipulation\n   <em>\n    pour autrui\n   </em>\n   , or any enforceable obligation, in favor of the individual unit owners as third party beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Other provisions of the Policy, as well as those contained in the Act and the Declaration, further support a finding that the Insurers and the Association did not intend to confer on any third party unit owner a legally enforceable right of recovery against the Insurers. The Policy expressly states that the Association is the \"Named Insured\" and provides, throughout the Policy, that \"the words 'you' and 'your' refer to the Named Insured.\" Paragraph 4 of the General Provisions provides that \"[t]he insurance described herein shall not be assigned in whole or in part without the written consent\" of the Insurers. Further, paragraph F of the Common Policy Provisions provides \"[y]our rights and duties under this policy may not be transferred without our written consent.\" Additionally, paragraph F of the Commercial Property Conditions specifically states that \"\n   <strong>\n    [n]o party other than you\n   </strong>\n   [the Association, the named insured], having custody of Covered Property\n   <strong>\n    will benefit\n   </strong>\n   from this insurance.\" [Emphasis supplied.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In addition to the Policy's provisions, the Act provides that \"[a]n insurance policy issued to the [A]ssociation does not prevent a unit owner from obtaining\n   <em>\n    insurance for his own benefit.\n   </em>\n   \" [Emphasis supplied.] La. R.S. 9:1123.112(E). Further, section 13(d) of the Declaration states that \"[e]ach Unit Owner is responsible for obtaining his own insurance\" covering damage to the contents, additions and improvements to his unit, and may obtain additional insurance covering his personal liability and loss or damage to his unit \"above and beyond the extent that his liability loss or damage\" is covered by the Policy obtained by the Association. Lastly, while the Act requires that unit owners be insured persons under the Association's\n   <em>\n    liability\n   </em>\n   coverage, it does not require that unit owners be named insureds under the Association's property insurance coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 9:1123.112(C)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. Ledet has not directed this Court to any ambiguity in the Policy, and we have found none. Therefore, considering the Policy provisions as a whole, together with the applicable provisions of the Act and the Declaration, we find the Policy lacks a manifestly clear stipulation of coverage in favor of individual unit owners, including Mr. Ledet, or that the Insurers and the Association intended to give them an enforceable benefit under the insurance contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the trial judge correctly determined that the Policy lacks a manifestly clear stipulation intending to establish a benefit in favor of Mr. Ledet or other unit owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Certainty as to the Benefit Provided\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The second factor in determining whether a stipulation\n   <em>\n    pour autrui\n   </em>\n   exists (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that there is certainty as to the benefit provided to the third party), is based on the principle that, in order \"[t]o create a legal obligation enforceable by the beneficiary, there must be certainty as to the benefit to accrue to the beneficiary.\"\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8469902\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/939/1206/#p1211\">\n    939 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1212 (citing\n   <em>\n    Berry v.

Pursuant to La. R.S. 9:1123.112(D) of the Act, the unit owners may\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   recover proceeds under the Policy from the Association-\n   <em>\n    not the Insurers\n   </em>\n   -and even then,\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   if surplus proceeds remain after repairs are made by the Association to the common elements and covered portions of the units. Thus, whether the unit owners are able to recover any proceeds at all is contingent upon the extent of damage occasioned to the common elements and covered portion of the units, and is triggered\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   when the loss payment made by the Insurers to the Association exceeds the Association's cost to repair that damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We find this benefit of the insurance proceeds to the unit owners, if any, is an indirect benefit, purely speculative, and is an obligation imposed by the Act upon the Association,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an obligation imposed upon the Insurers under the provisions of the Policy. Moreover, absent an express provision in the Policy, we find that a third party unit owner's potential entitlement to a portion of the insurance proceeds paid by the Insurers to the Association is insufficient to confer a benefit in favor of the unit owner to demand those proceeds directly from the Insurer. Because no express provision in the Policy exists in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , we will not read one into it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Benefit Not a Mere Incident of the Contract\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The third requirement-that the benefit to the third party cannot be a mere incident of the contract-requires the reviewing court to distinguish those instances where an advantage has actually been stipulated on behalf of a third party from those where the advantage relied upon is \"merely an incident of the contract between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8469902\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/939/1206/#p1211\">\n    939 So.2d at 1212-1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Smith, 11 Tul.

To establish a stipulation\n   <em>\n    pour autrui\n   </em>\n   , the third party relationship must form the consideration for a condition of the contract.\n   <em>\n    Rivnor Properties v. Herbert O'Donnell, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 92-1103 (La. App. 5th Cir. 1994),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7466529\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/633/735/#p742\">\n    633 So.2d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 742. Here, the plain language of the Policy, when viewed in its entirety, shows that the primary purpose of the Policy was\n   <em>\n    not to directly benefit unit owners or to insure their individual units\n   </em>\n   , but rather, was to discharge the Association's obligation under the Act and the Declaration to obtain insurance for the common elements and units against damage and loss, and to protect the Association's interests and property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Also, the mere mention of \"unit owners\" in the Policy does not make the unit owners third party beneficiaries. They are not individually identified in the Policy, nor is there a separately stated limit of liability for each unit owner. Consequently, we find that the benefit alleged by Mr. Ledet-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , coverage under the Policy for property he individually owns-was not consideration for a condition of the Policy, but rather, was merely incidental to the primary purpose for which the Insurers and the Association entered into the insurance contract. And, even though Mr. Ledet clearly benefits under the Policy, he is not an intended third party beneficiary with the right to make direct claims against the Insurers for individual losses; his potential benefits are merely incidental. Put another way, the Insurers did not intend to confer or obligate themselves to provide benefits to individual unit owners directly, nor was making unit owners third party beneficiaries consideration for the insurance contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, if we were to adopt Mr. Ledet's argument-that the Policy language intentionally stipulates a benefit in favor of the individual unit owners-we can envision a situation where insurers of condominium complexes in this state would not only be exposed to the insured's claim (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Association's claim), but potentially, would also be exposed to multiple claims by the individual unit owners, non-signatories to the insurance contract, seeking recovery and payment for the same loss. Additionally, unless 100% of the unit owners agreed and signed off on a settlement, a lone unit owner could potentially hold up the entire settlement, thus preventing finality to any of the claims and/or repair and restoration of the damaged property. Instead, we find that under the Act, the intention is to have the Association, as trustee for the unit owners, as the only party entitled to receive payment under the Policy for losses or damage to covered property (whether owned by the unit owner or by the Association), so that the Association may then ascertain how and when to distribute those funds, if ever, to unit owners in the event a surplus of proceeds remains after all repairs to the damaged common elements and units have been made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In sum, following our\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, we find Mr. Ledet has failed to satisfy the three-prong test for establishing a stipulation\n   <em>\n    pour autrui\n   </em>\n   as set forth by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   We conclude the Policy contains no provision which establishes a stipulation in favor of individual unit owners, such as Mr. Ledet, in a manifestly clear manner. We find there is no certainty in the Policy as to any\n   benefit provided to the individual unit owners, and conclude that any such benefit derived is not intentional, but instead, a mere incident of the insurance contract between the Insurers and the Association. Put simply, we find the Policy devoid of any benefit flowing directly in favor of individual unit owners, which would create in them a direct right of action against the Insurers to either enforce the Policy or demand its performance. Accordingly, in the absence of a direct benefit conferred by the Policy, pursuant to La. C.C. art. 1978, as a matter of law, the unit owners [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Ledet] cannot be third party beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8469902\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/939/1206/#p1211\">\n    939 So.2d at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court did not err in finding that Mr. Ledet is not a third party beneficiary under the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Express Contractual Insurance Trust\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Regarding Mr. Ledet's argument that, pursuant to La. R.S. 9:2222(1) of the Louisiana Trust Code, he has a statutory right of action against the Insurers (to the extent of his interest in the insurance proceeds owed for damages to his unit) as a beneficiary of an \"express contractual insurance trust\" administered by the Association as Trustee, while we find the argument novel, we reject it. Although Mr. Ledet may have a right of action against the Association for alleged violations of its fiduciary obligations owed to the unit owners pursuant to the Act and/or Declaration regarding the Association's adjustment and handling of the claim, and as \"trustee\" of the insurance proceeds, this issue is not before us on appeal and we do not address it here. We find nothing in the record before us that establishes an \"express contractual insurance trust\" under the Louisiana Trust Code, La. R.S. 9:1721,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , as suggested by Mr. Ledet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Further, merely because the Association was obliged to hold any insurance proceeds it received under the Policy as \"trustee\" or \"in trust\" for the unit owners \"as their interests may appear,\" we find that this did not create a \"trust\" or a \"trust estate\" as those terms are defined under the applicable provisions of the Louisiana Trust Code such that Mr. Ledet would have \"a statutory right of action against the Insurers.\" Our research of this innovative argument has produced no case law or applicable statutory authority that would legally support Mr. Ledet's position. Consequently, we find this argument has no merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Claims for Bad Faith Claims Adjusting\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   While Mr. Ledet did not brief the issue involving his extra-contractual claims against the Insurers separately, he appears to suggest that, as a third party beneficiary to the Policy, he has a right to seek statutory penalties against the Insurers for their alleged bad faith in handling his claims. Courts have generally held that statutes subjecting insurers to penalties are penal in nature and are to be strictly construed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelly v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   , 14-1921 (La. 5/5/15),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6862745\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/169/328/#p343\">\n    169 So.3d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 343. Because we have determined that Mr. Ledet, a non-party to the insurance contract, has no right to enforce the Policy as either a third party beneficiary thereto or as a beneficiary of an express contractual insurance trust, we find his claims against the Insurers for extra-contractual damages under La. R.S. 22:1892, La. R.S. 9:1973, and La. C.C. art. 1997, likewise fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Our\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review in this matter confirms no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the Insurers are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The Insurers have shown an absence of factual support for Mr. Ledet's claims against them, and Mr. Ledet has not produced sufficient evidence to show that he will be able to meet\n   his evidentiary burden at trial. Moreover, when reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Mr. Ledet, we conclude that reasonable minds can reach only one conclusion: the Insurers and the Association did not intend to confer an enforceable right in favor of unit owners against the Insurers to recover for damage and loss to their individual units, and Mr. Ledet is not a beneficiary of an \"express contractual insurance trust.\" Thus, the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment in favor of the Insurers and dismissing with prejudice Mr. Ledet's claims against them for breach of the Policy and bad faith claims handling.
