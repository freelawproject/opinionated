For the following reasons we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The underlying facts of this case are undisputed. Mr. Fred, a resident of Lafayette Parish, Louisiana was hired by DCDC, a limited liability company domiciled in Lafayette, Louisiana. He was\n   terminated from his employment on November 3, 2016, and was instructed to immediately leave the job site located in McKenzie County, North Dakota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 4, 2016, Mr. Fred contacted Mr. Jeffrey Reddock Sr., a principal with DCDC, via both telephone and text message, seeking the amount of salary due for his prior employment with DCDC. According to the pleadings, Mr. Reddock told Mr. Fred that he was not going to be paid his past due salary and expenses. On November 16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   and 23\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   , 2016, Mr. Reddock again allegedly refused to pay Mr. Fred his past due salary and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In his petition, Mr. Fred claimed that he was owed compensation for work done from October 16, 2016 to October 29, 2016, and from October 30, 2016 to November 3, 2016, the date of his termination by DCDC. Additionally, Mr. Fred claims that DCDC refused to reimburse him $509.87 in business expenses incurred during the course of his employment with DCDC. He claimed that pursuant to La.R.S. 23:631(A)(1)(a), he was entitled to his past due salary and expenses in the amount of $5,110.51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Fred's counsel made a formal written demand on DCDC through its registered agent for service of process seeking payment for Mr. Fred's past due salary and expenses in the amount of $5,110.51, as well as penalties pursuant to La.R.S. 23:632(A). The three day grace period provided by La.R.S. 23:632(A) lapsed without payment by DCDC to Mr. Fred. Thus, DCDC's failure to pay the total amount of $5,110.51 to Mr. Fred also entitled Mr. Fred to possible penalties pursuant to La.R.S. 23:632(B), in addition to possible reasonable attorney fees and costs in accordance with La.R.S. 23:632(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to La.R.S. 23:631(B), Mr. Fred then filed a summary proceeding by way of a rule for past due salary and expenses, penalties, and attorney fees, which was fixed for hearing by the trial court on February 6, 2017. DCDC answered the rule and filed an opposition. DCDC admitted that Mr. Fred was owed his past due salary and expenses in the amount of $5,110.51. However, in its answer and opposition to Mr. Fred's rule, DCDC alleged that as a result of Mr. Fred's willful negligence, he had done substantial damage to DCDC's well site. DCDC also alleged that Mr. Fred had committed a possible environmental violation which could result in a fine against DCDC from the North Dakota Environmental Agency. Therefore, DCDC claimed it was entitled to an offset for the alleged damages to its equipment and/or potential fine it might incur that far exceeded any amount owed to Mr. Fred for his past due salary and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the hearing, DCDC was prepared to put on witnesses in order to prove that it was entitled to an offset, which the trial court properly refused to allow in a hearing on a judgment on the pleadings. \"It is well settled that consideration of a motion for judgment on the pleadings must be based upon the pleadings alone and that supporting evidence is not to be considered.\"\n   <em>\n    Gibbens v. Wendy's Foods, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 31,487, p. 4 (La.App. 2 Cir. 1/20/99),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11638252\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/729/629/#p631\">\n    729 So.2d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631-32 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court found in favor of Mr. Fred and awarded him $5,110.51 in past due salary and expenses on the basis that DCDC was not entitled to an offset against their former employee. The trial court additionally awarded Mr. Fred $23,543.10 in penalties, which represented Mr. Fred's daily salary of $261.59 multiplied by ninety days in accordance with La.R.S. 23:632(A), plus stipulated attorney fees in the amount of $7,038.00. The trial court's judgment reflecting its ruling was signed on February 24, 2017. DCDC sought written reasons\n   for ruling from the trial court, which request was denied as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   DCDC filed a suspensive appeal. The validity and sufficiency of DCDC's suspensive appeal was challenged by Mr. Fred in the district court at a hearing fixed for October 16, 2017, just prior to oral argument in this case scheduled for October 26, 2017. No mention was made of the outcome of the hearing held in the district court at oral argument. However, despite any dispute over the validity of DCDC's suspensive appeal, DCDC's appeal was timely filed as a devolutive appeal. Accordingly, this court chooses to maintain its jurisdiction over DCDC's appeal as a devolutive appeal.\n   <em>\n    Martinez v. Rivet\n   </em>\n   , 16-100 (La.

DCDC also admitted that Mr. Fred executed the employment related documents previously listed as Exhibit \"A\" (in globo) and incorporated into Mr. Fred's pleadings. DCDC admitted the terms of his employment and salary listed as Exhibit \"B,\" which was also incorporated into his pleadings. DCDC further admitted Mr. Fred was paid in \"two-week increments,\" six days following the end of each pay period, and was paid a car allowance in the middle of the month. Finally, DCDC admitted Mr. Fred was terminated on November 3, 2016, and at his termination DCDC owed Mr. Fred $5,110.51 in past due salary and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On or about December 12, 2016, Mr. Fred, through his counsel, made demand on DCDC for his past due salary, expenses, and penalties via correspondence to DCDC's registered agent for service of process, as referenced in Mr. Fred's pleadings as Exhibit \"C.\" DCDC admitted the existence and receipt of the letter in paragraph 17 of its answer to Mr. Fred's pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Therefore, it is undisputed that DCDC timely failed to pay the $5,110.51 in past due salary and expenses owed to Mr. Fred pursuant to La.R.S. 23:631 (A)(1)(a). In its assignments of error, DCDC urges as a defense to its failure to pay Mr. Fred that it is entitled to a setoff against the amount of past due salary and expenses owed due to the negligence and damages done to DCDC property and possible environmental fines connected with the cleanup of the DCDC well site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DCDC's Assignments of Error Numbers One and Two\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   DCDC's assignments of error one and two basically state the same objection to the trial court's ruling granting Mr. Fred's motion for judgment on the pleadings and awarding Mr. Fred $5,110.51 in past due salary and expenses. DCDC argues it was not allowed to show that it was entitled to an offset based on Mr. Fred's \"negligent, willful, illegal, and damaging performance of his job.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   DCDC intended to present four witnesses at the hearing held in conjunction with Mr. Fred's motion for judgment on the pleadings and have them testify about Mr. Fred's activities at DCDC's well site. However, as previously stated, when a motion for judgment on the pleadings is before a trial court, only the pleadings can be considered, along with any exhibits attached and incorporated into the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    Canal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9710520\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/241/5/#p5\">\n    241 So.2d at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

DCDC seeks to support its failure to pay Mr. Fred based on Mr. Fred's alleged destruction of DCDC's property and a possible environmental fine imposed by the North Dakota Environmental Agency for an unlawful discharge at the DCDC well site allegedly caused by Mr. Fred. However, Mr. Fred argues that despite the allegations in DCDC's answer, it is barred from disputing the payment of the past due salary and expenses owed Mr. Fred by seeking an offset, as no specific, liquidated offset was supported by an appropriate exhibit properly attached to DCDC's answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Louisiana Revised Statutes 23:635 provides, \"No person, acting either for himself or as agent or otherwise, shall assess any fines against his employees or deduct any sum as fines from their wages.\" DCDC claims that Mr. Fred performed his work \"in a manner which constituted [a] willful violation of North Dakota environmental laws.\" Therefore, even if DCDC was charged with a violation and a fine by the North Dakota Environmental Agency, it could not use any action by Mr. Fred resulting in a fine as an offset or defense to the failure to pay his past due salary and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   DCDC argues that La.R.S. 23:635 also provides in pertinent part, \"This Section shall not apply in cases where the employees wilfully or negligently damage goods or works, or in cases where the employees wilfully or negligently damage or break the property of the employer ... but in such cases the fines shall not exceed the actual damage done.\" DCDC has alleged that there was \"willful damage to their property\" by Mr. Fred that far exceeded the amount owed to him as past due salary and expenses. Therefore, if DCDC's allegations are taken as true, they would not be barred from offsetting the past due salary and expenses they owed to Mr. Fred by the \"effect of law,\" under La.Code Civ.P. art. 965.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Mr. Fred argues that by failing to state a specific amount of any possible fine by the North Dakota Environmental Agency or a specific amount of damages allegedly caused by Mr. Fred's willful and negligent actions at DCDC's well site, that La.Civ.Code art. 1893 would bar any offset by DCDC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Louisiana Civil Code Article 1893 provides, \"Compensation takes place by operation of law when two persons owe to each other sums of money or quantities of fungible things identical in kind, and these sums or quantities are\n   <strong>\n    liquidated\n   </strong>\n   and presently due.\" (Emphasis added).

Black's Law Dictionary defines a \"\n   <em>\n    liquidated debt\n   </em>\n   \" as \"A debt whose amount has been determined by agreement of the parties or by operation of law.\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 433 (8th ed. 2004). Since DCDC has not established the amount of a liquidated offset claim pursuant to La.Civ.Code art. 1893, its claim for an offset was properly rejected by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In its assignment of error number six, DCDC raises the issue of whether La. R.S. 9:3921 actually bars \"DCDC from asserting any defenses to Fred's claim for wages.\" DCDC claims that it does not. La.R.S. 9:3921 states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A. Notwithstanding any provision in Title III of Code Book III of Title 9 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950 to the contrary, every master or employer is answerable for the damage occasioned by his servant or employee in the exercise of the functions in which they are employed. Any remission, transaction, compromise, or other conventional discharge in favor of the employee, or any judgment rendered against him for such damage shall be valid as between the damaged creditor and the employee, and the employer shall have no right of contribution, division, or indemnification from the employee nor shall the employer be allowed to bring any incidental action under the provisions of Chapter 6 of Title I of Book II of the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   against such employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We do not find that La.R.S. 9:3921 would be applicable to this case, as there is nothing in the record to support that a specific liquidated third party claim has been made against DCDC by the North Dakota Environmental Agency, or any other party. We find that the trial court was not clearly wrong and assignment of errors three, five, and six are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error Number Four\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   DCDC also claims the trial court erred in failing to allow it \"an opportunity to establish equitable defenses it may have to Fred's claim for penalties.\" La.R.S. 23:632 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   A. Except as provided for in Subsection B of this Section, any employer who fails or refuses to comply with the provisions of R.S. 23:631 shall be liable to the employee either for ninety days wages at the employee's daily rate of pay, or else for full wages from the time the employee's demand for payment is made until the employer shall pay or tender the amount of unpaid wages due to such employee, whichever is the lesser amount of penalty wages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   B. When the court finds that an employer's dispute over the amount of wages due was in good faith, but the employer is subsequently found by the court to owe the amount in dispute, the employer shall be liable only for the amount of wages in dispute plus judicial interest incurred from the date that the suit is filed. If the court determines that the employer's failure or refusal to pay the amount of wages owed was not in good faith, then the employer shall be subject to the penalty provided for in Subsection A of this Section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   C. Reasonable attorney fees shall be allowed the laborer or employee by the court which shall be taxed as costs to be paid by the employer, in the event a well-founded suit for any unpaid wages whatsoever be filed by the laborer or employee after three days shall elapsed from time of making the first demand following discharge or resignation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Becht v.

The\n   <em>\n    Domite\n   </em>\n   court, reasoned that: \"To allow such defenses is contrary to and makes less effective, if not ineffective, the obvious intent of the legislature in adopting this statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Domite,\n   </em>\n   94-16, p. 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7460480\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/641/715/\">\n    641 So.2d at 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At the hearing on Mr. Fred's motion for judgment on the pleadings, after hearing argument from counsel on the issue of offset and DCDC's ability to withhold Mr. Fred's salary and expenses, the trial court stated, \"Well, I don't agree. I don't agree. I'm going to grant judgment on the pleadings.

We find that the trial court was not manifestly erroneous or clearly wrong and therefore we also affirm the trial court's ruling awarding Mr. Fred $23,543.10 in penalty wages pursuant to La.R.S. 23:632. The parties stipulated that if attorney fees are due, the amount of attorney fees incurred at the trial court level is $7,038.00, which amount has not been appealed by DCDC.
