R. Crim. P., petition for postconviction relief attacking his capital-murder conviction and sentence of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2009, McMillan was convicted of murdering James Bryan Martin during the\n   course of a robbery. The jury recommended, by a vote of eight to four, that McMillan be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The circuit court chose not to follow the jury's recommendation and sentenced McMillan to death. This Court affirmed McMillan's conviction and sentence of death on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McMillan v.

On August 23, 2013, this Court issued its certificate of judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In August 2014, McMillan filed a timely petition for postconviction relief attacking his capital-murder conviction and death sentence. He filed an amended petition in December 2014 and an amendment to one claim in his petition in February 2015. In March 2015, the circuit court issued a 72-page detailed order summarily dismissing all the claims in McMillan's amended postconviction petition. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On direct appeal, this Court set out the following facts surrounding McMillan's conviction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   3245 \"The State's evidence tended to show that on August 29, 2007, Calvin McMillan and Rondarrell Williams drove to the Wal-Mart discount retail store in Millbrook in a white Nissan Sentra automobile belonging to Williams's girlfriend, in order for McMillan 'to get him a ride' (R. 1046.) Williams testified that he knew that McMillan had a gun. The men parked the vehicle by a truck on the outskirts of the parking lot and Williams went into the Wal-Mart store. He purchased some speakers and returned to the vehicle, where McMillan, despite opening and closing the vehicle's front passenger door several times, had remained. After a few minutes, Williams again got out of the vehicle and returned to the store.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"While Williams was in the store, McMillan got out of the vehicle and began walking around the parking lot, eventually standing by the entrance to the store. He subsequently returned to the vehicle and sat in the front passenger seat with the door open. He then got out of the vehicle quickly, wearing a different shirt than he was wearing when he and Williams had entered the parking lot, and approached a man later identified as the victim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"That same evening, the victim, James Bryan Martin, had driven to the Wal-Mart store in Millbrook following a Montgomery Biscuits minor-league baseball game. He had parked his Ford F-100 pickup truck in the parking lot a few rows from the vehicle driven by Williams and had entered the store. Inside, he had purchased diapers, a Vault brand beverage, and Reese's brand candy. After checking out, he put his bags in his truck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The victim was then approached by a man later identified as McMillan. Video surveillance of the parking lot of the Wal-Mart store, which was admitted into evidence as a DVD, shows that Martin walked several feet toward McMillan, and then turned and walked back to his truck. The surveillance video also shows that Martin got into his truck and that a few seconds later the brake lights on the truck came on. The video further shows that McMillan also walked toward Martin's truck, hesitated when another vehicle drove down the aisle, and then, when that vehicle passed, McMillan went to the driver's side door of the truck. The video demonstrates that McMillan appeared to shoot Martin and then pull him out of his truck. Martin collapsed on the concrete and McMillan shot him two more times. McMillan\n   got into the truck and started to drive away. He then placed the truck into park, got out of the truck, and appears to have shot Martin again. At that point, McMillan quickly got back into the truck and sped out of the parking lot. Several witnesses who were present in the parking lot or who were in the entrance of the Wal-Mart store approached the victim and called for help.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Two disposable cameras were found in the truck. The film from those cameras was subsequently developed[;] one of the pictures was a photograph of McMillan pointing a pistol resembling the murder weapon at the camera, a photograph of a 9mm High Point pistol positioned on a pile of money, another photograph of the pistol placed on a pillow or bedding, and two photographs of McMillan making hand gestures at the camera. There was also a photograph of a closet containing a striped shirt and a camouflage hat that matched the description of the shirt and hat worn by the man who had shot Martin. Among the clothing found in the truck was a black shirt with a neon skull that resembled the shirt worn by the man in Williams's girlfriend's vehicle the first time he had gotten out of the vehicle. The officers also found a pair of black Dickie brand shorts like those worn by the man who shot Martin; in the pocket of those shorts was a 9mm shell casing and a Reese's brand candy wrapper.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"McMillan gave a statement indicating that he had been given a ride to Montgomery in the truck belonging to Martin by a man named Melvin Ingram Browning and that Browning had driven away with McMillan's possessions in the truck. The State introduced evidence at trial indicating that McMillan had a Social Security card for a Melvin Eugene Browning in his wallet. (R. 1240.) Melvin Eugene Browning testified that his wallet had been lost years before this incident and that he was in the Lee County jail at the time of the offense. The State presented evidence to substantiate Browning's whereabouts at the time of the offense.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    McMillan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6958122\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/139/184/\">\n    139 So.3d at 191-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   McMillan appeals the circuit court's ruling dismissing a Rule 32, Ala.

A jail record notes that McMillan, from 8-pod, received treatment for a headache and swollen right eye on February 16, 2008; the nurse noted that it '[a]ppears that someone hit him.' However, the jail records which were produced to McMillan by the Elmore County jail contain no incident report describing the attack on McMillan. Second, jail officers had directed Lucas and the others to attack McMillan.... Third, prior to McMillan's judicial sentencing proceeding, Lucas told prosecutor James Houts during an interview at the Staton Correctional Facility that he and other inmates had attacked McMillan prior to the incident that occurred on March 1, 2008.

When Torrence got to high school, she said, she started talking to counselors, and the Department of Human Resources (\"DHR\") got involved. In 1998 Ford and her mother were arrested and charged with child endangerment after Ford beat McMillan with a pool stick and put McMillan in the hospital. McMillan, she said, was placed in different foster-care homes after his mother was arrested in 1998.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Carol Weaver, McMillan's maternal aunt, testified that in 1987 she went to New York to pick up her sister's children and bring them to live with her in Shorter, Alabama. She said that sometime later that year when McMillan's mother, Kimberly McMillan, came to Alabama Kimberly was pregnant with McMillan. McMillan was placed in foster care not long after his birth, Weaver said. At that time, she said, Kimberly was living with Willie Ford, who was a drug dealer. Weaver testified that in 1998 Kimberly and Ford were arrested, that Kimberly was charged with child endangerment and that Ford was charged with assaulting McMillan. Weaver said that in 1996, when McMillan was approximately 10 years old, she first learned that McMillan had been molested. McMillan, Weaver said, was aggressive and angry and she had to place him in foster care because she could not handle his behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Teal Dick, director of the Alabama Family Resource Center in Chilton County, testified that he was retained by defense counsel to review all DHR records related to McMillan, that he reviewed \"a pile of them,\" and that he spoke to former social workers and a psychologist about McMillan. Dick said that Ford had a history of violent behavior, that in 1995 there were allegations of child abuse, and that McMillan and his siblings had been beaten with extension cords and punched in their stomachs. During Dick's testimony various DHR reports that detailed abuse and neglect by McMillan's mother and her boyfriend were admitted into evidence. DHR records, Dick said, showed that Kimberly McMillan and her children were in protective shelters for 16 days in 1995 and 92 days in 1997. Dick read the following from one report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   \"When we arrived at the home both Kimberly and Willie were there. One of the officers kept Willie Ford outside while Kimberly showed us the trailer they lived in. It was dark and Kimberly explained that they had blown a fuse last night. They had electricity, but no water, no phone, and only a small space heater to keep them warm. There was a stove that didn't work and she explained that they cooked on a small grill that was on the porch. The refrigerator was empty and the only visible sign of food was a loaf of bread. There was no kitchen sink and the only water is what they got from the gas station. To take a bath, Kimberly explained that they have to rent a hotel room. The room where Ella and her brother sleep had a couple of old mattresses on the floor with a sheet and a blanket thrown loosely over the mattresses. There didn't appear to be clothes and other necessities in the home. The officer took pictures of the trailer. Mr. Ford had a rifle that was under the pool table.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   \"We were all in agreement that the children were being neglected and both Kimberly McMillan and Willie Ford\n   were arrested. Mr. Ford was visibly irritated by the arrest. I talked privately with Ms. McMillan and explained when she got out of jail I would be glad to help her get shelter if she was willing to get the help she needs for her drinking problem. I talked with her about Willie's anger and the danger this might put her in if she goes back to the trailer after getting out of jail.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   (Trial Record, p. 1597-98.) Dick further detailed the numerous times the children were given emergency vouchers for food while they were in foster care, that McMillan had had five different social workers in a five-or seven-year period, and that in that same period he had been placed in 25 or 26 different homes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Emma Stacy Cosby, the clinical director for SafetyNet Youth Systems, testified that SafetyNet is a residential psychiatric-treatment facility for individuals under the age of 21 and that it recruits, trains, and licenses foster homes. She said that McMillan was one of the children under her care in 2001 when he was placed in a foster home. Cosby testified concerning an incident that occurred in 2001 when she was in the neighborhood and McMillan threatened her and his foster mother and McMillan was arrested. Cosby further testified that McMillan had been treated by Dr. Daniel Mejer in 2001. Dr. Mejer felt strongly that McMillan needed residential treatment and that if he did not get help he would end up in prison. (R. 1660.) She detailed one foster home in which McMillan had been placed where he had been physically abused. (R. 1665.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Eddie Tucker, McMillan's father, testified that he came into contact with Kimberly McMillan in 1987 when he was driving a tractor-trailer cross country and was in New York. He told her that he was driving to Montgomery and she asked for a ride to Montgomery. They got married and Kimberly had McMillan soon after the marriage. He said that child support had been taken out of his check and sent to McMillan's aunt, with whom he lived for a while. Tucker said that DHR never contacted him about McMillan and that he would have taken McMillan into his home had he known what had been happening to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Dr. Kimberly Ackerson, a forensic psychologist, testified that she examined McMillan and spoke with several of his family members and reviewed various records relating to McMillan. It was her opinion that McMillan had a conduct disorder which, she said, is an \"onset psychiatric disorder and it's manifested by behavioral problems.\" (R. 1701.) She also testified that McMillan has an \"oppositional defiance disorder.\" (Trial Record, R. 1702.) Specifically, she said, McMillan was defiant and resisted and rejected authority. McMillan's counselor recommended that he get residential treatment. She testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \"One of the things that the records show is that [McMillan] demonstrated academic problems early on. And over the course of time he has been subjected to psychological testing primarily looking at intellectual testing and achievement testing. And one of the things that the achievement testing has consistently shown is that [McMillan] had functioned well below his same age peers in the areas of reading, math, English.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   \"And so what you do have is you have a young man who in my opinion has been affected by numerous factors starting from when he was in utero. We have a mother that was using drugs and alcohol. He is then born to a mother who cannot, because of her own personal issues, provide the trust, the relationship and the attachment that this child needs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   \"The next step down we now have a child who is subjected to abuse. And not just slapped around, he is having guns\n   pointed at him, he is being sodomized. He continues to learn and understand that the world is a hostile negative place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   \"What happens at this juncture when he's about six, seven, eight years of age, especially after I believe when he was sodomized, is he develops a way of coping with this world. And his way of coping with this world is to remain in what is commonly referred to as a fight or flight response. In other words, he is prepared to either fight or flight from the situation. He doesn't know how else to react. He hasn't been given the tools, he hasn't been given the environment to learn how to react in a normal environment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   \"So this coping mechanism, which is an adaptive coping mechanism for him in the home, is obviously a maladaptive coping mechanism for him within the foster home and within the different facilities that he goes to. So it is not surprising to me that a young individual who already has a learning problem, so he has difficulty learning as it is, what he has learned is a very maladaptive way of coping, is put-simply put into a residential or is put into a foster home and is expected to behave. That really was not an appropriate or fair expectation of this young man. And, in my opinion, given that he was tossed to all of these different homes, a couple of facilities here and there, what happened was there was a failure to really look and see what was driving these behaviors. Why was he continuing to act in such a maladaptive way?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   \"And one of the reasons that I think he continued to act in this manner is that he does have symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. And one of the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in particular is hyperarousal and hypervigilance. And that goes back to that fight or flight response. He has to be hypervigilant, he has to be aroused, he has to be on his guard all the time because he never knows what's going to happen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   \"Over time as a result of being in that mode, there can be neurological changes. And what happens is the brain basically, for lack of a-you know, for ease of understanding, it's that the brain is always prepared to be that way, always prepared to be hyperaroused, always prepared to be on guard. And when you simply put them into a healthy environment, hopefully a safe home, it doesn't just turn off. The brain continues to function that way. He doesn't know how to engage appropriately. He doesn't understand that people are really trying to reach out and help him, because he's never experienced that before. And instead he is constantly put from one place to another because of his behavior problems and the true crux of the issue was never addressed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   \"And I think from years of this, this is why, just over the years of all of this, we continue to have behavior problems, which he meets the antisocial personality disorder. He's got symptoms of an anxiety disorder which I mentioned is posttrauma stress disorder. He certainly has learning disabilities. And all of this really prepared him to not be able to function in the average everyday community. And, in fact, Calvin, during our interview, I don't know if you knew this, but he made a very insightful comment. And what he stated to me was 'all of these years prepared me to be here in jail.' And that really is what I find through the records, that he really never had an opportunity to learn how to behave and function in society as you and I know it. Rather he knows how to function in a society where there's control, where there are people that tell you what to do and how to do it.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   (Trial Record, R. 1706-09.) Dr. Ackerson testified that Dr. Kirkland had diagnosed McMillan with borderline intellectual functioning, which, she said, is \"just above mental retardation or mild mental retardation.\" (Trial Record, R. 1722.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   After Dr. Ackerson testified, defense counsel asked for it to be a part of the record that McMillan's mother was present and ready to testify but that it was agreed by counsel and McMillan's mother that it would be best if she did not testify. She was questioned on the record about this decision and indicated that it was her decision not to testify at McMillan's trial. (Trial Record, R. 1728.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   At sentencing, the jury recommended a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The circuit court found two statutory mitigating circumstances: the fact that McMillan had no significant history of prior criminal activity and McMillan's young age at the time of the murder. As nonstatutory mitigating circumstances the circuit court found that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   \"[McMillan] was raised in extreme poverty; that he was abandoned by his mother; that he was physically abused as a child; that he was raped as a child, that he was a witness to his mother's and sister's abuse; that he was raised in the home of an alcoholic/drug addict; that he did not get the treatment he needed; that he had no positive male role models; that he suffered from psychological and emotional difficulties; and that his intellectual functioning was in the borderline range.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   (Trial Record, C. 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Wiggins v.

Specifically, McMillan pleaded that his trial counsel should have investigated and presented evidence indicating that his school records revealed that he had learning problems at a young age, that testing revealed serious intellectual and adaptive deficits, that his family members noticed his mental deficits, that McMillan's mother is intellectually disabled, and that McMillan's\n   stepfather is also intellectually disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The circuit court made the following findings on this claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   \"In preparing for trial, McMillan and his defense had the services of Dr. Kimberly Ackerson, a board certified forensic examiner in psychology with a great deal of experience testifying as an expert in numerous courts. As part of her expertise, Dr. Ackerson had extensive experience with the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. Prior to McMillan's trial, Dr. Ackerson had served on the Blue Ribbon Committee on Mental Health Testimony in Alabama Capital Cases. In this case, Dr. Ackerson met with McMillan, his family members and reviewed the records obtained by defense counsel and did not express any opinion that McMillan suffered from mental retardation. Dr. Ackerson's invoice, contained in the fee declaration of [Kendrick] James [one of McMillan's trial counsel,] which is contained in the Court's files and of which the Court takes judicial notice, reflects that she spent three (3) hours conducting psychological and forensic assessments in this case. As noted above, Dr. Ackerson did not take issue with Dr. Kirkland's opinion that McMillan was functioning one level above mild mental retardation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   \"Recently, the Supreme Court noted, 'The selection of an expert witness is a paradigmatic example of the type of \"strategic choice\" that, when made \"after thorough investigation of the law and facts,\" is \"virtually unchallengeable.\" '\n   <em>\n    Hinton v.

In this case, the defense's use of highly qualified, board-certified forensic psychological who interviewed McMillan, spoke to his family, reviewed the records collected about McMillan's life and who did not dispute Dr. Kirkland's assessment regarding McMillan's classification of borderline intellectual functioning insulates them from the second-guessing contained in the petition. Counsel for McMillan could have reasonably relied on Dr. Ackerson's assessment of McMillan and her acceptance of Dr. Kirkland's findings in choosing not to pursue a mental retardation sentencing defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   \"[McMillan's] videotaped interview with Millbrook police officers would also provide a reasonable basis for a competent lawyer to determine that efforts to prove deficits in adaptive functioning, in the face of an expert's standardized instrument saying that such deficits do not exist, would be a fruitless endeavor.... In the light of McMillan's demeanor in his statement to police, including his goal-directed activity of attempting to deceive police and shift blame to a third party based on an actual person, and the existence of standardized testing suggesting that [McMillan's] adaptive functioning was not impaired, trial counsel could have reasonably determined that the strategy now advocated in the post-conviction petition would be a waste of defense resources.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   \"By the penalty phase of trial, the jury had seen McMillan, his demeanor, and his ability to interact and communicate with police during his videotaped interview. The jury knew that McMillan was living on his own and had previously worked at Hyundai, based on McMillan's employee identification card being admitted into evidence. The jury further saw McMillan undertake goal-directed activity in that he decided he wanted a truck, got transportation to a busy shopping\n   area to find someone's truck he could steal, he laid in wait for the right victim, and he fled from the police (twice). McMillan was the primary instigator of the crime and the crime was not the result of McMillan being a 'follower.' The jury also knew about the presence of all of McMillan's worldly possessions in the victim's truck, meaning they knew McMillan was able to take possession of, and keep up with, tangible goods without assistance from others. This evidence also showed McMillan was able to understand the need to engage in flight from the area following his commission of the offense of murder. Other goal-directed activity evidence included McMillan's attempts to alter legal and financial documents pertaining to the truck in order to make it appear he had a possessory interest in the truck. At a minimum, that activity reflected McMillan's knowledge about the concepts of ownership and documentary evidence of ownership, financial matters and title documents. In addition, McMillan was astute enough to attempt to misdirect police toward a third-party suspect named Melvin Browning. Against this backdrop, defense counsel could have reasonably decided that arguing their client was mentally retarded was a lost cause, especially in the light of the findings of Dr. Kirkland and no findings by Dr. Ackerson to the contrary....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   \"Trial counsel obtained the valuable services of multiple experts and the record establishes that they conducted a thorough investigation, with the records they uncovered used by McMillan's postconviction counsel at present.

Quite simply, they did enough to investigate and uncover issues pertaining to McMillan's mental health and mental status to present a reasonable and effective mitigation strategy.

Explaining McMillan's behavioral problems as a result of his incomplete frontal lobe development due to age, as is alleged by McMillan in his petition, could have shifted focus away from the neglect and abuse that was highlighted in the mitigation case as the likely culprit, and would have lessened the culpability defense counsel sought to assign to DHR, as treatment and counseling arguably would have done little to speed along McMillan's brain's development.

The record shows that ultimately counsel spoke to the court clerk on the phone and sent his investigator to Dallas County to obtain the file, but that it could not be located.

She further testified that her mother moved from New York to Shorter, Alabama, shortly after becoming pregnant with McMillan. She further testified that because of her mother's drug and alcohol use, her siblings (including McMillan) were moved into foster care shortly after his birth and while he was still an infant. This lasted until 1991 when McMillan returned to his mother in Waugh, Alabama. She testified this living arrangement included the presence of Willie Ford.

Dick noted that during the time the children stayed at the Waugh residence, they would periodically have to stay with Carol Weaver. Dick discussed one occasion in June 1997 when the children had to stay at a motel because the shelter was full.

Dick testified that the placement with Weaver lasted ten months. After Weaver, McMillan was placed with Macon County DHR. Next, Dick referenced McMillan's placement in the State Alternatives for Families and Youth Center in 2001. McMillan went through approximately twenty homes after that placement. Finally, Dick noted that McMillan was emancipated in January 2007.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-232\">\n   \"Emma Cosby testified that she was a social worker who supervised McMillan during a placement in the home of [W.B.] in the 2000-2001 time frame.

When the complained of comments are considered in the context of the entire argument of the State, McMillan's prejudice argument evaporates. The State began its penalty phase closing argument by 'emphasizing' to the jury that the 'decision is a legal and a factual one in accordance with the instructions of the Court.' Counsel for the State then reminded the jury that their decision required a weighing of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Counsel told the jurors that the amount of weight they gave the proven aggravating circumstance 'is solely yours.' Counsel for the State informed the jury that they were required to consider any mitigation offered by McMillan, but that only they could determine whether it was mitigating or the weight to be assigned to such circumstances. In conclusion, the State argued:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-258\">\n   \" 'And the law says, as we talked about earlier, if the aggravation outweighs the mitigation, it is your role, as duly impaneled jurors who have sworn an oath, to follow the instructions of the Court, follow the law, and apply it to the facts and return a verdict based on that. And if the aggravation outweighs the mitigation, it's death.

Deliberate means that you consider everyone's views and review the evidence, you don't shut yourselves off from everybody else, because that turns into a court of men and women and of individuals and not a court of law.'

This observation was a fair rebuttal to the proffered statutory mitigating circumstance of McMillan's age, showing that simply being 18 years old is not a handicap or condition that automatically results in lessened culpability.

McMillan also possessed both understanding and appreciation for his legal situation. Overall, McMillan was found 'capable of understanding his legal situation, assisting his attorneys, and proceeding to disposition and/or trial' and 'capable of retaining and comprehending basic concepts of the trial process.' The court-appointed examiner further noted, 'McMillan appears to be capable of understanding his legal situation and assisting his attorneys.'

Dr. Ackerson's opinion was that McMillan's behavioral problems sprang from a lack of attachment when McMillan was an infant as well as the after-effects of an alleged sexual assault. Rather than suffering from mental retardation, Dr. Ackerson noted that McMillan had been diagnosed with conduct disorder. Dr. Ackerson further noted a diagnosis of oppositional defiance disorder. Dr. Ackerson further found the presence of symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Dr. Ackerson's testimony also revealed that she relied, in part, on the court-ordered evaluation performed by Dr. Kirkland.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-318\">\n   \"Accordingly, the evidence before the Court is sufficient to establish that defense counsel provided reasonably competent assistance of counsel (i.e., were not deficient) in that their strategy was consistent with the opinions of multiple experts, including several who appeared on behalf of McMillan. Not a single expert for the defense found evidence of mental retardation. Indeed, the experts presented by the defense all concluded that McMillan suffered from behavioral disorders consistent with the documentation from DHR and somewhat consistent with the findings of the court-appointed expert.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   (C. 1489-93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   The trial record shows that counsel moved to suppress McMillan's statement to police. (Trial Record, C. 219-20.) A hearing was held on the motion. McMillan argued that his statement was unconstitutionally\n   procured because he was submitted to interrogation after invoking his right to counsel. On appeal, this Court held that McMillan had waived his right to counsel and that the statement was properly admitted into evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McMillan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6958122\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/139/184/\">\n    139 So.3d at 196-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   Based on the experts who evaluated McMillan, counsel had no reason to doubt McMillan's mental health or to argue that ground in the motion to suppress his statement.

McMillan challenges the following statement made by his defense counsel in closing: \"We have an eyewitness that got closer to Calvin McMillan than I am to you and that is Robbie Lusk.\" (Trial Record, R. 1414.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   The circuit court made the following findings on this claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-325\">\n   \"During closing argument, counsel observed, 'The first thing that is consistent is nobody in that parking lot can say that Calvin McMillan was there that night and committed this offense. Nobody, nobody could say it when they were sitting on that witness stand four feet away from Mr. McMillan. Nobody could look at him and say that's the guy that was there that night.' Later, defense counsel again emphasized that no eyewitnesses could point out McMillan. Even later, counsel stated, '... the State has to prove that it was Mr. McMillan that was out there that day, that evening, and committed the robbery.' This is another point where the State basically wants you to disregard the eyewitness testimony. Toward the end of his argument, counsel again argued, 'And they haven't shown that was Calvin McMillan there at the scene that night committing that offense.' Again, counsel argued there was nothing linking McMillan to being at Wal-Mart on the night of the offense. Continuing on his theme, defense counsel again asserted that there was not sufficient evidence to prove that McMillan was the person in the parking lot of Wal-Mart on the night of the murder. In conclusion, counsel described the only person that put McMillan in the parking lot, codefendant [Rondarrell] Williams, as a liar and reminded the jury that the other eyewitnesses could not pick McMillan out of a lineup or otherwise identify him, reminding them that [Robert] Lusk suggested the person might have long hair. Counsel then stated, 'Just because Mr. Martin was shot doesn't mean Mr. McMillan did it. The State has to prove that he did.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-326\">\n   \"All in all, it is clear that defense counsel did not concede that McMillan shot Martin. In context, it appears that counsel misspoke during the heat of battle. In fact, counsel immediately corrected himself by changing his misstatement to 'or extremely close to the black male on that night.' The context of the overall argument regarding Lusk's testimony centered on the fact that Lusk described hair coming out from beneath the hat worn by the shooter, something defense counsel stated would be impossible for McMillan because of his short cropped hair. He concluded his argument about Lusk's testimony by reminding the jury that Lusk could not pick McMillan out of a lineup, concluding 'Calvin wasn't the guy.' In context, therefore, counsel's misstatement did not affect the thrust or overall defense theme as stated in the closing argument.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-327\">\n   \"The Court finds that the inadvertent misstatement by defense counsel, immediately\n   corrected, does not constitute deficient performance and, in any event, McMillan was not prejudiced by the closing argument of counsel.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   (C. 1496-97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   As the circuit court correctly noted, it appears that the challenged remark by counsel was merely a misstatement and was not a concession of McMillan's guilt. Counsel repeatedly argued in closing that there was no one who could identify McMillan as the person in the parking lot at the time of the murder. Counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for making a misstatement similar to the one that occurred in this case. \"Effective counsel does not mean errorless counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Birt v.

Here, even taking into account the standard error of measurement McMillan's score would have remained above the generally accepted score of 70 (two standard deviations below 100) that constitutes the intelligence-quotient portion of a mental-retardation analysis. And that would assume the largest standard error of measurement operating such as to overestimate McMillan's intelligence. As a result, McMillan's full-scale IQ score placed him higher than 70-even taking into account the standard error of measurement; thus, he cannot satisfy the intelligence-quotient aspect of a mental-retardation diagnosis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-335\">\n   \"Nor is this a case where McMillan's adaptive functioning was not considered. As part of the court-ordered assessment, McMillan was administered the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System 2 (ABAS2). Thus, the evaluation in this case did not depend solely on McMillan's IQ scores, but also on a test of adaptive behaviors. The expert concluded that McMillan 'is not mildly retarded, but functions in the classification range immediately above the classification of mild mental retardation as well as in the range of low average intellectual functioning.' As to adaptive functioning, this Court took notice in its sentencing order of Dr. Kirkland's finding that McMillan's 'intellectual functioning and social adaptive functioning were on a high borderline to low average intellectual level.' Again, this finding by a court-ordered expert provides a basis for determining that McMillan does not meet the adaptive functioning aspect of a mental retardation diagnosis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-336\">\n   \"Further, Carol Weaver, McMillan's aunt who testified on McMillan's behalf\n   at trial, was 'interviewed in depth concerning McMillan's developmental history and symptom picture' by the court appointed expert. Weaver indicated that she 'would have never characterized McMillan as being mentally retarded.' Ultimately, the examiner noted that McMillan's history revealed problems with his behavior, a lifetime of being subjected to neglect and abandonment, and a history of multiple foster-home placements. The picture of McMillan painted by the court-appointed expert is very similar to that painted by the defense expert who testified at trial.
