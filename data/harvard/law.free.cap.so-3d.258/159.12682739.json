For the reasons that follow, we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Relevant Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, spilling millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, BP Exploration and Production, Inc., and/or BP America Production Company, (hereinafter \"BP\") engaged numerous companies to assist in performing response services. Ultimately, thousands of vessels participated. One such entity, Lawson Environmental Service, L.L.C. (hereinafter \"Lawson\"), was contracted by BP to assist. BP also engaged ORM to provide personnel and oil spill response services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ORM then subcontracted with CTEH, who supplied workers for the cleanup effort. CTEH employed Plaintiff, Nathanial Smith (hereinafter \"Smith\"), to work as a safety observer. On October 7, 2010, while working aboard the vessel, Captain Cristo (hereinafter \"Cristo\"), Smith was injured when the Boomer II rear ended the Cristo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Smith filed a petition for damages alleging claims under general maritime law against Lawson. In response, Lawson filed a third party demand against ORM, seeking indemnification. Although ORM agreed to indemnify Lawson, it filed a third party demand against CTEH, pursuant to a separate contractual indemnity agreement and sought contractual defense, indemnity, and insurance coverage. Smith subsequently reached a settlement and dismissed all claims against all parties with prejudice. Only ORM and CTEH's claims against each other remain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   CTEH filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking a determination that Smith is an employee under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20901\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , the Longshore Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (hereinafter \"LHWCA\"), and requesting that the indemnity agreement between ORM and CTEH be declared void.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After taking the matter under advisement, the trial court granted CTEH's motion for summary judgment, finding Smith was an employee under the LHWCA and dismissed ORM's third party demand. In the trial court's reasons for judgment, it concluded that Smith failed to meet the requirements to qualify as a Jones Act seaman for the following reasons: (1) Smith did not contribute to the function of the vessel; (2) Smith was not a Jones Act seaman connected to a fleet of vessels under common control of the U.S. government; (3) Smith had no substantial connection to the vessel in duration and nature, based upon Smith's statement \"that his work as a safety observer was done on the beaches that were being cleaned.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Applicable Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   An appellate court reviews a trial court's disposition on a motion for summary judgment using the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Navarre v.

In its motion for summary judgment, CTEH argues ORM's potential recovery against it for contractual defense, indemnity, and insurance coverage is contingent on Smith's status as an LHWCA employee or a Jones Act seaman.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   CTEH contends the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment and dismissing ORM's third party demand because the undisputed facts prove Smith was an employee under the LHWCA as a matter of law. According to CTEH's theory of the case, Smith qualifies as an employee under the LHWCA for two reasons. First, there were no facts to suggest Smith worked on a fleet of vessels under common ownership or control. Lawson chartered both the Cristo and the Boomer II. Further, CTEH attached deposition testimony of their employee, Smith, who stated that his assignment to the Cristo was controlled by the Cristo alone. Second, CTEH argues that Smith did not have a substantial connection in duration and nature to a vessel. To support these arguments, CTEH notes Smith worked only one day aboard the Cristo, falling far below the required thirty percent threshold needed to establish seaman status. The vessels Smith worked on were not under common control, according to CTEH's theory; thus, only the one day Smith worked on the Cristo should be used in determining how much time Smith worked on vessels. According to the timesheets for Smith, he worked aboard numerous vessels for nineteen days and worked on land eighteen days. Since CTEH calculates that Smith spent only six percent of his time on the Cristo, CTEH argues he could not qualify as a seaman as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In opposition to CTEH's motion, ORM maintains there are material factual disputes regarding whether Smith worked on a fleet of vessels under common ownership or control. In support, ORM produced an affidavit of ORM's CEO Tim Whipple (hereinafter \"Whipple\"); Smith's deposition testimony and Smith's timesheets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whipple attested that ORM and its subcontractors were at all times subject to the authority of the U.S. government, through the incident command system and the federal\n   on-scene coordinators. Whipple noted that \"response efforts followed the specific instructions relayed in the incident action plans, which contained detailed instructions concerning the authorized response activities that were to occur each day and which were approved by the federal on-scene coordinators, representatives and/or other federal officials at all times.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Smith's deposition, he testified that \"it wasn't his business to know actually what company owned which boats. I was there just to be a safety observer.\" ORM attached the joint stipulations of fact submitted in\n   <em>\n    In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig \"Deepwater Horizon\" in the Gulf of Mexico\n   </em>\n   . MDL 2179,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20614690\">\n    2016 WL 614690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at 9 (E.D. La. Feb. 16, 2016) (unpublished), which it argues demonstrated ultimate control of the vessels rested with the U.S. government for all response activities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ORM maintains vessel ownership is irrelevant; rather the determinative issue is control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ORM also contends that Smith met the thirty percent threshold, noting the threshold is only a guideline, as the unique facts of each case control the ultimate determination. According to ORM, Smith's deposition testimony and timesheets prove he worked aboard vessels for nineteen days, or over thirty-nine percent of his employment with CTEH. Specifically, Smith's timesheets reflected the time spent on the water each day, which supported his deposition testimony that he worked about forty percent of the time aboard vessels. Finally, Smith's deposition testimony was that he served aboard hundreds of vessels as a safety observer in the water, demonstrating a sufficient connection to vessels for seaman status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Based upon our review of the record, we find there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding the applicable maritime workers' statute under which Smith falls. Factual inferences on these issues are germane to the issue of seaman status. Thus, it requires the weighing of evidence which is improper on a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Becnel v. Chet Morrison, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 2010-1411, pp.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14-15%20%28La.App.%204%20Cir.%208/31/11%29\">\n    14-15 (La.App. 4 Cir. 8/31/11)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7029683\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/73/1002/#p1010\">\n    73 So.3d 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1010. Different factual inferences could be drawn by the trier of fact regarding who controlled the vessels. The only evidence CTEH submitted in support of their argument that each\n   vessel ultimately controlled operations for the day, was the deposition of Smith, which offered little insight. ORM offered Whipple's affidavit, which attested the U.S. government ultimately controlled the mission, which creates a genuine issue of material fact. Further, the question of which entity ultimately controlled the vessels upon which Smith worked necessarily touches upon the appropriate method to calculate Smith's total time spent aboard vessels. Therefore, the record before this Court does not provide the necessary undisputed facts as to Smith's seaman status which would justify the grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   There is a genuine issue of material fact as to Smith's status as a seaman under the Jones Act or under the LHWCA. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment in favor of CTEH and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Finding that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment, we pretermit discussion of ORM's additional assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    ORM is an organization which provides emergency preparedness and response management services to the oil industry.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Lawson chartered both the Cristo and the Boomer II to assist in cleanup.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    CTEH argues that the indemnity agreement violated\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20905\">\n     33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    CTEH appears to concede that reasonable minds could differ regarding Smith's contribution to the vessel's mission, focusing their argument on whether Smith served on a fleet of vessels under common ownership or control.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    CTEH objected in their reply brief, and at the hearing, to the affidavit.

C.C.P. art. 966(D)(2) constituted reversible error. La. C.C.P. art. 966(D)(2) provides that: \"[a]ny objection to a document shall be raised in a timely filed opposition or reply memorandum. The court shall consider all objections prior to rendering judgment. The court shall specifically state on the record or in writing which documents, if any, it held to be inadmissible or declined to consider.\" In\n    <em>\n     Morindani,\n    </em>\n    like in the case\n    <em>\n     sub judice,\n    </em>\n    an objection was made on the record to documents submitted on the summary judgment motion. However, in both cases, the trial court failed to state on the record, or in writing, that any of the documents submitted were inadmissible or would not be considered. This Court in\n    <em>\n     Morindani\n    </em>\n    found that the appellant's objection to the documents submitted in support of the motion for summary judgment were without merit, thus the trial court was not required to make any specific statements regarding their admissibility. Specifically, the\n    <em>\n     Morindani\n    </em>\n    court noted that the \"if any\" language in La. C.C.P. art. 966(D)(2) only requires the trial court to address the admissibility of documents if it deems the documents inadmissible or otherwise declined to consider them. In the case\n    <em>\n     sub judice,\n    </em>\n    CTEH argues that the affidavit is inadmissible because Whipple does not have personal knowledge, as required by La. C.C.P. art. 967. However, Whipple, the CEO of ORM indicated he is familiar with the records and business of ORM and, as CEO, would have personal knowledge of the business operations.
