He entered a plea of not guilty and, following a jury trial, was found guilty as charged on counts 1 and 3; he was found not guilty on count 2. Defendant filed a motion for post-verdict judgment of acquittal, which was denied. On count 1, defendant was sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence; on count 3, he was sentenced to life imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently. Defendant now appeals, designating one counseled assignment of error and two pro se\n   assignments of error. We affirm the molestation of a juvenile conviction and sentence; we affirm the aggravated rape conviction, amend the sentence to include that it be served at hard labor, and affirm as amended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The mother of eight-year-old daughter S.W.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   married defendant in February of 2009. They lived in Houma. Before the marriage, S.W.'s mother and defendant lived together for two years, each with children from previous relationships. According to S.W., when she was in the first grade (prior to her mother's and defendant's marriage), defendant put his finger in her vagina when she was taking a bath. At the time, she did not tell anyone of the incident. Several years later, according to S.W., when she was eleven years old, she and defendant were in a closet at their home in Dularge. There, defendant vaginally raped S.W. At the time, she did not tell anyone of the incident. In 2013, when she was thirteen years old and attending Evergreen Junior High School, S.W. told a guidance counselor what defendant had done to her. The school then contacted S.W.'s mother, who informed the police. Defendant did not testify at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    COUNSELED AND FIRST PRO SE ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his sole counseled assignment of error, defendant argues the State did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed molestation of a juvenile or aggravated rape and, as such, the evidence was insufficient to support either conviction.

According to S.W., defendant had checked her out of school (first grade) because she was sick; when they got home, defendant made her take a bath. Defendant notes in brief that most of S.W.'s school records at this time had been destroyed, and there was no record of who checked out S.W. or why she was checked out. Further, according to defendant, school records indicated that he \"would have been available to check her out on only one occasion, August 27, 2007.\" Defendant further notes that S.W, was seven years old on August 27, 2007. Defendant further suggests S.W's trial testimony was inconsistent with statements that she made to her mother and to Detective Tara Whitney, with the Terrebonne Parish Sheriff's Office, who handled S.W.'s case. Defendant notes that Detective Whitney testified that S.W. told her that she (S.W.) told her mother for the first time about the sexual abuse by defendant the day her mother and defendant got married which, according to S.W., was September of 2010. Further, according to defendant in brief, S.W. told the detective (per the detective's testimony) that there was domestic violence between defendant and S.W.'s mother on her wedding day because of S.W.'s disclosure of sexual abuse; and both defendant and S.W.'s mother, according to S.W. were issued a summons. Defendant suggests in brief that \"none\" of what S.W. said regarding the wedding and subsequent domestic violence is true. According to defendant, there was no incident in September of 2010; rather, there was a report of domestic violence in January of 2010, and a summons was issued only to S.W.'s mother. Further, defendant notes, defendant and S.W.'s mother were married on February 15, 2009, not in September of 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   S.W.'s testimony, if believed, established that defendant, on separate occasions, molested her and raped her. According to S.W., she was in the first grade and living at \"Colonial Village\" apartments with her mother, defendant, and siblings. S.W. testified that defendant had checked her out of school and, when they got home, he told her to take a bath. The defendant went into the bathroom with her and, while S.W. was bathing, defendant told her she was not taking \"a bath right,\" so he bathed her. While she was standing in the tub, according to S.W., defendant put his finger in her vagina. Defendant stopped when S.W. said she was going to tell her mother. Defendant replied to this that S.W. would get in trouble.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On a later occasion, when she was eleven years old, S.W. was living with her family in a house in Dularge on Riley Drive. There was a very large walk-in closet in the house, wherein S.W. and her siblings played and S.W. sometimes slept. There was a dresser and a television in the closet. According to S.W., sometime in 2011, she and defendant were in the closet. Defendant got behind S.W., pulled her shorts down, and told her to bend over. S.W. complied. According to S.W., defendant then put the tip of his penis in her vagina. Defendant pushed S.W., and she hit the wall with her head. She then left the closet and went outside. Louisiana Revised Statutes 14:41B provides that \"[e]mission is not necessary\" and that \"any sexual penetration, when the rape involves vaginal or anal intercourse, however slight, is sufficient to complete the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    State v. Rives,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9599631\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/407/1195/#p1197\">\n    407 So.2d 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1197 (La. 1981).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Alton Johnson, the Terrebonne Parish School Board Supervisor of Child Welfare and Attendance, testified at trial that S.W. attended Broadmoor Elementary for first grade in 2006 and 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Johnson indicated that attendance records showed that S.W. had been checked out of school on December 15, 2006, and on August 22, 2007. On both days, she had been checked out at 12:35 p.m. According to Johnson, there was nothing in the documentation to show who checked out S.W. or the reason for being checked out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Regarding the alleged rape incident, defendant notes that S.W. was asked to read an account of the alleged sexual abuse by defendant that she had handwritten in a letter. In this letter, S.W. mentions the bathtub incident and another incident in 2010 in a closet; the letter, however, does not contain any account of the rape that S.W. had alleged occurred in the same closet. Defendant suggests in brief that it is \"highly unlikely that if she had been raped in a closet\" when she was eleven years old that she would have forgotten it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Regarding the alleged crimes for which defendant was convicted, a reasonable trier of fact could have concluded that, despite any inconsistencies or contradictions, S.W. was being truthful when she testified that defendant, on one occasion, had put his finger in her vagina, and a few years later on another occasion, defendant vaginally raped her. The jury could have reasonably concluded that, given S.W.'s very young age at the time of these incidents, she was unable to remember exact dates and times, or to recall specific details surrounding the incidents. Dr. Jamie Jackson, an expert in pediatrics, testified at trial that delayed disclosure was common among sexual abuse victims, and that such disclosure could sometimes take years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In any event, the foregoing arguments raised by defendant are credibility issues. The jury heard the testimony and viewed the evidence presented to it at\n   trial and found defendant guilty as charged (on counts 1 and 3). In the absence of internal contradiction or irreconcilable conflict with the physical evidence, one witness's testimony, if believed by the trier of fact, is sufficient to support a factual conclusion.\n   <strong>\n    State v.

The trier of fact is free to accept or reject, in whole or in part, the testimony of any witness. Moreover, when there is conflicting testimony about factual matters, the resolution of which depends upon a determination of the credibility of the witnesses, the matter is one of the weight of the evidence, not its sufficiency. The trier of fact's determination of the weight to be given evidence is not subject to appellate review. An appellate court will not reweigh the evidence to overturn a factfinder's determination of guilt.\n   <strong>\n    State v.

We do not agree. While the evidence did not establish that defendant used force on S.W., the evidence clearly established he used his position of authority to molest S.W. By conflation, defendant avers in brief that, pursuant to the\n   <strong>\n    Leblanc\n   </strong>\n   decision, the State was required to prove that \"by the exertion of influence over the child,\" he must have effectively forced S.W. to participate in the lewd acts. This is incorrect. Under the \"supervision and control\" element, the law requires that the. molestation be accomplished\n   <em>\n    by virtue of\n   </em>\n   control and/or supervision of the juvenile. Moreover, the\n   <strong>\n    Leblanc\n   </strong>\n   decision had nothing to do with the \"supervision and control\" element.

During this time, S.W.'s mother worked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The foregoing facts established that defendant had authority or supervision over S.W. Defendant was clearly placed in a position of trust by S.W.'s mother. While defendant was not S.W.'s stepfather at the time of the molestation, he took on the role of guardian of S.W. and perpetrated the molestation by virtue of control and/or supervision.

According to defendant, the enactment of\n   LSA-Const. art.

It is well-settled that a constitutional challenge may not be considered by an appellate court unless it was properly pleaded and raised in the trial court below. A party must raise the unconstitutionality in the trial court, the unconstitutionality must be specially pleaded, and the grounds outlining the basis of unconstitutionality must be particularized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    State v.

Louisiana Constitution article I, \u00a7 17 (A) and Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure article 782A provide that in cases where punishment is necessarily at hard labor, the case shall be tried by a jury composed of twelve jurors, ten of whom must concur to render a verdict.
