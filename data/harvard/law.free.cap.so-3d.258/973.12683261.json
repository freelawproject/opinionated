Following his first appeal, this Court affirmed defendant's conviction of second degree murder in violation of La.

On October 29, 2014, this Court dismissed defendant's appeal finding that a ruling denying a motion to correct illegal sentence is not reviewable by this Court under its appellate jurisdiction. Accordingly, this Court granted defendant thirty days from the date of its opinion to file a supervisory writ application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, this Court found no error in the trial court's January 16, 2014 ruling and denied defendant's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   writ application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 15, 2016, defendant filed a second\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence citing\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v. Louisiana\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n    193 L.Ed.2d 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), which made the holding in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   retroactive to cases on collateral review. On April 28, 2016, the trial court ordered the matter set for hearing on resentencing. A hearing was held on December 7, 2017, after which the court sentenced defendant \"pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , to life in prison,\" noting that \"by operation of law he is eligible for parole.\" The commitment from the December 7, 2017 resentencing hearing states that the \"Court re-sentenced the Defendant pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Miller vs. Alabama\n   </em>\n   to imprisonment at hard labor in the Department of Corrections for a term of life in prison.\" The commitment does not specifically state defendant is parole eligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 28, 2017, defendant filed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motions to reconsider sentence and for appeal. Additionally, on January 5, 2018, a counseled motion for reconsideration of sentence and motion for appeal were also filed. The trial court granted defendant's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for appeal on January 9, 2018, and his counseled motion for appeal on February 20, 2018, and further denied his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion to reconsider sentence on February 2, 2018, and his counseled motion for reconsideration of sentence on April 13, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 16, 2018, defendant filed a Motion to Amend Minute Entry of December 7, 2017, alleging that the Department of Corrections requested clarification of the commitment to reflect that defendant was sentenced to life with parole. The trial court denied defendant's motion to amend the minute entry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We now consider defendant's third appeal asserting an error patent on the face of the record regarding the December 7, 2017 sentencing commitment. He argues the commitment fails to reflect his parole eligibility, and in the alternative, submits that if this Court should find the trial court resentenced him without the benefit of parole, such a sentence should be deemed excessive. Defendant also files several\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   claims regarding his resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his first counseled assignment of error, defendant argues that neither the commitment nor the Louisiana Uniform Commitment Order (UCO) reflects his parole eligible status and should be corrected. The State disagrees and argues that in accord with the transcript, the commitment and UCO accurately reflect that defendant was resentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . The State further contends that a judicial determination as to defendant's parole eligibility was not required to be made by the trial court due to its existence by operation of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant was convicted in 1997 of second degree murder committed when he was a juvenile and was sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Subsequent to his conviction and sentencing, the United States Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , which bars a sentencing scheme that mandates life-without-parole sentences for juveniles convicted of homicide on the grounds that such sentences constitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. A defendant who was under the age of majority at the time he/she committed a homicide is entitled to a sentencing hearing, otherwise known as a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   hearing, for purposes of determining whether his/her sentence will be imposed with or without parole eligibility.\n   <em>\n    State v. Allen\n   </em>\n   , 17-685 (La. App. 5 Cir. 5/16/18),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12672811\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/247/179/#p184\">\n    247 So.3d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To meet the requirements established in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Louisiana Legislature enacted La. C.Cr.P. art. 878.1, which sets forth the hearing procedure for determination of parole eligibility for certain juvenile offenders. La. C.Cr.P. art. 878.1(B)(1) specifically provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   If an offender was indicted prior to August 1, 2017, for the crime of first degree murder ( R.S. 14:30 ) or second degree murder ( R.S. 14:30.1 ) where the offender was under the age of eighteen years at the time of the commission of the offense and a hearing was not held pursuant to this Article prior to August 1, 2017, to determine whether the offender's sentence should be imposed with or without parole eligibility, the district attorney may file a notice of intent to seek a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole within ninety days of August 1, 2017. If the district attorney timely files the notice of intent, a hearing shall be conducted to determine whether the sentence shall be imposed with or without parole eligibility. If the court determines that the sentence shall be imposed with parole eligibility, the offender shall be eligible for parole pursuant to R.S. 15:574.4(G). If the district attorney fails to timely file the notice of intent, the offender shall be eligible for parole pursuant to R.S. 15:574.4(E) without the need of a judicial determination pursuant to the provisions of this Article. If the court determines that the sentence shall be imposed without parole eligibility, the offender shall not be eligible for parole.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Therefore, under La. C.Cr.P. art. 878.1(B)(1), if a juvenile offender was indicted of second degree murder prior to\n   August 1, 2017, and a hearing to determine the juvenile offender's parole eligibility was not held before that date, the State was afforded the opportunity to file a notice of its intent to seek a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole within ninety days of August 1, 2017. The State did not file such a notice in the instant matter. Therefore, La. C.Cr.P. art 878.1 required that defendant \"shall be eligible for parole pursuant to R.S. 15:574.4(E) without the need of a judicial determination ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On December 7, 2017, the trial court resentenced defendant \"pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , to life in prison.\" Later, the following exchange took place between the court and defense counsel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   DEFENSE: I'm sorry, Your Honor, but can we can back to Mr. Smith? I understand what the Court just said but I still didn't hear the Court say that he is eligible for parole and I - -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT: Because by operation of law he is eligible for parole.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While the trial court correctly noted that by operation of law defendant is eligible for parole pursuant to La. C.Cr.P. art. 878.1(B)(1) because the State did not file a notice of intent to seek a sentence of life imprisonment without parole, we find defendant's parole eligible status should be included in the commitment and UCO. The indication in the commitment the defendant was resentenced pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Miller vs. Alabama\n   </em>\n   , is not sufficient to alert the Department of Corrections that defendant is parole eligible. In order to reach this determination, the Department of Corrections would be required to review the record to determine defendant's parole eligibility based on the State's failure to file the notice of intent required by La. C.Cr.P. art. 878.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Therefore, this Court remands this matter to the trial court for correction of the commitment and UCO to indicate that defendant is parole eligible pursuant to La. C.Cr.P. art. 878.1(B)(1). We further direct the Clerk of Court for the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court to transmit the original of the corrected UCO to the appropriate authorities and the Department of Corrections' legal department.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Long\n   </em>\n   , 12-184 (La. App. 5 Cir. 12/11/12),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7018140\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/106/1136/#p1142\">\n    106 So.3d 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1142.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In his second assignment of error, defendant alternatively argues that if this Court finds the trial court sentenced defendant\n   to life without parole, the sentence is excessive and should be reduced. Based on our findings above, this assignment of error is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant also raises several\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   assignments of error. In his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   assignments of error one and four, defendant argues the trial court violated his constitutional rights under the United States Constitution by disobeying the substantive \"rule change\" announced in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   , in that the Eighth Amendment demands the trial court fashion an \"individualized\" sentence for juvenile offenders \"whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity.\" He claims the trial court here merely employed a procedural hearing to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's substantive \"rule change,\" failing to impose an individualized sentence. Defendant concludes that the trial court's deletion of the parole restriction from his sentence does not satisfy the resentencing requirements under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As discussed above, in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders. In\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court recognized that states could remedy\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   violations by rendering a juvenile parole eligible rather than imposing a new sentence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Giving\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   retroactive effect, moreover, does not require States to relitigate sentences, let alone convictions, in every case where a juvenile received life without parole.\n   <strong>\n    A State may remedy a\n    <em>\n     Miller\n    </em>\n    violation by permitting juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole, rather than by resentencing them.\n   </strong>\n   Allowing those offenders to be considered for parole ensures that juveniles whose crimes reflected only transient immaturity - and who have since matured - will not be forced to serve a disproportionate sentence in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To implement\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's\"meaningful opportunity to obtain release\" for those juveniles who commit murder, the Louisiana Legislature enacted La.

App. 2 Cir. 11/15/17), the court addressed a similar claim that the trial court erred in resentencing the defendant to life with parole pursuant to La. R.S. 15:574.4(E), instead of imposing an individualized sentence and allowing the defendant an opportunity to develop a record for alternative sentencing under\n   <em>\n    State v.

R.S. 15:574.4, violated federal and state\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   clauses and his constitutional right to due process by failing to provide him \"fair notice.\" He submits that his sentence violates his right to the protections of the \"fair warning requirement\" of the due process clause because it was based upon\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and the legislature's response to\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , which should not be applied retroactively to his case. He further contends that his sentence of life with parole eligibility is too harsh and that it constitutes\n   <em>\n    an ex post facto\n   </em>\n   application of the law because the new sentencing scheme announced in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   did not exist at the time of his conviction and original sentencing. He avers that because the mandatory sentencing provision under which he was originally sentenced has been ruled unconstitutional, his sentence is illegal and he should be resentenced according to the penalties provided for in the lesser and included offense of manslaughter in effect at the time he committed the offense. He concludes that because his crime reflects \"transient immaturity,\" he should be afforded the opportunity to prove that a downward departure from the sentence of life imprisonment is warranted in his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To the extent defendant argues that his sentence of life with eligibility of parole violates his right to due process by failing to provide fair notice because it was not a sentencing option at the time of his offense, this argument has previously been addressed and rejected by this Court and other Louisiana appellate courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The legislature designed an adequate solution to\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   by creating statutes relating to parole eligibility for juvenile homicide defendants which are to be read in conjunction with the murder statutes.

C.Cr.P. art. 878.1 and La. R.S. 15:574.4(E) ; (3) defendant is not entitled to be sentenced under the lesser included offense of manslaughter as the only issue in a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   hearing is parole eligibility; and (4) that defendant's sentencing under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   does not violate state and federal\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   clauses as the \"new law\" does not redefine criminal conduct or increase the penalty by which the crime is punishable. In sum, the trial court in this matter adhered to the law set forth in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   with respect to defendant's resentencing.

However, an error patent review was conducted with respect to defendant's resentencing, and the review reveals the following errors patent in addition to the error patent discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in response to defendant's first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We first find that neither the resentencing transcript nor the commitment reflects that defendant received a proper advisal of the time period for seeking post-conviction relief as required by La. C.Cr.P. art. 930.8. Generally, when a defendant is resentenced, he need not be advised again of the applicable prescriptive period for post-conviction relief if such advisal was provided during original sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Griffin\n   </em>\n   , 51,506 (La. App. 2 Cir. 9/1/17),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12668611\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/243/1205/\">\n    243 So.3d 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, when defendant was originally sentenced for second degree murder on June 27, 1997, the trial court apprised him of the three-year time limitation for applying for post-conviction relief then in effect at the time under La. C.Cr.P. art. 930.8. The amendment to article 930.8, which took effect on August 15, 1999, shortened the prescriptive period to two years and was held to apply retroactively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Powell\n   </em>\n   , 00-1729 (La. App. 5 Cir. 3/14/01),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11105182\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/783/478/#p482\">\n    783 So.2d 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 482. Thus, at the time of defendant's resentencing, the two-year prescriptive period was in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Accordingly, by way of this opinion, we advise defendant that no application for post-conviction relief, including applications that seek an out-of-time appeal, shall be considered if filed more than two years after the judgment of conviction and sentence has become final under the provisions of La. C.Cr.P. arts. 914 or 922.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Further, it is noted that the commitment properly reflects defendant's life sentence is to be served at hard labor, but the UCO does not. Thus, in addition to adding that defendant's sentence is with the benefit of parole as ordered above, we order the trial court to correct the UCO to reflect that defendant's life sentence is to be served at hard labor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
