We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On December 26, 2013, Dixie Boyd\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Mary Alice Boyd-Kline, as holder of Boyd's power of attorney, signed a \"residency agreement\" with STV, which operated an assisted-living facility, in which STV agreed to provide Dixie Boyd with a private apartment and other related services, including, among other things, utilities, housekeeping, laundry, meals, maintenance, planned activities, transportation, and security and protection. The residency agreement contained the following arbitration clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    [STV] and [Boyd] agree that [STV] is engaged in interstate commerce\n   </em>\n   and that, except for claims, disputes or controversies relating to unpaid Monthly Fees or the right to possession of the Apartment,\n   <em>\n    any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof\n   </em>\n   , shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules ....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Boyd resided at STV's facility from December 26, 2013, through March 18, 2016. On May 28, 2016, STV filed a collection action against Boyd, seeking to recover $10,475.28 in unpaid rent, plus statutorily stated interest, late fees, attorney fees, and court costs. On July 5, 2016, Boyd and Mary Alice Boyd-Kline (hereinafter referred to collectively as \"Boyd\") filed counterclaims against STV and fictitiously named defendants, alleging negligence, wantonness, negligent supervision and training, premises liability, and breach of contract. The counterclaims were based on the following allegation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"On or about February 28, 2016, STV failed to sufficiently supervise certain residents of STV, such that two residents engaged in a physical altercation. Said altercation resulted in [Dixie] Boyd, who was not involved, being knocked to the floor by one of the residents, striking [Dixie] Boyd's head on a sharp edged coat rack.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 15, 2016, STV filed a motion to compel arbitration of Boyd's counterclaims, a copy of the residency agreement, and a supporting brief. Boyd thereafter filed amended counterclaims, deleting her breach-of-contract claim. On December 2, 2016, Boyd filed a motion in opposition to STV's motion to compel arbitration, arguing that her counterclaims, as amended, encompassed only tort claims and that those claims did not fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 7, 2016, the trial court conducted a hearing at which the parties\n   argued only the issue whether Boyd's counterclaims fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement. Boyd presented no argument or evidence concerning whether the transaction underlying the residency agreement involved interstate commerce. Following the hearing, Boyd moved the trial court to dismiss the motion to compel or, alternatively, to allow her additional time in which to acquire additional proof of her newly submitted defense, i.e., that the residency agreement containing the arbitration provision was a contract of adhesion and was thus unenforceable. On December 15, 2016, the trial court granted Boyd's motion in part, stating that it would consider the submissions received to that date from all parties and that STV would have seven days in which to file a response to Boyd's most recent amended submission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 11, 2017, the trial court entered an order, denying STV's motion to compel arbitration without stating its reasons for doing so. STV filed, pursuant to Rule 59(e), Ala. R. Civ. P., a motion to alter or amend the order, in which it restated the facts and its arguments. STV also attached to its motion the affidavit of its agent, Brian Parker, who stated in detail the reasons the residency agreement evidenced a transaction involving interstate commerce. STV's Rule 59(e) motion was denied by operation of law. This appeal followed. We note that this appeal has been submitted to this Court solely on STV's brief; Boyd has not favored this Court with an appellee's brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"This Court's standard of review on an appeal from a trial court's order granting or denying a motion to compel arbitration is well settled.\n   <em>\n    Bowen v.

Accordingly, the burden then shifted to Boyd to show that the arbitration agreement was invalid or that it did not apply to the dispute in question. During the hearing on the motion to compel arbitration, the parties focused their argument on whether\n   Boyd's tort claims related to or arose out of the residency agreement. \"Whether an arbitration provision encompasses a party's claims 'is a matter of contract interpretation, which interpretation is guided by the intent of the parties, and which intent, absent ambiguity in the clause, is evidenced by the plain language of the clause.' \"\n   <em>\n    Green Tree Fin. Corp. of Alabama v. Vintson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11456066\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/753/497/#p505\">\n    753 So.2d 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 505 (Ala. 1999) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v.

The language of the arbitration provision in this case is not ambiguous. Under the plain language of the provision, Boyd agreed to arbitrate \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   controversy or claim\n   <em>\n    arising out of\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    relating to\n   </em>\n   [the residency agreement], or the breach thereof.\" (Emphasis added.) \"This Court has held [that] where a contract signed by the parties contains a valid arbitration clause that refers only to claims 'arising out of\n   <em>\n    or relating to\n   </em>\n   ' the contract, that clause has a broader application than arbitration clause that refers only to claims 'arising from' the agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Reynolds &amp; Reynolds Co. v.

As indicated, Boyd's tort claims are based on injuries she allegedly suffered as a result of an altercation between two other STV residents. Boyd alleged, among other things, that STV had a duty to provide a safe residential environment for Dixie Boyd and that STV had a duty to properly supervise and train employees or independent contractors responsible for providing safe residential care for Dixie Boyd. Those allegations clearly \"aris[e] out of or relat[e] to\" Dixie Boyd's residency at STV, which was established and governed by the residency agreement. It is \" 'well established that a party may not avoid broad language in an arbitration clause by attempting to cast its complaint in tort rather than contract.' \"\n   <em>\n    Beaver Constr. Co. v.
