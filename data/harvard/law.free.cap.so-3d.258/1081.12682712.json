For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 23, 2014, a Jefferson Parish Grand Jury indicted defendant, Tommie C. Molette a/k/a Tucker Molette, for the second degree murder of Deshon Evans, in violation of La. R.S. 14:30.1 (count one), and the attempted second degree murder\n   of Jonquell Neal, in violation of La. R.S. 14:27 and La. R.S. 14:30.1 (count two).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 22, 2017, trial commenced before a twelve-person jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a six-day trial, the jury found defendant guilty as charged on both counts. On June 26, 2017, the trial judge sentenced defendant for second degree murder to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, and for attempted second degree murder, to imprisonment at hard labor for fifty years without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, to run concurrently. Thereafter, defendant filed a timely notice of appeal, which was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this case, Tommie Molette, defendant-herein, is charged with second degree murder and attempted second degree murder for his involvement in a shooting incident that occurred on October 8, 2013 at 5923 Becker Street. The Hicks brothers - Kevin and Kevias - were also charged with second degree murder and attempted second degree murder for their involvement in the Becker Street incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In that same indictment, the grand jury also charged the Hicks and, their younger brother, Kedrick Anderson, with two counts of attempted second degree murder for their involvement in another shooting incident that occurred on July 13, 2013, at 2800 Mount Kennedy. Although defendant-herein was only indicted for the October Becker Street shootings, he and the Hicks brothers were tried at the same time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For clarity and completeness in addressing defendant's assignments of error, this opinion includes all of the germane testimony elicited at trial regarding five shooting incidents connected by ballistics and/or testimony to two groups of people. The first incident occurred on June 22, 2013, when A.P. was fired on while driving his girlfriend, J.A.'s, vehicle. Testimony reflected that A.P. was targeted because he had been deemed a \"rat.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ballistics were not recovered from that event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The second incident occurred on July 13, 2013, at approximately 9:45 p.m. at the\n   Ridgefield Apartments on Mount Kennedy Drive in Marrero. During the Mount Kennedy incident, J., the two-year-old son of A.P. and J.A., was shot in the chest. J.A., the child's mother, testified that, \"Kevias [Hicks'] face was the face in the front that I saw\" shooting at her son and her that night. J.A. also saw Kedrick Anderson with a \"big gun\" that night. J.A. stated that she did not see Kevin Hicks that night.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ballistics matched spent 9-mm shell casings recovered from the Mount Kennedy scene to two later shootings: the Bridge shooting and the Becker Street shooting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The third incident was a shooting that occurred on the Crescent City Connection on July 16, 2013. During that incident, Kevias Hicks was shot by someone riding in a nearby vehicle. Neither Kevias nor Kedrick Anderson, who was also in the car, would identify the assailant. However, J.A. testified that, at some point, A.P. told her that he and Kevias were shooting at each other on the \"bridge.\" A spent 9-mm shell casing found inside the Hicks' vehicle matched the ballistics of casings found at the Mount Kennedy and Becker Street shootings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the fourth incident, which occurred on August 12, 2013, at the Beechgrove Apartments in Westwego, Aubrieon Davis, who is the mother of Kedrick Anderson's son, was fired upon by A.P. while she was driving. Subsequently, A.P. pled guilty to aggravated assault with a firearm on Aubrieon Davis for that incident. Ballistics from the .40 caliber casing recovered at Beechgrove matched a casing found in the roadway after the Bridge shooting on July 16, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Finally, the only shooting pertinent to defendant-herein occurred on October 8, 2013 at 5923 Becker Street in Marrero. The surviving victim, Jonquell Neal, testified that he and his friend, Deshon Evans, were recording rap music in a studio at Deshon's house, when they heard a knock at the front door. Evans opened the door to Kevin and Kevias Hicks, and defendant-herein, Tommie Molette. Neal remembered that when Kevias came to the door, he said something about running from another shooting where a child had been shot. After the men talked for a little while, they decided to record a song in Deshon's studio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After they had been rapping and recording for a while in the studio, Neal heard Kevias say that he was a \"god\" and that \"your life is in my hands.\" Neal was concerned but continued writing his song. When he heard a loud sound, Neal thought it was the music at first. But when Neal looked up, Evans' blood was all over him, and Evans was dead. Neal saw Kevin, Kevias, and defendant-herein shooting in Evans' direction. Neal saw defendant-herein shoot him in the leg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Neal testified that, after he was shot, he picked up Evans' firearm from the floor, and put it in his lap. When Kevin tried to shoot him, Neal raised Evans' weapon, \"let off a shot,\" and Kevin left. Neal stated that more than twenty-five or thirty shots were fired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   That night, Neal received four gunshot wounds in his shoulder, thigh, and \"feet.\" Immediately after the shooting, Neal positively identified Kevin, Kevias, and defendant-herein as the shooters in photographic lineups. Neal further reported in his\n   statement at the hospital to Sergeant Gary Barteet of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office (\"JPSO\") that Kevias was shooting a 9-mm Smith and Wesson, that Kevin was using a 9-mm Beretta, and that defendant-herein was using a .40 caliber Colt. At trial, Neal testified that he was \"100% sure\" that Kevin, Kevias, and defendant-herein were the individuals who shot Evans and him that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. Susan Garcia of the Jefferson Parish Forensic Center, who was accepted as an expert in the field of forensic pathology, conducted the autopsy on Deshon Evans. She explained that Deshon Evans' cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   including a lethal wound to the head, and that his manner of death was homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Special Agent William Charles Williams of the FBI was accepted as an expert in the field of historical cell site analysis. Agent Williams analyzed historical records for two phone numbers - one associated with Kevin Hicks and one associated with defendant-herein - for the early morning hours of October 8, 2013. According to Agent Williams, both phones utilized the cellular phone tower nearest to 5932 Becker Street numerous times between 1:04 a.m. and 1:41 a.m. Williams testified that further data was consistent with both phones leaving the area around Becker, traveling along the Westbank Expressway, over the Mississippi River via the Crescent City Connection, and traveling north to the New Orleans East area. Williams testified that both phones were utilizing the nearest tower to 7840 Mills Avenue in New Orleans East between 2:52 a.m. and 2:54 a.m. The Mills Avenue address in New Orleans is associated with the Hicks' mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In order to connect the incidents, the State presented evidence regarding spent cartridge casings recovered at the scenes of the Mount Kennedy, the Beechgrove, the Bridge, and the Becker Street shootings. JPSO Deputy Jen\u00e9 Rauch, who is the supervisor of the firearms and tool mark section for the JPSO Crime Lab, was accepted as an expert in the field of firearm and tool mark examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Deputy Rauch testified that, after the July 13, 2013 Mount Kennedy shooting, fourteen casings that were fired \"in the same\" 9-mm weapon were recovered. Further, 2 casings were recovered that had been fired from a second 9-mm firearm. Also, eight 7.62 by 39-mm caliber casings were recovered that were all fired \"in the same weapon.\" Finally, one .45 caliber casing was found on the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Deputy Rauch testified that, after the July 16, 2013 shooting on the Crescent City Connection Bridge, two casings were recovered: a 9-mm casing recovered from inside of the Hicks' vehicle and a .40 caliber casing recovered from the roadway of the Bridge. Ballistics revealed that the .40 caliber casing at Beechgrove was fired from the same .40 caliber pistol used during the shooting on the Bridge that injured Kevias Hicks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Deputy Rauch further testified that, after the Becker Street shootings in October of 2013, eight 9-mm casings were recovered that were fired from the same 9-mm pistol. Next, four 9-mm casings were recovered\n   that were fired from a second 9-mm pistol. Further, thirteen casings fired from a .40 caliber pistol were recovered. Finally, a .45 caliber Taurus pistol was recovered from the scene but ballistics confirmed that it was damaged by a bullet during the shooting, which prevented it from firing that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Deputy Rauch testified that the ballistics database used by law enforcement connected the same 9-mm firearm to four shootings: Mount Kennedy on July 13, 2013; the Bridge Shooting on July 16, 2013; the Becker Street shooting on October 8, 2013; and a homicide at I-10 and Clearview Parkway on December 30, 2013. At Mount Kennedy, fourteen 9-mm rounds were shot from this weapon. After the Bridge shooting, one expended 9-mm casing from this weapon was found on the floor of the interior of the vehicle driven by the Hicks brothers that night. At Becker Street, eight 9-mm rounds were shot from this weapon. Finally, three casings fired from this weapon were found at the Clearview/I-10 homicide but further investigation revealed that the December homicide was not linked to the instant crimes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   JPSO Deputy Chief Timothy Scanlan, who is the Commander of the Technical Services Bureau, was accepted as an expert in the fields of firearms and tool mark examination, blood stain pattern analysis, and crime scene reconstruction. Deputy Chief Scanlan investigated the Mount Kennedy and Becker Street crime scenes and formulated conclusions. Deputy Chief Scanlan asserted that Jonquell Neal's testimony was consistent with the cartridge case distribution and the angles of fire at the Becker Street crime scene. He also asserted that after reviewing reports of the Mount Kennedy scene, what he found there was consistent with the description of events provided by J.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After hearing the testimony and evidence, the twelve-person jury found defendant-herein guilty of the second degree murder of Deshon Evans and the attempted second degree murder of Jonquell Neal. Defendant-herein appeals his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal, defendant raises four assignments of error: first, the trial court erred in denying the motion to sever; second, the trial court erred in denying the re-urged motion to sever and motion to quash; third, the trial court erred in denying the re-urged motion to quash and motion for mistrial; and fourth, the trial court erred in denying the motion for new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In each of his assignments, the crux of defendant's argument is that, given the voluminous evidence of violent acts allegedly committed by the Hicks brothers without him, defendant-herein was prejudiced by trial of his charges for the October 8, 2013 Becker Street crimes with the unrelated charges for the July 13, 2013 Mount Kennedy shootings against the Hicks brothers. Defendant alleges that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to sever filed well before trial, his re-urged motion to sever filed immediately before trial began, and his motion to quash and motion for mistrial filed after the first full day of trial. Further, defendant alleges that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for new trial based on prejudice to him that resulted from the voluminous evidence of violent acts allegedly committed by Kevin and Kevias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The State responds that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's request for severance from his co-defendants because the law is clear that where co-defendants are jointly charged, they need not be charged in every count. Further, the State avers that defendant cannot prove that he was prejudiced. The State contends that the jury clearly understood that defendant was only charged in the Becker Street shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Motion to Sever\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On June 16, 2016, defendant filed a Motion to Sever Defendants for Trial on the basis that he was not charged with the crimes that occurred on July 13, 2013. He also argued that if defendants were all tried together, the jury would be confused as to his involvement. Defendant alleged that his right to a fair trial was impinged because he was sitting as a defendant for uncharged crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On June 24, 2016, at the hearing on the motion to sever, defense counsel argued that defendant-herein was only charged with the Becker Street shootings and had no connection with the Mount Kennedy shootings. Defense counsel contended that the State was going to bring in evidence of prior acts that had nothing to do with defendant-herein. For that reason, counsel contended that it would be prejudicial for defendant-herein to appear before a jury to defend himself for uncharged acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The prosecutor averred that the surviving witness of the Becker Street shootings would testify that Kevias gained entry to Becker Street for himself and the co-defendants by saying that they were on the run from the police for the Mount Kennedy shooting. Although defense counsel disagreed with that description of events, the prosecutor still maintained that the statement allowed the trio to gain admittance to Becker Street on the night in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After hearing arguments of counsel, the trial judge denied the motion to sever, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   In looking at the Bill of Indictment, I think it is clear and certainly can be made clear for the jury that the separate incidences that are indicted here they can clearly distinguish. I don't think there is any undo-prejudice [sic] to Mr. Molette sitting through a trial where there is evidence put on of his co-defendants involved in a separate incidence [sic] anymore prejudicial than the fact that he already himself is charged with two counts in this bill of indictment. So again, the Court denies motion to sever.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defense counsel objected and sought review of that ruling with this Court. This Court denied the writ, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Relator, Tommie Mollette, seeks review of the trial court's June 24, 2016 denial of his motion to sever defendants for trial. Relator failed to attach a copy of his motion to sever that was filed with the trial court, but argues in his writ application that his motion was based on undue prejudice. He claims that his co-defendants, Kevin Hicks and Kevias Hicks, were charged with two additional counts of attempted murder (counts three and four) that occurred three months prior to the charged offenses of second degree murder and attempted second degree murder (counts one and two) against Relator. Kevin and Kevias were also charged in counts one and two, for a total of four charges against them, whereas Relator only faces two charges (counts one and two). Relator asserts a severance is warranted because a jury would be hostile towards him because evidence of the other attempted murders, in which he had no participation, will be admitted against his co-defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   After a hearing in which no evidence was presented, the trial court denied the motion to sever and found that, at this time, the separate charges against all defendants could be clearly distinguished and made clear for the jury. The trial court found no undue prejudice in requiring Relator to sit through a trial where evidence of his co-defendants' involvement in a separate incident would be admitted. Jointly indicted defendants are to be tried jointly unless the court finds that justice requires a severance. La. C.Cr.P. art. 704. Whether justice requires a severance must be determined by the facts of each case.\n   <em>\n    State v. Hayden\n   </em>\n   , 09-954 (La. App. 5 Cir. 5/11/10),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042752\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/41/538/#p543\">\n    41 So.3d 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 543. The ruling on a motion to sever is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned unless it is manifestly erroneous and injurious to the defendant.\n   <em>\n    State v. Tennant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9710895\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/352/629/#p634\">\n    352 So.2d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 634 (La. 1977). Upon review of the writ application and the transcript of the motion hearing, we do not find the trial court abused its discretion in denying Relator's motion to sever the trial of defendants at this time. Accordingly, on the showing made, we do not find Relator is entitled to relief and deny his writ application.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Molette\n   </em>\n   , 16-K-457 (La. App. 5 Cir. 8/24/16)(unpublished writ disposition).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On May 22, 2017, the first day of trial, defendant-herein filed a Motion to Quash Indictment alleging misjoinder of offenses and misjoinder of defendants. The trial judge again denied the motion to sever as to defendant-herein because he was charged with a murder and an attempted murder in the October shootings, which were clearly distinct from the July incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The State responded that this issue had been previously addressed by the trial judge in his denial and by this Court in its writ denial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State reiterated that the jury could distinguish between the separate victims and the separate incidents. After hearing arguments of counsel, the trial judge denied the motion to quash the indictment, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   It remains the Court's belief that the indictment, as it stands, the evidence that will be presented against Mr. Molette is easily distinguishable by the jury where he is charged with a crime that occurred or crimes that occurred, counts that occurred in October and not with the ones that are charged - - that the Hicks are charged with - - the Hicks defendants are charged with in July. And I think it's easy for the jury to compartmentalize those in their mind and certainly he has abled counsel here to ensure that the jury recalls he is only charged with the one count of murder and then the attempted murder that occurred in the October incident. So for all those reasons, the Court denies the Motion to Quash.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defense counsel noted his objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   After the first full day of testimony, defense counsel re-urged his motion to\n   quash and moved for a mistrial on the basis of misjoinder of defendants and misjoinder of the counts. He stated that only one of the seven witnesses called during one day of trial testified regarding defendant-herein. He also stated that there was emotional testimony by J.A. and that some of the jurors \"teared up\" when pictures of the child victim were shown. Defense counsel argued that was \"purely prejudicial\" to his client, and moved for a mistrial. The prosecutor responded that the issue had already been addressed several times. Further, of the nineteen upcoming witnesses, sixteen would be about the Becker Street shootings, which was a majority of the witnesses in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The prosecutor asserted that it was very clear that defendant-herein was not charged with any of the other shootings and that no evidence would improperly associate him with his co-defendant's other charges. Further, each witness' testimony would be clear as to what scene, date, and crimes were involved. The prosecutor stated that, although the jury was emotional, he was confident that the jury would be able to separate the charges and the defendants. Defense counsel noted that the jury was looking at all three defendants with \"very stern looks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   After hearing arguments of counsel, the trial judge denied the motion to quash, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   There was extensive voir dire going on during the jury selection process, Mr. Vedros, as well as all counsel involved had an opportunity to voir dire the jurors. The Court is comfortable that the jurors that we have selected is [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] more than capable, and as this Court obviously intends to do and will do in the instructions will instruct them that they are only to consider the evidence against Mr. Molette that is presented as it relates to the October incident. Again, the Court is comfortable that the level of voir dire, extensive voir dire, on that issue throughout the jury selection process and therefore, the motion is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defense counsel noted his objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   La. C.Cr.P. art. 493 permits the joinder of offenses if the offenses charged \"are of the same or similar character or are based on the same act or transaction or on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan,\" and the offenses are triable by the same mode of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   La. C.Cr.P. art. 494 provides the law regarding joinder of defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Two or more defendants may be charged in the same indictment or information if they are alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction or in the same series of acts or transactions constituting an offense or offenses. Such defendants may be charged in one or more counts together or separately and all of the defendants need not be charged in each count.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   La. C.Cr.P. art. 495 provides that, \"[t]he objections of misjoinder of defendants or misjoinder of offenses may be urged only by a motion to quash the indictment.\" La. C.Cr.P. art. 532 provides in pertinent part that a motion to quash may be based on one or more of the following grounds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (3) The indictment is duplicitous or contains a misjoinder of defendants or offenses. In such case the court may permit the district attorney to sever the indictment into separate counts or separate indictments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   A defendant properly charged in the same indictment with two or more offenses pursuant to La. C.Cr.P. art. 493 may nonetheless move for a severance of the offenses under La. C.Cr.P. art. 495.1, which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   If it appears that a defendant or the state is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses in an indictment or bill of information or by such joinder for trial together, the court may order separate trials, grant a severance of offenses, or provide whatever other relief justice requires.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In determining whether prejudice results from a joinder of offenses, the trial court must consider the following factors: whether the jury would be confused by the various counts, whether the jury would be able to segregate the various charges and evidence, whether the defendant would be confounded in presenting his various defenses, whether the crimes charged would be used by the jury to infer a criminal disposition, and whether, considering the nature of the charges, the charging of several crimes would make the jury hostile.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Motions to sever under La. C.Cr.P. art. 495.1 are within the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Factual, rather than conclusory, allegations are required when the defendant alleges prejudicial joinder of offenses on a motion to sever.\n   <em>\n    State v.
