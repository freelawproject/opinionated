In\n   <em>\n    Paulk I\n   </em>\n   , this court reversed the trial court's July 21, 2015, judgment to the extent that that judgment \"found the mother in contempt of court and insofar as it offset the amount the mother owed for the [parties'] children's activity fees, books, and uniforms associated with their attendance at UMS-Wright Preparatory School against the amount the father owed for child support.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12364923\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/217/899/\">\n    217 So.3d at 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Paulk II\n   </em>\n   , the mother raised the same issues regarding the January 11, 2017, order that she raises in the present mandamus petition regarding the order under review; however, this court did not reach the merits of the arguments in\n   <em>\n    Paulk II\n   </em>\n   . Instead, this court, \"ex mero motu, raised the jurisdictional issue of the effect of Judge Banks's [intervening] retirement on the validity of the January 11, 2017, order entered by him.\" After receiving letter briefs on that issue, this court determined that, because the order challenged was issued by a retired judge who had lacked authority to enter an order in the case, that order was void.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12674273\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/249/521/\">\n    249 So. 3d at 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This court did not reverse the judgment as to the finding that the father was in contempt, nor did we state in our opinion that the trial court could revisit that finding. Thus, the finding that the father was in contempt is the law of the case, and the trial court lacked the authority\n   to alter that finding.\n   <em>\n    Queen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8358754\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/959/620/#p621\">\n    959 So.2d at 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, we grant the mother's petition to the extent that she challenges the trial court's denial of the mother's counterclaim seeking to hold the father in contempt for failing to pay child support and his portion of the children's medical expenses. We issue a writ directing the trial court to amend its November 29, 2017, order in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The mother also argues that the trial court failed to follow this court's instruction in\n   <em>\n    Paulk I\n   </em>\n   \"to calculate the amounts the parties owe.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12364923\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/217/899/\">\n    217 So.3d at 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She argues that the trial court's November 29, 2017, order does not contain sufficient detail concerning its calculations. However, in this court's remand instructions in\n   <em>\n    Paulk I\n   </em>\n   , we did not require the trial court to provide any detail concerning its calculations; we simply required the trial court to calculate the amounts each party owes without offsetting the amounts against one other. Moreover, the mother does not cite any law requiring any such detail. Accordingly, we conclude that the mother has failed to show a clear legal right to the relief she seeks on this point, and her petition is therefore denied with regard to this issue.\n   <em>\n    Queen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8358754\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/959/620/#p621\">\n    959 So.2d at 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   PETITION GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; WRIT ISSUED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Thompson, P.J., and Pittman, Thomas, and Donaldson, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
