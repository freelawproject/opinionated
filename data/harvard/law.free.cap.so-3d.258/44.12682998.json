After various pretrial motions and hearings, the parties selected a jury on March 28, 2016. The jury heard evidence and argument on March 29 through April 1 and ultimately found Defendant guilty as charged on both counts. On July 28, the trial court sentenced Defendant to serve life in prison for the first degree murder conviction, with a consecutive fifty-year term for the armed robbery conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant now appeals his convictions and sentences, assigning three errors. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Defendant's murder conviction and vacate his armed robbery conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 28, 2014, Defendant was armed with a gun when he entered a store in Evangeline Parish, seeking to commit an armed robbery. In the course of the robbery, he shot proprietor Ann Nguyen, killing her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERRORS PATENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed for errors patent on the face of the record.

Defendant argues that his convictions for both first degree murder and armed robbery violate the constitutional protection against double jeopardy, as the robbery was the act that elevated the homicide to first degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   A person cannot twice be placed in jeopardy for the same offense.

Defendant made no attempt at the hearing, nor does he attempt in brief, to demonstrate any facts to show that the strike of venire member Seria was based upon her race. As noted in the colloquy above, the State asserted that of the eight challenges it had used up to that point, \"We used four on white and four on black.\" Defendant did not and does not refute that assertion. For the reasons discussed, this assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Defendant's armed robbery conviction and sentence is vacated due to double jeopardy. His conviction and sentence for first degree murder is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
