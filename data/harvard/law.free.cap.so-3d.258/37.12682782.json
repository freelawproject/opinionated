Plaintiff and her attorney assert an exception of prescription. For the following reasons, we grant the exception and dismiss Defendants' motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties herein have an extensive litigation history arising out of a 2010 motorcycle accident involving Brian Snavely and Brian's subsequent death on August 18, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following the motorcycle accident, Brian initiated an action in the Fifteenth Judicial District Court for Lafayette Parish (\"the Fifteenth JDC\") against the parents of the minor driver of another vehicle involved in the accident, as well as the parents' insurer. This action was assigned to Division C before Judge Rubin and given docket number 11-0381 (\"the motorcycle action\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Both prior to, and following the accident, Brian received pain management treatment from Dr. Margaret Rice. Approximately two years after Brian's death, Brian's mother, Linda Snavely, initiated three separate actions alleging that medical treatment provided by Dr. Rice and/or various related medical entities caused or contributed to Brian's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   First, on June 26, 2014, Ms. Snavely sought to convene a medical review panel against Dr. Rice, Mr. Stacey Singleton, who was an accountant, as well as the following entities: Margaret A. Rice, APMLLC; Rice Medical Management, LLC; and Ace Pain Management, LLC (\"the Rice Entities\"). However, according to the Patient's Compensation Fund (\"PCF\"), only Dr. Rice was a qualified healthcare provider entitled to a medical review panel. Defendants sought a docket number from the Fifteenth JDC, and the matter was assigned to Division K before Judge Michot and given docket number 14-3917 (hereinafter \"the PCF action\"). On September 10, 2014, Dr. Rice filed an exception of prescription, and on October 27, 2014, the trial court granted the exception and dismissed the PCF action against Dr. Rice. This court affirmed that judgment.\n   <em>\n    In Re: Professional Liability Claim of Snavely\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15-207%20%28La.App.%203%20Cir.%2011/4/15%29\">\n    15-207 (La.App. 3 Cir. 11/4/15)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6844629\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/178/614/\">\n    178 So.3d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 21, 2014, Ms. Snavely sought and obtained leave to file an amended petition in the motorcycle action (docket no. 11-0381). Therein, she asserted medical malpractice and wrongful death claims against the Rice Entities and Mr. Singleton. Shortly after, the pending claims against the minor driver and the insurer were dismissed following a settlement. On February 9, 2015, Defendants asserted an exception of prescription, which the trial court granted on March 10, 2015, dismissing the medical malpractice and wrongful death claims.

The medical malpractice action was assigned to Division A before Judge Trahan and given docket number 14-5373.

Lomax Jordan, arguing that Ms. Snavely's attorney violated duties imposed by La.Code Civ.P. art. 863 by signing and filing multiple petitions alleging the same prescribed claim. Also on June 23, 2016, the Rice Entities and Rice Urgent Care filed a motion to assess attorney fees as sanctions in the medical malpractice action (docket no. 14-5373). Similarly, Dr. Rice filed a motion to assess attorney fees as sanctions in the PCF action (docket number 14-3917) on June 27, 2016, and a hearing was set for August 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 25, 2016, in the motorcycle action (docket no. 11-0381), Ms. Snavely filed a prescription exception, and other exceptions, arguing that the sanctions motions were untimely as they were filed after a final judgment had been rendered. She also filed a motion seeking to consolidate the motorcycle action with the PCF action and the medical malpractice action. Ms. Snavely's motion to consolidate was heard August 29, 2016. Following the hearing, the trial court granted the motion and signed an order consolidating the three matters. The order also denied the sanctions motions filed in the motorcycle action, the PCF action, and the medical malpractice action, stating that there was no violation of La.Code Civ.P. art. 863.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants Dr. Rice, the Rice Entities, Rice Urgent Care, and Mr. Singleton have filed appeals in connection with each of the three trial court docket numbers, assigning as error the trial court's consolidation and dismissal of the three motions for sanctions. Those appeals have been consolidated in this court. Ms. Snavely has asserted a prescription exception in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We first address the issue of whether Defendants' motions seeking attorney fees as sanctions under La.Code Civ.P. art. 863 were timely.

The\n   <em>\n    Frazer\n   </em>\n   court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the motion for sanctions pursuant to an exception of prescription, quoting favorably the trial court's reasoning, which we find persuasive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Mellon Bank Corp. v.

The court also found that the motion was not filed in the trial court before the entry of a final judgment as required by supervisory rule of the U.S. Court of Appeals, 3d Circuit. In the instant suit there is no such court rule but the wisdom and purpose of the rule seems eviden[t] to this court. A motion to sanction filed in the trial court following completion of the trial and the appeal process raises at least two problematic issues. First, what authority does the trial court have to act after the jurisdiction of the trial court is divested by appeal? And secondly, and more relevant to the instant exception, can the purposes of Article 863 be effectively served after the underlying litigation is over?[ ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The imposition of sanctions usually serves two main purposes: deterrence and compensation; encompassed within those objectives are the related subsidiary goals of punishing litigation abuse and facilitating case management.\n   <em>\n    Navarro-Ayala v.

The trial court granted the plaintiffs' exception of prescription, finding the defendant's motion for sanctions untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In reversing the trial court, the appellate court in\n   <em>\n    Keaty\n   </em>\n   agreed with the defendants that the claim for sanctions had not prescribed \"because it was brought ... within less than a year after this [c]ourt rendered judgment affirming the dismissal of the [plaintiffs'] claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Keaty\n   </em>\n   , 781So.2d at 610. In so holding, the\n   <em>\n    Keaty\n   </em>\n   court found \"no reason why sanctionable conduct should not be classified as an offense for prescription purposes,\" applied the one-year prescriptive period applicable to torts, and found that the one-year period\n   began from the date of a final judgment as doing so \"seems consistent with the concept of a continuing tort.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11119076\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/781/607/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11119076\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/781/607/\">\n    at 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Connelly\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff filed a legal malpractice claim against his wife's attorney on February 2, 1993. On September 1, 1993, the trial court granted the defendant's exception of no cause of action but allowed time for the plaintiff to amend his action. The plaintiff failed to do so, and on November 2, 1993, the trial court dismissed the plaintiff's action. A year later, on November 2, 1994, the defendant-attorney filed a motion for sanctions against the plaintiff, and the trial court denied the plaintiff's prescription exception. The court of appeal affirmed, stating :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [c]onsidering the facts in this case, we feel that the imposition of sanctions\n   <em>\n    within a year after the plaintiff filed his objectionable petition\n   </em>\n   serves the policy purpose of deterrence and is not so remote in time from the behavior sought to be deterred .... Moreover, a year from the filing of the\n   <em>\n    plaintiff's petition\n   </em>\n   is not inordinately long.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Connelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11911753\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/699/411/\">\n    699 So.2d at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We note that the\n   <em>\n    Connelly\n   </em>\n   court's analysis focused on the date the objectionable\n   <em>\n    petition\n   </em>\n   was filed, even though the petition in that case was filed more than a year before the motion for sanctions. There is no analysis in\n   <em>\n    Connelly\n   </em>\n   pertaining to its apparent conclusion that the motion for sanctions, which was filed after the dismissal of the underlying claim, was timely. However, we disagree with both\n   <em>\n    Connelly\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Keaty,\n   </em>\n   to the extent they support a finding that a motion seeking monetary sanctions under La.Code Civ.P. art. 863 filed after the decision in the underlying action had become final is timely, especially when the moving party was aware of the behavior sought to be deterred by the sanctions motion [i.e. the repeated filing of prescribed claims in the instant matter] prior to the finality of the underlying action. We therefore grant the exception of prescription, and the issues asserted by Defendants on appeal are now moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the exception of prescription filed by Ms. Snavely and J.
