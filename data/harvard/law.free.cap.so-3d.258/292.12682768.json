On October 16, 2013, Tameka Smith was indicted by a Forrest County grand jury on one count of armed robbery of a Dollar General store on June 5, 2013. The case proceeded to trial on March 18, 2015, and the jury found Smith guilty of armed robbery. Smith was sentenced to serve twenty years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), with twelve years to serve, eight years suspended, and five years of post-release supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On appeal, Smith asserts that (i) the trial court erred in overruling Smith's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   objection; (ii) prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments violated Smith's right to a fair trial; (iii) testimony from the State's witness, Detective Casey Sims, violated Smith's Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause right to confront adverse witnesses; (iv) the trial court erred in refusing Smith's requested jury instruction on the defense's theory of misidentification; and (v) the trial court erred in allowing the State to introduce CD exhibits in envelopes containing written notations. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. This case concerns an armed robbery of a Dollar General store near Hattiesburg, Mississippi, on June 5, 2013, at around 8 p.m. Store manager Paige Arnold and cashier Kelly James were working at the Dollar General that night. Arnold was the State's first witness. She testified that she was on the toothpaste aisle when a woman in a gray hoodie with a white towel over her face approached her and said she had a toothache. Arnold testified that she was 5' 9\u00bd? tall, and she guessed that the woman was around 5' 6? tall. Arnold showed the woman where the oral pain medications were, then resumed straightening up the toothpaste aisle. Later, the cashier, Kelly James, accompanied the same woman to the toothpaste aisle, and showed her the same medicine Arnold had shown her. Kelly returned to her register at the front of the store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4. About ten minutes later, a customer approached Arnold and said she was needed up front. Arnold testified that she walked to the front of the store, and the female customer from the toothpaste aisle told her she did not have the money to buy the medicine and needed Arnold to cancel the transaction, which Arnold did. The customer was standing off to the side when Arnold opened the cash register. Arnold testified that the female customer ran between her and James (the cashier) and started grabbing money out of the cash register. Arnold testified that she jumped on the woman's back and started taking the money back from her, and James also started grabbing the money back from the woman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5. According to Arnold, the woman dragged Arnold and James outside, and Arnold pulled off the woman's jacket and towel and looked at the woman. The woman got in a car, and Arnold got a description\n   of the vehicle and the vehicle's tag number. Arnold recalled she watched the woman for about a minute while she was in her car because there was another car entering the parking lot, so the woman had to wait to leave. Arnold testified that she and the woman made eye contact as the woman drove away. Arnold called 911 and gave a description of the woman and the car and gave the tag number of the vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Arnold then waited for the police to arrive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. The State showed Arnold several photographs, including a photo of the vehicle driven by the woman and the vehicle's license plate (JDM 592). Arnold identified the vehicle and the license plate as the ones involved in the armed robbery. A copy of the Dollar General surveillance video of the crime was presented, as was a recording of Arnold's 911 call; both were played for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. Arnold testified that she was shown a photo lineup three days after the robbery and she was 80 percent sure when she identified Smith. She explained in her trial testimony that \"I told Detective Sims, my gut instinct is 80 percent sure it was the defendant; 20 percent sure it was the other person.\" According to Arnold, the reason she did an eighty percent identification was that \"[t]here was ... another person in the lineup that had been in my store earlier that day that I went and did the police lineup. She's a regular customer, and ... it threw me a little bit.\" At trial, Arnold identified Smith as the person who committed the armed robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. James, the store cashier, also testified for the State. She corroborated Arnold's testimony about the woman looking for toothache medicine. James then testified that when the woman reached her cash register to check out, James rang up the medicine and told the woman her total. At that point, James said the woman came around the cash register and got behind her and said, \"I have a gun. I have my kids in the car. Just give me a little bit of the money.\" James then testified that the woman also grabbed a pair of scissors from the counter and put them against James's back. At one point in the surveillance video, a pair of scissors can be seen hanging out of the woman's pocket. James told the woman that because she had already rung up the sale, the cash register could not be opened without the manager using her key to void the sale. The woman repeatedly told James to just hit the \"enter\" or \"total\" buttons to open the cash register; James hit the buttons, and the woman hit buttons herself, but the cash register would not open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. In the meantime, other customers were waiting at the register to check out, and the woman walked from behind the counter and stood nearby. Arnold arrived and voided the sale, and James began ringing up the next customer. According to James, when the cash register opened, the woman stuck her hand in the cash register drawer and said, \"I'm sorry. Thank you.\" James said that the woman grabbed \"a whole bunch of money, and we just started wrestling with her - me and my manager - out the door.\" At that point James's boyfriend emerged and assisted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10. James positively identified Smith as the robber in a photo lineup three days after the robbery. James also identified Smith as the robber in court. James gave police a description of the woman and said the woman was around 5' 2? tall, because\n   she was taller than James, who is 4' 11? tall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11. Officer Eric Prouix testified that he was working on patrol for the Hattiesburg Police Department on June 5, 2013. He was dispatched to the Dollar General and preserved the register/counter area for potential fingerprints, if any could be found. He also helped secure the scene. Officer Prouix testified that no fingerprints were found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12. Officer Tammy Hoadley of the Hattiesburg Police Department testified that she was also working on patrol on the evening of June 5, 2013. She responded to a dispatch call around 8 p.m. regarding an armed robbery and reported to the Dollar General. When she got there, she helped secure the area and spoke with the victims, Arnold and James. Officer Hoadley testified that she did not collect any fingerprints and she did not transport anything to the crime lab for DNA analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13. Detective Casey Sims worked for the Hattiesburg Police Department and investigated the armed robbery at Dollar General that took place on June 5, 2013. Detective Sims testified that he ran the tag numbers that were reported, and he determined that the vehicle belonged to an elderly woman who lived out of town, a Ms. Bobbie Fairley. He testified that he asked Ms. Fairley to come to Hattiesburg on a pretense. He met with her, seized her vehicle, and processed the vehicle as a crime scene. Detective Sims further testified that during the course of his investigation he was able to determine the names of the people who were at Ms. Fairley's house on the evening of the robbery, which included Tameka Smith, who was Ms. Fairley's grandson's girlfriend. Detective Sims said he was informed that on June 5, 2013, Ms. Fairley's grandson took Smith's vehicle and left Smith and her two children with Ms. Fairley. Once Detective Sims ascertained that Smith had been at Ms. Fairley's home on the evening of the robbery, he brought Smith in for questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14. Detective Sims testified that about three days after the robbery, he presented photo lineups to James and Arnold. Detective Sims corroborated Arnold's testimony that she circled Smith and another person; and Detective Sims likewise confirmed that James positively identified Smith in the photo lineup. Both Arnold and James identified Smith in court as the robber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 15. Detective Sims testified that he arrested Smith for armed robbery and that Smith's booking information reflects that she is 5' 7? tall and weighed 235 pounds. Detective Sims also obtained Smith's cell phone records, which were admitted as an exhibit at trial. The records showed that Smith made a call from around Prentiss, Mississippi, at 7 p.m. that lasted 582 seconds (9 minutes and 41 seconds). The records also reflected that Smith made a call from around Prentiss at 8:43 p.m., which lasted 252 seconds (4 minutes and 12 seconds). Detective Sims testified that the call reporting the robbery came out \"around 2000 hours, which is 8 p.m.\" The time stamp on the store's surveillance video indicates that the robbery occurred at about 7 p.m., or 19:00 hours. Arnold, the store manager, testified that the time on the surveillance video was an hour behind because the district manager was the only one who could adjust the system, and the district manager was on sick leave when the time changed, so the time had not been set forward. Detective\n   Sims testified that the Prentiss area is about forty minutes from the Dollar General store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 16. Steve Pazos, an investigator with the District Attorney's office, testified that he conducted a follow-up investigation into the case. Specifically, Investigator Pazos testified that he interviewed Smith's mother and alibi witness, Jennifer Smith. According to Investigator Pazos, Jennifer said she was on the phone with her daughter during the time that the robbery took place because they spoke from 7:00 p.m. to 7:09 p.m. Investigator Pazos testified that his phone conversation with Jennifer discredited Smith's alibi that she was on the phone with her mother when the robbery took place because the actual call for service came in through the police department's line at 7:54 p.m. A recording of Investigator Pazos's interview with Jennifer was played for the jury and admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 17. Jennifer Smith testified for the defense. She testified that the suspect in the surveillance video was not her daughter because Smith was pigeon-toed, but the suspect was not; Smith's legs are straight, but the suspect's legs \"bowed back\"; the suspect was much wider than Smith; and the suspect's skin was darker than Smith's skin. Jennifer testified that she was at her home in Pattison, Mississippi, on the night of the robbery, and she talked to Smith on the phone about a business-plan homework assignment from about 7:00 p.m. to 7:10 p.m. On cross-examination, Jennifer acknowledged that Smith was staying at Ms. Fairley's house in June 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 18. Smith testified in her own defense at trial. Smith testified that she was not the person in the surveillance video and that she never went to the Dollar General on the night in question. She said she got to Prentiss (Ms. Fairley's home) at about four o'clock that evening with her children, and immediately began to work on homework. She made a five-minute trip to a corner store right down the street just outside of Prentiss sometime between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., and she left the house a second time with her boyfriend at about 10 p.m. They went to the Junior Food Mart in Prentiss. Smith denied ever going to Forrest County on the night in question. Smith testified that she is about 5' 7? tall and, under cross-examination, Smith testified that she weighed 205 pounds at trial, which was about thirty pounds less than she weighed in June 2013. At trial, Smith stood up and showed the jury that she was pigeon-toed. She denied that she was guilty of the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 19. In response to questions by the prosecutor, Smith denied that she lived with her boyfriend's grandmother (Ms. Bobbie Fairley) in 2013, but she acknowledged that she visited for a couple of days and was staying the night at Bobbie Fairley's home on June 5, 2013. Smith acknowledged that Bobbie Fairley lived in Jefferson Davis County, and that Bobbie Fairley's car was the car police tracked down using the tag number at issue. Smith testified that Bobbie Fairley lay down in bed about 7 p.m. or 7:30 p.m. on the night in question, but Smith testified that Bobbie Fairley was not asleep at that time. Smith also testified that Bobbie Fairley's car was not accessible to her because Bobbie Fairley kept her keys in her purse in the bedroom and usually locked the bedroom door. Smith acknowledged that Arnold reported the vehicle being driven by a person matching her general description, but she maintained that she never drove the vehicle that night or left Prentiss to go to Hattiesburg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 20. The jury was instructed on the offense of armed robbery, the lesser-included offense of simple robbery, and the alibi defense. The trial court denied\n   Smith's requested instruction on misidentification. After retiring for deliberations, the jury returned a verdict, finding Smith guilty of armed robbery. Smith was sentenced to serve twenty years in MDOC custody, with twelve years to serve, eight years suspended, and five years of post-release supervision. Smith was also ordered to pay a $2,500 fine, $100 to the victim compensation fund, and all court costs. The sentencing order was entered August 13, 2015. Smith's trial counsel filed no post-trial motions. On September 3, 2015, Smith filed a notice of appeal, pro se. Smith was subsequently appointed appellate counsel through the Office of State Public Defender, Indigent Appeals Division, and an amended notice of appeal was filed on March 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    Challenge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 21. Smith asserts that the State's use of three of five peremptory challenges against African American jurors constitutes a violation of\n   <em>\n    Batson v. Kentucky\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   because these jurors were not struck for race-neutral reasons. As addressed in more detail below, the trial court found that Smith did not meet her burden to go forward with a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge, and even if she had, the trial court found that the three African American jurors were struck for race-neutral reasons. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court's ruling on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 22. The Mississippi Supreme Court has directed this Court to \" 'give great deference to a trial court's determinations under\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   because they are based largely on credibility.' \"\n   <em>\n    Williams v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996749\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/126/85/#p94\">\n    126 So.3d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94 (\u00b6 37) (Miss.

A\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   ruling may not be overturned unless the record indicates that the ruling \"was clearly erroneous or against the overwhelming weight of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8343240\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/947/910/#p917\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation mark omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Thorson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11820172\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/721/590/#p593\">\n    721 So.2d 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 593 (\u00b6 4) (Miss. 1998) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 23. As the Mississippi Supreme Court has explained, a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge should proceed as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   First, the defendant must establish a prima facie case of discrimination in the selection of jury members. The prosecution then has the burden of stating a racially neutral reason for the challenged strike. If the State gives a racially neutral explanation, the defendant can rebut the explanation. Finally, the trial court must make a factual finding to determine if the prosecution engaged in purposeful discrimination. If the defendant fails to rebut, the trial judge must base his decision on the reasons given by the State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Berry v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457366\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/802/1033/#p1037\">\n    802 So.2d 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1037 (\u00b6 11) (Miss. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 24. In this case, after the trial court allowed two jurors to be struck for cause (Jurors 11 and 19), the State submitted its first twelve jurors, going up through, and including, Juror 20. Juror 17 was absent. Out of the remaining seventeen panel members, the record reflects that the State exercised the first five of its six peremptory challenges, striking three African Americans and two Caucasians. At this point the defense raised its\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge. Smith's initial\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge was based on her trial counsel's mistaken belief that the State had used four (not three) of its peremptory challenges to strike African Americans, namely Jurors 9, 10, 12, and 13. The trial court corrected Smith's counsel,\n   noting on the record that Juror 12 was a Caucasian female.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 25. In response to Smith's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge, the trial court judge stated that he did not know whether Smith had met her burden of showing a prima facie case of discrimination in the selection process, given that three of the State's peremptory strikes were against African Americans, and two were against Caucasians. The trial court, however, allowed the State to go forward and provide its race-neutral reasons for its strikes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 26. The State provided the following explanations:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-41\">Juror State's reason(s) for Number exercising peremptory strike Juror 9 \"[W]e observed that she seemed to be disinterested, was not making eye contact.\" Juror 10 \"[I]t was our observation that she frowned a lot during our voir dire and gave us the impression that she just didn't want to be here.\" Juror 13 \"[S]he also seemed to be disinterested and not really engaged in the voir dire process.\"</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The State also provided the reason it struck Juror 12 (a Caucasian female): \"As to [Juror] number 12, she seemed not only disinterested, but also aggravated, at times with the entire voir dire process.\" Lastly, the State pointed out that of the twelve jurors submitted by the State at that point, four were African Americans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 27. The trial court then afforded Smith an opportunity to rebut the State's race-neutral reasons. Smith's counsel offered the following rebuttal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Your Honor, the only thing that the State has proffered as a race-neutral reason is that they didn't want to be here. Nobody wants to be here, Your Honor. That's not a valid excuse or a reason to excuse somebody, and he said nothing else.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In response, the trial court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   I think he said more than simply they don't want to be here. And quite frankly, I disagree with you that nobody wants to be here. These are my people. They like to come to court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   But in any event, I don't think you've met your burden to go forward with a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   [c]hallenge. And in the event you have, I do not think that these jurors were -- well, I do think they were struck for race-neutral reasons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In short, the only rebuttal offered by Smith was that \"juror disinterest\" was not a race-neutral reason because \"nobody wants to be [on the jury panel].\" The trial court rejected this argument based on its own experience and observation that \"[t]hese are my people. They like to come to court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 28. On appeal, Smith asserts that the State's reasons for excluding the jurors in question included several of the five indicators of pretext. The Mississippi Supreme Court has specified five indicia of pretext for use in analyzing a race-based\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (1) disparate treatment, that is, the presence of unchallenged jurors of the\n   opposite race who share the characteristic given as the basis for the challenge; (2) the failure to voir dire as to the characteristic cited; (3) the characteristic cited is unrelated to the facts of the case; (4) lack of record support for the stated reason; and (5) group-based traits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Lynch v.

Smith, as the opponent of the strikes at issue here, bears the burden in determining whether a race-neutral explanation is pretextual.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9214636\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/877/1254/#p1272\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457366\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/802/1033/#p1037\">\n    802 So.2d at 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 29) ). Smith's trial counsel, however, offered no evidence supporting his rebuttal argument that \"nobody wants to be [on the jury panel];\" nor did he address any of the above-cited indicators of pretext. As such, Smith is procedurally barred from raising this issue on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sudduth v.

The race of the two arresting officers is not mentioned in the record. The record is quite sparse concerning the racial composition of the entire venire panel, which consisted of approximately fifty people. Of the seventeen members on the venire panel first considered for peremptory challenges by the State for tendering to the defense, nine of those seventeen were African Americans. The State exercised five of its six available strikes. The State accepted and tendered four African American panel members even though it had one remaining peremptory strike. There is no indication in the record of the race of any of the six jurors peremptorily stricken by the defense. Likewise, there is no indication in the record of the race of the final juror excused by the State when it used its last peremptory strike. Needless to say, no information exists in the record to indicate the racial composition of the jury that actually tried Watson.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8206142\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/662/#p665\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 30. Just as we determined in\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   , we likewise find here no abuse of discretion in the trial court's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   determination, as the record displays no racial discrimination in the jury selection in this case. In the Appendix to this opinion, we set forth the juror and jury selection information that this Court was able to glean from the record. From our review of the record, we find that it contains no information concerning the racial composition of the entire venire panel. As to the race of the seventeen members of the panel first considered for peremptory challenges by the State for tendering to the defense, the record indicates that the State exercised five of its six available strikes, striking three African Americans and two Caucasians. At this point, Smith's counsel made his\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge. The record shows that at this time, the State had selected four African American panel members, although\n   it had one remaining peremptory strike. The record contains no evidence of the race of any of the six jurors peremptorily struck by the defense; nor is there any indication of the race of the final juror struck by the State when in exercised its final peremptory challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 31. Having rejected the sole rebuttal argument offered by Smith, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   decision herein based upon the race-neutral reasons given by the State.\n   <em>\n    Thorson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11820172\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/721/590/#p593\">\n    721 So.2d at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 2) (\"If the defendant fails to rebut, the trial judge must base his decision on the reasons given by the State.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8206142\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/662/#p665\">\n    991 So.2d at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 8). The trial court determined that even if Smith had met her burden with proceeding with a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge, the three African American jurors at issue were struck for race-neutral reasons-juror disinterest and inattention. Precedent supports that juror disinterest and inattention are race-neutral reasons for a peremptory challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Horne v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11408622\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/825/627/#p636\">\n    825 So.2d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 636 (\u00b6 24) (Miss. 2002) (\"Inattentiveness alone has been accepted as a race-neutral explanation for the exercise of a peremptory strike.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457366\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/802/1033/#p1037\">\n    802 So.2d at 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 36) (\"This Court has held [that] '[i]nattentiveness, boredom, dress, demeanor, unemployment, and sleeping during voir dire have all been determined by this Court to be racially neutral reasons.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 32. We also find no merit in the pretextual arguments that Smith asserts on appeal. Smith appears to be making a \"disparate treatment\" argument in asserting that it is \"not sensible\" for the trial court to have \"assumed\" that unchallenged Caucasian jurors were not \"disinterested.\" Smith, however, points to no evidence in the record that indicates that selected Caucasian jurors showed disinterest. In fact, the record reflects that Juror 12, a Caucasian female, was\n   <em>\n    struck\n   </em>\n   by the State for the same reason, as follows: her disinterest and aggravation with the process as a whole. This supports a race-neutral reason for the State striking jurors on the basis of disinterest, rather than a purposefully racially discriminatory motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 33. Smith also asserts that the race-neutral reasons provided by the State are \"unrelated to the facts of the case\" and therefore indicate pretext. Relying upon precedent, we disagree. In\n   <em>\n    Lockett v. State\n   </em>\n   , for example, the Mississippi Supreme Court expressly recognized that \"[a]n expression of contempt or hostility may reasonably be assumed to spell trouble for the prosecution. Such demeanor is a legitimate reason,\n   <em>\n    related to any case\n   </em>\n   , for a prosecutor to exercise a peremptory challenge.\"\n   <em>\n    Lockett v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7587151\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/517/1346/#p1351\">\n    517 So.2d 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1351-52 (Miss. 1987) (citing cases) (emphasis added). In the same way, we find that the demeanor of the three jurors in question is related to Smith's case, and does not constitute a pretextual basis for exercising a peremptory challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 34. Finally, Smith asserts that the fact that neither the prosecution nor the trial court judge questioned the three jurors regarding their demeanor and lack of interest indicates that these reasons were merely a pretext. Smith also argues that there is no record evidence that the three jurors in issue were disinterested or failed to make eye contact. We also reject these contentions. As we recognized in\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   , \"although lack of support in the record may be an indication of pretext, 'the basis for the prosecutor's strike need not be in the record.' \"\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8206142\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/662/#p665\">\n    991 So.2d at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 9) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Manning v.

Bobbie Fairley was the grandmother of Smith's boyfriend at the time. Smith was visiting Bobbie Fairley's home in Prentiss, Mississippi, including spending the night at Bobbie Fairley's home on June 5, 2013-the evening of the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 38. Where lawyer-misconduct during opening or closing arguments is alleged, the applicable standard of review requires the Court to determine \"whether the natural and probable effect of the improper argument is to create unjust prejudice against the accused so as to result in a decision influenced by the prejudice so created.\"\n   <em>\n    Terrell v.

As addressed above, the record shows that the prosecutor's comments did not constitute error and the trial court sustained the defendant's objection.

In this case, the jury was properly instructed that their exclusive duty is to consider and weigh the evidence; that they must give Smith the benefit of any reasonable doubt; and that they could only find Smith guilty if the State proved all the elements of armed robbery beyond a reasonable doubt. Additionally, jury instruction D-3 addressed Smith's presumption of innocence, and the jury was also told that Smith was not required to establish the \"truth of her alibi to [the jury's] satisfaction.\" In short, the State's comments on the inadequacy of Smith's defense did not shift the burden of proof, and, particularly in light of these jury instructions, we find that the natural and probable effect of the State's arguments did not create unjust prejudice against Smith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013238\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/630/#p637\">\n    89 So.3d at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 22-24).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finding no error, this issue lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Failure to Call Bobbie Fairley\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 42. Smith also asserts that the State made an improper comment during its closing argument about her failure to call Bobbie Fairley as a witness to support Smith's alibi. The prosecutor said, \"[Smith] doesn't have any evidence of alibi because she doesn't have an alibi. Ms. Bobbie Fairley - you know, she was staying at Ms. Bobbie Fairley's house, and she wasn't here to testify.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 43. Smith's trial counsel objected to this comment and the trial court sustained the objection, admonishing the State to \"[s]tick to the evidence that's been presented.\" Smith did not request a curative instruction, nor did Smith request a mistrial. As such, we reject Smith's assignment of error on this issue based upon the Mississippi Supreme Court's determination on similar grounds in\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

Based on precedent, the record reflects that had a hearsay/confrontation clause objection been made, the trial court would not have abused its discretion in overruling that objection and allowing admission of Detective Sims's testimony for the following purpose served here: explaining Detective Sims's course of investigation and the reason he proceeded to bring Smith in for questioning. In short, Detective Sims's testimony was relevant and related to his decisionmaking in his investigatory process. The jury was not exposed to inadmissible hearsay, and Smith's rights under the Confrontation Clause were not implicated.

Smith argues, however, that there was really only one eyewitness-identification in her case because only the store cashier, Kelly James, identified Smith as the robber in a photo line-up. Store manager, Paige Arnold, identified two women in a photo lineup, and testified at trial that she told the investigating officer that she was eighty percent sure that one woman was the robber (Smith) and twenty percent sure it was the other person.

The jury also heard about Arnold's pre-trial misidentification and the reason for her confusion. Further, this case is even stronger than\n   <em>\n    Tugle\n   </em>\n   , because James, the cashier, positively identified Smith in both the photo-line-up and at trial.

Smith's assignment of error regarding the trial court's refusal of her identification jury instruction is without merit for this additional reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7010056\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/109/589/#p595\">\n    109 So.3d at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 23) ;\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7044979\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/37/645/#p649\">\n    37 So.3d at 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Error in Allowing Exhibits with Notations on the Envelopes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 61. The State introduced three CD/DVD exhibits at trial. These exhibits were admitted into evidence and played for the jury without objection. Each CD/DVD was in an envelope, and these envelopes had notations on them regarding the recordings. Smith asserts that the trial court erred when it allegedly allowed the jury to have the CD/DVD exhibits in these envelopes because, according to Smith, the notations on the envelopes were argumentative comments; they highlighted specific portions of the evidence; and the jury could have believed the notations were made by the trial court judge. The standard of review for a trial court's rulings \"regarding matters of evidence, relevancy and discovery violations, ... is abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9037833\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/891/179/#p182\">\n    891 So.2d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182 (\u00b6 6) (Miss. 2004). We find this assignment of error without merit for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 62. The record contains the original CD/DVD exhibits in the envelopes containing the following notations:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-109\"><strong>Exhibit description</strong> <strong>Notation description</strong> Ex. 5 - surveillance video from Dollar 5:23 P. Arnold enters video General 6:28 ?'s face is exposed It appears that ? had a pair of scissors in her pocket ? went for the cash drawer use Quicktime player Ex. 6-911 recording Play this one *06-05-13 19.56.05 911 call from manager manager gave dispatch ?'s license plate #. you can hear the panic in her voice.

Smith claims that these exhibits, in their envelopes, were given to the jury. Even if they were, the record contains no contemporaneous objection from Smith's trial counsel regarding the envelopes and the notations they contained. Further, Smith's trial counsel did not file any post-trial motions, and thus this alleged error was never raised until Smith's appeal. Accordingly, even assuming the exhibits\n   were given to the jury in their envelopes, we find that this issue is procedurally barred. As the Mississippi appellate courts repeatedly recognize, \"[i]t is incumbent on the party asserting error to make a contemporaneous objection and obtain a ruling in order to preserve the objection.\"\n   <em>\n    Ronk v.

Although the record reflects that the recordings were admitted into evidence, there is no indication in the record that the envelopes, containing the notations, were entered into evidence. There also is no indication in the record that the jury was given these exhibits in the envelopes. Even assuming this did occur, Smith acknowledges that \"the comments on the envelopes in this case were almost certainly made by investigators or a member of [the] prosecution team;\" yet Smith then speculates that there exists the possibility that one or more of the jurors could have believed the comments were made by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 65. We acknowledge the principle that judges \"should be astutely careful so that unintentionally the jurors are not improperly influenced by their words and actions,\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

The record contains no indication at all that the trial judge made the notations, endorsed the notations, or that the judge even knew the notations were on the envelopes.
