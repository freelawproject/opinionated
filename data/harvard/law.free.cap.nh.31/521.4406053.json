The indictment then sets out at much length, and with minuteness, the testimony of the respondent at the trial in the common pleas, stating wherein it was material, and also its falsity, and concludes by charging <em>\u201c </em>that he, the said Charles Bailey, in manner and form aforesaid, did falsely, wilfully, knowingly and corruptly commit corrupt and wilful perjury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-5\">On the trial, to prove that the false oath was taken in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>judicial proceeding, as alleged in the indictment, the counsel for the State offered evidence of the writ and subsequent proceedings in an action in favor of John Bailey, plaintiff, against the trustees of Colebrook Academy, principal defendant, and trustees. The defendant\u2019s counsel contended that there was a fatal variance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\">By the consent of the parties the indictment was taken from the jury in order that this question might be settled before a trial; and it was ordered that the questions arising upon the case be transferred to the superior court for their determination.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-6\"><em>Sullivan, </em>attorney general, for the State.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-7\">The principal objection to this indictment is that the word \u201c Colebath \u201d was used instead of \u201c Colebrook.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-8\">Our answer to it is this. The following words in the indictment, viz: \u201cin which said John Bailey was plaintiff and the trustees of the Colebath Academy aforesaid was defendant,\u201d are superfluous. If these words had been omitted in the indictment, or if they should be striken out of it, it would be good and sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-9\">The following authorities are relied upon to prove that they may properly be rejected as surplusage:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-10\">\u201c All unnecessary words may be rejected as surplusage in an indiciment, if it would be good without them.\u201d Whar. Cr. Law 165. An authority in 1st Leach\u2019s Cr. Law 127 is cited as having a direct bearing upon the point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-11\">\u201c The introduction of averments, superfluous or immaterial, will not vitiate an indictment, for if it can be supported without the words they will be rejected as surplusage. Harrison\u2019s An\u2019l Dig. 836; 1 Ch. Cr. Law 143; Star. Cr. Pl. 274; 1 Term Rep. 322; E. P. Cro. 785.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-12\">\u201c When time, place, person or other circumstances are not descriptive of the fact or degree of the crime, the discrepancy between the allegation and the proof is not a variance.\u201d Greenleaf 83, \u00a7 65.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>In this ease was given the name of the action in which the perjury was committed, but it was not descriptive of either the fact or degree of the crime. The name of the action was stated in subsequent words in the indictment in language so clear that the accused cannot suffer by a rejection of the words mentioned above; either from a want of knowledge of the action in which the perjury was committed, or from a second conviction for the same offence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-5\">If it had been alleged in the indictment that the writ in favor of Colebath Academy instead of Colebrook Academy had been forged, the writ would have been the subject matter of the crime; but in this case to describe the writ is not a description of the fact, instrument or degree of the perjury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-6\">Similar errors have often been committed, and have been considered immaterial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-7\">In Noscoe on Ev. 820, are collected many cases of errors resembling this case, which were considered as not fatal to the indictment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b524-8\"><em>Burns 8f </em>Fletcher, for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-9\">The prosecutor must prove, in order to support an indictment for perjury:</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-10\">1st. The authority to administer an oath.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-11\">2d. The occasion of administering it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-12\">3d. The taking of the oath.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-13\">4th. The substance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-14\">5th. The materiality of the matter sworn.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-15\">6th. The introductory averments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-16\">7th. The falsity of the matter sworn.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-17\">8th. The corrupt intent of the defendant. 2 Stark. Ev. 2d Ed. 621.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-18\">The occasion of administering the oath must be proved as laid. If the perjury is alleged to have been committed on the trial of a cause at <em>nisiprius, </em>the record must be pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>duced in order to show that such a trial was had. 2 Stark. Ev. 622.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-5\">The occasion must be correctly stated, and a variance is fatal. <em>Eden's case, </em>1 Esp. 97.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-6\">Records produced in evidence must be strictly conformable with the statement in the pleading they are intended to prove. The slightest variance in substance between the matter set out, and the record produced in evidence will be fatal. Archbold\u2019s Crim. Pl. 95, and authorities cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-7\">\u201cColebath\u201d Academy and \u201cColebrook\u201d Academy are not substantially the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-8\">In <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>The president and trustees of the Savings Bank for the county of Strafford, </em>5 N. H. Rep. 449, it was decided that copies of the writ and execution in favor of the \u201c Savings Bank for the county of Strafford,\u201d were improperly received in evidence on account of the variance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-9\">So in this case it does not appear that Colebrook Academy and Colebath Academy are the same body.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b525-10\">Eastman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1d\">From an examination of the indictment it will be seem that a clerical error was committed in drawing it, by using the word \u201c Colebath \u201d instead of \u201c Colebrook.\u201d Instead of saying the trustees of \u201c <em>Colebath </em>Academy aforesaid,\u201d it should have said the trustees of \u201c <em>Colebrook </em>Academy aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">To prove that the false oath was taken in a judicial proceeding, as alleged in the indictment, the counsel for the State offered evidence of the writ and subsequent proceedings in an action in favor of John Bailey plaintiff, against the trustees of the \u201c Colebrook \u201d Academy.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">The defendant\u2019s counsel contended that there was a fatal variance between the evidence and the allegations of the indictment ; and unless some part of the averment in the indictment can be rejected as surplusage, the objection is well taken; for the trustees of \u201c Colebath \u201d Academy cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>construed to mean the trustees of \u201c Colebrook\u201d Academy. Can this difficulty be got over ?</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The general rule is that all descriptive averments in an indictment must be proved as laid. But if an averment may be entirely omitted without affecting the charge against the prisoner, and without detriment to the indictment, it may be disregarded in evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Copp, 15 </em>N. H. Rep. 212; 1 Phill. on Ev. 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">And all unnecessary words may, on trial or arrest of judgment, be rejected as surplusage, if the indictment would be good upon striking them out. Wharton\u2019s Crim. Law 165; Leach 536; Arch. Cr. Pl. 22; Stark. Cr. Pl. 274; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Arnold, 4 Pick. 251; <em>State </em>v. <em>Buckman, </em>8 N. H. Rep. 203; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Bolkom, 3 Pick. 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">In <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Morris, </em>Leach 127, the indictment alleged that the defendant, <em>\u201c Francis </em>Morris, the said goods above mentioned, so as aforesaid feloniously stolen, taken and carried away, feloniously did receive and have, he the said <em>Thomas </em>Morris then and there well knowing the said goods and chattels to have been feloniously stolen, taken and carried away.\u201d Here was an error in using the name \u201c Thomas,\u201d instead of n Francis,\u201d but the twelve judges held that the words \u201c he the said Thomas Morris,\u201d might be struck out as surplusage, and that the indictment was sensible and good without them.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">And such would also seem to have been the opinion of the court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>4 Pick. 252; where the indictment charged that the defendant in and upon one Peddy <em>Harvey </em>did make an assault and her the said Peddy <em>Hunt </em>then and there did beat, wound and ill treat, with the intent her the said Peddy <em>Harvey </em>to ravish. The mistake in the indictment was in calling Peddy <em>Harvey </em>by the name of Peddy <em>Hunt, </em>but it appears to have been held that the whole clause \u201c and her the said Peddy Hunt then and there did beat, wound and ill treat,\u201d might be rejected as surplus-age. The indictment was perfect without these words.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>By striking out the word <em>\u201c </em>Colebath \u201d in this indictment it will stand perfectly well. It will then read, \u201c at the court of common pleas holden at Lancaster, within and for the county of Coos, aforesaid, on the first Tuesday of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-three, the jurors for the State of New Hampshire upon their oath present, that at the court of common pleas, holden at Lancaster, in and for the county of Coos aforesaid, on the first Tuesday of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one, a certain issue duly joined in the court aforesaid, between one John Bailey and the trustees of the Colebrook Academy, a corporation duly established by law in this State, in a plea of the case, in which said John Bailey was plaintiff and the trustees of the academy aforesaid was defendant, came on to be tried in due form of law, and was then and there tried by a certain jury of the county in that behalf, duly empanelled and sworn to try said issue between the said parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">It will thus be seen that in rejecting this word as surplus-age, the indictment is left perfect, and the defendant can in no way be prejudiced that we can discover. It is merely an unnecessary word, inconsistent with the other parts of the indictment, that is rejected, and the authorities cited would appear fully to sustain this view of the question. The word can be omitted without affecting the charge against the prisoner, and without detriment to the indictment. The cases which show that averments and words in an indictment cannot be rejected as surplusage, are those where it is made to appear that it cannot be done without leaving the indictment imperfect.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Treating this word as surplusage, there is no variance between the evidence and the indictment. We therefore hold the indictment valid and the evidence competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">It would seem, also, that upon the authorities the whole averment, as stated by the attorney general, might be stricken out.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
