They thereupon gave notice to that town at what time and place they would be heard ; and after such hearing they apportioned a part of the expense of the road to be paid by that town. Their report was accepted by the court of common pleas, and judgment rendered that the town of Wentworth recover of the town of Dorchester the sum so apportioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-7\">Several errors were assigned in the proceedings and judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-8\"><em>Quincy, </em>for Wentworth,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AB5\">moved that the writ of error be quashed. In support of this motion, he contended that the judgment which this writ of error is brought to reverse, is founded on a statute, the provisions of which refer .to the laying out of highways. The proceedings are not according to the course of the common law, but are based entirely on the statute. Therefore error does not lie, but the appropriate remedy is by writ of <em>certiorari.

Certiorari and Error.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b452-6\">Bell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Af0\">The authorities cited by the counsel for Went-worth are entirely conclusive that error does not lie to reverse a judgment rendered upon a petition for a new highway. The only remedy is by writ of <em>certiorari, </em>which is issued upon petition, and after a hearing upon the merits. Such has long been the usual practice. The writ of error, therefore, must be quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
