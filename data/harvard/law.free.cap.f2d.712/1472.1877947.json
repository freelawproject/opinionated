Joette Lorion, the petitioner, seeks review of a final decision of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) denying her request that the Commission institute licensing review of Turkey Point Plant Unit Number 4 (Turkey Point), a nuclear reactor located near Miami, Florida. The jurisdictional bases of the petition for review are asserted to be 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(4) (1976) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b) (1976) which together give this court authority to review directly those final orders of the NRC entered after formal agency proceedings. Because the Commission\u2019s decision in this case did not result from such a formal proceeding, however, we must dismiss this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1549-15\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1549-16\">In September 1981, the petitioner wrote the Commission to express her concern that the continued operation of the Turkey Point reactor near her home threatened her safety and the safety of her neighbors. Specifically, the petitioner\u2019s letter called attention to the possible leakage of Turkey Point\u2019s steam generator tubes and questioned the integrity of the reactor\u2019s steel pressure vessel. To address these concerns, the petitioner requested in her letter that the Commission (1) temporarily shut down the reactor for a steam generator inspection and (2) initiate a license review to consider the suspension of Turkey Point\u2019s operating license until such time as its operator, Florida Power and Light Company (FP &amp; L), submitted proof of the reactor\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1549-17\">The Commission treated the petitioner\u2019s letter as a specific enforcement request under section 2.206 of its rules of practice, 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.206 (1982), and referred the request to the NRC\u2019s Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. Section 2.206 provides a means by which any member of the public may request the Director of Regulation to take enforcement action against a NRC licensee. Seven weeks later, however, the Director notified the petitioner that he was denying her request. Among the reasons given were that an inspection of Turkey Point\u2019s steam generator tubes had taken place since petitioner had sent her letter (thereby mooting that aspect of her request) and that the ongoing monitoring of the reactor\u2019s steam generator tubes and an upcoming study of the reactor\u2019s pressure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1474\">*1474</page-number>vessel integrity were sufficient to protect the public\u2019s health and safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1550-4\">After unsuccessfully urging the Commission to review the Director\u2019s decision, the petitioner filed for review in this court. She asks that we set aside the Director\u2019s decision as arbitrary and capricious agency action that, in addition, was reached without affording her the benefit of a public hearing; alternatively, the petitioner contends that her letter was merely \u201cadvisory\u201d and was not intended as a section 2.206 request. Moreover, the petitioner asserts in her brief that the Commission has failed to prepare an adequate environmental impact statement, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 \u2014 4361 (1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980), for repairs made to Turkey Point\u2019s steam generators.</p>\n<p id=\"b1550-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1550-6\">At the outset, it is important to note that our review is limited to the Commission\u2019s denial of the petitioner\u2019s request under section 2.206 of the NRC\u2019s rules of practice. Accordingly, none of the petitioner\u2019s NEPA arguments are properly before us. These arguments were not raised by the petitioner in her letter of September 1981 and therefore played no role whatsoever in the agency action that the petitioner asks us to review. <em>See </em>Letter from Joette Lorion to the NRC (Sept. 11, 1981), Joint Appendix (JA) 1-2. This court long has recognized that our normal procedures allow only those contentions subjected to agency scrutiny during the administrative process to be entertained on judicial review. <em>See D.C. Transit System, Inc. </em>v. <em>Washington Area Transit Commission, </em>466 F.2d 394, 413-14 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1086, 93 S.Ct. 688, 34 L.Ed.2d 673 (1972). We also reject the petitioner\u2019s contention that her letter should not have been treated as a section 2.206 request because she had not formally labelled or addressed her letter as a \u201csection 2.206 request\u201d and had intended it to be merely \u201cadvisory.\u201d In promulgating its rules of practice, the Commission clearly expressed its intent to treat \u201cany\u201d request for the modification, suspension, or revocation of a license as a section 2.206 request, <em>see </em>39 Fed.Reg. 12,353 (1974), and the court may rely upon this contemporaneous explanation of the scope of the agency\u2019s rules, <em>see Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. EPA, </em>636 F.2d 1267, 1280 (D.C.Cir.1980). Indeed, it would be a disservice to members of the interested public for the NRC to reject out of hand enforcement requests simply because they were not appropriately labelled and addressed. Thus, properly framed, the petition for review asks us to consider the Commission\u2019s treatment of the petitioner\u2019s September 1981 letter under 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.206.</p>\n<p id=\"b1550-8\">Although the parties have not raised the issue, we nevertheless must determine our jurisdiction to review NRC denials of section 2.206 requests. It is axiomatic that federal courts of appeals are courts of limited jurisdiction \u201cempowered to hear only those cases ... entrusted to them by a jurisdictional grant by the Congress.\u201d 13 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3522, at 44 (1975 ed.). Our jurisdiction to review administrative decisions of the NRC is straightforward. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(4) (1976), courts of appeals have authority to review \u201call final orders of the Atomic Energy Commission [now the NRC] made reviewable by section 2239 of title 42.\u201d Section 2239 of title 42 provides, in subsection (b), for judicial review in the courts of appeals of \u201c[a]ny final order entered in any proceeding of the kind specified in subsection (a).\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b). Section 2239 designates, in subsection (a), those formal NRC \u201cproceedings\u201d in which a person may, upon request, demand a hearing. These proceedings include \u201cany proceeding ... for the granting, suspending, revoking, or amending of any license or construction permit .... \u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a). Thus, we may review the Commission\u2019s final order in this case, denying petitioner\u2019s request under 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.206, only if the order was entered in the kind of \u201cproceeding\u201d specified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2289(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1475\">*1475</page-number>A. <em>The Nature of the Section 2.206 Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1551-4\">To appraise properly the relationship of section 2.206 requests to NRC \u201cproceedings,\u201d it is helpful to describe briefly the regulatory framework into which section 2.206 fits. Under section 2.202 of the NRC\u2019s rules of practice, the Commission\u2019s various staff directors may \u201cinstitute a proceeding to modify, suspend, or revoke a license ... by serving on the licensee an order to show cause.... \u201d 10 C.F.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b1551-5\">\u00a7 2.202(a) (1982). A show cause proceeding under section 2.202 constitutes a formal \u201cproceeding\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a) and, upon timely demand, the Commission must grant the licensee a hearing. <em>See </em>10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.202(b)-(c). In 1974, the Commission adopted section 2.206 specifically to provide a mechanism for members of the public to request the Director of Regulation to institute a section 2.202 proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1551-6\">Any person may file a request for the Director of Regulation to institute a proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 2.202 to modify, suspend, or revoke a license or for such other action as may be proper.... The requests shall specify the action requested and set forth the facts that constitute the basis for the request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1551-7\">10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.206(a) (1982); <em>see </em>39 Fed.Reg. 12,353 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1551-8\">Although the Commission has interpreted section 2.206 to require issuance of a show cause order when \u201csubstantial health or safety issues have been raised,\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co., </em>2 N.R.C. 173, 176 (1975), the Commission has never required that this determination be made pursuant to a hearing, <em>see, e.g., Northern Indiana Public Service Co. </em>(Bailly Generating Station, Nuclear-1), 7 N.R.C. 429, 432-33 (1978). Instead, the Director of Regulation has considerable discretion to make whatever unilateral inquiries he or she deems necessary. Provided that this discretion is not abused, the Director \u201cis free to rely on a variety of sources of information, including staff analysis of generic issues, documents issued by other agencies, and the comments of the licensee on the factual allegations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The language of section 2.206 merely requires that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1551-10\">Within a reasonable time after a request pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section has been received, the Director of Regulation shall either institute the requested proceeding ... or shall advise the person who made the request that no proceeding will be instituted in whole or in part ... and the reasons therefor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1551-11\">10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.206(b) (1982). In short, a section 2.206 request triggers a preliminary investigation by the NRC\u2019s staff to determine whether or not a formal proceeding should be instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1551-12\">In light of the language and function of section 2.206, both this court and the Seventh Circuit have affirmed the Commission\u2019s refusal to hold hearings on section 2.206 requests; the Commission\u2019s processing of such requests repeatedly has been held <em>not </em>to constitute a \u201cproceeding\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a). In <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Nuclear Regulatory Commission, </em>591 F.2d 12 (7th Cir.1979), for example, the court held that hearings on section 2.206 requests were properly denied because the requests did not involve \u201cagency action which, according to that agency\u2019s governing statute, must be preceded by a hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. Similarly, in <em>Porter County Chapter of the Izaak Walton League v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Porter County), </em>606 F.2d 1363 (D.C.Cir.1979), this court held that the procedural accoutrements of a statutory \u201cproceeding\u201d were inapplicable to section 2.206 requests because \u201c[t)he agency is not bound to launch full-blown proceedings simply because a violation of the statute is claimed. It may properly undertake preliminary inquiries in order to determine whether the claim is substantial enough under the statute to warrant full proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1369 &amp; n. 16 (noting that the result is \u201ccongruent with that ... in <em>Illinois v. NRC\"). </em>Relying on both of these decisions, the Commission maintains in the present case that the petitioner was not entitled to a hearing on her section 2.206 request. As the Commission succinctly puts it: \u201cA request for an enforcement proceeding is just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1476\">*1476</page-number>that \u2014 a request. Unless and until granted, it is not a \u2018proceeding\u2019 where the requester has any right to present evidence.\u201d Government Brief at 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-4\">B, <em>Caselaw Regarding Subject Matter Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1552-5\">Neither the <em>Porter County </em>nor <em>Illinois v. NRC </em>court discussed the issue of subject matter jurisdiction. Yet, given this court\u2019s holding in <em>Porter County </em>that section 2.206 requests do not entail \u201cproceedings\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a), it would logically follow that we must dismiss petitions to review such requests for lack of jurisdiction: 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b) expressly limits our reviewing authority to final orders entered pursuant to the kind of \u201cproceedings\u201d specified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a). The logic of the jurisdictional statute, however, has been conveniently distorted in a separate line of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-6\">In <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRDC v. NRC), </em>606 F.2d 1261 (D.C.Cir.1979), this court held that it had exclusive jurisdiction to review a NRC decision denying a request by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) for the Commission to license certain tanks constructed for the storage of high-level radioactive waste. The Commission had denied the NRDC\u2019s request because the NRC\u2019s licensing jurisdiction extends only to storage tanks authorized for long-term storage, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5842(4) (1976), and the tanks in question were intended only for short-term storage, <em>see </em>606 F.2d at 1264. Stating that \u201ca licensing jurisdiction determination is a necessary first step in any proceeding for the granting of a license,\u201d this court found that the NRC\u2019s decision \u201cwas \u2018entered in a proceeding\u2019 for \u2018the granting ... of any license\u2019\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a) and thus within the reviewing jurisdiction of this court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-7\">Our decision in <em>NRDC v. NRC </em>was scrutinized recently by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Rockford League of Women Voters v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Rockford), </em>679 F.2d 1218 (7th Cir.1982). At issue in <em>Rockford </em>was the Commission\u2019s denial of a section 2.206 request that the Commission institute proceedings to revoke the construction permit of a partially completed reactor because of allegedly unresolved safety issues. Although Judge Posner, writing for the <em>Rockford </em>court, upheld the Commission\u2019s decision, he correctly noted the jurisdictional implications of <em>Porter County </em>and <em>Illinois v. NRC: </em>\u201cAt least on a literal reading of section 2239(b), the Director\u2019s action in denying the petitioner\u2019s request to initiate a revocation proceeding was not an order, final or otherwise, in a section 2239 proceeding; it was a refusal to initiate such a proceeding....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1220. Moreover, Judge Posner added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1552-9\">A ruling that the courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to review the Director\u2019s refusal to initiate a revocation proceeding would not leave the petitioner remediless. The League could still bring suit in district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, the general federal-question jurisdiction statute, see <em>Izaak Walton League of America v. Schlesinger, </em>337 F.Supp. 287, 291-92 (D.D.C.1971); Gage v. <em>Commonwealth Edison Co., </em>356 F.Supp. 80, 84 (N.D.Ill. 1972); <em>Gage v. AEC, supra, </em>479 F.2d [1214] at 1222, and perhaps under other statutes, such as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337 (acts regulating commerce), as well. The district court is arguably the more appropriate venue for a proceeding to review informal agency action, of which agency inaction is a conspicuous example. In deciding not to initiate a proceeding to revoke the Byron construction permit, the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation naturally did not compile the kind of formal record that is the usual predicate for reviewing agency action in the courts of appeals. To decide whether he abused his discretion it might be necessary to reconstruct the informal record on which he based his decision. The district courts are better suited to perform that task than the courts of appeals. See <em>Susquehanna Valley Alliance v. Three Mile Island Nuclear Reactor, </em>619 F.2d 231, 241 (3d Cir.1980).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 1220-21. Despite these misgivings, the <em>Rockford </em>court concluded \u201cprimarily on the authority of [NRDC <em>v. NRC]\u201d </em>that district courts were precluded from asserting jurisdiction to review the NRC\u2019s section 2.206 decisions because of the exclusive jurisdiction over licensing \u201cproceedings\u201d lodged in the courts of appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 1221. Although Judge Posner noted that the holding in <em>NRDC v. NRC </em>\u201cadmittedly does some violence to the language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b),\u201d and suggested that he might be \u201csomewhat inclined as an original matter to come out the other way,\u201d he interpreted \u201cproceeding\u201d in section 2239(b) to encompass the informal section 2.206 process in order to avoid creating a conflict between the circuits and because he felt that an extra level of district court review would be simply \u201ctoo much.\u201d 679 F.2d at 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-6\">Shortly after <em>Rockford </em>was decided, this court again addressed its jurisdiction to review the NRC\u2019s section 2.206 decisions in <em>Seacoast Anti-Pollution League of New Hampshire v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Seacoast), </em>690 F.2d 1025 (D.C.Cir. 1982). At issue in <em>Seacoast </em>was a section 2.206 request that the Commission institute a proceeding to revoke the construction permits for a non-operational reactor because the permits did not include an adequate evacuation plan. In sustaining the Commission\u2019s denial of this request, we acknowledged that this court has jurisdiction \u201conly if the Commission\u2019s final order was entered in a proceeding for the revoking of the construction permits.\u201d 690 F.2d at 1028.\u201d After reciting the statutory requirement, however, we referred to <em>NRDC v. NRC </em>and <em>Rockford </em>and concluded that the Commission\u2019s refusal to institute a section 2239(a) revocation proceeding was nonetheless a \u201cnecessary first step\u201d in any revocation proceeding and hence reviewable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b). 690 F.2d at 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-8\">C. <em>Resolving the Conflict Among </em>Porter County, NRDC v. NRC, Seacoast, <em>and the Jurisdictional Language in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1553-9\">Upon reflection, we are no longer comfortable with the strain our decisions have placed on the clear-cut language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239. By applying to section 2.206 requests the \u201cnecessary first step\u201d rationale employed by this court in <em>NRDC v. NRC, </em>the Seventh Circuit in <em>Rockford </em>and this court in <em>Seacoast </em>have interpreted \u201cproceeding\u201d in section 2239(b) as encompassing the informal process commenced by the filing of a section 2.206 request. <em>See Rockford, </em>679 F.2d at 1221. Yet, the statutory language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b) explicitly restricts our reviewing jurisdiction to those final orders entered in the kinds of formal \u201cproceedings\u201d specified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a). This unusual, interlocking scheme does not allow \u201cproceeding\u201d to mean one thing for procedural purposes and another for jurisdictional purposes. Accordingly, we cannot rely on our constructions of other statutory schemes \u2014 usually requiring interpretation of a simple, jurisdictional grant to review agency \u201corders\u201d\u2014 in which Congress impliedly may have intended broader meanings to attend the same words in jurisdictional sections than in other sections. <em>See, e.g., Investment Company Institute v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, </em>551 F.2d 1270, 1276-81 (D.C.Cir.1977) (construing the word \u201corder\u201d more broadly in jurisdictional section than in other, non-related sections of the Bank Holding Act of 1956); <em>cf. City of Rochester v. Bond, </em>603 F.2d 927, 933 n. 26 (D.C.Cir.1979) (courts sometimes construe \u201corder\u201d for purposes of special review provisions more expansively than its definition in the Administrative Procedure Act). Nor may we read out the unusual cross-reference in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239 by relying on cases generally confirming the institutional ability of this court to review informal agency action. <em>See, e.g., Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Hardin, </em>428 F.2d 1093,1098-99 (D.C.Cir.1970). Our inferences of Congress\u2019 jurisdictional choices operate only \u201cin those cases not plainly governed by statutory language or history.\u201d <em>City of Rochester v. Bond, </em>603 F.2d at 935. In the present case, we are confronted with a peculiar jurisdictional statute which precludes us from interpreting \u201cproceedings\u201d in 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>\u00a7 2239(b) with the same latitude with which we have legitimately interpreted such terms as \u201corders\u201d or \u201cfinal orders\u201d in other statutes. Here, Congress has explicitly referenced its use of the word \u201cproceeding\u201d in the statute\u2019s jurisdictional section to the kinds of \u201cproceedings\u201d specified in the statute\u2019s procedural section. Thus, we are presented with one of those unusual statutes \u201cwhich define a reviewable order with such limiting circumstantiality that a number of determinative agency actions cannot possibly be squared with the requirements.\u201d L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 422 (Abridged Student Ed. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-4\">Given this unusually self-contained statutory scheme, there is no room in which to import the well-founded presumption against bifurcation of judicial forums. However economical we may find exclusive court of appeals review of the NRC\u2019s section 2.206 decisions to be, it is one thing to read notions of judicial economy into statutory terms capable of assimilating them and quite another to read out Congress\u2019 jurisdictional terms in order to accommodate our own policy preferences. To paraphrase an opinion by Judge Posner issued shortly after his opinion in <em>Rockford, </em>the precise statutory provision by which Congress has granted exclusive jurisdiction to courts of appeals \u201cis not some mindless, irksome technicality that we should try to construe our way around.\u201d <em>Denberg v. Railroad Retirement Board, </em>696 F.2d 1193, 1196 (7th Cir. 1983). The conclusion of this court in <em>Porter County </em>that section 2.206 requests do not entail \u201cproceedings\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a) for procedural purposes, 606 F.2d at 1369, and the Commission\u2019s reiteration in the present case that \u201c[ujnless and until granted, a [request for enforcement] is not a \u2018proceeding\u2019 where the requester has any right to present evidence,\u201d Government Brief at 2A-25, precludes this court from viewing the section 2.206 process as a \u201cnecessary\u201d part of the NRC\u2019s formal licensing proceedings for jurisdictional purposes. <em>Cf. Foti v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>375 U.S. 217, 232, 84 S.Ct. 306, 315, 11 L.Ed.2d 281 (1965) (in light of compelling legislative history, court of appeals jurisdiction over \u201cfinal orders of deportation\u201d included jurisdiction over administrative determination historically and consistently made as an integral part of the formal deportation hearings). There is no evidence in the sparse legislative history surrounding the passage of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239 to suggest that Congress envisioned its jurisdictional grant in section 2239(b) to extend beyond orders entered in formal hearings. <em>Compare </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b) (1976) (final version of \u00a7 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954) <em>with </em>H.R. 8862, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 189 (1954), <em>reprinted in </em>I <em>Legislative History of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (Legislative History) </em>at 105, 167-68 (1955) (unenacted version of \u00a7 189, as introduced, providing for review in the courts of appeals of \u201cany proceeding to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend any order of the Commission\u201d) <em>and </em>H.R. 9757, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 189 (1954) (unenacted version of \u00a7 189, as introduced, providing for review in the courts of appeals of \u201c[a]ny final order granting, denying, suspending, revoking, modifying, or rescinding any license.\u201d). <em>See generally </em>H.R.Rep. No. 2181, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. (1954); S.Rep. No. 1699, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1954] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 3456; 100 Cong.Rec. 10685-86 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-6\">Thus, in light of the specific jurisdictional grant given to us by Congress in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b), we can no longer reconcile the \u201cnecessary first step\u201d rationale of <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, </em>606 F.2d 1261 (D.C.Cir.1979) and <em>Seacoast Anti-Pollution League of New Hampshire v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, </em>690 F.2d 1025 (D.C.Cir.1982) with our holding in <em>Porter County Chapter of the Izaak Walton League v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, </em>606 F.2d 1363 (D.C.Cir.1979) and the Commission\u2019s steadfast insistence that the section 2.206 process does not entail a \u201cproceeding\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a). Accordingly, we hold that this court is without subject matter jurisdiction to review directly the Commission\u2019s section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number>2.206 decisions under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b).<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> To avoid misunderstanding, however, we emphasize that we are not holding today that the NRC\u2019s denials of section 2.206 requests are unreviewable. A requester allegedly injured by the NRC\u2019s refusal to institute licensing proceedings is presumptively entitled to judicial review for agency action asserted to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with law. In the absence of any applicable statute prescribing review in a particular court \u2014 which is the case here regarding the NRC\u2019s denials of section 2.206 requests\u2014 \u201cnonstatutory\u201d review may be sought in district court under any applicable jurisdictional grant, <em>see City of Rochester v. Bond, </em>603 F.2d at 931. As Judge Posner indicated in <em>Rockford, </em>district court review of the NRC\u2019s section 2.206 decisions could be predicated on the general federal question jurisdictional statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (Supp. V 1981) and, possibly, under the jurisdictional grant regarding acts of commerce, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337 (1976), as well. This court, of course, would then be able to review the decisions of the district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-5\">It may well be that Congress will want to amend its jurisdictional grant in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b) to allow courts of appeals to review directly the NRC\u2019s denials of section 2.206 requests. Or Congress may want to leave jurisdiction over such informal decisions in district courts. Our opinion today merely holds that the statutory limitations on our present jurisdiction in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b) make it a decision for Congress, and not for this court, to make. The present case is therefore dismissed from this court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and transferred to the federal Dis-</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-8\">trict Court for the District of Columbia pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1631 (West 1983). <em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1555-7\"> Because this holding resolves an unavoidable conflict among these prior decisions, this part of our opinion has been separately considered and approved by the full court, and thus constitutes the law of the circuit. We wish to make clear, however, that our change of course today does not upset the <em>res judicata </em>effect of our prior decisions, on the merits, on the parties in <em>NRDC v. NRC, Porter County, </em>or <em>Seacoast. Cf. Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, </em>308 U.S. 371, 60 S.Ct. 317, 84 L.Ed. 329 (1940) (res <em>judicata </em>applied to prior decisions of lower court under jurisdictional statute subsequently declared unconstitutional); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 12 (1982) (interests in finality can operate to give <em>res judicata </em>effect to decisions resting on incorrect subject matter jurisdiction determinations).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
