We affirm the resolution of the insider status issue and remand for further consideration and entry of findings on the subordination issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Land Wall, president, controller and director of Missionary Baptist Foundation of America, Inc. (MBFA), a religious non-profit corporation, filed a petition for reorganization of that corporation and its seven wholly-owned subsidiaries, together considered as one entity, under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The debtor\u2019s schedules included two promissory notes which are the subject of this appeal. These notes represent obligations of the debtor to Robert G. Huffman, claimant herein, and result from several transactions involving (1) Huffman, (2) Wall, (3) their partnership known as Wall and Huffman, (4) West Texas Home Health Care, Inc. (West Texas Homes), a nursing home management corporation owned by Huffman and Wall, and (5) one or more of MBFA\u2019s subsidiaries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Huffman and Wall established both their partnership, Wall and Huffman, and their corporation, West Texas Homes, in 1975. The partnership purchased Dumas Convalescent Center, a nursing home in Dumas, Texas, borrowing $228,000 from a commercial lender to cover the downpayment and the costs of needed improvements. Huffman had no personal exposure on this loan. Shortly thereafter the partnership contracted with West Texas Homes for the operation of the facility. Wall handled the financial details; Huffman was involved exclusively in management.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">In early 1977, Wall individually purchased the Crestview Home in Throckmorton, Texas. He entered into a management contract with West Texas Homes identical to that covering the Dumas home. On February 1,1977, Wall transferred his interest in Crestview to Pampas Enterprises, a partnership composed of himself and three family members. That same day Pampas subleased the property to West Texas Homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">Crestview and Dumas were sold to MBFA in April 1977. Under the terms of this package sale, MBFA assumed all indebtedness encumbering the properties and agreed to pay $148,014 for the equity. Huffman and Wall, individually, each received a promissory note for $74,007, secured by a second lien on the Dumas property. Through this <em>en globo </em>transaction Huffman shared equally with Wall in the equity in Crestview, despite the former\u2019s apparent lack of a proprietary interest therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">Contemporaneously with the sale of the Dumas and Crestview homes, West Texas Homes assigned its contractual rights in both homes to MBFA receiving therefor two unsecured promissory notes, each in the amount of $88,860. West Texas Homes was subsequently dissolved and in the distribution of its assets, its shareholders, Huffman and Wall, each received one of the $88,860 notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">Through August of 1980, MBFA made periodic payments to Huffman on the $74,-007 and $88,860 notes. When the petition in bankruptcy was filed, MBFA\u2019s books reflected a balance of $37,170.96 owed Huffman on the $74,007 note. Although the corporate books did not evidence the $88,-860 note, MBFA\u2019s representatives acknowledged the existence of a debt in this amount to West Texas Homes. The debt- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>or\u2019s schedules reflected an aggregate balance on the two notes in favor of Huffman of $119,005.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The trustee formally objected to Huffman\u2019s claim, contending that MBFA was not indebted to him on the $88,860 note nor for the $37,170.96 balance, because the $74,-007 note was invalid as the product of an arrangement by Huffman and Wall designed to improperly extract monies from the debtor. The bankruptcy court found, <em>inter alia, </em>that Wall\u2019s ownership or control of the debtor placed him within the definition of \u201cinsider of the debtor,\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(25)(B). Recognizing that Huffman\u2019s connection with MBFA differed from Wall\u2019s, the bankruptcy court then addressed the question whether Huffman could be characterized as an insider because of his business relationship with Wall and his stock ownership in West Texas Homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The bankruptcy judge found that MBFA\u2019s acquisition of the Dumas and Crestview homes and West Texas Homes\u2019 contractual position were effected by Wall on a less than arms-length basis. The judge concluded that because West Texas Homes was an affiliate of the debtor under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(2)(B), its conveyance of the $88,860 note to Huffman was an insider transaction. Further, the judge determined that the $74,007 indebtedness to Huffman, in his capacity as general partner of a partnership which controlled the debtor, likewise resulted from an insider transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Based on these findings, the bankruptcy judge allowed the $119,005 claim but ordered it subordinated, under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 510(c)(1), to those of the general unsecured creditors. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court in all respects, concluding that there had been sufficient findings to justify the subordination of Huffman\u2019s claim under the three-pronged test we enunciated in <em>Matter of Mobile Steel Co., </em>563 F.2d 692 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">On appeal, Huffman contends that the bankruptcy court erred in imputing insider status to him because of MBFA\u2019s association with West Texas Homes and the Wall and Huffman partnership. He further contends that there were insufficient findings to support the application of the equitable subordination doctrine outlined in <em>Matter of Mobile Steel Co. </em>We disagree with the first contention and agree with the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Findings of fact made in a bankruptcy proceeding will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. <em>See Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipeline Co., </em>458 U.S. 50, 102 S.Ct. 2858, 73 L.Ed.2d 598 (1982); <em>In re Reed, </em>700 F.2d 986 (5th Cir.1983). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous \u201cwhen although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). Strict application of the clearly erroneous rule is particularly important where, as here, the district court has affirmed the bankruptcy judge\u2019s findings. <em>In re Garfinkle, </em>672 F.2d 1340 (11th Cir.1982) <em>(citing DeMet v. Harralson, </em>399 F.2d 35 (5th Cir.1968)). This rigorous standard does not constrain appellate scrutiny of conclusions of law, which are subject to plenary review. <em>In re Bubble Up Delaware, Inc., </em>684 F.2d 1259 (9th Cir. 1982); <em>Matter of Multiponics, Inc., </em>622 F.2d 709 (5th Cir.1980). <em>See Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982). When a finding of fact is premised on an improper legal standard, or a proper one improperly applied, that finding loses the insulation of the clearly erroneous rule. <em>Smith v. Hightower, </em>693 F.2d 359 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">\n<em>Huffman as an Insider</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">The district court considered the determination by the bankruptcy court that Huffman was an insider to be a finding of fact which was not shown to be clearly erroneous. Huffman argues that we should make an independent analysis of the finding and, regardless of the standard applied, find that there is insufficient evidence to establish his insider status on either of the subject notes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>We perceive the insider determination to be a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">According to the legislative history, an insider under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(25) is an entity or person with \u201ca sufficiently close relationship with the debtor that his conduct is made subject to closer scrutiny than those dealing at arms length with the debtor.\u201d S.Rep. No. 95-989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 5787, 5810. <em>See </em>Phillips, <em>Insider Provisions of the New Bankruptcy Code, </em>55 Am.Bank L.J. 363 (1981). If the debtor is a corporation, its insiders may include any officer, director, controlling person, partnership in which the debtor is a general partner, general partner of the debtor, or relative of a general partner, director, officer, or controlling person. \u00a7 101(25)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Use of the word \u201cincludes\u201d in \u00a7 101(25) evidences Congress\u2019 expansive view of the scope of the insider class, suggesting that the statutory definition is not limiting and must be flexibly applied on a case-by-case basis.

King, Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 101.00[2]; Note, The Term \u201cInsider,\u201d 57 Notre Dame Law. at 733 n. 52. As explained in the Senate Report, the phrase \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d envisions \u201csituations in which there is an opportunity to control, and where the existence of that opportunity operates as an indirect control.\u201d S.Rep. No. 95-989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 5807.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-20\">After finding that West Texas\u2019 assignment of the $88,860 note was an insider transaction, the bankruptcy court held that West Texas Homes, a corporation 20 per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>cent or more of whose outstanding voting securities were owned by Wall, was an affiliate within the intendment of \u00a7 101(2)(B). Having determined that Wall was an alter ego<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the debtor, the bankruptcy court concluded that MBFA could thus be deemed to own or control 50 percent of West Texas Homes\u2019 stock. Huffman does not challenge the legal identification of Wall with the debtor for purposes of this action, but assigns error in the judge\u2019s reference to evidence offered in other proceedings and at other times in this reorganization case in arriving at the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">A court may take judicial notice of the record in prior related proceedings, and draw reasonable inferences therefrom. <em>See Kinnett Dairies, Inc. v. Farrow, </em>580 F.2d 1260 (5th Cir.1978); <em>State of Florida Board of Trustees v. Charley Toppino &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>514 F.2d 700 (5th Cir.1975). Here, the bankruptcy court referred to the record developed in the same case, albeit in different proceedings. Although we intend no blanket approval of this action, we cannot gainsay the bankruptcy court\u2019s \u201cright to take notice of its own files and records and [the absence of] any duty [on its part] to grind the same corn a second time.\u201d <em>Aloe Creme Labs. v. Francine Co., </em>425 F.2d 1295, 1296 (5th Cir.1970). Both parties were aware that the principal issue was whether Wall\u2019s predetermined role as an insider of the debtor could be imputed to Huffman. The case was thus presented. Huffman had ample opportunity to submit evidence on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">We are persuaded that as to the $88,860 note, Huffman was an insider of an affiliate within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(2). By definition, an insider of an affiliate is an insider of the debtor under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(25)(E). In light of the interrelationship of all transactions, this finding of Huffman\u2019s insider status with respect to the $88,860 note is dispositive as to the $74,007 note, inasmuch as the components of Huffman\u2019s claim are not sufficiently discrete to warrant separate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">\n<em>Equitable Subordination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">Upon finding that Huffman played an insider\u2019s role in the pertinent transactions with the debtor, the bankruptcy court subordinated his $119,005 claim pursuant to \u00a7 510(c), assigning no specific reasons therefor. Huffman asserts that the trustee failed to establish an adequate evidentiary basis for equitable subordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">Section 510(c)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> permits the bankruptcy court, in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction, to apply pre-Code principles of equitable subordination. 3 Collier on Bankrupt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>cy \u00b6510.04 The courts have recognized three general categories of conduct considered sufficient to warrant equitable subordination: (1) fraud, illegality, breach of fiduciary duties; (2) undercapitalization; and (3) claimant\u2019s use of the debtor as a mere instrumentality or alter ego. <em>See </em>Cohn, Subordinated Claims: Their Classification and Voting Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 56 Am.Bank.L.J. 295 (1982); Note, Deep Rock in the Deep South \u2014 Equitable Subordination of Claims in Fifth Circuit Bankruptcy Proceedings, 11 Cumb.L.Rev. 619 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">We adopted a triad test for the equitable subordination of claims in bankruptcy in <em>Matter of Mobile Steel Co.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">(i) The claimant must have engaged in some type of inequitable conduct,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">(ii) The misconduct must have resulted in injury to the creditors of the bankrupt or conferred an unfair advantage on the claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">(iii) Equitable subordination of the claim must not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy [Code].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avx\">563 F.2d at 700 (citations omitted). <em>Accord, Matter of Multiponics, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">A claim filed pursuant to \u00a7 501 enjoys prima facie validity which may be overcome by the trustee\u2019s presentation of evidence. A claim arising out of dealings between a debtor and its fiduciaries is to be rigorously scrutinized by the courts, <em>Matter of Multiponics; Matter of Mobile Steel Co., </em>but mere proof of a fiduciary relationship is insufficient to invalidate a transaction. To sustain an objection, the trustee must overcome the presumption of validity which attaches to all properly filed claims. Upon the trustee\u2019s submission of sufficient evidence to overcome the prima facie showing, the claimant is obliged to prove his good faith and fairness in the dealings. It is at this juncture that the fiduciary\u2019s claim is subject to the probing light of judicial inquiry. We observed in <em>Multiponics </em>that \u201c[t]his proof allocation provides a proper balance of burdens, assuring that the trustee does not underprove his objections while, at the same time, assuring that the fiduciary need not overprove his good faith and fairness at the mere cry of inequity by the trustee.\u201d 622 F.2d at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">Notwithstanding the bankruptcy judge\u2019s failure to assign reasons, the district court discerned sufficient findings of fact corresponding to each of Mobile\u2019s three components to justify the order of subordination. Specifically, the district court stated that the following findings by the bankruptcy judge were supported by the evidence and fulfilled the requirements of our articulation of the equitable subordination doctrine: (1) Huffman and Wall engaged in inequitable conduct in 1977 in the context of MBFA\u2019s acquisition of the Dumas and Crestview Homes and West Texas Homes\u2019 contractual rights therein; (2) these transactions conferred an unfair advantage on both Huffman and Wall; and (3) the subordination of Huffman\u2019s claim was consistent with the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">These findings, though perhaps inherent in the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling, were not enunciated. Though we agree that Huffman\u2019s insider connection with the debtor compels close examination of his claim, we cannot conclude, in the absence of explicit findings by the bankruptcy court on each element of the <em>Mobile </em>test, that the trustee has discharged his burden of proof thereunder. Whether or not Huffman\u2019s insider status,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> coupled with his receipt of the fruits of Wall\u2019s manipulations, is tantamount to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>unfairness, bad faith or unconscionable wielding of control for personal gain envisioned by <em>Mobile </em>and <em>Multiponics </em>is problematical, in light of our holding that \u201can objection on equitable grounds cannot be merely formal, but rather must contain some substantial factual basis to support its allegation of impropriety.\u201d <em>Matter of Mobile Steel Co., </em>563 F.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Under the totality of the circumstances of this case, therefore, we are persuaded that a remand to the bankruptcy court for entry of the findings required for application of this circuit\u2019s equitable subordination test is necessary. On remand, the bankruptcy court should set forth its relevant findings and conclusions under each element of the test we impressed in <em>Matter of Mobile Steel Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\">. The record reflects that four MBFA subsidiaries, all known as Associated Memorial Homes, were involved in the relevant transactions with Huffman, Wall, the Wall and Huffman partnership, and West Texas Homes. It is not clear which of the four, Associated Memorial Homes of West Texas, Inc., Associated Memorial Homes of Central Texas, Inc., Associated Memorial Homes of Lubbock, Inc., and Associated Memorial Homes of Greenbelt, Inc. became indebted to Huffman. To facilitate discussion we shall simply refer to the obligor on the Huffman promissory notes as \u201cMBFA\u201d or \u201cthe debtor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-5\">. The bankruptcy judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7j\">The divers proceedings to date in this Chapter 11 case have demonstrated time and again that Wall met practically every test that could be devised for the existence of \u201cinsider\u201d status. He manipulated and controlled the parent corporation and the subsidiaries. He dealt with those entities as his <em>alter ego. </em>He transferred monies and assets between the entities with impunity. Although the nonprofit debtor corporation had no voting securities, Wall controlled the corporate activities with an iron hand. In summary, Wall was an \u201cinsider.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYe\">\u2666 <em>Us </em>sje * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASju\">Wall\u2019s dealings with his puppet corporation, MBFA, were exemplified by the transactions which gave rise to the instant litigation when he caused his personal real estate, the partnership real estate, and the management contracts of the corporation, West Texas Home Health Care, Inc., to be transferred and assigned to MBFA for amounts in excess of $325,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7y\">From these findings, it reasonably can be inferred that Wall breached his fiduciary duty to the debtor and its various subsidiaries by collectively utilizing the corporate entities as a conduit for the funneling of monies and assets for his own personal gain. <em>See Matter of Multiponics, Inc. See also </em>Cowan on Bankruptcy \u00a7 16.7 (1983 Interim Supp.).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AFJ\">.

Unless there is a finding of inequitable conduct beyond the mere relationship between the claimant and the insolvent debtor, subordination cannot stand nor will it be authorized.\u201d 3 Collier on Bankruptcy, \u00b6510.04 at 510.14-15 (footnote omitted). One court has required a showing not only of a fiduciary\u2019s ability and intent to control the debtor, but the actual exertion of such control to the detriment of other creditors, before that fiduciary\u2019s legitimate claim may be subordinated. <em>In re Branding Iron Steak House, </em>536 F.2d 299 (9th Cir.1976) (applying the Bankruptcy Act of 1898).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
