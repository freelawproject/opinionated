Appellee asserts entitlement to absolute immunity from civil liability arising from his testimony. This court rejected that claim. Thereafter the Supreme Court decided <em>Briscoe v. </em>LaHue<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we granted rehearing to reconsider the issue in light of that decision. Upon such reconsideration, we are compelled to the conclusion that <em>Briscoe </em>entitles appellee to absolute immunity as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-21\">The factual background and procedural history in this case have been fully detailed in our earlier opinions, <em>Briggs v. Goodwin, </em>698 F.2d 486 (D.C.Cir.1983) <em>(\u201cBriggs </em>II\u201d); <em>Briggs v. Goodwin, </em>569 F.2d 10 (D.C.Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>437 U.S. 904, 98 S.Ct. 3089, 57 L.Ed.2d 1133 (1978) <em>(\u201cBriggs </em>I\u201d); only a brief review is required here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-22\">The case arises out of a grand jury proceeding in which several grand jury witnesses, including appellant Briggs, were represented by the same counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response to rumors that some of the grand jury witnesses were government informants, the witnesses filed a motion in district court to compel the government to disclose whether any government informants were among the witnesses represented by group counsel. At the hearing on the motion, appellee Goodwin, who was the prosecutor in charge of the grand jury investigation, took the stand and was asked under oath whether any of the witnesses represented by group counsel were government informants. Goodwin answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Appellant Briggs alleges that Goodwin\u2019s response was false, that Goodwin knew it to be false, and that the allegedly false statement caused Briggs to share defense strategy with an informant, who passed it back into the hands of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>Briggs sued Goodwin, <em>inter alia, </em>for damages arising out of violation of Briggs\u2019s sixth amendment rights. Goodwin asserted absolute immunity on two grounds: 1) as a prosecutor, and 2) as a witness. The district court refused to dismiss the case on either ground, but agreed to certify the question of prosecutorial immunity for interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-4\">In a 2-1 decision, this court rejected Goodwin\u2019s prosecutorial immunity claim. <em>Briggs I, </em>569 F.2d 10 (D.C.Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>437 U.S. 904, 98 S.Ct. 3089, 57 L.Ed.2d 1133 (1978). Applying the \u201cfunctional\u201d test outlined in <em>Imbler v. Pachtman,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court found that at the time of the statement Goodwin was operating in his investigatory role.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In that capacity, he was not entitled to the absolute immunity conferred on prosecutors acting as advocates, but only to the qualified immunity provided for police and other government officials acting as investigators.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1522-5\">For a variety of reasons,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Briggs I </em>also reached the question of witness immunity, despite the district court\u2019s refusal to certify the issue for interlocutory appeal<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the failure of the parties to brief it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On this issue, the <em>Briggs I </em>panel held that Goodwin\u2019s statement was not the testimonial act of a witness in the traditional sense, and that the protection of absolute witness immunity should not apply.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The majority went on at some length to explain that even if Goodwin had been a witness, common law witness immunity might not protect government officials whose perjured testimony infringed constitutional rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The case was remanded for the district court to determine Goodwin\u2019s entitlement to a qualified immunity based upon good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-18\">On remand, the district court granted summary judgment for Goodwin.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the instant appeal, we reversed on the ground that factual issues remain in dispute. <em>Briggs II, </em>698 F.2d 486 (D.C.Cir.1983). Thereafter, the Supreme Court decided <em>Briscoe; </em>we thereupon ordered supplemental briefing and granted rehearing to reconsider the issue of witness immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-19\">\n<em>Briscoe v. LaHue.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-20\"><em>Briscoe </em>involved a civil suit for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against a police officer who allegedly gave perjured testimony that led to the plaintiff\u2019s criminal conviction. All parties to the suit agreed that the common law affords lay witnesses absolute immunity from civil suits based on their testimony.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The case presented the issue of whether the same immunity applies to police and other government witnesses testifying in their official capacity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>Absolute witness immunity is traditionally justified as a response to two concerns: 1) intimidation, and 2) self-censorship. Without the protection of immunity, witnesses with important information may be dissuaded from coming forward to testify because of the potential for civil liability arising out of their participation in a judicial proceeding.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Even after taking the stand, witnesses may be inhibited by the risk of liability from speaking freely for fear of making honest errors that might subject them to suit.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Absolute immunity has therefore been justified in order that \u201cthose involved in judicial proceedings be \u2018given every encouragement to make a full disclosure of all pertinent information within their knowledge.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1523-5\">The plaintiffs in <em>Briscoe, </em>and the dissenting opinions,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> offered several reasons why these concerns apply with less force to government witnesses such as police officers than to lay witnesses. First, police officers have a professional interest in obtaining prosecutions that is likely to counterbalance their hesitation to testify. Second, the financial burden of defending a civil suit is less of a concern for police officers, whose defense in suits alleging constitutional violations in the performance of their jobs is ordinarily undertaken by the government. In such suits generally, police officers are entitled to qualified, not absolute, immunity. Third, \u201cperjured testimony by police officers is likely to be more damaging to constitutional rights than such testimony by ordinary citizens, because the policeman in uniform carries special credibility in the eyes of the jurors.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For this reason, cross-examination may be less effective in discrediting the perjured testimony of police officers than that of lay witnesses. Finally, the need for close cooperation between prosecutors and police officers reduces the likelihood of prosecutions for perjury, thereby undermining the sanction on which the law relies to compel immunized witnesses to speak the truth.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1523-15\"><em>Briscoe </em>explicitly considered these concerns and found that they did not justify excluding official witnesses from the protection of absolute witness immunity.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Court said that the police officer functions like \u201cany other witness.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, the Court added, without absolute immunity, the potential for litigation against official witnesses \u201cmight undermine not only their contribution to the judicial process but also the effective performance of their other public duties.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, the Court held that the public interest in \u201cprotecting the judicial process,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> which had justified affording judges, prosecutors and lay witnesses the protection of absolute immunity, also justified granting that protection to police officers when they take the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1524-4\">In <em>Briggs I, </em>this court denied Goodwin witness immunity because his testimonial act differed from that of a witness in the usual sense. The court found that Goodwin\u2019s brief statement on the stand \u201cwas prompted by, and directly incidental to\u201d his involvement in managing and administering an investigation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u201cTo the extent that [Goodwin\u2019s] one word answer is viewed as a testimonial act, it was one occasioned by, and critical to, appellant\u2019s discharge of that responsibility.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1524-5\">We find it difficult to distinguish Goodwin\u2019s testimonial act from those of police officers in situations falling within the rationale of <em>Briscoe. </em>Testimony by a police officer will very often involve challenges to his conduct while performing investigatory tasks. A police officer who has been integrally involved in an investigation that culminates in a criminal prosecution has a clear interest in the outcome of the trial. In such a situation, the police officer has professional and personal interests in his testimony that are closely analogous to Goodwin\u2019s interest in the testimony out of which this suit arises. <em>Briggs I </em>explicitly found Goodwin to be operating not as a prosecutor but as an investigator.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We decided that in that role his immunity should resemble that of a police officer involved in an investigation. <em>Briscoe </em>informs us that that immunity is absolute for statements made on a witness stand. <em>Briscoe </em>therefore compels the conclusion that when Goodwin made his sworn statement from the witness stand,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> he enjoyed absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1524-13\">The fact that <em>Briscoe </em>involved statements at a trial whereas this case involves statements at a hearing on a motion during the grand jury phase of an investigation is not a distinction that allows a different result. <em>Briscoe </em>emphasized the concern that the absence of immunity would interfere with the ability of \u201cjudicial proceedings\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> \u201cto determine where the truth lies.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> That concern applies not only to trials, but to any judicial proceeding where the testimony of witnesses might be affect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1449\">*1449</page-number>ed by the lack of immunity.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Thus, the rationale of <em>Briscoe </em>applies with equal force whenever a witness testifies in a judicial proceeding the function of which is to ascertain factual information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-5\">In addition to causing reconsideration of Goodwin\u2019s witness status, <em>Briscoe </em>rejected the reasons offered in <em>Briggs I </em>for why absolute witness immunity might not apply to government officers in suits alleging constitutional violations <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Briggs I </em>explicitly noted that \u201c[pjolicy considerations counsel-ling the insulation of <em>private citizens </em>from civil liability arising from their performance as witnesses do not apply with equal force when a complaint charges that constitutional rights have been violated by a <em>public employee </em>operating from the witness stand .... The unique importance of constitutional rights hardly needs restatement .... [Ijt can be asserted with both reason and authority that absolute immunity is not to be extended to the constitutional tort context absent the most compelling justification.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Supreme Court apparently found that neither the public employee status of the witness, nor the constitutional character of the alleged violation constituted such a compelling .justification.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1525-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-13\">In granting absolute immunity to public officials acting as witnesses, the Supreme Court recognized that \u201cthe alternative of limiting the official\u2019s immunity would dis-serve the broader public interest.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> \u201cIn this instance it has been thought in the end better to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject those who try to do their duty to the constant dread of retaliation.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> As a lower court, we are bound by the balance struck.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We therefore vacate our prior opinion and affirm the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment for Goodwin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-14\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1521-17\">. -U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 1108, 75 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1521-23\">.

Fuller briefing on this issue indicates that the fact of Goodwin\u2019s oath was indeed significant to the credibility given his statement by those who relied on it. The full transcript makes clear that Goodwin offered to make an unsworn representation in response to the court\u2019s inquiry, but witnesses\u2019 counsel insisted that such a representation was \u201cnot competent proof in any court of law and that under these circumstances Mr. Goodwin ought to submit an affidavit <em>under oath </em>.... \u201d (July 13, Tr. pp. 64-65, Joint Appendix (J.A.) 62930). It was in response to this objection that the court ordered Goodwin to take the stand, be sworn and testify. Moreover, testimony at appellant\u2019s criminal trial, and depositions and interrogatories suggest the importance of the fact that Goodwin\u2019s statement was under oath. <em>See, e.g., </em>Answer of Jack Jennings to Goodwin\u2019s Interrogatory No. 11, J.A. 530; Answer of Scott Camil to Goodwin\u2019s Interrogatory No. 11, J.A. 519; Answer of John Briggs to Goodwin\u2019s Interrogatory No. 11, J.A. 517; Deposition of Peter P.

While upholding appellee\u2019s absolute immunity claim, we note our deep concern. The allegations in this case painfully illustrate the significant costs of this holding \u2014 not only to the appellant, but to the integrity of our criminal justice system as well. As the state\u2019s lawyer and an officer of the court, a prosecutor has a special obligation to discharge his duties lawfully and fairly. In this case, appellant claims that a prosecutor perjured himself from the witness stand during a criminal investigation. Our response to appellant\u2019s claim is that a civil damages action, whatever its merits, may not be pursued against the prosecutor. Instead, appellant must rely on the possibility of a prosecution of the prosecutor by his fellow prosecutors. We find it troubling that our system of justice, which rests so fundamentally on the consent of the governed, offers such inadequate remedies for official violations of individuals\u2019 constitutional rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1525-15\">MacKINNON, Senior Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A5f\">(concurring in the judgment):</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-16\">I am not in disagreement with much of the analysis and statements in Judge Bazelon\u2019s present opinion, but I believe some of the facts are more favorable to Goodwin than the opinion recognizes, and I prefer to make several comments and rest my concurrence in the result on the following grounds. First, I continue to adhere to the views expressed in my dissent from the panel\u2019s original decision in <em>Briggs v. Good</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1450\">*1450</page-number><em>win II, </em>698 F.2d 486, 497-98 (D.C.Cir.1983). Second, it is my view that Goodwin has a valid factual defense in that he had given orders that government informants be excluded from the class of potential defendants represented by defense counsel and was justified in assuming that his orders had been carried out. Third, in addition to my opinion that Goodwin enjoys immunity as a witness, I am also of the opinion that he possesses complete immunity as a prosecutor, since I generally agree with the opinions expressed in Judge Wilkey\u2019s dissent in <em>Briggs v. Goodwin I, </em>569 F.2d 10, 29-61 (D.C.Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>437 U.S. 904, 98 S.Ct. 3089, 57 L.Ed.2d 1133 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1526-4\">I must also voice my disagreement with the view expressed in footnote 36 of the majority opinion. That view fails to acknowledge a basic principle of law that has been recognized as fundamental to American jurisprudence for over a hundred years: that those who participate in public litigation and who perform certain governmental functions are not to be subjected thereby to harassing civil litigation. This principle has been consistently applied to judges, prosecutors, legislators and presidents, as well as to witnesses. The law of immunity and its compelling justifications have been expounded by some of the greatest jurists in our nation\u2019s history. <em>See, e.g., Bradley v. Fisher, </em>13 Wall. (80 U.S.) 337, 351, 20 L.Ed. 646 (1872) (Field, J.) (\u201c[J]udges ... are not liable to civil actions for their judicial acts, even when such acts are in excess of their jurisdiction, and are alleged to have been done maliciously or corruptly.\u201d); <em>Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 554, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 1217, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967) (Warren, C.J.) (\u201cThis immunity \u2018is not for the protection or benefit of a malicious or corrupt judge, but for the benefit of the public, whose interest it is that judges should be at liberty to exercise their functions with independence and without fear of consequences.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Scott v. Stansfield, </em>L.R. 3 Ex. 220, 223 (1868)); <em>Barr v. Matteo, </em>360 U.S. 564, 572-73, 79 S.Ct. 1335, 1340, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434 (1959) (Harlan, J.) (\u201cThe privilege is not a badge or emolument of exalted office, but an expression of a policy designed to aid in the effective functioning of government.\u201d); <em>Gregoire v. Biddle, </em>177 F.2d 579, 581 (2d Cir.1949), <em>cert. denied, </em>339 U.S. 949, 70 S.Ct. 803, 94 L.Ed. 1363 (1950) (L. Hand, J.) (\u201cThe justification for ... [denying recovery] is that it is impossible to know whether the claim is well founded until the case has been tried, and to submit all officials, the innocent as well as the guilty, to the burden of trial and the danger of its outcome would dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute ....\u201d) (quoted in <em>Nixon v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 731, 752, 102 S.Ct. 2690, 2703 n. 32, 73 L.Ed.2d 349 (1982)). My final objection to the personal comments in footnote 36 is that they are extrajudicial and serve no worthwhile purpose, as the Supreme Court has spoken.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
