Brennan, </em>417 U.S. 188, 190, 195, 208, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 2228, 2234, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Goodrich alleged that she performs the same work as a number of male IBEW employees, but is paid substantially less.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-4\">The IBEW sought summary judgment on two grounds. First, it asserted that Goodrich and the male employees in question did not perform \u201cequal work.\u201d Second, it relied on the Act\u2019s awkwardly-phrased fourth affirmative defense: the wage disparity at issue, the IBEW urged, was \u201cbased on any other factor other than sex.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(l)(iv) (1976). The district court found that genuine issues of material fact precluded summary adjudication of the \u201cunequal work\u201d defense, but held that the IBEW was entitled to judgment, as a matter of law, on its \u201cother factor other than sex\u201d plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-10\">Our review indicates that the district court applied the Act\u2019s residuary affirmative defense incautiously and disposed of the case precipitously. As explained by the IBEW, both the unequal work plea and the residuary defense ultimately rested on the same contentions \u2014 that the men with whom Goodrich compared herself were on call to perform additional duties and had special expertise augmenting the value of their services to the union. The district court correctly ruled that the IBEW\u2019s \u201cadditional duties\u201d and \u201cspecial expertise\u201d contentions entailed disputed matters of fact relevant to a determination whether Goodrich and her male co-workers were engaged in equal work. When the same contentions reappeared in explanation of the IBEW\u2019s \u201cother factor other than sex defense,\u201d however, the district court viewed them differently and granted summary judgment. We conclude that the \u201cadditional duties\u201d and \u201cspecial expertise\u201d contentions present triable issues. We therefore reverse the judgment entered summarily for the IBEW, and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-4\">Bernice Goodrich has been employed at the IBEW\u2019s headquarters in Washington, D.C. since 1952; she is not, however, a union member. In 1961, she began work at her present position as an \u201cagreement analyst\u201d in the agreement approval department. The primary function of the department is to review labor agreements that local unions submit to the International President for his approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-5\">' The department is headed by a director, who is male, and has a professional staff of six employees, five males and Goodrich. Of the six staff members, only Goodrich is classified as an agreement analyst. The five male employees hold the position of either \u201cInternational Representative\u201d or \u201cSenior International Representative.\u201d The two \u201cInternational Representative\u201d classifications carry a large financial advantage. Although Goodrich has considerably more experience in reviewing labor agreements than any of her male colleagues,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> she receives substantially less pay.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1567-6\">International Representative status at the IBEW\u2019s headquarters is entirely dependent upon active membership in the union. All professional employees at the union\u2019s headquarters who have been active members of an IBEW local hold the International Representative title. And only active union members, pursuant to the IBEW \u201cmembership rule,\u201d are eligible for designation as International Representatives. The agreement approval department is one among many areas of the union\u2019s professional operations in which International Representatives work. Regardless of the particular jobs they hold, International Representatives receive a uniform annual salary based on their seniority in the union. These salaries are generally much higher than those paid to professional employees who are not union members. Thus, despite Goodrich's extensive experience in the agreement analysis department, she is paid less than her male co-workers because she has never been a union member and is therefore ineligible to be an International Representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-10\">In December 1981, Goodrich commenced this action claiming that the disparity between her pay and that of her male co-workers violated the Equal Pay Act. To establish a prima facie case under the Act, a plaintiff must show that an employer pays different wages to employees of opposite sexes \u201cfor equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(1) (1976); see <em>Corning Glass Works v. </em>Brennan, 417 U.S. 188, 195, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 2228, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974) (legislative history clarifies that plaintiff must make these threshold showings). Once a plaintiff has carried this initial burden, a defendant may escape liability either by refuting any part of the prima facie case, or by pleading and proving one of the Act\u2019s four affirmative defenses. These defenses permit payment of different wages if \u201cmade pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>any other factor other than sex.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(1) (1976).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1568-4\">In her complaint, Goodrich alleged the necessary elements of a prima facie violation of the Act. The parties then stipulated, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) the work performed by Goodrich is equal to the work of the five male International Representatives \u201cat such times as such Representatives are assigned to and physically performing work in the Agreement Approval Department\u201d; (2) the IBEW has always required active union membership as a prerequisite to International Representative status; and (3) the \u201cmembership rule\u201d has been applied equally and without exception to male and female IBEW employees. Record Excerpts (R.E.) Mr-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-5\">The IBEW initially challenged Goodrich\u2019s prima facie case by arguing that the work she performed was not equal, within the meaning of the Act, to the work International Representatives performed. The Equal Pay Act standard is neither \u201ccomparable\u201d work nor \u201cidentical\u201d work. Instead, the test under the Act is \u201csubstantial equality\u201d \u2014 whether the jobs in question are substantially related and substantially similar in skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions. <em>See Thompson v. Sawyer, </em>678 F.2d 257, 274 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>567 F.2d 429, 449 (D.C.Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1086, 98 S.Ct. 1281, 55 L.Ed.2d 792 (1978). According to the IBEW, the work in this case was unequal for two reasons: International Representatives perform additional duties beyond those required for the particular jobs they currently hold, and they have special expertise relevant to their duties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Goodrich contested these claims; she asserted that the additional work was trivial, frequently nothing more than attending social functions, and that the alleged special expertise had no relationship to the work performed at headquarters.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court concluded that the parties\u2019 conflicting allegations concerning the \u201csubstantial equality\u201d of the work performed by Goodrich and males in the agreement approval department presented material issues of fact that were not appropriate for resolution by summary judgment. Memorandum Opinion (Mem. Op.) at 3, R.E. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-10\">As a second defense, the IBEW asserted that any wage disparity rested upon a bona fide factor other than sex \u2014 the fourth affirmative defense under the Act. The union identified its membership rule, which precludes Goodrich from becoming an International Representative, as the requisite neutral factor. Significantly, however, the IBEW did not assert that the additional pay International Representatives received was principally a bonus in recognition of important service rendered to locals in past years. Instead, the union claimed that the membership rule served to assure that Intema<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1493\">*1493</page-number>tional Representatives would have the special expertise required for the additional duties they perform. Goodrich repeated in this context what she had said in relation to the \u201cunequal work\u201d defense. She contended that the membership rule in fact does not serve the alleged purpose because special expertise in local union problems is not needed in the jobs her co-workers hold and the extra duties, to the extent they exist, are insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-4\">The district court believed the stipulation that the membership rule is applied equally to men and women doomed \u201cany attempt [by Goodrich] to draw [the IBEW\u2019s] affirmative defense into question.\u201d Mem. Op. at 4, R.E. 9. The IBEW, according to the district court, had \u201ccarefully and extensively explained its position that the union membership rule is a bona fide rule that serves a valuable business purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, R.E. 11. Despite Goodrich\u2019s argument that the expertise relevant to job performance and additional work claims lacked solid evidentiary support, so that the alleged \u201cvaluable business purpose\u201d had not been established as a matter of law, the district court remarked that Goodrich \u201cmade no attempt to rebut defendant\u2019s justification for the IBEW membership rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On this reasoning, the district court granted the IBEW\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-5\">II. Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-6\">In essence, the district court held that \u201cadditional duties\u201d and \u201cspecial expertise\u201d contentions can do double duty. If proved, they can defeat a claim that the employees in question are engaged in equal work. But they can serve as well to establish that a rule not framed in terms of sex, such as the IBEW membership rule, is bona fide. However, under the district court\u2019s view of this case, \u201cadditional duties\u201d and \u201cspecial expertise,\u201d when pressed into service in this latter fashion, can carry the day for the employer if the contentions are merely alleged; under the residuary, fourth affirmative defense, the contentions need not be proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-12\">We believe this view of the breadth of the residuary defense would substantially undermine the equal pay principle advanced by the Act. \u201cAdditional duties\u201d and \u201cspecial expertise\u201d contentions, we hold, do not establish that a rule or criterion is bona fide when those contentions merely restate \u201cunequal work\u201d assertions which involve genuine issues of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-13\">Case law, citing the Equal Pay Act\u2019s legislative history, establishes that the residuary affirmative defense applies only when \u201cpay differentials are based on a <em>bona fide </em>use of \u2018other factors other than sex.\u2019 \u201d <em>County of Washington v. Gunther, </em>452 U.S. 161, 170, 101 S.Ct. 2242, 2248, 68 L.Ed.2d 751 (1981) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The IBEW here relied on its \u201cadditional duties\u201d and \u201cspecial expertise\u201d explanation to justify as bona fide use of the membership rule to establish pay differentials that, in Goodrich\u2019s case and perhaps generally, separated women from men.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We do not determine whether a different rationale for the higher pay awarded International Representatives would have been subject to trial. <em>See supra </em>pp. 1492-1493. We hold only that when \u201cadditional duties\u201d and \u201cspecial expertise\u201d are the factors ultimately relied upon,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the residuary defense<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> will not serve to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>the trial that would be required to test whether the alleged extra duties and expertise exist and mark the work in question as unequal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1570-4\">In the further proceedings our remand requires, we caution the district court against overreading the parties\u2019 stipulation. That court commented: \u201cAlthough [Goodrich] may not have foreseen the legal effect of her stipulation, it forecloses [her] from contending that the IBEW membership requirement constitutes sex-based wage discrimination.\u201d Mem. Op. at 4-5, R.E. 10-11. Fairly construed, the stipulation simply acknowledged that the IBEW has consistently adhered to the membership rule, that the rule is longstanding, and that it bars males who lack union membership, as it bars females who are not union members, from achieving International Representative status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1570-5\">A concession as to the length of time a rule has remained in place and the employer\u2019s consistency in adhering to it is not a concession that the rule insulates the employer from Equal Pay Act liability. <em>See Thompson v. Sawyer, supra, </em>678 F.2d at 277 (\u201clongstanding\u201d binding industry practices are not bona fide factors other than sex because they constitute a \u201ccontinuing structure of sexual discrimination\u201d). Nor is a plaintiff barred from contesting the genuineness of the reasons an employer proffers for a rule (here, to provide compensation for additional duties and special expertise) because the rule itself does not invoke a sex criterion or because the plaintiff has not attempted to bring herself within the rule. <em>See Corning Glass Works </em>v. <em>Brennan, supra, </em>417 U.S. at 203-05, 209-10, 94 S.Ct. at 2232-33, 2235; <em>Thompson v. Sawyer, supra, </em>678 F.2d at 276-77, <em>aff\u2019g in relevant part Thompson v. Boyle, </em>499 F.Supp. 1147,1158\u2014 59, 1166 (D.D.C.1979).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1570-10\">Under the familiar standard leading us to remand this case, a party seeking summary judgment must demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that he or she is entitled to prevail as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In determining whether a genuine issue exists, the trial court must accord the party opposing the motion the benefit of all reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1495\">*1495</page-number>doubts, and construe matters presented in connection with the motion most favorably to the motion\u2019s opponent. <em>See, e.g., McSurely v. McClellan, </em>697 F.2d 309, 321 (D.C.Cir.1982) (per curiam); <em>Abraham v. Graphic Arts International Union, </em>660 F.2d 811, 814 (D.C.Cir.1981).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1571-4\">Viewing the record before us in the light most favorable to Goodrich, and bearing in mind that reasonable doubts must be resolved against the IBEW, we are persuaded that the union has not sustained its summary judgment burden. Goodrich has raised factual issues relevant to determining whether the IBEW has paid her less than it pays employees of the opposite sex engaged in substantially equal work. She has called into question the genuineness of the IBEW\u2019s claims that her male co-workers merit higher pay because, as International Representatives, they perform additional duties and have relevant special expertise. To defeat summary judgment for the union, Goodrich was required to do no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-6\">For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment from which this appeal has been taken and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1565-12\">. The Act, an amendment to \u00a7 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1565-13\">No employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex: <em>Provided, </em>That an employer who is paying a wage rate differential in violation of this subsection shall not, in order to comply with the provisions of this subsection, reduce the wage rate of any employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1566-6\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(1) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1566-7\">. Both the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2 (1976), provide remedies for sex discrimination in the workplace. While the Equal Pay Act addresses only wage disparities between employees performing \u201cequal work,\u201d the prohibitions of Title VII are much broader, making it unlawful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1566-8\">to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s ... sex ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2gT\">to limit, segregate, or classify ... employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual\u2019s ... sex....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1566-13\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l), (2). In contrast to Equal Pay Act cases, Title VII wage discrimination claims are not limited to situations involving \u201cequal work.\u201d <em>See County of Washington v. Gunther, </em>452 U.S. 161, 168, 101 S.Ct. 2242, 2247, 68 L.Ed.2d 751 (1981); <em>International Union of Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>631 F.2d 1094, 1099 (3d Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 967, 101 S.Ct. 3121, 3122, 69 L.Ed.2d 980 (1981). A plaintiff may be awarded monetary relief under both statutes provided that each is satisfied and the plaintiff does not recover for the same wrong under both provisions. <em>See Thompson v. Sawyer, </em>678 F.2d 257, 263 (D.C.Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-14\">In addition to the scope of their prohibitions, the two statutes differ in other respects that may influence a plaintiffs choice of remedy. For example, the Equal Pay Act, unlike Title VII, \u201chas no requirement of filing administrative complaints and awaiting administrative conciliation efforts.\u201d <em>County of Washington v. Gunther, supra, </em>452 U.S. at 175 n. 14, 101 S.Ct. at 2250 n. 14; <em>see Ososky v. Wick, </em>704 F.2d 1264, 1266 (D.C.Cir.1983) (district court does not have discretion to require exhaustion of administrative remedies in individual Equal Pay Act cases).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1567-7\">. At the time of this suit, Goodrich had approximately 21 years of experience in reviewing labor agreements (1961-1982). By contrast, no male International Representative in the department had more than eight years of experience in agreement analysis work: John Dalton (1974-1982); Richard Willaert (1977-1982); William Shank (1979-1982); Robert Damiani (1977-1980, 1982); and Stan Hubbard (1981-1982). Record Excerpts (R.E.) 26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1567-8\">. From 1979 to 1982, for example, Goodrich received annual salaries of $24,494 (1979), $26,-795 (1980), $30,030 (1981), and $31,189 (1982). R.E. 22. During that same period of time, the male International Representatives in the agreement approval department generally received much higher salaries: John Dalton\u2014 $44,000 (1979-1982); William Shank \u2014 $44,000 (1979-1982); Jack Joyce \u2014 $36,400 (1979-1980), $44,000 (1981-1982); Richard Willaert\u2014 $36,400 (September 1979-August 1981), $44,-000 (September 1981-1982); Robert Damiani\u2014 $36,400 (January 1979-May 1979), $44,000 (June 1979-1982); and Stan Hubbard \u2014 $24,700 (November 1981-1982). R.E. 21-22. Hubbard, the only male to earn less than Goodrich, did not begin work at the IBEW\u2019s headquarters until May 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1568-6\">. The \u201cBennett Amendment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(h) (1976), incorporates these four affirmative defenses into Title VII for sex-based wage discrimination claims. <em>See County of Washington v. Gunther, </em>452 U.S. 161, 168, 101 S.Ct. 2242, 2247, 68 L.Ed.2d 751 (1981). Thus, a wage differential does not violate Title VII if it fits within one of the Equal Pay Act defenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1568-7\">. The IBEW asserted that International Representatives have no written job description and may be assigned to different union positions at different times during their tenure. <em>See </em>R.E. 30-31, 39, 52. International Representatives, including those assigned to the agreement approval department, the IBEW added, are on call \u201con any day of the week, at any time of the day,\u201d to perform duties above and beyond those required for their particular position. R.E. 41; see R.E. 31, 33, 40, 44.

Goodrich questioned whether International Representatives in the agreement approval department really do perform additional duties or have any special expertise. For example, in support of its claim of additional duties, the union had pointed out that, unlike Goodrich, International Representatives assigned to the agreement approval department are required to attend the annual IBEW construction conference and the annual AFL-CIO legislative conference. Goodrich, however, claimed that International Representatives attending such conferences \u201cperform no work there at all.\u201d Rather, they receive time off from their agreement analysis work to attend, while Goodrich must remain at IBEW headquarters and continue to work.

Whitin Machine Works, Inc., </em>635 F.2d 1095, 1098 (4th Cir.1980); <em>Brennan v. Owensboro-Daviess County Hosp., </em>523 F.2d 1013, 1031 (6th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 973, 96 S.Ct. 2170, 48 L.Ed.2d 796 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1570-7\">. The rule that an employee need not have Title VII-type standing to attack an employer\u2019s purportedly gender-neutral pay criterion has not been the subject of much judicial discussion. Nevertheless, we find the point implicit in Equal Pay Act precedent that guides our decision. In <em>Coming Glass Works v. Brennan, </em>for example, Coming, from 1944 to 1966, paid male night-shift inspectors more than it paid female dayshift inspectors; the pay differential was inaugurated at a time when state law prohibited women from working at night. The Supreme Court found that the night and day inspectors were engaged in \u201cequal work,\u201d and rejected Coming\u2019s affirmative defense that the shift differential was a \u201cfactor other than sex\u201d justifying the disparate wages. 417 U.S. at 203-05, 94 S.Ct. at 2232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1570-8\">In 1966, Coming opened the night shift to female employees, but retained the higher wage for night inspectors. <em>Id. </em>at 205, 94 S.Ct. at 2233. Some female inspectors applied for the higher-paying night positions (not all were accepted), but many did not even apply. <em>See Hodgson v. Corning Glass Works, </em>474 F.2d 226, 230 (2d Cir.1973), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, 417 </em>U.S. 188, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974); <em>Brennan v. Corning Glass Works, </em>480 F.2d 1254, 1257 (3d Cir.1973), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>417 U.S. 188, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974). Thus, while some women enjoyed the higher night salary after 1966, all of the day inspectors remained at the lower salary level. The Court held that this post-1966 disparity between night and day wages perpetuated the 1944-1966 wage differential made illegal by the Equal Pay Act, and therefore affirmed the lower court decision awarding back pay to female day inspectors from 1966 to the time of suit. 417 U.S. at 209-10, 94 S.Ct. at 2235.</p>\n<p id=\"b1570-12\">None of the female day-shift inspectors who failed to apply for the night-shift positions had Title VII-type standing to challenge women\u2019s limited access to night shift work. Yet they prevailed on their Equal Pay claim even though they, like Goodrich, had not sought entry into the higher-paying job classification. And in <em>Thompson v. Sawyer, </em>female bindery workers successfully argued that a four-year apprenticeship program was not a bona fide \u201cfactor other than sex\u201d; successful plaintiffs included women who had not applied for admission into the program or higher-paying job classification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1571-9\">. These principles apply with equal force at the appellate level. Like the district court, we read the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. <em>See Poller v.
