On an assessment of damages, after the dissolution of an injunction, the dismissal of the bill and dissolution of the injunction are conclusive evidence that the writ was wrongfully sued out. Where the defendant was enjoined'from taking possession of lumber claimed by him, for about three weeks, the damages recoverable are only such as will cover his injury by the delay caused and the expense necessarily incurred in procuring the dissolution of the injunction.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-6\" pgmap=\"187\">2. The sureties in the injunction bond are not liable for wrongs suffered by the defendant, during the time the injunction was in force, by unlawful acts of the complainant, other than the improvident act of suing out the writ. They are not liable for the tortious acts of the complainant in taking and converting the property during the pendency of the injunction.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b187-7\" pgmap=\"187\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Saline county; the Hon.

The testimony stands uncontradicted that this sum has 'been piaid in consequence of the wrongful suing out of the writ of injunction, and yet the court refused to allow any damages on that account, and only allowed the sum of $500 attorney\u2019s fee in the case.</p><attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-10\" pgmap=\"187\">Mr. Andrew D.

It was also charged in the bill that the location of the lumber in question was such that the same could easily be removed with boats and barges before the aid of the law could be invoked, and stating that appellants were residents of Massachusetts, and that their agent, Gravett, was of doubtful solvency. The prayer of the bill was for an injunction restraining appellants, their agents, servants, etc., from removing or in any manner intermeddling with said 500,000 feet of lumber, and for other relief. This bill was verified by the oath of appellee. On application to the judge of the circuit court on the same day, an order for the issue of the writ of injunction was made upon the execution of a bond, and on the same day the bond with sureties was given and the writ issued.</p> <p id=\"b189-4\" pgmap=\"189\">On the 24th of February, 1874, on motion of appellants, the injunction was dissolved by order of the circuit court made at chambers.</p> <p id=\"b189-5\" pgmap=\"189\">Thereupon appellants filed their suggestion of damages and presented testimony to prove the same, and moved the court for an allowance of the same.</p> <p id=\"b189-6\" pgmap=\"189\">This claim for damages embraced\u2014</p> <blockquote id=\"b189-7\" pgmap=\"189\">Alleged value of 200,000 ft. of lumber, - - $8400</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b189-8\" pgmap=\"189\">Wages of agent, ------ 153</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b189-9\" pgmap=\"189\">Wages of watchman, ----- 25</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b189-10\" pgmap=\"189\">Cost of telegrams, ----- 60</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b189-11\" pgmap=\"189\">Traveling expenses, ------ 49</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b189-12\" pgmap=\"189\">\u201c \u201c ..... 18</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b189-13\" pgmap=\"189\">Interest on value of lumber, - - - - 70</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b189-14\" pgmap=\"189\">Attorney\u2019s fees, ------ 1000</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b189-15\" pgmap=\"189\">Total, -------- $9721</blockquote> <p id=\"b189-16\" pgmap=\"189\">On the 26th of May, 1874, complainant, in open court, by leave of court, dismissed his bill without prejudice and at his costs, but the court retained the case for the assessment of appellants\u2019 damages.</p> <p id=\"b189-17\" pgmap=\"189\">On June 4, 1874, after the bill was dismissed, appellants filed an answer.</p> <p id=\"b189-18\" pgmap=\"189\">On June 14, 1874, on application of appellants, the venue was changed to Saline county.</p> <p id=\"b189-19\" pgmap=\"189(89) 190(33)\">In their answer appellants aver, that of the lumber so on the bank of the river when the bill was filed, some 150,000 to 200,000 feet was the property of appellants, worth from $6000 to $8000\u2014and say that Mugge was and is of doubtful solvency, \u2014and that on the 28th of January, 1874, Mugge having taken possession of appellants\u2019 lumber, they sued out a writ of replevin for said lumber, and placed the same in the hands of the sheriff to execute, and that the sheriff on that day took possession of said lumber, and afterwards and on the 30th of January, 1874, while the lumber was so in the possession of the sheriff, the injunction in this case was issued.</p> <p id=\"b190-6\" pgmap=\"190\">The answer further says, that since the issuing of the writ of injunction, the appellee has taken possession of said lumber and removed it out of this State, and to parts unknown.</p> <p id=\"b190-7\" pgmap=\"190\">On the suggestion of damages, proofs were taken and such proceedings had, from time to time, that at the May term, 1876, the matter was heard by the circuit court of Saline county, and appellants\u2019damages assessed at the sum of $500, and judgment was entered against the appellee for such damages and for costs.</p> <p id=\"b190-8\" pgmap=\"190\">Appellants bring the record here, and seek a reversal of this judgment upon the ground that the damages are not so large as they'had a lawful right to have assessed.</p> <p id=\"b190-9\" pgmap=\"190\">Appellants, by their counsel, claim that the proofs taken show that the lumber in question was their property, and that while they were restrained by the injunction from meddling with the same, appellee wrongfully took and disposed of the same to his own use, and that the necessary expense of collecting and presenting this proof upon the assessmept of damages was large; and counsel insist that appellants were entitled by law to have the value of the lumber and these expenses included in the assessment of damages.</p> <p id=\"b190-10\" pgmap=\"190(122) 191(57)\">This position can not be sustained. The service of the writ of injunction in no way authorized or caused the wrongful act of appellee, in taking and converting the property. The dismissal of the bill and the dissolution of the injunction Avere conclusive that the injunction was wrongfully sued out. The only question on the assessment of damages was, (assuming the appellee to have been all wrong in suing out the injunction) to what extent Avere appellants injured by being delayed some three weeks in taking and caring for the lumber and in procuring a dissolution of the injunction. Wrongs suffered during that time by unlawful acts of appellee, other than the improvident act of suing out the injunction, constitute no part of the damages caused by the injunction. \u25a0 The sureties who joined in the injunction bond did not thereby make themselves liable for damages resulting from any wrongful acts of appellee, which he had done or might' thereafter do, save damages which naturally resulted from the legal effect of the writ of injunction.</p> <p id=\"b191-5\" pgmap=\"191\">The decree of the circuit court must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b191-6\" pgmap=\"191\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
