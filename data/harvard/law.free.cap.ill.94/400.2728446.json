The courts of bolh law and equity hold that there are three classes of cases in which the statute of uses does not execute the use, and when the use remains as it did before the statute, a mere equitable interest, to be administered only in a court of equity, viz: 1, where a use is limited upon a use; 2, where a copyhold or leasehold estate or personal property is limited to uses; and 3, where such powers or duties are imposed with the estate upon a donee to uses so that it is necessary that he should continue to hold the legal title in order to perform his duty or execute the power.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b401-10\" pgmap=\"401\">5.

An action of ejectment will not lie against a trustee.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-11\" pgmap=\"406\">Perry on Trusts says, sec. 228 : \u201c It is the duty of the trustee to defend and protect the title to the trust estate; and as the legal title is in him, he alone can sue and be sued in a court of law. The cestui que trust, the absolute owner of the estate in equity, is regarded in law as a stranger.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-12\" pgmap=\"406\">In the case of Richeson v. Ryan et al. 15 Ill. 13, it is held by this court that if the legal title is in a trustee, he alone should recover. See also Smith v. Ramsey, 1 Gilm. 377: \u201c If the trustee dies,\u201d as did Hddges in this case, \u201cthe estate will descend, charged with the trust, to his heir.\u201d And in Wash-burn on Peal Property, vol. 2, page 467, it is said: \u201c It should, however, be borne in mind that at common law, upon the death of a trustee, his estate descended, charged with the trust, to his heirs.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-3\" pgmap=\"407\">Perry on Trusts sums it up in this language, sec. 343: \u201c Therefore, upon the death of one of the original trustees, the Avhole estate, Avhether real or personal, devolves upon the survivors, and so on to the last survivor; and upon the death of the last survivor, if he has made no disposition of the estate by will or otherwise, it devolves upon his heirs, if real estate; and upon his executors or administrators, if it is personal estate.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-4\" pgmap=\"407\">Nor was this trust an executed trust. A trust is said to be executory when some further act is necessary to be done by the trustee to give effect to it, and a trust is said to be executed Avhen no act is necessary to be done by the trustees to give it effect; but in equity a trust can never be regarded as executed if it would defeat the plain intention of\"1 the testator.</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-5\" pgmap=\"407\">Here, the legal estate was transferred to trustees for them to act,\u2014that is, to collect rents, take charge of the estate, and do in general what might to them seem best for the interests of the estate, paying annually the current expenses of Mary L. Walsh, and upon her death Avithout issue to pay certain specific legacies, the balance of the estate to be \u201cdivided equally\u201d between the three residuary legatees and devisees. Some act Avas to be done, and to be done by the trustee of the estate, and doubly so if there are charities to be administered by the courts through the instrumentality of a trustee.</p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-6\" pgmap=\"407\">The rule is the same whether the act to be done is directed by the Avill or by a court of chancery. See Edmonson and wife v. Dyson, 2 Kelly, page 307, where this Avhole question is fully considered. The trust can not be considered as executed as long as some act is to be done by the trustee. What evidence can be found in this record that a single one of these legacies is paid ?</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-7\" pgmap=\"407(56) 408(150)\">\u201c The test of an executory trust is that the trustee has some duty to perform, for the performance of which it is necessary that the title be regarded as abiding in him. Here nothing could be plainer than that the trustee could not perform the trusts conferred on him without retaining the title of the property.\u201d In the case at bar, how could the trustee perform the trust imposed upon him without retaining the estate? But it may be insisted that he could retain the estate until these special legacies were fully paid, and then, as the foreign corporations could not take at law, this real estate descended to the heirs, divested of the trust. This can not be. The law is well settled that if the estate and legal title is once vested in a trustee for a lawful purpose, all unlawful restraints will fall away and be simply ,void, leaving the estate well vested in the trustee. See Perry on Trusts, sec. 738: \u201cAgain, if there is a valid trust joined with a void one, the legal estate will vest, and the heir or residuary devisee must resort to a court of equity.\u201d Willett v. Sandford, 1 Ves. Sen. 186; 2 Jarman, 207.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-6\" pgmap=\"408\">The legal title certainly vested in the trustee when he held the estate in trust for Mary L. Walsh, and, in the event of her death, for the other legatees; and having once vested, the only way it can be divested, if the instrument itself does not direct how it is to be divested, is by a bill in chancery or by a conveyance from the trustee.</p><attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-7\" pgmap=\"408\">Mr. James M.

Hill on Trustees, 2 Am. ed., sec. 239, and cases cited; the Law of Trusts and Trustees, by Tiffany &amp; Bullard, 1 ed., p. 791, and cases cited.</p><p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-7\" pgmap=\"409\">Therefore, if there be a devise to trustees, without any words of limitation or a fortiori to trustees, their executors, administrators and assigns, in trust, out of the rents and profits, to pay debts or legacies, and if, from the amount or nature of the payments to be made, as well as the general scope of the trust, the payments may well be discharged by an annual perception of the profits, and no sale or other anticipation of the income is necessary for that purpose, the authorities, without exception, establish that the trustees will take only a term of years sufficient for raising the required moneys, and no estate of inheritance will vest in them. And the fact of the devise being to the persons who are appointed executors would seem to be in favor of this construction. Hill on Trustees, 2 Am. ed., top p. 349, and cases cited.</p><p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-8\" pgmap=\"409\">A devise to trustees without the addition of any words of limitation, in trust to pay the rents and profits to a person or persons for life, followed by a gift of the estate over, will give the trustees an estate during the life of the cestui que trust for life, as we have already seen that a devise to the trustees and their heirs in a similar trust will be cut down into a life estate. And a similar devise to trustees in trust for an individual nntil of age, or any other specified age, will give them a chattel interest only determinable upon the cestui que trusts attaining that age or dying before.

Perry on Trusts (1st ed.) sec. 316.</p><p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-6\" pgmap=\"410\">A trust to preserve contingent remainders without limitation to heirs will not be enlarged, for the trust does not require an estate of inheritance.

Butl. n. 8.</p><p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-7\" pgmap=\"410\">Applying these propositions of law to the facts of this case and we conclude that the legal estate in the lands never did vest in the trustee.</p><p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-8\" pgmap=\"410\">But if we concede that the legal estate was in Charles T. Hodges at the time of his death, as claimed by appellant, still we are unable to see how that will help them, because we understand that on the death of Mary Lucy Walsh the statute of uses executed the legal title in the three foreign corporations aforesaid, by virtue of whose right appellant holds possession, if they could take under the will, and if they could not take, then the statute executed the legal title in appellees. In either event the legal title is not now and never has been in the heirs at law of Mr. Hodges. \u201cThus, where an estate is given to trustees and their heirs, in trust to pay the income to A during her life, and at her decease to hold the same for the use of her children or heirs, or for the use of other persons named, the trust ceases upon the death of A, for the reason that it remains no longer an active trust; the statute of uses immediately executes the use in those who are limited to take it after the death of A, and the trustees cease to have anything in the estate, not because the court has abridged their estate to the extent of the trust, but because, having the fee or legal estate, the statute of uses has executed it in the cestui que trust.\u201d Perry on Trusts, sec. 320; Parker v.

Swayne et al. 83 id. 336.</p> <p id=\"b411-7\" pgmap=\"411\">But this, it will be observed, has reference only to passive trusts, or what are sometimes termed simple or dry trusts; and in such eases the legal estate never vests in the feoffee for a moment, but is instantaneously transferred to the..cestui que use as soon as the use is declared. 2 Blackstone\u2019s Com. (Sharswood\u2019s ed.) 331, 332; and Witham v. Brooner, supra.</p> <p id=\"b411-8\" pgmap=\"411(61) 412(408) 413(163)\">It is said in Perry on Trusts, sec. 300: \u201c Although it is probable that it was the intent of the statute \\i. e., of uses] to convert all uses or trusts into legal estates, yet the convenience to the subject of being able to keep the legal title to an estate in one person, while the beneficial interest should be in another, was too great to be given up altogether, and courts of equity were astute in finding reasons to withdraw a conveyance from the operation of the statute. Three principal reasons or rules of construction were laid down whereby conveyances were excepted from such operation: First, where a use was limited upon a use; second, where a copyhold or leasehold estate, or personal property was limited to uses; third, where such powers or duties were imposed with the estate upon a donee to uses that it was necessary that he should continue to hold the legal title in order to perform his duty or execute the power. In all of these three instances courts, both of law and equity, held that the statute did not execute the use, but that such use remained as it was before the statute, a mere equitable interest to be administered in a court of equity.\u201d And again, in sec. 305, it is said: \u201cThe third rule of construction is less technical, and relates to special or active trusts, which were never within the purview of the statute. Therefore, if any agency, duty or power be imposed on the trustee, as, by a limitation to a trustee and his heirs to pay the rents, or to convey the estate, or if any control is to be exercised or duty performed by the trustee in applying the rents to a person\u2019s maintenance, or in making repairs, or to preserve contingent remainders, or to raise a sum of money, or to dispose of the estate by sale, in all these and in other and like cases, the operation of the statute is excluded, and the trusts or uses remain mere equitable estates. So, if the. trustee is to exercise any discretion in the management of the estate, in the investment of the proceeds or the principal, or in the application of the income, or if the purpose of the trust is to protect the estate for a given time, or until the death of some one, or until division.\u201d * * * And again, in regard to enlarging and extending estates given to trustees, the same author, in sec. 315, says: \u201cSo, if land is devised to trustees without the word heirs, and a trust is declared which can not be fully executed but by the trustees taking an inheritance, the court will enlarge or extend their estate into a fee simple to enable them to carry out the intention of the donors. Thus, if land is conveyed to trustees without the word heirs, in trust to sell, they must have the fee, otherwise they could not sell. The construction would be the same if the trust was to sell the whole or a part, for no purchasers would be safe unless they could have the fee, and a trust to convey or to lease at discretion would be subject to the same rule. A fortiori, if an estate is limited to trustees and their heirs, in trust to sell or mortgage or to lease at discretion, or if they are to convey the property in fee, or to divide it equally among certain persons, for to do any or all of these acts requires a legal fee.\u201d See, also, to the same effect, Hill on Trustees, (4 Am. ed.) 376; Doe d. Dees v. Williams, 2 Meeson and Welsby (Exch.) 749.</p> <p id=\"b413-6\" pgmap=\"413\">In those cases where the legal fee is not vested in the trustee, it will, of course, in the absence of a devise prevailing to the contrary, vest in the heir at law. And there are also cases in which, it having been the duty of the trustee to convey to the heir at law, it will be presumed, after the lapse of considerable time, that such conveyance has been made. Hill on Trustees (4 Am. ed.) 401; Perry on Trusts, sec. 350; Gibson v. Rees et al. 50 Ill. 383; Pollock v. Maison, 41 id. 516. But it is not claimed, nor could it be, that there is any foundation for such presumption in the facts found in this record.</p> <p id=\"b413-7\" pgmap=\"413(109) 414(24)\">In Harris v. Cornell, 80 Ill. 67, it was said, referring to Hardin v. Osborn, Sept. T. 1875, that it had been held the purposes of a trust having been accomplished, the owner of the trust became, by operation of law, reinvested with the legal title and could sue in ejectment. This was unadvisedly said. A rehearing was granted in Hardin v. Osborn, and the opinion therein referred to was withdrawn. In McNab v. Young et al. 81 Ill. 11, language of like import as that used in Harris v. Cornell, supra, was used upon the authority of the same case, although it is therein erroneously referred to as being reported in 60 Ill. at p. 93. The case there reported, of that name, does not discuss that or any kindred question.</p> <p id=\"b414-6\" pgmap=\"414\">The true doctrine in regard to active trusts, and that adhered to by this court, is expressed in Vallette v. Bennett, 69 Ill., at p. 636, that where the legal title is vested in the trustee, nothing short of a reconveyance can place the legal title back in the grantor or his heirs, subject, of course, to the qualification that, under certain circumstances, such reconveyance will be presumed without direct proof of the fact.</p> <p id=\"b414-7\" pgmap=\"414(285) 415(56)\">The language of Walsh\u2019s will is: \u201cAs to my worldly estate, all the real, personal and mixed, of which I shall die seized and possessed, * * * I hereby grant, devise, convey and confirm unto,\u201d (naming the trustees) \u201cin trust,\u201d etc. He then directs his said trustees to assume and take entire control of his estate; to collect all outstanding dues, rents, profits and interests of whatever character, derived therefrom, and to govern and control all such interests as may accrue and arise to said estate from time to time; to make such disposal of said estate as shall in their judgment benefit and increase the value of said estate; that said trustees \u201cshall pay, or cause to be paid, out of said estate,\u201d to his daughter, Mary Lucy,'\u201csuch installments of money as in the judgment of said trustees shall be deemed proper and sufficient to meet her current expenses, and provide her an ample and comfortable support; \u201d that said trustees should transfer his estate to his said daughter upon her reaching the age of thirty-five.years, she being then unmarried, but if then married, they are directed to transfer the estate to her only upon the contingency that they should deem her husband a person in whom confidence might be placed; but if the trustees should deem the husband an incompetent and unfit person to have the care and control of the estate, they are directed to continue to make payments to his daughter, \u201cin such amounts and at such times as in their judgment they may think proper,\u201d and that the circumstances and station of his daughter may demand; that in the event of the death of his daughter without issue, certain specific legacies, amounting to some $2600 in the aggregate, are given, and the balance of his estate is to be divided equally between the House of the Good Shepherd, Saint Joseph\u2019s Male Orphan Asylum, and Saint Ann\u2019s Infant Asylum; and he then exempts his trustees from liability for all losses occurring without their fault.</p> <p id=\"b415-6\" pgmap=\"415\">This very clearly gave the entire control and management of the estate to the trustees until Mary Lucy should arrive at the age of thirty-five years\u2014being unmarried;\u2014and she having died before she reached that age, the control and management of the estate continued to devolve upon them. The language employed so plainly conveys this idea, that it can admit of no controversy.</p> <p id=\"b415-7\" pgmap=\"415\">The power \u201cto make such disposal of the estate as shall,\u201d in the judgment of the trustees, \u201cbenefit and increase the value of said estate,\u201d\u2014as also the duty of paying Mary Lucy \u201csuch installments of money as in the judgment of said trustees shall be proper, and sufficient to meet her current expenses and provide an ample and comfortable support \u201d\u2014 necessarily imply the power to sell the lands and convert them into money or interest bearing securities; for this might well, in the judgment of the trustees, benefit and increase the estate, and be essential to make payment of the sums directed to be paid to Mary Lucy. The power implied to sell, is to sell the whole title,\u2014and to this is essential the power to convey that title, requiring, as a condition precedent, a fee simple estate in the trustees.</p> <p id=\"b415-8\" pgmap=\"415\">The property is devised to the trustees to sell and convey, if they deem it advisable, or to hold and control until it is to be transferred as directed; and in the contingency that has arisen, it was intended that it should be the duty of the trustees to make the equal division of the property between the corporations designated and convey it accordingly,\u2014for the grant to these corporations is in severalty, and not as tenants in common, and their title must necessarily rest on the conveyance of the trustees.</p> <p id=\"b416-4\" pgmap=\"416\">Whether the corporations can hold or not, is not now material. The words of the devise show the intention of the testator that the trustees should take a fee, whether he was mistaken in the law as respects the objects of his intended bounty or not. The only difference would be, if the corporations can not take, the trustees, instead of holding the legal title in trust for them, hold it in trust for the heirs-at-law. Hill on Trustees, (4 Am. ed.) 208-9.</p> <p id=\"b416-5\" pgmap=\"416\">The legal title, then, being in the trustees, the heirs-at-law could not maintain ejectment.
