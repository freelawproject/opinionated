Mod. Law of Evid., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2140, 2143; <em>Chamb. H. B. on Evid., </em>\u00a7 758; <em>Huddy\u2019s Ency. of Auto Law, Vol. </em>17-18, <em>p. </em>548; <em>Berry on Automobiles, Vol. </em>5, <em>p. </em>390; 1 <em>Wig. on Evid., </em>\u00a7 716); and I think that that general rule should be applied in this case. <em>Chamb. Mod. Law of Evid., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2140, 2143; <em>Chamb. H. B. on Evid., </em>\u00a7 758; <em>Huddy\u2019s Ency. of Auto Law, Vol. </em>17-18, <em>p. </em>548; see, also, <em>Teets v. Hahn, </em>104 <em>N. J. L. </em>357,140 A. 427; <em>Grath v. Wilson Motor Car Co. </em>( <em>Mo. App.), </em>253 <em>S. W. </em>776; <em>Anderson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>Elect. Laundry Co., </em>146 <em>A. </em>683, 7 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>567; <em>Shea v. Hudson, </em>165 <em>Mass. </em>43, 42 <em>N. E. </em>114.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"> As was pointed out in <em>Chamberlayne\u2019s Modern Law of Evidence, </em>\u00a7 2143: \u201cHe (the owner) may give the value of his household furniture, including articles of clothing or the contents of the stable, carriages, and similar articles. Such an owner may appraise his horses, cattle or other animals. If he has building materials, machinery, or the like, he may estimate as to what they are fairly worth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Where the property is not what may be fairly termed of the common usual and ordinary nature, the reason for that rule is apparently because the owner\u2019s relation to his property is such that it may be fairly regarded as creating in and of itself a species of special knowledge, with respect to its value. <em>Chamb. H. B. on Evid., </em>\u00a7 758; <em>Chamb. Mod. Law of Evid., </em>\u00a7 2140; <em>Shea v. Hudson, </em>165 <em>Mass. </em>43, 42 <em>N. E. </em>114.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The weight of such evidence necessarily depends on the circumstances, and is for the jury to determine, but for the reasons already given it seems that in most cases no showing of special skill or experience is required to admit the estimate of the owner, as to value, though proof of possession may perhaps increase the weight of his testimony. <em>Chamb. H. B. on Evid., </em>\u00a7 758; <em>Chamb. Mod. Law of Evid., </em>\u00a7 2140.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">In <em>Huddy\u2019s Encyclopedia of Automobile Law, Vol. </em>17-18, <em>p. </em>548, <em>supra, </em>the author said: \u201cThe present or past owner will generally be deemed qualified to give an opinion as to the value of a motor vehicle, but other witnesses must be qualified as to their knowledge of value before they will be allowed to give an opinion on the subject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The defendant\u2019s objection to the question is, therefore,overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>The witness, in answering the question objected to, then said that the value of his car immediately prior to the collision was $500.00.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
