They took no proceedings to open the judgment at that term, nor at the succeeding March or May terms thereof, but delayed acting until the September Term, 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Judgments entered by confession upon warrants of attorney are in the nature of summary proceedings, and remedial action as to them will not be unduly limited. <em>Miles v.
