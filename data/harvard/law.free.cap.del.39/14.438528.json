It, also, tended to show that the defendant had failed to stop at that sign and that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and damages were caused thereby. The defendant, on the other hand, produced evidence that tended to show that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and damages were caused in whole or in part by his own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">In considering and discussing with counsel the instructions to be given to the jury, Layton, C. J., called attention to the fact that no count in the declaration was based on <em>Section </em>5638 of the <em>Revised Code of </em>1935, <em>Section </em>100 of the <em>Motor Vehicle Act, </em>and stated that by reason of that fact the Court could not charge on that statute or on negligence <em>per se.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
