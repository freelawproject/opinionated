However, the appeals to the commissioner having been consolidated and the four appeals to this court having been presented by counsel for both parties as a consolidated appeal, we shall dispose of the issues presented in one decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Appellee is the owner of registration No. 265,436, issued December 24, 1929, for a trade-mark consisting of the word \u201cCrown\u201d and a pictorial representation of a crown for use on rayon yarn.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">It appears from the record that appellee and its predecessor have used the word \u201cCrown\u201d or a pictorial representation of a crown as trade-marks on rayon yarn since 1925, and that appellee has permitted various corporations, by license agreements, to use its trade-marks on fabrics made from its rayon yarn.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">According to its license agreement with the appellant company dated January 2, 1940 (appellee\u2019s Exhibit No. 8), appellee required appellant, as a purchaser of its yarn, to have the fabrics made from such yarn approved by the Better Fabrics Testing Bureau, Inc., and, as stated in the exhibit, permitted the appellant company to use appellee\u2019s \u201cCrown\u201d trade-mark, \u201cin either representation or word,\u201d and the words \u201cCrown Tested Quality or Tested Quality\u201d on labels, stickers, tags, or other forms of identification on its fabrics, provided the fabrics were tested as aforesaid. Appellee also required in that agreement that it should have sole control \u201cover the purchasing, wording, form and issuing of all labels, stickers, tags, or other kinds of identification, etc.,\u201d which contain either the term \u201cCrown\u201d or a pictorial representation of a crown and the words \u201cCrown Tested Quality or Tested Quality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">The appellant company agreed in that license agreement to identify its goods by appellee\u2019s \u201cCrown\u201d trade-mark and the phrase \u201cCrown Tested Quality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">Substantially the same agreement was entered into by the involved parties on January 3, 1939 (appellee\u2019s Exhibit No. 7), and on December 8, 1932 (appellee\u2019s Exhibit No. 6). \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">Each of the license agreements referred to provided that it might be cancelled by either party upon not less than one day\u2019s written notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">It clearly appears from the record that appellee is the owner of the word \u201cCrown\u201d and a pictorial representation of a crown for trade-mark use on rayon yarn; that its marks have been used by appellant and other licensees on fabrics made from appellee\u2019s rayon yarn; and that appellee has extensively advertised its goods and its marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-16\">It further appears from the record that many of appellant\u2019s customers referred to its fabrics as \u201cCrown fabrics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-17\">That appellant\u2019s fabrics should become known as \u201cCrown fabrics,\u201d is not strange in view of the license agreements entered into by appellant and appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-18\">Several of appellee\u2019s witnesses stated that, in their opinion, there would be no confusion between appellant\u2019s trademarks and those of appellee if used concurrently on the goods of the respective parties. Such opinions, although entitled to be given consideration for what they are worth, are not binding on the tribunals of the Patent Office or on this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-19\">It is contended by counsel for appellant that the adoption and use of appellant\u2019s trade-marks are not covered by the license agreements entered into by the parties, but grow out of appellant\u2019s corporate name. Counsel also contends that appellee is estopped from asserting confusing similarity of the marks of the parties, because, it is alleged, appellee condoned appellant\u2019s use of the trade-marks here involved. In support of his conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>tions, counsel cites the cases of Heger Products Co. v,. Polk Miller Products Corp., <em>47 F.2d 966, 18 </em>C.C.P.A., Patents, 1106, and Malone v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Co., 65 F.2d 154, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">In each of those cases it was held, in substance, that where an applicant for the registration of his mark had, by his conduct, led others, who used similar marks on goods of the same descriptive properties as those of the applicant, to believe that there was no objection to such use and, in fact, consented to such use, he would be estopped from claiming exclusive ownership of the mark and from registering the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Those cases have no hearing on the issues here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We find nothing in the record to indicate that appellee ever condoned appellant\u2019s use of its involved marks, except as such marks might have been used under the license agreements entered into by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">As stated in the decision of the commissioner, appellant has appropriated opposer\u2019s marks in their entirety. It has appropriated the word \"Crown,\u201d as well as a pictorial representation of a crown, and has used them on goods of the same descriptive properties as those on which appellee uses its marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">That the marks of the parties are confusingly similar can not be seriously questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Whatever right appellant might have to use its marks under its license agreements with appellee, it obviously is not entitled to the exclusive use of such marks, and, therefore, is not entitled to register them.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b304-13\">GARRETT, Presiding Judge, did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b304-14\">LENROOT, Judge, sat during the arguments of this case, but resigned before the opinion was prepared.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-30\"> These appeals were originally decided by this court on the nineteenth day of June 1944. Thereafter, counsel for appellee filed a petition for rehearing, requesting that the court revise certain language in its decision which, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>contended, was not necessary to a decision in the case. The rehearing was granted October 2, 1044, solely for the purpose of permitting the court to revise the language in its decision to which counsel for appellee had directed the court\u2019s attention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
