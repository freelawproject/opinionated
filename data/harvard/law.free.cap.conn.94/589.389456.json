One payment on the stipulated purchase price was made at once as the contract demanded; the remaining terms of purchase were to be satisfied at the time of the transfer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-7\">When the contract was made there was an existing defect in the defendant\u2019s title to the property, then unknown to any of the parties, and which \u201crendered it questionable and unmarketable.\u201d The plaintiffs discovered it next day, notified the defendant, and gave him the option of returning the money already paid and treating the contract as rescinded, or of taking an extension of time to enable him to remove the defect. The defendant chose the latter course, and for that purpose the plaintiffs extended the time for completing the sale of the property for one week \u2014 until two o\u2019clock in the afternoon of April 19th, following. The defect remained and had not been removed when the extended time expired, nor did the defendant during that period or at its termination offer to perform his obligations under the contract. After giving the defendant the additional week within which to perfect his own title for the transfer, the plaintiffs did nothing further by way of tender of performance of their part of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-8\">The trial court held that \u201cuntil such tender was made or excused the plaintiffs acquired no right of action,\u201d and solely upon that ground rendered judgment for the defendant.

The plaintiffs\u2019 discovery of the defect in McNamara\u2019s title, and his treatment of the offered choice of courses made by them as a result of it, imported a new element into their relations. By accepting time to enable him to clear his own title, he not only conceded his present inability to fulfil the agreement, but suspended the need of any further action by the plaintiffs until he should have satisfied the single condition on which the extension was accorded him. He never met the requirement, and the result of his failure to perform this prerequisite to the transfer within the time fixed for affecting it, was to put him in default on his whole undertaking. Under these circumstances a tender of performance by the plaintiffs became as unnecessary through his not acting at all, as it would have been in the face of his positive refusal to meet the obligations of his agreement, and for the same reasons. \u201cIn such a condition of things a tender would have been useless, for the refusal in effect so declared it.\u201d <em>Nothe </em>v. <em>Nomer, </em>54 Conn. 326, 329, 8 Atl. 134; <em>Janulewycz </em>v. <em>Quagliano, </em>88 Conn. 60, 64, 89 Atl. 897; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>24 Conn. 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The plaintiffs had a choice of remedies. By one of them they \u201cmight, after default made by the defendant, have elected to rescind the contract and sue for a recovery of the advancements made thereon.\u201d <em>Janulweycz </em>v. <em>Quagliano, supra; Lyon </em>v. <em>Annable, </em>4 Conn. 350. They chose and pursued this course, and for the reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>given the finding clearly discloses their right to a recovery upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"Av9\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the cause remanded to the City Court with directions to enter judgment for the plaintiffs to recover the amount already paid upon the contract, with interest thereon from April 19th, 1918.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
