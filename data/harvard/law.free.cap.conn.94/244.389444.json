The single ground which has any bearing here is dealt with in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-7\">The complaint was then demurred to, substantially for not disclosing that the proper authorities had furnished any support or paid out any money to the woman because of Litvin\u2019s default, and before the bringing of the action. The demurrer was overruled, the defendants were defaulted for failure to plead further, and upon a hearing in damages the court found that the bond sued upon was taken in lieu of a penalty of sixty days in jail imposed by the Criminal Court of Common Pleas in New Haven County, upon Litvin\u2019s conviction of a charge of nonsupport; that the defendants were wholly in default of all payments provided for by the bond for the entire period of six months, and that \u201cprior to the bringing of this action the selectmen of the town of New Haven furnished no support to the said Katherine Litvin\u201d; and rendered judgment for $104 \u2014 that being the amount of the defaulted payments for the full period of six months. The bond itself, which was attached to the finding, was taken to the treasurer of the town of New Haven, and is conditioned for the payment of the weekly sums directly to the wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-8\">The various assignments of error upon which the appeal rests are sufficiently indicated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-9\"><em>Franklin </em>Coeller, for the appellants (defendants).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>Robert J.

Nothing amounting to a serious misdescription is apparent, but the matter invites comment lest we otherwise seem to sanction a loose practice quite capable of working serious mischief if persisted in.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The plea in abatement was conclusively disposed of on issues of fact, and one of its grounds was that the plaintiff, as treasurer, had not authorized the bringing of this action. This was determined against the defendants, and no foundation has been laid for questioning the correctness of the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">It is urged as error that the plaintiff\u2019s official standing as treasurer was not established. It need not have been until questioned, and it does not appear that the challenge came until after the default. It was then too late. The default necessarily recognized and settled the plaintiff\u2019s status and his right to sue. For the same reason, the attacks upon the validity of the bond are without effect as the record discloses them. They went essentially to the merits of the action, and were available only as matters of defense. But the default conclusively admitted the cause of action as alleged, and precluded a defense. <em>Lamphear </em>v. <em>Buckingham, </em>33 Conn. 237, 250. It conceded the plaintiff\u2019s right to a judgment, and left open for determination the single question of amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Several assignments of error rest upon alleged rulings in the admission or rejection of testimony. The finding wholly ignores the subject, and nothing in the record warrants us in assuming that any such rulings were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Error is also predicated upon the court\u2019s denial of a so-called motion for a nonsuit on the hearing in damages. This mere statement would dispose of the claim, even if the silence of the record upon the matter permitted us to assume that a motion so foreign to the procedure involved was injected into it.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The one remaining ground of error is based upon the overruling of the demurrer. Here the substance of the defendants\u2019 claim is that no right to sue upon the bond accrued until the plaintiff, or other proper authority, had actually furnished support to the woman because of Litvin\u2019s default. This is not so. The bond itself, to which we must look for the strict measure of the accountability of the obligors, contains no such qualification. They were answerable upon it when their refusal to meet their undertaking was complete. The liability was neither contingent upon an actual prior disbursement of money for the woman\u2019s support, nor limited in any sense to the amount of such payments made before the commencement of the action. They are accountable to the full measure of their default, and it was not a prerequisite of the treasurer\u2019s right to a recovery of this amount, that support had already been furnished by the authorities charged with that duty under \u00a7 6418 of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">In so far as we may assume from the record that these same claims were urged upon the hearing as bearing upon the amount which the plaintiff was entitled to recover, they are disposed of by what has been said of the ruling upon the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
