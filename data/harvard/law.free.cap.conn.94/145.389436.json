The men were intimate friends and DeVito, who had never before loaned money, refused the bonus, but promised to lend the money if Freberg would get \u201csuitable endorsers\u201d on a note for his security. The next morning DeVito drew $200 from the bank and delivered the money to Freberg, who handed him his executed note for $225 payable to DeVito and indorsed by the other two defendants. DeVito took the note \u201cupon the insistence\u201d of Freberg, but with the concurrent mutual understanding of both that the maker\u2019s obligation was on a loan of $200 only. The paper in suit is the second renewal of the note so given, \u2014 no part of either of the others having been paid at its maturity, \u25a0 \u2014 and the excess amount over the face of the first note represents accumulated protest fees. The plaintiff drew neither of the notes, and accepted each of them only as found, and with no intent to evade the provisions of the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>The defendant indorsers having been duly notified of the nonpayment of the second renewal note, this action was brought upon it, and defenses were interposed setting up the claimed illegality of the transaction under the statutes referred to. The court found that $210 was due upon the note and rendered judgment for that amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-6\">The evidence and rulings upon the trial were certified to this court, and the appeal assigns error in the refusal of the trial judge to find certain facts claimed to be material, and in ruling and holding (1) that the loan violated no provision of the statutes already referred to; (2) that the plaintiff took the original and each renewal note without intent to evade the statutes;-and (3) that the statutes did not prohibit the bringing of this action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-7\"><em>James B.

The evidence certified to us justifies each of these conclusions of fact, and both must stand. It was undisputed that the only suggestion of a bonus or charge for the use of the money, came from Freberg, the borrower, and other testimony gave ample warrant for finding not only that DeVito refused it, but that the note was urged upon him by Freberg with an express understanding that the lender neither wanted nor expected anything more than the repayment of his money. Any apparent inconsistency between that attitude and a reluctant acceptance of the note for an amount greater than the sum lent, was a matter for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>the trial court to consider in weighing the testimony. In no event is it suggestive enough to militate with us against the explicit finding on this feature of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The defendant seems to contend, however, that where the amount of the note exceeds the amount of the loan by a sum greater than the interest charge sanctioned by the statute, that fact alone supplies the illegal intent and conclusively establishes a violation of the statute. This is not true. Whether in taking the note for more than the underlying Joan the plaintiff intended to evade the prohibitions of the statute, was in itself a vital question of fact for the trier\u2019s determination,\u2014 as the matter of intent always must be in cases arising under this or any analogous statute aimed at usurious practices. <em>Douglass </em>v. <em>Boulevard Co., </em>91 Conn. 601, 604, 100 Atl. 1067. For while the taking of the note was indispensable to bring this phase of the transaction under the ban of the statutes, the further element of a specific unlawful intent was equally so. Proof of the former of course does not of itself establish the latter, and so long as the main fact of taking the note is susceptible of an explanation which strips the act of the attendant intent required to make it offensive to the law, that explanation must be always available to one challenged under either the civil or criminal aspect of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">This in no sense loses sight of the fact that cases may be frequent where the circumstances surrounding the taking of such a note point so irresistibly to a concealed corrupt motive as to demand the inference of an accompanying intent to evade the statute. This case is not of that class, as the record discloses it to us, and the trial court\u2019s finding absolving the plaintiff of any such intent, was fairly if not necessarily forecast by the facts found to attend the actual negotiation of the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>These considerations dispose of the defendant\u2019s final claim. Since neither the loan nor the taking of the note violated any provision of the statutes relating to the subject, this action upon the note was obviously not within the prohibited class.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
