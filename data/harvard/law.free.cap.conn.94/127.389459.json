J., Wheeler, Beach, Gager and Curtis, Js.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b139-11\">A plaintiff who suddenly turns from the right-hand side of the road, upon which he has been traveling, to the left-hand side, to avoid a collision seemingly imminent, is not necessarily negligent nor guilty of a violation of the law of the road; and therefore an instruction to the jury which permits them to find such negligence or violation merely because of such conduct, irrespective of the conditions which prompted it, is inadequate and prejudicial to the cause of a losing plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b139-12\">Argued October 8th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A6H\">decided December 22d, 1919.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-13\">Action to recover damages for injuries to the plaintiff\u2019s person and to his automobile through a collision with a street-railway car of the defendant, which was alleged to have been caused by the negligence of its servants, brought to the Superior Court in Hartford County and tried to the jury before <em>Case, J.; </em>verdict and judgment for the defendant, and appeal by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A1q\">\n<em>Error and new trial ordered.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b139-14\"><em>Jacob Schwolsky </em>and <em>Henry J.

Of course, if the plaintiff did either of these things, he was violating one of the elementary rules of the road, known to all intelligent users of the highway and respected by all prudent travelers. If the collision with Rankin was due directly to such conduct of the plaintiff, then its result, the throwing of his own car on to the railroad track, is chargeable to his own negligence.\u201d The charge does not deal directly with the circumstances which the plaintiff claims accompanied the collision. The plaintiff claimed to have proved that he was on the east side of the paved roadway and was confronted by a head-on collision with Rankin\u2019s car running recklessly on the east side of the roadway, and that the plaintiff turned suddenly to the left to avoid a collision. The jury were left with such guidance only as to this claimed situation, as is contained in the portion of the charge given above, where it is stated, in substance, that if the plaintiff suddenly turned to the left when Rankin\u2019s automobile approached, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>violating a rule of the road and was guilty of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">If the jury found that the plaintiff was driving his automobile north on the east side of the roadway, and that Rankin was driving an automobile south at a reckless rate of speed on the east side of the roadway, directly toward the plaintiff\u2019s automobile, and that the plaintiff in order to avoid a head-on collision suddenly turned his automobile to the left, and while the plaintiff was so doing Rankin\u2019s automobile struck the rear of the plaintiff\u2019s automobile and threw it on the tracks, then the jury might reasonably have found that the plaintiff was free from negligence in turning suddenly to the left to avoid a collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">We are of the opinion that the charge gave an inadequate and prejudicial direction as to this feature of the case, and that the plaintiff\u2019s third claim of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">In view of the conflicting claims of the parties as to the circumstances under which the plaintiff\u2019s automobile got upon the trolley-tracks, the portions of the charge of the court set up in the first, second, fourth, fifth, eighth and ninth claims of error, are correct and adequate directions to the jury in relation to the claimed facts. These claimed errors dealing with directions as to facts, are not of general interest and call for no discussion. The sixth and seventh claimed errors were abandoned in argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">There is error and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
