The plaintiff was employed by as a night watchman therein. As such watchman it was his duty to make inspection rounds of the premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>at stated intervals during his hours of duty, and in the course of such rounds to \u201cring in\u201d at boxes installed for that purpose at various points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b721-6\">The defendant conducted a burglar alarm, night watch and sprinkler supervision service in the city, in and from a central office electrically connected with various properties in the city which it was under engagement to serve. Among these latter was the Miner, Read &amp; Tullock establishment. Electrical connections between the company\u2019s office and this establishment were such that when the watchman \u201crang in\u201d on a box, that fact would be registered in the defendant\u2019s office. If the failure to ring in was continued a certain number of minutes after schedule-time, called a period of grace, it became the defendant\u2019s duty under the terms of its employment by Miner, Read &amp; Tullock, to send a roundsman to the place to ascertain the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b721-7\">The New Haven operating manager of the defendant testified, without contradiction, that the duties of a roundsman sent in response to a night watch call were under their instructions to locate the watchman, and in case he should be found on duty to ascertain from him why he had failed to \u201cring in\u201d according to schedule, and in addition to obtain from him a written statement of the cause of his failure entered upon a card or slip provided for that purpose and signed by the watchman, and thereupon to report by telephone to the central office from the place of business visited, or some neighboring point, and to return to that office with the signed statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b721-8\">At night the defendant\u2019s central office was in charge of a night manager, a subordinate of the operating manager, and several roundsmen were there on duty to respond to calls or alarms that might come in. A portion of the equipment of the place was a supply of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>loaded revolvers, three or four in number, which lay upon a desk ready for use by the roundsmen as required.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b722-6\">During the night of October 18th, 1916, the apparatus in the defendant\u2019s office indicated that Miner, Read &amp; Tullock\u2019s watchman had failed to \u201cring in\u201d either on scheduled time or within the prescribed period of grace. The night manager thereupon dispatched one Sullivan, -a roundsman then on duty, to answer the call. As he went he took with him, as the night manager was aware, one of the revolvers. Upon his arrival at Miner, Read <em>&amp; </em>Tullock\u2019s place of business, he entered the office, which was on the second floor of the building. The watchman appeared almost immediately. As Sullivan\u2019s whereabouts were unknown to the defendant at the time of the trial, he was not present thereat, and the only testimony concerning what took place subsequent to Sullivan\u2019s arrival was that of the plaintiff whose testimony was in substance as follows: Sullivan reached the office about four-thirty o\u2019clock in the morning. The plaintiff, having just finished his round, came in almost immediately and found Sullivan smoking. As the rules of the establishment forbade smoking on the premises, the plaintiff reproved Sullivan for his conduct, upon which the latter replied that he was doing the smoking. The plaintiff then filled out the slip presented for the purpose, by writing into the blank space provided for entering the excuse for failure to \u201cring in,\u201d the words, \u201cWhole round started late,\u201d signed it and handed it back to Sullivan. The plaintiff thereupon left the office, passed into the hallway leading from it to the stairs down to the stre\u00e9t, turned on the electric light and began to look for a broom with which to finish some cleaning. Sullivan followed shortly, and when he had reached nearly to the head of the stairs, said to the plaintiff, \u201cCan\u2019t you keep awake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>for an hour?\u201d Thereupon a wordy altercation ensued in which sharp language was used, bad names called and ill temper displayed. In the end words led to a scuffle between the two men, and the scuffle ended by Sullivan drawing his revolver and shooting the plaintiff in the left leg.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b723-6\">Sullivan was not licensed to carry concealed weapons. A fellow roundsman testified that the night manager had given general orders for the roundsmen to take revolvers with them when they answered night watch calls, and the jury might reasonably have found that fact, although the operating manager testified that he knew of no such orders, nor that the roundsmen were accustomed to carry weapons in response to night watch calls. The then night manager was not present at the trial and did not testify.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b723-7\"><em>Frederick H. Wiggin </em>and <em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A78\">The first of the defendant\u2019s reasons of appeal is based upon the court\u2019s denial of its motion to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial. The plaintiff claimed a recovery upon three grounds, to wit: (1) that Sullivan\u2019s unjustifiable use of his revolver was the act of the defendant\u2019s servant in the course of his employment by and on behalf of the defendant; (2) that the defendant was negligent in entrusting to Sullivan, to quote the language of the plaintiff\u2019s brief, \u201can unlicensed, reckless young man, a loaded revolver in violation of the statute laws of the State, when it knew, or by the exercise of reasonable care might have known, that he was an unfit and reckless person, and liable to fall into a passion, and in that it did not select <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>a proper and fit person for the duties assigned him\u201d; and (3) that the defendant had ratified Sullivan\u2019s act and thus made it its own. The defendant asserts that the evidence failed to furnish a reasonable foundation of fact for either of these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The law applicable to the first claim of recovery is well settled. In <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Hills, </em>45 Conn. 44, 47, is a statement of the rule which has since been repeatedly approved: \"The rule is that for all acts done by a servant in obedience to the express orders or directions of the master, or in the execution of the master\u2019s business, within the scope of his employment, and for acts in any sense warranted by the express or implied authority conferred upon him, considering the nature of the services required, the instructions given, and the circumstances under which the act is done, the master is responsible; for acts which are not within these conditions the servant, alone is responsible.\u201d <em>Ritchie </em>v, <em>Waller, </em>63 Conn. 155, 160, 28 Atl. 29; <em>McKiernan </em>v. <em>Lehmaier, </em>85 Conn. 111, 114, 81 Atl. 969; <em>Carrier </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>88 Conn. 37, 40, 89 Atl. 894.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">From this statement it appears that there are three sets of conditions under which an employee may be liable for the tort of his agent, to wit: (1) when the tortious act is done in obedience to the express orders or directions of the master; (2) when it is done in the execution of the master\u2019s business within the scope of his employment; and (3) when it is warranted by the express or implied authority conferred upon the servant, considering the nature of the services required, instructions given, and the circumstances under which the act was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Consideration of the first of these conditions may be dispensed with, since there is no evidence or claim that Sullivan\u2019s act was done in obedience to an express order or direction of the defendant. If conditions imposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>liability upon it for Sullivan\u2019s wrongdoing existed, they must fall under one or both of the two classes last above enumerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The errand upon which Sullivan was sent by the defendant had not been completed when the altercation between him and the plaintiff took place and the shot was fired. But that fact is by no means decisive of the defendant\u2019s responsibility for Sullivan\u2019s act as one done in the execution of the defendant\u2019s business and within the scope of his employment. The test of liability is not to be found in anything so artificial as its occurrence during the period of the servant\u2019s employment or before a task entrusted to the servant has been completed. It matters not that the employee\u2019s working hours have not expired, or the task to which he has been especially assigned has not been finished. If he turn aside from his work or task to do something unrelated to the master\u2019s business he is, as long as he is so engaged, as much acting outside the scope of his employment as he would be were his working day ended or his task completed. <em>Morier </em>v. <em>St. Paul, M. &amp; M. Ry. Co., </em>31 Minn. 351, 352, 17 N. W. 952. The test is to be found in the nature of the tortious act and its relation or nonrelation to that which the actor was employed to do. A master is liable only for those torts of his servant which are done with a view of furthering his master\u2019s business within the field of his employment \u2014 for those which have for their purpose the execution of the master\u2019s orders or the doing of the work assigned to him to do. <em>Magar </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>183 N. Y. 387, 390, 76 N. E. 474; <em>Fairbanks </em>v. <em>Boston Storage Warehouse Co., </em>189 Mass. 419, 75 N. E. 737; <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Timmins, </em>178 Mass. 378, 380, 59 N. E. 1038. \u201cThe rule recognized in all the recent cases, and which does not materially conflict with any of the old decisions, although it may qualify some of the intimations or casual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>expressions or illustrations of the judges, is that for the acts of the servant, within the general scope of his employment, while engaged in his master\u2019s business, and done with a view to the furtherance of that business and the master\u2019s interest, the master will be responsible.\u201d <em>Mott </em>v. <em>Consumers Ice Co., </em>73 N. Y. 543, 547. \u201cIt is a general rule that an act done by a servant while engaged in his master\u2019s work, but not done as a means or for the purpose of performing that work, is not to be deemed the act of the master.\u201d <em>Dougherty </em>v. <em>Chicago, M. &amp; St. P. Ry. Co., </em>137 Iowa, 257, 260, 114 N. W. 902; <em>Bowler </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>162 Mass. 319, 320, 38 N. E. 498; <em>Fairbanks </em>v. <em>Boston Storage Warehouse Co., </em>189 Mass. 419, 75 N. E. 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The undisputed facts show that at the time the altercation arose which ended in the shooting, Sullivan had fully performed the errand upon which he had been sent, except that it remained for him to report to his employer\u2019s office by telephone and return to it with the card which the watchman had signed. Not a thing remained for him to do save to so telephone and return. He had no further business calling for conversation or dealing with the watchman. In so far as the latter was concerned his business was finished. When he left the hallway, whither the plaintiff in the performance of his work had preceded him, his only possible purpose connected with the performance of his assigned duties was to make his way out of the building either to seek an outside telephone or to return to the office of his employer, or both. His taunting remark there and then addressed to the plaintiff, which was the prelude of the verbal fireworks and personal conflict which preceded the shooting, did not have the remotest connection with anything he had to do for the defendant, and could not have been spoken either as a means of furthering his employer\u2019s business or with a purpose of furthering it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>This was equally true of all that subsequently transpired. In uttering the taunting language and in all that followed, Sullivan turned aside from the performance of the work committed to him by his employer to have a personal controversy of his own entirely unrelated to his employer or his employer\u2019s interests, and in no conceivable way promotive of the latter\u2019s business. The jury could not reasonably have found otherwise. \u201cIf a servant steps aside from the business of his master for never so short a time to do an act that is not a part of that business, the relation of master and servant is for the time suspended and the acts of the servant during that interval are not the master\u2019s, but his own.\u201d <em>St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>75 C. C. A. 536, 538, 144 Fed. Rep. 806, <em>808; Jacquemin </em>v. <em>Turner &amp; Seymour Mfg. Co., </em>92 Conn. 382, 103 Atl. 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">.These observations so effectively dispose of any claim that even if Sullivan\u2019s act was not done in the furtherance of his employment by the defendant, it nevertheless would be responsible for its consequences as one warranted by either the express or implied authority conferred upon Sullivan, considering the nature of the service he was called upon to render, the instructions given him, or the circumstances under which the act was done, that further consideration of that aspect of the case is uncalled for.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">It remains to consider the second ground upon which the plaintiff bases his claim to recover, to wit, that the defendant in sending Sullivan upon his errand, armed with a loaded revolver, was negligent in view of the conditions stated by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel as being those shown by the evidence. One of these conditions undoubtedly existing was that Sullivan was not licensed to carry concealed weapons, but that fact can furnish no basis for civil responsibility on the part of the defendant unless Sullivan\u2019s failure to have a license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>contributed in some way to the shooting. <em>Broschart </em>v. <em>Tuttle, </em>59 Conn. 1, 18, <em>21 </em>Atl. 925; <em>Farrington </em>v. <em>Cheponis, </em>84 Conn. 1, 8, 78 Atl. 652; <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Laskau, </em>89 Conn. 325, 329, 94 Atl. 370. It is plain that it did not so contribute, and the jury could not reasonably have found that it did. A license in Sullivan\u2019s pocket would not have tended to keep the revolver there, nor could the nonexistence of a license by possibility have been a contributing influence in Sullivan\u2019s use of the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Another condition stated is that the defendant, when it sent Sullivan forth with a revolver, knew or ought to have known that he was a reckless person, liable to fall into a passion and unfit to be entrusted with a deadly weapon upon such an occasion. We have examined with care the testimony and fail to find even a scintilla of evidence that the defendant had or ought to have had knowledge or even suspicion that Sullivan possessed any of the traits rightly or wrongly attributed to him by the plaintiff. Without this vitally important fact the plaintiff\u2019s claim falls to the ground, since plainly it cannot be regarded as negligence to supply effective weapons of protection to one who goes upon a night errand such as was that upon which Sullivan was sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim of ratification is based solely upon the fact that when Sullivan reported the shooting to his superior, the night manager of the defendant\u2019s office, no reprimand was administered to him and he remained.in the defendant\u2019s employ for three weeks or more thereafter. Ratification of torts by conduct can only be accomplished when the conduct relied upon is unequivocal and of a character that clearly shows an intent to ratify. To hold one responsible for a tort not committed by himself or by his orders, \u201chis adoption or an assent to the same must be clear and explicit, and made with full knowledge of the tort, and that the injured party claims that there has been a tort com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>mitted.\u201d 1 Jaggard on Torts, 44; Chapin on Torts, 226; <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Jerris, </em>75 Me. 184, 188; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>9 Johns. (N. Y.) 117, 118. Knowledge of the tort signifies not merely knowledge of the commission of the act, but knowledge of its tortious quality as well. 1 Jaggard on Torts, 44. To constitute a ratification, therefore, certain conditions at least are essential. The claimed conduct amounting to ratification must be unequivocal as evidencing an intent to ratify; it must have been had with full knowledge of the tortious quality of the act claimed to have been ratified, and it must have been had with the actual or imputed intent to ratify.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">These conditions could not have been found to exist in this case. It does appear that Sullivan reported the incident to the night manager, but it nowhere appears what his report was, or that reprehensible conduct on the part of Sullivan was revealed in it. Assuming that the plaintiff\u2019s story in court was an uncolored and complete one and strictly accurate, there is no testimony tending to show that the defendant ever had it called to its attention until after Sullivan\u2019s employment by the defendant had terminated, or that any story of the affair imputing to Sullivan improper conduct in it came under its notice before his departure. Even if it did, continuance in employment alone could not fairly be regarded as unequivocally evidencing an intent to ratify. Such continuance is too readily open to explanation on other grounds. <em>Everingham </em>v. <em>Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co., </em>148 Iowa, 662, 665, 127 N. W. 1009; <em>Kwiechen </em>v. <em>Holmes &amp; Hallowell Co., </em>106 Minn. 148, 152, 118 N. W. 668; <em>Buttrick </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>83 Mass. (1 Allen) 172, 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The other reasons of appeal do not call for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">There is error and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
