The finding conclusively settled every matter in dispute, save an item of interest amounting to something over $4, which it is claimed the court erroneously allowed. This did not justify an appeal, and our disposition of the case is manifestly controlled by <em>Neville </em>v. <em>Frary, </em>88 Conn. 50, 89 Atl. 882, and the earlier cases there referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
