The drenching so received caused lobar pneumonia, and from this disease McDonald died, eleven days after the drenching. McDonald\u2019s surviving wife makes claim under the Compensation Act against the City as a dependent of the deceased. The Commissioner held that the lobar pneumonia arising from-the drenching and resulting in the death, constituted an injury within the meaning of the Act, but that McDonald was not an employee of the City within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">Our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act applies only in situations where the persons are in the \u201cmutual relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>of employer and employee.\u201d General Statutes, \u00a7 5341. \u201cEmployer\u201d is defined by the statute to mean \u201cany person, corporation, firm, partnership or joint stock association, the State and any public corporation within the State using the services of another for pay.\u201d \u201cEmployee\u201d is defined as meaning \u201cany person who has entered into or works under any contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer.\u201d General Statutes, \u00a7 5388.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The first question arising upon the appeal is whether a regularly appointed member of the city fire department is an employee of the City? By taking the position of a fireman, did he enter into or work under any contract of service with the City as his employer? The Act in terms requires a contract relationship of employer and employee, and its privileges as well as duties are limited to those sustaining such legal relationship. Workmen\u2019s compensation, in the legal sense, is a creation of the statute, and courts have no power to extend its provisions to cases not fairly within the scope of the given Act. If the given Act is broader or narrower than what a sound public policy requires, the remedy lies with the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The Compensation Acts of the various States are by no means uniform in designating those entitled to compensation. For illustration: The Act in Massachusetts provides that cities and towns may pay compensation to such laborers, workmen and mechanics employed by them as receive injuries, etc. Under this Act it was held that a hoseman, a member of the fire department, a permanent fire force, stationed at an engine house, was not a laborer, workman or mechanic, and that these words were to be taken in their ordinary lexical sense, which excluded the trained and disciplined force comprising the Boston fire department. This case was decided upon the limitation as to kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>work done, and this Act is narrower in its scope than our Act which is based upon contract relationship alone. In Minnesota, on the other hand, both policemen arid firemen are entitled to the benefits of the compensation law under a statute which provides that employees and workmen shall be construed to mean, among other things, every person in the service of a city under any appointment, or contract for hire. <em>State ex rel. Duluth </em>v. <em>District Court, </em>134 Minn. 28, 158 N. W. 791. In Michigan the statute excepts from its operation \u201cany official of the State, or of any county, city, township, incorporated village or school district.\u201d Under this statute it was held that a policeman was, an officer and not an employee. In this case the only provision for the appointment of policemen was that authorizing the commissioners to engage such employees as might be necessary. <em>Blynn </em>v. <em>City of Pontiac, </em>185 Mich. 35, 151 N. W. 681. These cases, based on different provisions, emphasize the necessity of confining our attention to the language of our own Act, which, unlike those above referred to, makes the one and only test \u201cmutual relation of employer and employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">It is to be observed that the statutory definition of the word \u201cemployee,\u201d as used in the Compensation Act, is narrower in its scope than the general lexical definition. To \u201cemploy\u201d is \u201cto engage ... or keep for or in service or duty; procure or retain the services of.\u201d The synonyms are \u201chire, use.\u201d \u201cEmployee\u201d is \u201ca person who is employed; one who works for wages or a salary; one who is engaged in the service of or is employed by another.\u201d Standard Dictionary, words \u201cemploy,\u201d \u201cemployee.\u201d In this broad sense it may be conceded that a fireman is an employee of the city through its fire department; that is, he is in the service of the city under the provisions of the charter with the duty of suppressing fires, for a compensation. But our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>statute is founded upon the theory of a contract of service existing between employee and employer. \u201cThere must be a real contract of employment, either express or implied, or there is no 'employee\u2019 within the definition and meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>State, </em>89 Conn. 682, 687, 96 Atl. 161. It is apparent, then, that although the statutory definition of employer as including \u201cthe State and any public corporation within the State using the services of another for pay,\u201d is broad enough to include a municipal corporation, yet the definition of employee as one whose services are secured as a result of a contract, express or implied, restricts the liability of the State or a public corporation to cases where it has secured the services of another by contract alone. It is not necessarily the character of the service undertaken, but rather how the service is secured by the municipal corporation, which determines whether the person injured is within the terms of our Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The source of the power of New Haven, both as to the organization of police and fire departments, is contained in its charter, in form a public Act. 13 Special Laws, p. 388. It is therefore necessary to look to the language of the charter to determine the nature of the relation between the members of the fire department and the city. The charter provides for a substantially similar organization of the police department and the fire department, and some aid may be gained by making this comparison. Each department is under the control of a board of commissioners; the members of each department are appointed; in the police department all appointments 'and promotions, except the chief, are made by the board in accordance with the rules of the civil service board. Charter, \u00a7 47, as amended April 9th, 1901, and May 22d, 1907. The board fixes the pay or compensation of all members of the department except the chief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Charter, \u00a7 50. In the same way in the fire department, all appointments and promotions, except the chief, are made by the board in accordance with the rules of the civil service board. Section 55 as amended July 19th, 1905, and September 12th, 1911. ' And the compensation of the officers and employees of said department, except the chief, is determined by the board. Section 55. Then there are certain provisions common to both departments. By \u00a7 59 the board of each department \u201cshall have power to prescribe and define the duties of the members of such departments, and to make all rules necessary for the proper government thereof and the appointment of officers and employes.\u201d By \u00a7 60 the chief of each department \u201cshall assign to duty all the members of his department, making such changes from time to time as in his judgment the efficiency of his department may require. He shall have power to suspend, without pay, any member of the regular force\u201d [under certain regulations not now material]. Section 64 provides that \u201ceach of said boards of commissioners shall have sole power of appointment and promotion of all officers and employes of their respective departments, under such rules and regulations as they may adopt for the purpose, except where otherwise provided.\u201d By \u00a7 65, \u201ceach of said boards of commissioners shall have power, for cause, after a hearing on charges made in writing, to remove, reduce in rank, or suspend without pay, any officer or employe in its department that it has power to appoint. . . . Any officer or employe dismissed may make his application to any judge of the Superior Court within and for New Haven County in the nature of an appeal from such order of the board of commissioners,\u201d upon certain proceedings stated. Under \u00a7 66 as amended May 3d, 1901, a Policeman\u2019s Relief Fund and a Fireman\u2019s Relief Fund are established. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>By subsections 5 and 6 of \u00a7 66, two per cent per annum on the salaries of members of the respective departments is assessed for the benefit of their respective funds. Section 69 provides that the respective boards, with the mayor\u2019s approval, \u201cmay permanently retire any member of the department who, while in actual performance of duty and by reason of the performance of such duty, and without fault and misconduct on his part, shall have become permanently disabled, physically or mentally, so as to be entirely unfited to perform such duties; and either of said boards may cause to be paid from the fund of said department to said member during his lifetime ... a sum not greater than one-half nor less than one-fourth of his previous compensation.\u201d Section 70 provides that the board of each department may pay a death benefit of not exceeding $2,000 from the fund \u201cto the widow of, or other person or persons dependent upon, any member of such department who shall have been killed while in the actual performance of duty, or shall have died from the effects of any injury received while in the actual discharge of such duty.\u201d By \u00a7 71 all members of the retired lists in either department shall be subject to the orders of the board of commissioners of such department, who may require a re-examination of any member, and if reported capable of performing duty, he may be restored to service in the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The provisions for the civil service board provide for competitive examinations, and appointments are to be determined within certain limits by the results of such examination. Various terms are used when referring to the members of either department. The general term most in use appears to be \u201cmember\u201d of the department. In \u00a7 55 of the charter it is provided that the department shall \u201cconsist of a chief, a fire marshal, a superintendent of fire alarm telegraph, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>and such other officers and employes as the board of fire commissioners may from time to time prescribe.\u201d In \u00a7 59, relating to both departments, it is said that the boards respectively \u201cshall have power to prescribe and define the duties of the members of such departments, and to make all rules necessary for the proper government thereof and the appointment of officers and employes.\u201d In \u00a7 64 of the charter, as already quoted, each of said boards has sole power of appointment and promotion of all officers and employees of their respective departments. In \u00a7 66, with reference to the establishment of the pension funds, \u201cmembers of the respective departments\u201d is the designation. In the section on retirement, \u00a7 69, the language is \u201cany member of the department,\u201d and the pension and death benefit funds are concerned with \u201cmembers of their respective departments.\u201d We think the term \u201cemployee\u201d as used is not indicative of all of the relationship existing between the city and the member. \u201cEmployee,\u201d \u201cofficers and employees,\u201d and \u201cmembers,\u201d are used interchangeably as a general designation of the persons upon whom the duties of their respective departments are cast.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In a somewhat similar situation it was said in <em>Blynn </em>v. <em>City of Pontiac, </em>185 Mich. 35, 44, 151 N. W. 681: \u201cIn view of the distinction clearly made in the sections with reference to the police department, the word 'employees\u2019 used in this section should not be held to have been used in any other than the comprehensive sense of including all persons serving the public in these departments, whether filling an appointive office or merely occupying a temporary contractual relation to the municipality as an employee.\u201d We think a reading of the charter makes it quite clear that the use of the term \u201cemployee\u201d is not at all decisive of the question to be answered here, which is whether the service is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>rendered under a contract of employment. There is, then, no special significance to be attached to the terminology of the charter, and we return at once to the question whether the given person, whether called in the charter \u201cofficer, member, or employee,\u201d obtained his position by virtue of a contract of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The charter places the police and fire departments upon practically the same basis in all essentials relating to the organization of the departments and the method of securing the persons necessary to carry out the purposes of the department. In this respect whatever is true of one department is true of the other. The members of each department while engaged in the specific duties of the department are engaged in a public, governmental act for the public good. <em>Jewett </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>38 Conn. 368; <em>Judson v.Winsted, </em>80 Conn. 384, 386, 68 Atl. 999; <em>Pope </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>91 Conn. 79, 81, 99 Atl. 51; <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>45 Conn. 191. In the <em>Farrell </em>case the charter of Bridgeport provided with respect to the police department that \u201cthe common council shall have the sole power of appointment and removal of the officers and members of said department.\u201d And such appointment and removal was to be upon the nomination or recommendation of the police commissioners. Section 64 of the Bridgeport charter as quoted in 45 Conn. p. 192. With reference to the relation between a member of the police departmant and the city, it was said in the same case (p. 195): \u201cAgain, a policeman of the city of Bridgeport is an arm of the law; he holds an office as a trust from the State; he is a preserver of the public peace; he is not the hired servant of a master; no contract relation exists between him and the city by which he is bound to its service; he can lay down his trust at any time according to his pleasure without exposing himself to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>action for damages for breach of contract.\u201d We think this applies equally to firemen.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In the leading case of <em>Hafford </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>82 Mass. (16 Gray) 297, 302, it was said: \u201cThe members of the fire department of New Bedford, when acting in the discharge of their duties, are not servants or agents in the employment of the city, for whose conduct the city can be held liable; but they act rather as officers of the city, charged with the performance of a certain public duty or service; and no action will lie against the city for their negligence or improper conduct, while acting in the discharge of their official duty.\u201d This case was cited with approval in <em>Jewett </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>38 Conn. 368, and also was cited and followed in <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>104 Mass. 87, and we think is the established law of this State. To be sure, the present case is not one where the attempt is made to charge the city with liability for the conduct of its firemen, but the language of <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>45 Conn. 195, is significant as to the relationship, where it is said of the policeman, \u201che is not the hired servant of a master; no contract relation exists between him and the city by which he is bound to its service.\u201d And it is from this point of view that a policeman or a fireman is deemed to be a public officer, in that as an officer of the city he is the arm of the State in the performance of a governmental duty, as distinguished from one who is, by some contract with the city, doing work private to the city not involving the performance of a governmental duty delegated to the city by the State. <em>Schmitt </em>v. <em>Dooling, </em>145 Ky. 240, 140 S. W. 197, 27 Anno. Cases, 1913B, 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The claimant, however, says in effect that, granting that McDonald, as fireman,- was a public officer to the extent that he acts as an arm of the State in the performance of a governmental duty so that the principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>of <em>respondeat superior </em>does not arise from Ms relations with the city, the Act makes no distinction as to the character of his work, but only refers to the method of Ms employment. We therefore look a little further to see whether there is any contract relationship between the fireman and the city, even though, from the point of view of governmental agency, he may be held to be a public officer. As will be seen by reference to the charter provisions summarized above, the fireman becomes a member of the department as the result of an appointment by the named officials. \u201cAll appointments and promotions, except the chief, who shall be appointed by the mayor, shall be made by said board [of fire commissioners] in accordance with the rules of the civil service board.\u201d Charter, \u00a7 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Does such an appointment and acceptance create a contract of service? The cases are numerous that an appointment to a public office does not create a contract. <em>Sibley </em>v. State, 89 Conn. 682, 96 Atl. 161, goes far toward settling the question. It was there held that a sheriff holds'his office not as an \u201cemployee\u201d of the State, but as a public official under a trust from the State, which invests him with a portion of its sovereign power to be exercised in the interests of the public. This was a case of a constitutionally elected officer; but it makes no difference whether the officer is elected or appointed. The terms \u201celected\u201d and \u201cappointed\u201d are in contrast to \u201cemployment\u201d and \u201ccontract.\u201d <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Over-River School District, </em>53 Conn. 502, 3 Atl. 552; <em>State ex rel. Rylands </em>v. <em>Pinkerman, </em>63 Conn. 176, 28 Atl. 110; <em>State ex rel. Stage v. Mackie, </em>82 Conn. 398, 74 Atl. 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">In <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Port Huron Log Driving &amp; Booming Co., </em>11 Mich. 139, cited in Mechem on Public Officers, \u00a7 100, it was said (p. 147): \u201cIt is difficult to perceive by what process a public office can be obtained or exercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>without either election or appointment.\u201d In Mechem on Public Officers, \u00a7102, \"appointment,\u201d as used in this connection, means \"the act of designation by the executive officer, board or body, to whom that power has been delegated, of the individual who is to exercise the functions of a given office.\u201d Chief Justice Marshall, in the often-cited case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Maurice, </em>2 Brock. 96, 26 Fed. Cas. No. 15,747, said: \u201cIf a duty be a continuing one, which is defined by rules prescribed by the government, and not by contract, which an individual is appointed by government to perform, who enters on the duties appertaining to his station, without any contract defining them, ... it seems very difficult to distinguish such a charge or employment from an office, or the person who performs the duties from an officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">In <em>People ex rel. Sweeney </em>v. <em>Sturgis, </em>78 N. Y. App. Div. 460, 79 N. Y. Supp. 969, affirmed in 175 N. Y. 470, 67 N. E. 1088, the question arose under a statute regulating the hours of labor of employees, in which employee was defined as in that Act meaning \"a mechanic, working man or laborer who works for another for hire,\u201d and it was decided that firemen did not come within this statute because there was no contract of hiring, and this is said as to the position of a regular fireman (p. 463): \u201cThe word 'hire\u2019 evidently does not relate to public officers or others holding positions under the city, who are included in the classified lists of the Civil Service Law, such as the uniformed members of the fire department who are appointed to position after rigid examination and from competitive lists. No contract of hiring is made with them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">In <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>51 U. S. (10 How.) 402, 13 L. Ed. 472, it was held that the appointment by the governor of a canal commissioner did not constitute a contract within the constitutional provision as to laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>impairing the obligation of a contract. \u201cAn appointment to office is neither a contract nor is the office or its prospective emoluments the property of the incumbent.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Kenny </em>v. <em>Hudspeth, </em>59 N. J. L. 320, 322, 36 Atl. 662. The case of <em>Uffert </em>v. <em>Vogt, </em>65 N. J. L. 377, 47 Atl. 225, related to the office of receiver of taxes. The court, in holding that appointment to a municipal office did not create a contract, took occasion to compare at some length the different characteristics of appointment and contract (p. 380): \u201cThe appointment to a public office, for a definite term, and the acceptance of such office bears no analogy to a contract made between the government and an individual. In the latter the terms agreed upon define the rights and obligations of both parties, and neither may depart from them without the assent of the other. In the former both the rights and privileges as well as the duties of the appointee are prescribed by the government and not by agreement of the parties, and the government (in the absence of constitutional restriction), may at any'time, and without the appointee\u2019s consent, abridge those rights and privileges or increase those duties, or change their character; or it may put an end to them before the expiration of the term, by abolishing the office. On the other hand, although the appointee may accept the office for a definite term, his acceptance does not bind him to serve out that term. He may resign, or otherwise determine his official relation, without incurring any liability to the government by so doing. So, too, if he be guilty of malfeasance or neglect of official duty, the remedy against him is not by civil suit for breach of contract, but by indictment or impeachment. \u2018 Whether the officer be appointed immediately by the government or through the agency of a municipal corporation is immaterial. The duties to be performed, not the mode of appointment, constitute the test of his being a public officer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Is he invested with any portion of political power, partaking in any degree in the administration of civil government, and performing duties which flow from sovereign authority? If so his office is a public office,\u2019 and his relation to the government is, in no sense, a contractual one.\u201d See, also, 29 Cyc. 1366; 4 Corpus Juris, p. 1405.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">We have examined the cases upon which the claimant relies. In <em>McCarl </em>v. <em>Borough of Houston, </em>263 Pa. St. 1, 106 Atl. 104, the court held that a borough policeman was an employee and entitled to recover under their Compensation Act, but that Act defined employee as one who \"performs service for another for a valuable consideration.\u201d This language is considerably broader than the definition in our Act. In <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>57 Ohio St. 415, 49 N. E. 404, the action was <em>quo warranto, </em>in behalf of firemen who had been appointed under an ordinance subsequently repealed, to oust a set of firemen hired under a later ordinance. The later ordinance provided that \"the said council shall employ as many assistant firemen,\u201d etc. The court decided that the second set were not public officers, but simply in the employment of the city as laborers, and that their right to work for the city as laborers could not be challenged by <em>quo warranto. </em>The court admitted that the chief of the fire department was a public officer. The case is based on the Ohio statutes and the terms of the city ordinance, and the distinction between officers of the fire force and plain firemen within the organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">It appears from the citations above that this court and the courts of Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey, have ignored this distinction between officers within the force and the regular members of the force. The result reached may be right so far as <em>quo warranto </em>is concerned, for it has been held that \"'there are grades <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>of positions denominated offices which do not rise to the dignity of being entitled to the notice of the attorney-general by information. \u2019 \u201d <em>Blynn </em>v. <em>City of Pontiac, </em>185 Mich. 35, 45, 151 N. W. 681. The Ohio decision can have little or no bearing upon the question as it arises under the New Haven charter and the established law of Connecticut with respect to the position of fireman. Further, as to the precise point here in question, to wit, whether \u00e1 contract relation exists between the firemen and the city, the language of the ordinance in the Ohio case in terms provides for employment, while the New Haven charter is explicit in providing for appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Firemen are members of a regularly organized governmental department. Their powers, rights, duties and privileges are determined by the State through a delegation of power to the city, and accrue to the individual through appointment to membership in the department. Members may be promoted, reduced in rank, suspended or dismissed, with certain rights of appeal. They may be retired from active duty, but they still remain subject to the orders of the board of commissioners, and may be recalled to duty. In case of retirement for disability incurred in the performance of their duty, they become entitled, out of the firemen\u2019s fund, to from one quarter to one half their previous compensation, payable monthly for life. Widows or dependents of firemen who lose life in the service, may receive a benefit from the fund of not over $2,000. None of the distinctive features and incidents of the fireman\u2019s position arise through contract. As a governmental officer appointed to do governmental work he differs from a sheriff only in the manner of his designation by appointment instead of by election, and in the specific nature of his duties. The reasoning of <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>State, </em>89 Conn. 682, 96 Atl. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>161, applies with great force, and we think is conclusive.
