Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfS\">This appeal presents the question whether the trial court erred in striking the defendant's claim for a trial by jury. The plaintiff, The Home Oil Company, Inc., initiated a contract action against the defendant, Nancy Royce Todd, seeking the balance of monies due for a new heating oil system installed for her by the plaintiff, for heating fuel oil delivered and service provided to her, and for attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint in eight counts was filed on August 5,1982. On December 15,1982, the defendant filed an \u201cAnswer and Counterclaim\u201d to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. In the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, she alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s failure to repair promptly another heating system which purportedly caused \u201cgreat damage\u201d to her property; reliance on the plaintiff\u2019s promise to repair this system; and negligence on the plaintiff\u2019s part in its failure to repair it promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">On January 19, 1983,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plaintiff answered the counterclaim with a \u201cReply to Counter Claim\u201d and a \u201cReply in Avoidance . . . to the Counter Claim.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>essence, this pleading, according to the defendant, raised <em>\u201ca </em>defense analogous to contributory negligence\u201d; it also alleged that the service contract expressly excluded damages resulting from \u201cexternal causes.\u201d The gravamen of the plaintiffs claim in this pleading was that the defendant\u2019s failure to order oil for the heating system in question caused its breakdown and any damages resulting therefrom. Simultaneously, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel filed a claim for the trial list, indicating his election that this dispute be tried to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">A \u201cpretrial conference\u201d between the parties was held on April 7, 1983. Because this did not resolve the dispute, the court informed the parties that the matter would be tried on April 12,1983. The record and court file disclose that the defendant claimed the case for jury trial on the date of the conference. Apparently, there had been no discussion at the pretrial conference regarding the defendant\u2019s intent to claim a jury trial. The case, however, was not tried on April 12 because the defendant was away on vacation and, therefore, was unavailable. The court continued the matter until May 4, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>On April 25,1983, the plaintiff filed a motion to strike the defendant\u2019s claim for the jury docket,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> asserting that the defendant\u2019s jury claim was not filed timely in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 52-215.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to the plaintiff, the jury claim had not been filed within ten days from the time that the issues had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>joined by the plaintiffs \u201creply\u201d to the counterclaim. The defendant thereafter filed a \u201cReply to Matters in Avoidance\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on April 27,1983, in which she denied the basic allegations set forth in the plaintiffs \u201cReply in Avoidance to . . . Counter Claim\u201d that had been filed previously on January 19, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The case came to trial on May 4, 1983. Before the presentation of evidence, the trial court denied from the bench the defendant\u2019s claim for jury trial; defense counsel took timely exception to the ruling.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial proceeded and the court rendered judgment against the defendant on all eight counts of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Because the defendant again was on vacation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>and did not appear for this trial, the court, upon the plaintiffs motion, nonsuited the defendant on her counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims only that the trial court erred in striking her claim for a jury trial. She contends that the plaintiffs pleading in reply to her counterclaim set forth matters in avoidance that required a further pleading by her in order to close the pleadings. The defendant also maintains that the pleadings were not closed until she filed her \u201cReply to Matters in Avoidance,\u201d and, therefore, her claim for a jury was filed within the time limitations of \u00a7 52-215 because it was asserted prior to the date of her reply. We agree, and find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">We have stated that General Statutes \u00a7 52-215 \u201cprovides two periods of time within which an issue proper for trial by jury may be entered in the jury docket. One is \u2018within thirty days after the return day.\u2019 The other is contained in the provision which reads, in part, as follows: \u2018When ... an issue of fact is joined, the case may, within ten days after such issue of fact is joined, be entered in the docket as a jury case upon the request of either party made to the clerk . . . .\u2019 <em>Leahey </em>v. <em>Heasley, </em>127 Conn. 332, 334, 16 A.2d 609 [1940].\u201d <em>Amercoat Corporation </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>165 Conn. 729, 732, 345 A.2d 30 (1974), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Pfotzer </em>v. <em>Amercoat Corporation, </em>431 U.S. 967, 97 S. Ct. 2926, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1063 (1977); see also <em>Noren </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>72 Conn. 96, 98, 43 A. 649 (1899). It is the latter period that is involved in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">To ascertain whether the defendant\u2019s claim for a jury trial was timely, we must determine when the ten day period began to run, that is, \u201c[w]hen ... an issue of fact [was] joined.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-215. We have said in this context that \u201c[t]he word \u2018when\u2019 has been construed to mean \u2018whenever.\u2019 <em>Noren </em>v. <em>Wood, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>[supra, <em>98].\u201d Amercoat </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>supra, 732. We also have recognized that the issue of fact \u201cmust be formed by the pleadings in writing. See <em>Avon Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>30 Conn. 476, 488 [1862].\u201d <em>Amercoat Corporation </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>supra. Accordingly, we examine both the pleadings of the parties and the time frame within which they had been filed in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">At the outset, we emphasize that the construction of a pleading is a question ultimately for the court. See generally <em>McAdam </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>153 Conn. 278, 280, 216 A.2d 193 (1965); <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>103 Conn. 267, 278, 130 A. 571 (1925). When a case requires this court to determine the nature of a pleading filed by a party, we are not required to accept the label affixed to that pleading by the party. In this vein, we analyze the pleadings at issue in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The plaintiffs complaint alleged in eight counts monies due in contract for services rendered and oil delivered and for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in this action. In her answer filed on December 15,1982, the defendant admitted all the allegations contained in the complaint except those claiming attorney\u2019s fees. With her answer, the defendant also filed properly a counterclaim in three counts. See Practice Book \u00a7 116.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In response to the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, the plaintiff filed a pleading entitled a \u201cReply to Counter Claim\u201d as well as the following: \u201cAs and for a First Reply in Avoidance to the First and Second Count of the Counter Claim\u201d and \u201cAs and for a Second Reply in Avoidance to the First and Second Count of the Counter Claim.\u201d See footnote 3, supra. This pleading by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>plaintiff, in its entirety, addressed only matters concerning the defendant\u2019s counterclaim; it did not constitute a pleading responding directly to the defendant\u2019s answer to the complaint. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 171,172.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Under our rules of practice, a counterclaim, if proper, is an independent action. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 116, 168, 169; <em>Hanson Development Co. </em>v. <em>East Great Plains Shopping Center, Inc., </em>195 Conn. 60, 63, 485 A.2d 1296 (1985); see also <em>Schurman </em>v. <em>Schurman, </em>188 Conn. 268, 270, 449 A.2d 169 (1982). It has been defined as <em>\u201ca </em>cause of action existing in favor of a defendant against a plaintiff which a defendant pleads to diminish, defeat or otherwise affect a plaintiff\u2019s claim and also allows a recovery by the defendant.\u201d 1 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. (2d Ed. 1982 Sup.) \u00a7 129b. For purposes of examining pleadings relative to a counterclaim then, the party asserting it becomes the \u201cplaintiff\u201d on the counterclaim. Accordingly, the general rule is that \u201c[a] counterclaim should be pleaded in exactly the same way the claim would be pleaded in the complaint in an independent action.\u201d 1 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. (2d Ed. 1970) \u00a7 129g; see also Practice Book \u00a7 168 (a counterclaim \u201cshall be pleaded and replied to according to the rules governing complaints and answers\u201d). The pleading containing the counterclaim serves as the \u201ccomplaint,\u201d and the \u201cdefendant\u201d on the counterclaim, the plaintiff Home Oil in this case, responds to it by filing an answer to the counterclaim. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 112,168.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Subsequent to the filing of the answer to the counterclaim by the defendant on the counterclaim, the plaintiff on the counterclaim, i.e., the defendant in the original action, may have to file a \u201creply\u201d in response to the answer to the counterclaim. See Prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>tice Book \u00a7\u00a7 112,171,172. We examine the pleadings relative to the counterclaim in the present case under these procedural guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">As stated above, the defendant Todd properly asserted a counterclaim in three counts which she had filed with her answer to the complaint. In response to this counterclaim, the plaintiff filed a pleading entitled \u201cReply to Counter Claim.\u201d That pleading, under the circumstances of this case, despite its label, plainly constituted an answer to the allegations of the defendant\u2019s three count counterclaim. That the parties and the trial court mistakenly construed this pleading as a reply rather than as an answer to the counterclaim is not controlling for resolution of this appeal. See Practice Book \u00a7 3060D; <em>Mizla </em>v. <em>Depalo, </em>183 Conn. 59, 63, 438 A.2d 820 (1981); <em>Stoni </em>v. <em>Wasicki, </em>179 Conn. 372, 374, 377, 426 A.2d 774 (1979). In conjunction with the \u201cReply to Counter Claim,\u201d the plaintiff also asserted two \u201cReplies] in Avoidance to the First and Second Count of the Counterclaim,\u201d to which we have already referred. As already pointed out, these \u201creplies in avoidance\u201d alleged both \u201ca defense analagous to contributory negligence\u201d and a defense of disclaimer under the oil system service contract between the parties. These allegations were in the nature of matter in avoidance in that they introduced other facts inconsistent to those pleaded in the counterclaim in order to avoid it. See Practice Book \u00a7 172; <em>Holtz </em>v. <em>S. Landow Fruit &amp; Produce Co., </em>125 Conn. 358, 362, 5 A.2d 882 (1939); <em>Mahaiwe Bank v. Douglass, </em>31 Conn. 170, 177 (1862). Because these allegations pleaded factual matter new to the action in this case, the defendant Todd, as plaintiff on the counterclaim, should have been permitted to reply to them in a responsive pleading. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 112, 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The defendant\u2019s pleading filed April 27, 1983, captioned \u201cReply to Matters in Avoidance,\u201d constituted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>reply to the plaintiff\u2019s answer in avoidance of the counterclaim; the plaintiff\u2019s invocation of Practice Book \u00a7 173<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to invalidate this pleading thus is without merit. The defendant\u2019s \u201cReply to Matters in Avoidance\u201d cannot be considered a pleading \u201csubsequent to reply,\u201d under Practice Book \u00a7 173, and, therefore, the defendant was not required to obtain \u201cleave of the court\u201d to file it under that Practice Book section. In this case then, the defendant\u2019s \u201cReply to Matters in Avoidance,\u201d which denied the new matters in avoidance raised by the plaintiff in its responsive pleading to her counterclaim, was a proper and necessary pleading to join issue. See Practice Book \u00a7 129 (implied admissions). \u201cWhere responsive pleading is required . . . the issue is joined when the responsive pleading is filed.\u201d 2 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. (2d Ed. 1971) \u00a7 173. The defendant\u2019s \u201cReply to Matters in Avoidance\u201d was a pleading that joined new issues of fact in this case, and, therefore, the ten day period under \u00a7 52-215 began to run when it was filed on April 27, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The defendant Todd had filed her jury trial claim on April 7, 1983, a point in time when no viable ten day period under \u00a7 52-215 was running. We have recognized, however, that a \u201cpremature\u201d jury trial request \u201c \u2018remain[s] in the files until an issue [of fact is] joined. . . . The request, never having been recalled, was a continuing authority\u2019 to the clerk to place the cause on the jury docket upon the joining of issue.\u201d <em>Amercoat Corporation v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>supra, 733-34, quoting <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>80 Conn. 493, 494-95, 68 A. 977 (1908). Therefore, in light of the April 7, 1983 claim by the defendant for the jury trial list and the subsequent joining of the issue of fact with the filing of the defendant\u2019s reply on April 27,1983, this case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>required to be entered on the jury trial docket. <em>Amercoat Corporation v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>supra, 734. Accordingly, the striking of the defendant\u2019s claim for the jury was clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 3060D.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">There is error, the judgment is vacated and the matter is remanded with direction to restore the case to the jury trial docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-11\"> The pleadings indicate that the contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant involved four different properties located in Stamford.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-6\"> This pleading by the plaintiff is dated December 23, 1982. The record and court file indicate, however, that it was filed in the clerk\u2019s office on January 19, 1983. At oral argument, counsel for the plaintiff stated that he had mailed the reply and claim for the trial list on December 23, so that he could not account for the lapse of time between the date of the pleading and the date on which the papers were endorsed by the clerk of the court. The filing date as endorsed by the clerk on the pleading controls for purposes of determining the date a pleading is filed. See Practice Book \u00a7 127; see also Practice Book \u00a7 260 (\u201cAll claims of cases for the jury shall be made in writing, served on all other parties and filed with the clerk.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b347-7\"> This pleading provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">\u201cAS AND FOR A FIRST REPLY IN AVOIDANCE TO THE FIRST AND SECOND COUNT OF THE COUNTER CLAIM, THE PLAINTIFF ALLEGES:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">\u201c1.
