Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWn\">This case concerns the application of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) which has been adopted by both Connecticut and Florida, the two states directly involved in this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff husband instituted this Connecticut custody action against the defendant wife, a Florida resident, after her refusal to return their two minor children<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to him in Connecticut after summer visitation with her. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the action on the basis that Connecticut was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>inconvenient forum under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-97<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>to determine the issue of custody.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The relevant background circumstances are the following: The marriage of the parties was dissolved in 1979 in Florida where the parties had resided since 1969. The dissolution judgment gave primary custody of the minor children to the plaintiff and rights of \u201cliberal and reasonable rights of visitation\u201d to the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It also provided that neither party \u201ccan remove the children from the State of Florida without an Order of [this] Court.\u201d Moreover, the judgment also provided that the court \u201cretains jurisdiction ... to enter such Orders as may be equitable, appropriate and just and to insure compliance with this Final Judgment.\u201d Thereafter, on May 5, 1980, the Florida court entered a modification order pursuant to a joint stipu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>lation of the parties which provided, inter alia, that the plaintiff \u201cmay remove the minor children from the state of Florida, to reside in any location within the continental United States\u201d and that the defendant \u201cwill have custody of the children during the summer months ....\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In August, 1980, the plaintiff and the children left Florida and went to Columbus, Indiana, where they resided for about three and one-half months. The children attended school there.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff remarried on September 3, 1980, in Indiana. He then moved to Bethel, Connecticut, and stayed with his brother for four or five weeks until he could find a place for the children. The children enrolled in and attended school in Bethel. Thereafter, the plaintiff moved to North Carolina, where the children went to school and lived until early in September, 1981. The plaintiff then returned for two weeks to Columbus, Indiana, with the children who were \u201cenrolled in school\u201d there.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Sometime around October 1,1981, the plaintiff returned with the children to West Redding, Connecticut, and the children went to school in Redding. After living in West Redding for \u201cabout two and a half months,\u201d he moved in January, 1982, to New Milford where the children attended school until June, 1982. At that time, the children went to Florida to live with their mother, the defendant, for the summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>A week or two before the commencement of school in September,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the defendant\u2019s attorney wrote to the plaintiff requesting a modification of custody. The plaintiff refused and requested that the defendant return the children to him. She refused to do so. On September 9, 1982, the defendant filed an action in Florida seeking a modification of the custody award in the dissolution judgment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On September 15,1982, the plaintiff filed this action in Connecticut seeking enforcement of the Florida judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> By order dated October 1, 1982, the Florida court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for temporary custody and designated her as the primary custodian of the minor children whose residence was ordered to \u201cbe that of the [defendant] until further order of this court.\u201d In entering these orders, which were expressly designated temporary, that court, referring to its final judgment of August 8,1979, found that it \u201chas never relinquished its jurisdiction over the subject matter or the parties herein, and that [it] has the power, jurisdiction and authority to continue to issue Orders in this cause.\u201d Additionally, the Florida court in its order indicated that it had been advised that the plaintiff had initiated proceedings in Connecticut to request that state to recognize the final judgment in the original Florida action. It also noted that it was further advised that the Connecticut proceedings had been initiated on September 15, 1982, whereas the defendant had filed her Florida petition for modifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>tion of its final judgment on September 9,1982, when the minor children were in her physical care, custody and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Thereafter, on November 15,1982, after a full hearing in Florida where both parties were represented by counsel, that court issued its \u201cOrder Relinquishing Jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This order, inter alia, determined that Florida was an inconvenient forum for a custody determination because of the unavailability of witnesses, including the plaintiff, and that \u201cjurisdiction ... is relinquished by this Court to the Courts of the State of Connecticut . . . [and] that this Court will cooperate with the Courts of the State of Connecticut . . . including resuming jurisdiction of the cause should the Courts of the State of Connecticut express their willingness that this be done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">On April 25, 1983, a hearing was held in Connecticut on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss which was predicated on the ground that Connecticut was an inconvenient forum under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-97 for the determination of custody.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court granted the motion, finding that Florida should assume jurisdiction, and the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>The plaintiff claims on appeal that the trial court erred: (1) in dismissing his action, contrary to statutory and case law and the order of the Florida court, when the Florida court had previously made the determination that the issue of custody should best be determined in Connecticut; and (2) in refusing, contrary to statutory intent, to permit him to present evidence through the defendant as a witness in his own behalf. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The plaintiffs first claim of error is essentially threefold: By declining jurisdiction, the plaintiff argues, the Connecticut court acted in contravention of the \u201chome state\u201d concept under the UCCJA, the Florida court order that relinquished jurisdiction, and the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980 (PKPA). We address these prongs of his claim in that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The plaintiff claims that the Connecticut court erred in dismissing this action on the ground that Florida at the time was the \u201chome state,\u201d a \u201cfinding\u201d the plaintiff characterizes as contrary to the statutory definition of \u201chome state.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-92 (5); 46b-93 (a) (1) (A), (B).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The plaintiff cannot, as appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>at oral argument, establish that the \u201chome state\u201d concept was a basis for the Connecticut court\u2019s ruling from which he now appeals; the record does not support the plaintiff\u2019s contention that this question was actually decided. The issue on this appeal does not turn, however, on whether Florida or Connecticut is the \u201chome state\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-93 (a) (1) as the plaintiff seems to argue.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Rather, our focus is whether the trial court erred when it dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action pursuant to the UCCJA\u2019s \u201cinconvenient forum\u201d provision, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-97, which was the explicit thrust of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. In her motion to the Connecticut court, the defendant asserted four reasons for declining jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 46b-97. The court in its memorandum of decision on the motion to dismiss explicitly relied on at least two of those grounds, i.e., that Florida has a \u201ccloser connection\u201d with the children than does Connecticut; see General Statutes \u00a7 46b-97 (c) (2); and that \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d concerning the Brown children\u2019s present and future care \u201cis more readily available\u201d in Florida. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-97 (c) (3). We agree with the result reached by the Connecticut court and first address the factors that should be weighed by the Connecticut court in determining under the UCCJA whether the Florida court rather than the Connecticut court should adjudicate this custody dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>We note that the question here is not whether jurisdiction existed in Connecticut, but rather whether it should be declined pursuant to \u00a7 46b-97. These questions are separate and distinct under the UCCJA which envisages that where concurrent jurisdiction exists, only one state should <em>exercise </em>that jurisdiction. <em>Plas </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>155 Cal. App. 3d 1008, 1018, 202 Cal. Rptr. 490 (1984); <em>Hattoum </em>v. <em>Hattoum, </em>295 Pa. Super. 169, 175, 441 A.2d 403 (1982); see General Statutes \u00a7 46b-91 (a) (1) and (2); Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act \u00a7 3, Commissioners\u2019 note, 9 U.L.A. 123 (hereinafter UCCJA \u00a7 3, Commissioners\u2019 note).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Section 7 of the UCCJA, adopted by the Connecticut General Assembly and codified at General Statutes \u00a7 46b-97,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> permits the courts of our state to decline jurisdiction over custody disputes in accordance with that section. Moreover, in adopting \u00a7 1 of the act; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-91; the legislature has expressed the intent that it is the policy in Connecticut to \u201cassure that litigation concerning the custody of a child take place ordinarily in the state with which the child and his family have the closest connection and where significant evidence concerning his care, protection, train-\u2019 ing and personal relationships is most readily available, and that courts of this state decline the exercise of jurisdiction when the child and his family have a closer connection with another state . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-91 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">By its express language, \u00a7 46b-97 (c) directs the Connecticut courts, in considering whether to decline to exercise their proper jurisdiction, to \u201ctake into account the following factors, including but not limited to\u201d those enumerated therein; see footnote 3, supra; and thus contemplates that considerations that evolved under the traditional common law doctrine of forum non con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>veniens; see <em>Gulf Oil Corporation </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>330 U.S. 501, 508-509, 67 S. Ct. 839, 91 L. Ed. 1055 (1947); are not supplanted by the \u201cinconvenient forum\u201d provision of the UCCJA.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> UCCJA \u00a7 7, Commissioners\u2019 note; see also <em>In re Leonard, </em>122 Cal. App. 3d 443, 468, 175 Cal. Rptr. 903 (1981); <em>William L. </em>v. <em>Michelle P., </em>99 Misc. 2d 346, 352-53, 416 N.Y.S.2d 477 (1981). The common law principle of forum non conveniens provides that a court \u201cmay resist <em>imposition </em>upon its jurisdiction\u201d even when it has jurisdiction. (Emphasis added.) <em>Gulf Oil Corporation </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>supra, 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Moreover, the factors expressed in \u00a7 46b-97 (c) are to be considered in view of the overall goal of determining \u201cif it is <em>in the interest of the childfren] </em>that another state assume jurisdiction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 46b-97 (c); <em>see Agnello </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>184 Conn. 421, 429, 440 A.2d 172 (1981). The purpose of the inconvenient forum provision thus \u201cis to encourage judicial restraint in exercising jurisdiction whenever another state appears to be in a better position to determine custody of a child.\u201d UCCJA \u00a7 7, Commissioners\u2019 note. As we have noted in conjunction with the forum non conveniens doctrine, the \u00a7 46b-97 (c) factors are not preclusive. In passing, we also note that the \u201chome state factor\u201d relied upon by the plaintiff \u201cwas never intended to tip the balance of factors toward a new forum.\u201d <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>91 Wis. 2d 342, 356, 283 N.W.2d 591 (1979).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Declining jurisdiction under \u00a7 46b-97 is discretionary with the court. By the inclusion of the word \u201cmay\u201d in that section, the legislature clearly intended that the inconvenient forum issue in UCCJA cases remain discretionary; see <em>Breneman </em>v. <em>Breneman, </em>92 Mich. App. 336, 342, 284 N.W.2d 804 (1979); as is the common law forum non conveniens principle. <em>Piper Aircraft Co. </em>v. <em>Reyno, </em>454 U.S. 235, 257, 102 S. Ct. 252, 70 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1981), reh. denied, 455 U.S. 928, 102 S. Ct. 1296, 71 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1982); <em>Gulf Oil Corporation </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>supra, 509; <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>56 Ill. App. 2d 429, 433, 206 N.E.2d 535 (1965); <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Great American Ins. Co., </em>29 N.Y.2d 356, 361, 278 N.E.2d 619, 328 N.Y.S.2d 398 (1972). This discretion must be exercised in accordance with the overall pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>poses of the UCCJA; see General Statutes \u00a7 46b-91; which have been summarized by some courts as consisting of the elimination of \u201cjurisdictional fishing with children as bait.\u201d <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>District Court, </em>186 Colo. 218, 220, 526 P.2d 658 (1974); <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>464 A.2d 202, 204 (Me. 1983); <em>Spaulding </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>460 A.2d 1360, 1363 (Me. 1983). A determination by the court under \u00a7 46b-97 that Connecticut \u201cis an inconvenient forum to make a custody determination under the circumstances of the case and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-97 (a); will not be reversed absent a clear abuse of discretion. See <em>Szmyd </em>v. <em>Szmyd, </em>641 P.2d 14, 18 (Alaska 1982); <em>Loper </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>126 Ariz. 14, 17, 612 P.2d 65 (1980); <em>Plas </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 496-97; <em>Larsen </em>v. <em>Larsen, </em>5 Kan. App. 2d 284, 292, 615 P.2d 806 (1980); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>380 Mass. 454, 459, 404 N.E.2d 69 (1980); see also <em>Piper Aircraft Co. </em>v. <em>Reyno, </em>supra, 257. This standard of review is necessary in order to \u201cdiscourage continuing controversies over child custody in the interest of greater stability of home environment and of secure family relationships for the child.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-91 (a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The trial court correctly determined that Florida has a \u201ccloser connection\u201d with the children than Connecticut in accordance with \u00a7 46b-97 (c) (2), which provides that the court \u201cmay\u201d consider whether \u201canother state has a closer connection with the child and his family or with the child and one or more of the contestants.\u201d From 1969 to 1980, the parties themselves had lived in Florida where both children had been bom. Both children resided, attended school and received religious training in Florida until they left that state with their father in August, 1980. At the time they departed from Florida, the children were aged ten and eleven. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>time of the divorce in 1979, the maternal grandparents and uncles and aunts lived in Florida; the plaintiff apparently had no relatives living there then.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The defendant mother, \u201cone ... of the contestants,\u201d remains to this date a Florida resident, and the children since 1980 have lived with her there during the summers. A Florida court had entered both the original dissolution decree in 1979 and the stipulated modification of the judgment affecting the custody arrangement in 1980. The courts of that state, while \u201crelinquishing\u201d jurisdiction to Connecticut, also adjudged that its cooperation with our courts included \u201cresuming jurisdiction of the cause should the Courts of . . . Connecticut express their willingness that this be done.\u201d Accordingly, the significant and long term contacts demonstrate that the children have a closer connection to Florida than to Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">On the other hand, their connection with Connecticut is not at all close. They did reside here apparently from about October, 1981, to June, 1982, during which time they attended school here. Testimony was presented both about their itinerant life with their father from August, 1980, until October, 1981, and after that date when they had returned to Connecticut. The plaintiff, \u201cone . . . of the contestants,\u201d presently resides in this state. On this record, the Brown children\u2019s connection with Connecticut is slight in comparison to that with Florida.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Further, the trial court also correctly determined that \u201csubstantial evidence concerning the children\u2019s present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>and future care is more readily available in Florida.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 46b-97 (c), the court \u201cmay\u201d properly consider whether \u201csubstantial evidence concerning the child\u2019s present or future care, protection, training and personal relationships is more readily available in another state.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-97 (c) (3). It seems reasonable that the most meaningful resolution of the issue of custody would require evidence concerning the children\u2019s life in Florida, Indiana, and North Carolina, as well as in Connecticut. The children, who have resided in Florida since June, 1982, apparently can appear in court to testify in this matter.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This is noteworthy because \u201c[s]ince a custody proceeding is concerned with the past and future care of the child by one of the parties, it is of vital importance in most cases that the judge [have] an opportunity to see and hear the contestants and the child.\u201d UCCJA \u00a7 11, Commissioners\u2019 note; see <em>Agnello </em>v. Becker, supra, 430. Despite the fact that the plaintiff testified in Connecticut, he made no offer of proof that \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d was \u201cmore readily available\u201d in Connecticut than in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In passing, we note that \u00a7 46b-97 (c) (4), which lists as a factor that \u201cthe parties have agreed on another forum,\u201d is obviously inapposite. Another statutory factor set out in \u00a7 46b-97 is whether \u201cthe exercise of jurisdiction by a court of this state would contravene any of the purposes stated in section 46b-91.\u201d General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>utes \u00a7 46b-97 (c) (5). Although the trial court did not specifically discuss that factor in haec verba, this was dealt with implicitly in the court\u2019s disposition. The court properly found that the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d and \u201cclose connection\u201d factors militated against the exercise of jurisdiction in Connecticut. Those factors have been given greater emphasis by the drafters of the UCCJA, and were subsequently adopted by the General Assembly, as perhaps the two primary considerations in determining which forum should assume jurisdiction in child custody disputes. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-91 (a) (3). Accordingly, we are unpersuaded that the court\u2019s finding that Florida, rather than Connecticut, was \u201ca more appropriate forum\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 46b-97 was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The second prong of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is that the trial court\u2019s action \u201cin dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction in that it is an inconvenient forum expressly contradicts the finding of the Florida Court Order.\u201d The Connecticut court, of course, did not dismiss \u201cfor lack of jurisdiction.\u201d In assigning error to what was a dismissal on the basis of the inconvenient forum provision of the UCCJA, the plaintiff argues that returning the case to Florida places an unfair burden on the plaintiff especially as the children are in Florida because of the defendant\u2019s alleged violation of a court order. In doing so, he claims that the dismissal of this action by the Connecticut court endorses the violation of a court order and also ignores completely the reasons for which Florida relinquishes jurisdiction to Connecticut. We cannot accept the plaintiff\u2019s claim in light of the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">At the outset, we consider arguments that are implicit in the plaintiff\u2019s posture here and which he also urged upon us at oral argument: that Connecticut in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>passing upon the motion to dismiss on \u201cinconvenient forum\u201d grounds was \u201cbound\u201d by the Florida court\u2019s determination stated in its \u201cOrder Relinquishing Jurisdiction\u201d and that jurisdiction had been relinquished by Florida to Connecticut. The plaintiff\u2019s position misconstrues both the nature of the Florida court\u2019s order and the \u201cinconvenient forum\u201d principle within the statutory structure of the UCCJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The Florida court\u2019s order, as stated above, explicitly reserved the authority of the Florida court to resume jurisdiction over this dispute \u201cshould the Courts of the State of Connecticut express their willingness that this be done.\u201d The relinquishing by the Florida courts of their jurisdiction over this matter to Connecticut on the ground that Florida was an inconvenient forum clearly does not bind the courts of Connecticut to assume jurisdiction. It is for the courts of this state, and no other, to decide in proceedings brought here whether Connecticut constitutes a more appropriate or inconvenient forum for a custody determination. See, e.g., <em>Loonan </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>179 N.J. Super. 164, 168, 430 A.2d 975 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">We affirm here the finding of the Connecticut court that, in accordance with \u00a7 46b-97 (a), Connecticut is an inconvenient forum and Florida is \u201ca more appropriate forum\u201d within which to resolve this particular dispute. The touchstone of the UCCJA in general, and of \u00a7 46b-97 in particular, is the best interest of the child, not that of the parents. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-91, 46b-93, 46b-97 (c), 46b-98 (b); <em>Agnello </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>supra, 429. While it is true that the defendant did not return the children from their Florida visitation, their residency has been in Florida since September, 1982, by virtue of a Florida court order. We determine elsewhere in this opinion that the action of the trial court does not contravene either the UCCJA or the PKPA. We also agree with Chief Judge Breitel\u2019s apt observa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>tion that \u201c[b]oth the [UCCJA] and the case law, however, recognize properly that the apparent imperative to discourage abduction must, when necessary, be submerged to the paramount concern in all custody matters: the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Matter of Nehra </em>v. Uhlar, 43 N.Y.2d 242, 250, 372 N.E.2d 4, 401 N.Y.S.2d 168 (1977). In the present case, the trial court could, and did, properly determine the application of the inconvenient forum principle.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Moreover, the trial court\u2019s action neither ignored the reasons for which Florida relinquished jurisdiction to Connecticut nor did it \u201cexpressly contradict the finding of the Florida Court order.\u201d The Florida court in relinquishing jurisdiction to this state, in the spirit of interstate cooperation fostered by the UCCJA, expressly provided that such cooperation \u201cinclud[ed] resuming jurisdiction of the cause should the Courts of the State of Connecticut express their willingness that this be done.\u201d Both states involved have given real meaning to the purpose of their respective analogues to \u00a7 7 of the UCCJA which is designed \u201cto encourage judicial restraint in exercising jurisdiction whenever another state appears to be in a better position to determine custody of a child.\u201d UCCJA \u00a7 7, Commissioners\u2019 note; see General Statutes \u00a7 46b-97; Fla. Stat. Ann. (West 1983) \u00a7 61.1316. Their mutual deference demonstrates \u201c[t]here is no reason why [the] courts of one state should not be able to \u2018assume with confidence that the courts of the other jurisdiction will act with wisdom and sincerity in all matters pertaining to the welfare of [the] child.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>73 Cal.

There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>fore, it can be assumed that the Florida court will address the necessary concerns of the parties, including the claimed abduction of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The third prong of the plaintiffs claim is that jurisdiction should be exercised by the Connecticut courts under the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> because Connecticut is the \u201chome state\u201d of the children under that statute. See 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>\u00a7 1738A (b) (4). The plaintiff asserts that the defendant unlawfully and improperly detained the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>and, for that reason, Connecticut\u2019s failure to exercise jurisdiction is contrary to the purposes of the PKPA. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">As a threshold matter, we note that it has not been determined by any court of this state or of Florida that the defendant, as a matter of fact or law, has illegally detained these children. Nevertheless, declining jurisdiction in this case does not thwart the stated purposes of the PKPA.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201cBoth the UCCJA and PKPA were enacted to prevent jurisdictional conflict and competition over child custody, and, in particular, to deter parents from abducting children for the purpose of obtaining custody awards.\u201d <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>supra. The full faith and credit clause of the federal constitution; U.S. Const., art. IV \u00a7 1; supplies the constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>underpinning of the PKPA. See \u201cThe Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act: Constitutionality and Effectiveness,\u201d 33 Case Western L. Rev. 89 (1982). The PKPA provides that the courts of every state enforce a child custody determination of another state if made \u201cconsistently\u201d with the PKPA provisions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A (c). Geared as the PKPA is toward establishing national jurisdictional standards that endeavor to reduce interstate child abductions, the application of the PKPA to this case initially turns on the definition of a \u201ccustody determination.\u201d We believe that the orders of the Florida court which, in effect, generated this Connecticut action, fall squarely within the PKPA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>definition of a \u201ccustody determination.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A (b) (3); see <em>Belosky </em>v. <em>Belosky, </em>97 N.M. 365, 640 P.2d 471 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">That conclusion, however, does not in this case mandate the result claimed by the plaintiff. While the PKPA creates a preference for the home state, \u201cit does not significantly disrupt the jurisdictional provisions of [the] UCCJA.\u201d <em>E.E.B. </em>v. <em>D.A., </em>89 N.J. 595, 610, 446 A.2d 871 (1982), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Angle </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>459 U.S. 1210, 103 S. Ct. 1203, 75 L. Ed. 2d 445, reh. denied, 460 U.S. 1104, 103 S. Ct. 1806, 76 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1983). In <em>E.E.B., </em>the New Jersey Supreme Court held that the PKPA permits a \u201chome state\u201d; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A (b) (4); to \u201cdefer jurisdiction to another state on the ground that the other is a more appropriate forum. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1738A (c) (2) (D).\u201d <em>E.E.B. </em>v. <em>D.A., </em>supra, 610-11. We agree with the New Jersey Supreme Court that the determination whether a court of another state constitutes a \u201cmore appropriate forum\u201d under the PKPA involves consideration of factors \u201cthat [the] UCCJA enumerates as relevant in making a determination of inconvenient forum.\u201d Id.; see General Statutes \u00a7 46b-97. Therefore, insofar as we have determined that the inconvenient forum provision of \u00a7 46b-97 has been correctly applied in this case, we must reject the plaintiff\u2019s claim under the PKPA.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">We now turn to the plaintiff\u2019s second claim that the trial court erred by refusing to permit him, contrary to the intent of the drafters of the UCCJA, to intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>duce evidence in his own behalf \u201cin a critical hearing.\u201d The plaintiff maintains that the UCCJA mechanism for introducing evidence in a Connecticut court from out-of-state witnesses; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-109 (b) and 46b-108;<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> required the trial court, at the hearing on the motion to dismiss, to grant his request made at the hearing that the defendant, then living in Florida, \u201cappear to give testimony prior to the Court ruling on the motion before it.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> By denying this request, the plaintiff argues, the court in effect prevented him \u201cfrom presenting witnesses in his [own] behalf.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The plaintiffs brief first cites \u00a7 46b-109 (b) in support of his claim. That section, however, is wholly discretionary providing that the Connecticut court \u201cmay request\u201d the Florida court \u201cto order\u201d the defendant \u201cto appear in the [Connecticut] proceedings.\u201d In this case, the plaintiff asked the Connecticut court that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>defendant \u201cbe ordered to appear\u201d because he would be \u201crequiring\u201d her testimony. Even if this request sought an order under \u00a7 46b-109 (b), the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to do so, because the only issue before the trial court was that framed by the motion to dismiss, i.e., the application of the inconvenient forum doctrine.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Second, the plaintiffs reference to \u00a7 46b-108 in support of this claim does not avail him. Section 46b-108 permits, inter alia, the taking of testimony of out-of-state witnesses where they are located.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> No such request was ever made to the trial court. In oral argument before us, the plaintiff admitted that he had never tried to depose the defendant. Additionally, he never sought a continuance in order to take advantage of any \u201cprocedural devices available\u201d under the UCCJA.
