Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0y\">The defendant, John Manley, was charged by information with robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> larceny in the third degree in violation of General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>utes \u00a7 53a-124 (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and using a motor vehicle without the owner\u2019s permission in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119b.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> All three charges arose from the same incident. After a jury trial the defendant was found guilty as charged. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On June 20, 1980, Ann Twaroski, a school teacher, was returning in the afternoon to her home on Pardee Place, New Haven. While she was attempting to parallel park her 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass at the corner of Pardee and Fountain Streets, she noticed two young men sitting on a brick wall that surrounds the corner property. At the time, the doors to her vehicle were locked, and the driver\u2019s window was rolled down some five to six inches. Three other youths in the neighborhood had also observed these two men.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Twaroski\u2019s initial attempt to parallel park was not successful, and she prepared to pull out into the street for a second attempt. While the vehicle was stopped and her foot was on the brake, she turned her head from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>facing the rear of the vehicle towards the front, and suddenly became aware that one of the two men she had seen sitting on the wall was approaching the driver\u2019s side of her car. She heard <em>\u201ca </em>voice\u201d and \u201cturned around,\u201d and at that point, when she saw him next to the car, she reached in vain to close the driver\u2019s side window. Later identified by her as the defendant, this man, \u201cblack, in his twenties, sunglasses on, a dark jacket,\u201d however, had reached through that partially opened window and unlocked the driver\u2019s side door on the inside. He then opened the driver\u2019s side door using the outside handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">As he opened the door, the defendant said to Twaroski: \u201cMove over or I will kill you. I have a gun.\u201d She then saw \u201ca silver gun,\u201d the barrel of which \u201cwas fairly long and narrow.\u201d Twaroski did not comply with the defendant\u2019s demand, however. Instead, she resisted by screaming, grasping the car\u2019s steering wheel, and \u201cblasting\u201d the horn. The defendant then repeatedly struck her with his gun on her hands, shoulder, and head. He \u201cripped\u201d her watch from her arm and attempted to remove her ring from her finger. During the struggle, the defendant demanded that Twaroski \u201cmove over\u201d and, at one point, he placed his hand over her mouth. She finally managed to push the defendant so as to allow her escape from the vehicle, but she then either was pushed or fell face down in the middle of the road.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Shawn Rothwell, a fifteen year old newspaper carrier at the time, had observed, prior to the incident, the two men as they alternated \u201cgetting up\u201d from the wall in order to look into a nearby supermarket park<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>ing lot. To young Rothwell, the men appeared to be \u201cnervous.\u201d He then observed the incident in progress and ran to get his father, Michael Rothwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Meanwhile, Twaroski\u2019s vehicle, which was still in gear, began to roll down the street as the defendant attempted to get fully inside. As Michael and Shawn Rothwell ran down the street towards the scene of the crime, the defendant, seeing them, left the car, raised the gun, and \u201cfired\u201d it in the direction of Michael Rothwell. The defendant entered the vehicle and drove away. When taken by the defendant, the vehicle contained Twaroski\u2019s purse, wallet, driver\u2019s license, cash in the amount of $64 to $67, a gold chain valued at $100, credit cards, eyeglasses, and school-related materials. Three other young neighbors also witnessed the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Approximately thirty-five minutes later, Helen Myers observed the Twaroski vehicle parked on the northbound shoulder of the Wilbur Cross Parkway, \u201cjust outside of the [Wilbur Cross Parkway] tunnel\u201d but still in New Haven. Myers, who had been visiting with a priest at her mother\u2019s house in the Twaroski neighborhood at the time of the incident, was aware of the general circumstances regarding the crime when she observed the vehicle, which she recognized as belonging to Twaroski. About five to ten minutes later when she arrived at a shopping center in Hamden, Myers called the New Haven police department and reported seeing the vehicle on the parkway. Within minutes, Connecticut State Trooper Harold Lufgren was dispatched to investigate the vehicle; he arrived there within twenty-five minutes of that dispatch. Lufgren found the Twaroski vehicle abandoned on the parkway shoulder approximately 1.7 miles from the scene of the crime with the car\u2019s engine still running.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>The next afternoon, Wilburt Thorne, who lived a short distance from the defendant, found Twaroski\u2019s purse, wallet and identification papers in a parking lot by his home on Wilmot Road, New Haven, a three to five minute walk from the Wilbur Cross Parkway tunnel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thorne notified the police, and Twaroski\u2019s purse, wallet and papers were recovered and thereafter returned to her. Her money, gold chain and some of her credit cards were not recovered. Her watch, which the defendant had torn from her wrist, was found in the glove compartment of her abandoned automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Later on the day of the actual incident, Twaroski, who was still \u201cquite distraught,\u201d had been unable to identify positively her assailant from police photographs. At trial, she did identify the defendant as the perpetrator. The defendant was also implicated by latent fingerprint evidence processed from Twaroski\u2019s vehicle. Three such fingerprints were identified as the defendant\u2019s: a print of his left middle finger upside down on the top edge of the interior of the driver\u2019s door glass window and two prints of his right ring and little fingers on the top of the automatic transmission gear shift lever.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred: (1) in refusing to charge on robbery in the third degree as a lesser included offense of robbery in the first degree; (2) in refusing during trial to admonish the jury that an earlier set of his fingerprints admitted into evidence could have been taken by the police for a purpose unrelated to crime; (3) in denying his request to charge the jury that fingerprint evidence standing alone is sufficient for a conviction only if the fingerprints were found under such circumstances that they could only have been impressed at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>crime; and (4) in denying his request to charge the jury on the dangers of misidentification and the factors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of misidentification.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The defendant\u2019s most arguable claim is that the trial court erred in refusing to charge on robbery in the third degree as a lesser included offense of robbery in the first degree. In the first count of the information, the state charged the defendant with a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2). This count specifically required the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime of robbery; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> while \u201carmed with a deadly weapon, to wit: a pistol or revolver.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2). He contends that the trial court\u2019s failure to grant his timely written request to charge the jury on robbery in the third degree which requires no weapon be used as a lesser included offense compels a reversal of his conviction. The gravamen of his claim is that, because neither the actual weapon used nor any bullet was ever recovered,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>should have granted this request to charge on the lesser included offense. A careful review of the record in the trial court and the applicable law, however, require us to reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\"><em>\u201cIn State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), this court articulated a four pronged test for determining when it is proper to charge a jury with respect to a lesser included offense. \u2018A defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser offense if, and only if, . . . (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. Vass, 191 Conn. 604, 616-17, 469 A.2d 767 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The focal question raised by the defendant\u2019s claim involves the fourth prong of the <em>Whistnant </em>test: whether the evidence of the element that differentiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the included offense of robbery in the third degree from robbery in the first degree, in this case the \u201carmed with a deadly weapon\u201d element, was \u201csufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d Id., 617; <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra. \u201cWe must answer in the affirmative if viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shuman, </em>37 N.Y.2d 302, 304, 333 N.E.2d 363 (1975); reasonable minds could differ upon the existence or nonexistence of the element that distinguishes the inclusive from the included offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>180 Conn. 599, 610-11, 430 A.2d 1297 (1980) <em>(Healey, J., </em>dissenting). Otherwise the defendant would lose the right to have the jury pass upon every factual issue fairly presented by the evidence. <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>162 U.S. 313, 314, 16 S. Ct. 839, 40 L. Ed. 980 (1896) . . . .\" <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>185 Conn. 63, 77-78, 441 A.2d 84 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>185 Conn. 402, 423, 441 A.2d 119 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 989, 102 S. Ct. 1612, 71 L. Ed. 2d 848 (1982). This, of course, requires a determination whether the matter involved is \u201csufficiently in dispute\u201d under the fourth prong of <em>Whistnant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">As stated, the defendant was charged by information with a violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2), armed with a deadly weapon \u201cto wit: a pistol or revolver,\u201d so it was incumbent upon the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of the element of a \u201cdeadly weapon.\u201d A \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (6) as, inter alia, \u201cany weapon, whether loaded or unloaded, from which a shot may be discharged . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because neither the actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>weapon nor any bullet had been recovered, the defendant contends that the issue of the weapon\u2019s \u201coperability\u201d was sufficiently in dispute for purposes of the fourth prong of <em>Whistnant </em>to require in this case a jury charge on the lesser included offense as requested. We assess that claim on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The jury heard the following testimony regarding the \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d: Mrs. Twaroski testified that the defendant, upon opening her car door without her consent, demanded: \u201cMove over or I will kill you. I have a gun.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> She \u201cdid see the gun\u201d; it was \u201csilver\u201d and \u201cthe front of it was fairly long and narrow.\u201d The defendant had struck her repeatedly with the gun. She conceded her unfamiliarity with guns, but when she was lying in the street after escaping from the defendant, she witnessed the defendant \u201ccrouching slightly\u201d and aiming the gun in the direction of Michael Rothwell, who at that time was in pursuit of the defendant. She then \u2018heard the gun discharged [sic].\u201d Although Twaroski was rigorously cross-examined and also underwent three recross-examinations, defense counsel <em>never </em>directed any inquiries to her regarding her testimony about the weapon in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Jason Goldfarb, an eleven year old neighbor, testified that he first saw the \u201ctwo men sitting on the wall,\u201d then heard Twaroski \u201cyell.\u201d He also saw her lying on the street and Rothwell \u201ccoming down the street\u201d; he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>then heard \u201ca shot.\u201d There was <em>no </em>cross-examination by defense counsel of this witness. Stephanie Chandler, a fifteen year old, who witnessed the incident, testified: \u201cI saw a lady trying to get away from a man who was in the car, and she was banging on the door . . . I saw she was pushed out into the street, and I heard a gunshot; and I saw Mr. Rothwell turn up the street . . . .\u201d Later, on direct examination, young Chandler again testified that she \u201cheard a gunshot.\u201d On cross-examination, defense counsel asked her only one question, and it related <em>not </em>to her observations as an eyewitness, but rather to whether she looked at any police photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Newspaper carrier Shawn Rothwell testified, as stated above, as an eyewitness to the incident. He related that his father \u201cwas about 20 yards from the car when the guy had pulled out ... a silver-plated gun, and he [the defendant] brought his arm up like this, and he shot over with his right hand ... I heard the firing off.\u201d Young Rothwell reiterated that \u201cwhen he [the defendant] saw my father coming, his first reaction was, pull the gun out. And he took it out like this and he shot once.\u201d As with Stephanie Chandler, defense counsel\u2019s <em>only </em>inquiries on cross-examination of Shawn Rothwell were directed to whether he looked at police photographs of possible suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">More detailed testimony concerning the weapon was provided by Shawn\u2019s father, Michael Rothwell. Rothwell testified that he was about thirty or thirty-five yards away when he \u201csaw the chromeplated barrel come over and he fired.\u201d Michael Rothwell further testified that he had hunted with a variety of guns and had owned a variety of handguns. He had not been able to identify visually the defendant\u2019s gun because he had only seen its barrel, but he testified that the sound of the discharge was familiar to him as the sound of a .22 or .25 calibre firearm. He also testified that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>heard that sound \u201c[m]any times before.\u201d Defense counsel did voir dire Rothwell as to his personal experience with firearms<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but otherwise did <em>not </em>cross-examine him at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In sum then, five witnesses for the state testified regarding the incident and the gunshot. The defense neither presented its own witnesses nor did it cross-examine <em>any </em>of these five witnesses regarding their testimony about the gunshot. While we agree with the defendant that jurors in criminal cases should be \u201cfree to reject even uncontradict\u00e9d testimony, if they do not find it credible\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dudla, </em>190 Conn. 1, 7, 458 A.2d 682 (1983); we are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s claim that the \u201cproof\u201d differentiating robbery in the third degree from the charged offense of robbery in the first degree was \u201csufficiently in dispute\u201d under the fourth prong of <em>Whistnant </em>to require an instruction on the claimed lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">While this defendant, of course, was under no obligation to present evidence in his own behalf, we recognize as a practical matter that the defendant, for purposes of the <em>Whistnant </em>test, ought, in order to be entitled to a jury instruction on a lesser included offense, to endeavor to place a particular element of the crime charged \u201csufficiently in dispute\u201d under the fourth prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>This could' occur either through the right of cross-examination, the major function of which is to put certain matters in dispute, or through evidence presented as part of the defendant\u2019s case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>supra, 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>In this case, the defendant, as was his choice, decided not to pursue either of these courses. It is not at all improper that the defendant, requesting a lesser included offense instruction, bear an obligation, weak though it may be, to demonstrate that there is evidence \u201csufficiently in dispute\u201d to warrant giving the requested instruction. See <em>Rouse </em>v. <em>United States, </em>402 A.2d 1218, 1221 (D.C. App. 1979); <em>Day </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 A.2d 957, 962 (D.C. App. 1978). The fourth prong of <em>Whistnant </em>specifically requires that the \u201cproof\u201d be \u201csufficiently in dispute.\u201d Such proof is \u201csufficient\u201d when it is \u201cmarked by [a] quality [such as] to meet with the demands, wants or needs of a situation . . . .\u201d Webster, Third New International Dictionary. In the <em>Whistnant </em>context, therefore, the proof is \u201csufficiently in dispute\u201d where it is of such a factual quality that would permit the finder of fact reasonably to find the defendant guilty on the lesser included offense. This requirement serves to prevent a jury from capriciously convicting on the lesser included offense when the evidence requires either conviction on the greater offense or acquittal. See <em>Sansone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>380 U.S. 343, 349-50, 85 S. Ct. 1004, 13 L. Ed. 2d 882 (1965); <em>Sparf and Hansen v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 51, 63-64, 15 S. Ct. 273, 39 L. Ed. 343 (1895); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>551 F.2d 236, 239 n.4 (8th Cir. 1977). This rationale comports with the view that \u201c[f]act finding does not require mathematical certainty. [But] [j]urors are supposed to reach their conclusions on the basis of common sense, common understanding and fair beliefs, grounded on evidence consisting of direct statements by witnesses or proof of circumstances from which inferences can fairly be drawn.\u201d <em>Schulz </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania R. Co., </em>350 U.S. 523, 526, 76 S. Ct. 608, 100 L. Ed. 668 (1956). Moreover, the trial court, in making its determination whether the proof is \u201csufficiently in dispute,\u201d while it must carefully assess all the evidence whatever its source, is \u201cnot required to put the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>to the jury on a basis [of a lesser included offense] that essentially indulges and even encourages speculations as to [a] bizarre reconstruction [of the evidence].\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>444 F.2d 888, 890 (D.C. Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">We have chronicled at some length the evidence that goes to the \u201csufficiently in dispute\u201d claims of the defendant. We conclude that the trial court properly refused the request to charge. Any fair view of the evidence, short of one that would be speculative, shows that the matter involved was not \u201csufficiently in dispute.\u201d The \u201cproof\u201d under <em>Whistnant </em>must be \u201csufficiently in dispute\u201d; here it was <em>not </em>in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">In this regard, the defendant contends that his trial counsel\u2019s argument to the jury concerning the possibility that the gun may have been a starter pistol placed the element in question sufficiently in dispute. We do not agree. With no evidence or testimony of any kind before the jury that the defendant\u2019s gun could have been a starter pistol, it would have been \u201csheer speculation\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>190 Conn. 219, 234 n.7, 460 A.2d 961 (1983); for the jury to have considered that argument seriously. Cf. <em>Harpman </em>v. <em>State, </em>435 So. 2d 375 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1983) (starter pistol in evidence). Moreover, as a general rule, trial counsel should not state or suggest an inference from facts that are not in evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 575, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983); State v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 457, 450 A.2d 828 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinsey, </em>173 Conn. 344, 351, 377 A.2d 1095 (1977) <em>(Loiselle, J., </em>concurring); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>96 Conn. 160, 169, 113 A. 452 (1921). As rhetorical advocacy, the defense counsel's argument to the jury did not serve, in the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>of <em>any </em>proof during trial, to place the matter \u201csufficiently in dispute\u201d for the purposes of the fourth prong of Whistnant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">While the defendant maintains that the \u201csufficiently in dispute\u201d prong was satisfied by both the \u201cshortcomings\u201d in the state\u2019s case as well as his decision to leave the state to its proof, we do note that he has not articulated a claim that the verdict should be set aside because of insufficient evidence. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979). While this case did not require the requested instructions, we do recognize that \u201cthe jury\u2019s role as fact-finder is so central to our jurisprudence that, in close cases, the trial court should generally opt in favor of giving an instruction on a lesser included offense, if it is requested.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Comer, </em>421 F.2d 1149, 1154 (D.C. Cir. 1970). Under these circumstances, however, the proof on the element that differentiates first-degree robbery from third-degree robbery, as a matter of law, was not \u201csufficiently in dispute\u201d; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>181 Conn. 388, 400, 435 A.2d 1002 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1086, 101 S. Ct. 874, 66 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1981); and thus, the trial court properly refused to charge as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The defendant\u2019s remaining three claims concern the identification of him as the perpetrator in this case. The defendant first claims error in the curative instruction given by the trial court regarding the origin of a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>card containing Ms fingerprints. Specifically, he argues that the trial court erred in refusing to admonish the jury that his fingerprints on that card could have been taken by the police for a noncriminal purpose. This claim arose at trial when the state offered into evidence the card bearing the defendant\u2019s fingerprints; it had been used by the police for comparison with the latent fingerprints lifted from the abandoned Twaroski vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">During the course of laying the foundation for introducing this card into evidence, the police officer testifying described the proposed exhibit as <em>\u201ca </em>standard fingerprint card of the New Haven Police Department taken from the subject on October 13,1976, pursuant to a criminal investigation of the defendant, fingerprint card impression of the suspect involved.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Defense counsel objected and requested a mistrial or, in the alternative, a curative instruction by the court. The trial court denied the request for a mistrial<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and immediately instructed the jury: \u201cBefore we go back to any further questioning, I want to tell you as a jury apparently the witness made reference to the fact that this card, when a foundation was being laid to its introduction, was obtained as a result of some prior investigation of another incident unrelated to this particular activity. I am specifically going to instruct you that you are to disregard the fact that the card was obtained as a result of an investigation of any earlier activity. The only concern of this exMbit is only for what it actually represents; and it is not being presented to you in any respect with regard to any prior activity on the part of this defendant. So that you are to disregard any reference of that respect; and you are only to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>this in the light of what it actually represents as far as the information contained in this document.\u201d In addition, the trial court, during its charge to the jury, reaffirmed the obligation of the jury not to consider any excluded evidence or disallowed answers in reaching a verdict. Dissatisfied with the initial curative instruction, the defendant argues that under <em>State </em>v. <em>Ralls, </em>167 Conn. 408, 356 A.2d 147 (1974), this instruction was insufficient to dispel the implication that the defendant had a prior \u201ccriminal history\u201d and thus was \u201cmanifestly\u201d prejudicial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ralls, </em>supra, the testifying police officer, while identifying Ralls\u2019 fingerprint card, stated that he had obtained it from \u201c \u2018a central bureau for all the criminal arrest records in the State of Connecticut.\u2019 \u201d Id., 416. Appropriately, the <em>Ralls </em>trial court then interrupted the testimony and issued a curative instruction, which essentially attempted to dispel the notion that the card could have originated only from a criminal arrest of the defendant. In contrast, this case presents a much different problem in that the witness had <em>already </em>testified that the fingerprints were obtained pursuant to a prior \u201ccriminal investigation of the defendant.\u201d For the trial court here to have informed the jury, as the defendant desired, that the fingerprints could have been taken for a purpose unrelated to crime would have been, at the very least, anomalous in the face of the testimony already given by the officer. We note that in this case, unlike the factual thrust presented in <em>Ralls, </em>there was no direct testimony from this witness that the defendant had previously been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>arrested and the defendant does not claim that the exhibit itself contained any actual evidence of past crimes. Under the circumstances, which included both the immediate curative instruction directing the jury to disregard the origin of the card as well as the final instructions directing the jury not to consider excluded evidence or disallowed questions or answers, we find no merit to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in denying his request to charge the jury that fingerprint evidence standing alone is sufficient for a conviction only if the fingerprints were found under such circumstances that they could only have been impressed at the time of the crime.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The trial court, however, charged the jury on this matter that \u201c [fingerprint evidence is a consideration for you to rely upon and to support a conviction if the Defendant\u2019s fingerprints were found in the place where the crime was committed, in this case, the interior of the car, under such circumstances that they could only have been placed there when the crime was committed.\u201d The defendant complains that this portion of the charge failed to instruct the jury that fingerprint evidence is sufficient to support a conviction <em>only </em>under such circumstances. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>defendant contends that the jury should also have been charged that \u201c[tjhis is particularly true in the case of an automobile.\u201d See footnote 16, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">We have said that \u201ca conviction may not stand on fingerprint evidence alone unless the prints were found under such circumstances that they could have been impressed only at the time the crime was committed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>186 Conn. 179, 182, 440 A.2d 280 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>188 Conn. 645, 648, 453 A.2d 88 (1982); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayell, </em>163 Conn. 419, 426, 311 A.2d 60 (1972). Moreover, we have noted that \u201cgenerally, when a party submits a request to charge on a specific issue, it is the duty of the court to comply in substance with the request if it is applicable.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Annunziato, </em>169 Conn. 517, 529, 363 A.2d 1011 (1975). In the present case, however, because the essence of the request was given, any semantical discrepancy between the instruction as given and the rule as stated in both <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>supra, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>supra, cannot be considered reversible error. Moreover, as we have summarized above, the fingerprint evidence in this case was not the sole connection of the defendant to the crime. The victim identified the defendant in court, and the testimony as to the proximity of the defendant\u2019s residence at the time to the abandoned automobile and Twaroski\u2019s personal belongings go far in undermining the factual underpinnings of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court erred in denying his request to charge the jury on the dangers of misidentification and the factors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of misidentification. The defendant submitted to the trial court a detailed seven-part request to charge on identification, totaling in excess of nine hundred words. Instead of giving that, the trial court charged, inter alia, the following: \u201cNow, another important issue in this case is the iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>tification of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime alleged here. The State has the burden of proving identity beyond a reasonable doubt. It is not essential that the witnesses themselves be free from doubt as to the correctness of their identification. However, you the jury must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the accuracy of the identification of an accused before you can convict him. If you\u2019re not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was the person who committed the offense, then you must find the accused not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">\u201cAlthough we have indicated that a court should grant a request for a charge regarding the dangers of misidentification in an appropriate case, we have not found reversible error in the failure to do so where \u2018the conviction of the defendant did not turn upon the testimony of eyewitnesses who were uncertain, unclear or inconsistent.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Harden, </em>175 Conn. 315, 322, 398 A.2d 1169 (1978); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Maturo, </em>188 Conn. 591, 600, 452 A.2d 642 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>[supra, 393-94].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>George, </em>194 Conn. 361, 375, 481 A.2d 1068 (1984). In this case, however, not only were the specific instructions correct, but our review indicates that the charge as a whole fairly presented the case to the jury so \u201cthat injustice was not done under the law to the legal rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>182 Conn. 207, 211, 438 A.2d 418 (1980); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>172 Conn. 223, 226, 374 A.2d 203 (1977). Additionally, with the strong fingerprint evidence linking the defendant to the Twaroski vehicle, the identification of John Manley as the perpetrator in this case \u201cwas neither dubious; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>supra, 394; nor did it present any special difficulties. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harden, </em>supra, 322.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Maturo, </em>supra, 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-11\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 53a-134. bobbery in the first degree: class b felony, (a) A person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime: (1) Causes serious physical injury to any person who is not a participant in the crime; or (2) is armed with a deadly weapon; or (3) uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument; or (4) displays or threatens the use of what he represents by his words or conduct to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm; except that in any prosecution under this subdivision, it is an affirmative defense that such pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm was not a weapon from which a shot could be discharged.
