Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIK\">This appeal presents the question whether, under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the commissioner of the department of children and youth services (DCYS) must petition to extend a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>mitment of custody of two minor children, who had been adjudicated neglected, when their custody was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>committed originally to the commissioner but subsequently had been transferred to their paternal grandmother by order of the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>The following facts are critical to this appeal: On February 11,1981, the commissioner of DCYS filed in the Waterbury Superior Court for Juvenile Matters separate petitions, each alleging neglect of the two children involved in this particular dispute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The neglect petitions requested that both minor children, one then aged three years, nine months, and the other two years, four months, be adjudicated neglected and committed to the custody of DCYS.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After a hearing, the court, on September 23, 1981, found the children neglected and entered orders committing them, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 46b-129 (d), to the cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>tody of DCYS for a period not to exceed two years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Previously, the children had been \u201cplaced\u201d by DCYS, on January 26,1981, with their paternal grandparents with whom they had been residing at the time of the \u201cOrder of Commitment\u201d to DCYS. Under the \u201cOrder of Commitment\u201d to DCYS, the children continued to reside with their paternal grandparents, although DCYS possessed \u201clegal\u201d custody of the children. Thereafter, on May 4, 1982, the court, acting on DCYS\u2019 \u201cMotion for Transfer of Commitment,\u201d entered \u201cOrders of Custody\u201d that granted <em>\u201ccustody-guardianship\u201d </em>of these children to their paternal grandmother. (Emphasis in original.) DCYS continued to be involved with the case, however, by monitoring their education and therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Later, the natural mother filed a \u201cPetition for Revocation of Commitment\u201d on June 22, 1983.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This matter came before the court on July 19, and was continued to September 20, 1983, to enable DCYS to prepare a study of the children\u2019s situation. As prepared and submitted to the Juvenile Court, the DCYS study recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>mended, inter alia, that certain steps be taken by the natural parents and paternal grandparents of these children, who would \u201ccontinue to live with their grandparents.\u201d The DCYS study also recommended that the natural mother be allowed weekly visitation \u201cin a structured setting\u201d with the children. All parties apparently agreed to abide by the DCYS recommendations, which were incorporated into orders of the court. The court then continued the matter to December 14, 1983, for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Thereafter, DCYS, on December 12, 1983, submitted to the court an \u201caddendum\u201d to its original study. This \u201caddendum\u201d recommended, inter alia, that the natural mother\u2019s petition for revocation of commitment be denied but that the children\u2019s commitment be retransferred to DCYS for an eighteen-month period during which time the children would continue to reside with the paternal grandparents while remaining \u201cunder the protective supervision of DCYS. . . .\u2019\u2019On December 14, 1983, the court requested that the paternal grandmother file a motion for clarification of the orders of custody,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which she accordingly filed on December 20,1983, in conjunction with her motion for continuation of custody of the two children.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In response to these motions, the court sua sponte dismissed the natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>mother\u2019s petition for revocation of commitment, finding that \u201cthere is no matter pending before this court, the original commitment having expired.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While no articulation of this ruling was sought, the parties agree that the court dismissed the natural mother\u2019s petition for revocation of commitment on the ground that the maximum statutory period for which the children\u2019s custody had been committed to DCYS had elapsed; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (d); and because of a lack of appropriate action by that agency to extend the period pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 (e), the order transferring custody of the minor children to their paternal grandmother had lapsed. Under this decision custody of these children hence reverted to their natural parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">On appeal, both appellants, the paternal grandmother and DCYS, claim that the court erred in concluding that the \u201ccommitment\u201d in each case had expired for failure of DCYS to petition the court for an extension of commitment in accordance with \u00a7 46b-129 (e). We find error and hold that the statutory eighteen month maximum period of commitment to DCYS does not apply to those cases in which custody of children, adjudicated neglected, has been vested pursuant to a Superior Court order in an appropriate third party under \u00a7 46b-129 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We recognize initially that the established public policy in this state is \u201c[t]o protect children whose health and welfare may be adversely affected through injury and neglect; to strengthen the family and to make the home safe for children by enhancing the parental capacity for good child care; [and] to provide a temporary or permanent nurturing and safe environment for children when necessary . . . .\u201d General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\u00a7 17-38a (a); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>189 Conn. 276, 283, 455 A.2d 1313 (1983); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>177 Conn. 648, 660, 420 A.2d 875 (1979). We are also aware that \u201cthe right to family integrity is not a right of the parents alone, but \u2018encompasses the reciprocal rights of both parents and children. . . \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>supra, 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The sole question presented here turns primarily on the interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129. We have said that \u201c[t]he meaning to be given a statute is determined by legislative intent and that legislative intent must be determined by language actually used in the legislation.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Eason </em>v. <em>Welfare Commissioner, </em>171 Conn. 630, 634, 370 A.2d 1082 (1976), cert. denied, 432 U.S. 907, 97 S. Ct. 2953, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1079 (1977) (child welfare statutes construed). We accordingly examine the express language of \u00a7 46b-129.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Section 46b-129 governs petitions for adjudication of neglected children and the appropriate \u201ccommitment\u201d of their custody. After a judicial determination that a child is \u201cuncared-for, neglected or dependent\u201d the Superior Court has available three possible options from which to choose regarding custody of that child: (1) to \u201ccommit [the child] to the commissioner of children and youth services\u201d; (2) to \u201cvest such child\u2019s or youth\u2019s care and personal custody\u201d in a third party until the child reaches the age of eighteen; or (3) to permit the natural parent to retain custody and guardianship of the child,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> with or without protective supervision by DCYS. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Until the enactment of Public Acts 1979, No. 79-579, no significant distinction existed, at least for the purposes of the duration of a commitment of custody, between a \u201ccommitment\u201d to DCYS of the child\u2019s custody and the \u201cvesting\u201d of custody in an appropriate third party; both dispositions could continue without further subsequent action until the child reached the age of eighteen. This 1979 legislation established, however, a two year maximum time limit as the period of the commitment of custody. Public Acts 1979, No. 79-579.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That time limit, which was subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>reduced by the legislature to eighteen months; see footnote 4, supra; was placed only upon \u201ccommitments\u201d made \u201cto the commissioner of children and youth services.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (d). Child custody \u201cvested\u201d in appropriate third parties by the court, however, remained statutorily unrestricted in terms of any duration on the period of such custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">This 1979 provision, inter alia, required the \u201ccommissioner of children and youth services,\u201d at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u201cninety days before the expiration\u201d of \u201ceach two-year commitment made in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section [46b-129],\u201d to petition the court to \u201c(1) revoke such commitment\u201d; \u201c(2) terminate parental rights\u201d in accordance with \u00a7 17-43a; or \u201c(3) extend the commitment beyond such two-year period on the ground that an extension is in the best interest of the child.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 46b-129 (e). The 1979 amendment by its terms applied only to commitments \u201cmade in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d)\u201d and was not made applicable by the legislature to \u00a7 46b-129 (g). No \u201cninety day rule\u201d or requirement similar to \u00a7 46b-129 (e) was imposed by the General Assembly on court orders entered pursuant to the \u201ctransfer\u201d or \u201ctermination\u201d of commitment provision of \u00a7 46b-129 (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">With that statutory scheme in mind, we examine the posture of the parties on appeal. The natural mother contends that the trial court did not err because the maximum period of commitment to DCYS, without any judicially approved extension, is eighteen months under \u00a7 46b-129 (d); no such extension was requested by DCYS in accordance with \u00a7 46b-129 (e), and, therefore, the original commitment of the children to DCYS expired. She further argues that the transfer of commitment to the paternal grandmother did not obviate the requirement that DCYS petition the court for an extension of commitment pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 (e) (3). The paternal grandmother, on the other hand, argues that the court, by transferring \u201ccustody-guardianship\u201d of the children to her, \u201cvested\u201d custody in accordance with \u00a7 46b-129 (d) in her as a \u201cperson found to be suitable and worthy of such responsibility by the court.\u201d The grandmother argues that DCYS involvement, as it relates to the commitment to the commissioner, has been terminated under \u00a7 46b-129 (g) and that there was accordingly no requirement for an extension request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>by the commissioner under \u00a7 46b-129 (e) (3). The attorney general emphasizes that because the court \u201ctransferred commitment,\u201d the commissioner was in no position to file a petition to extend the commitment under \u00a7 46b-129 (e) in behalf of the relative; by the court\u2019s vesting of custody in the paternal grandmother under \u00a7 46b-129 (d), the commissioner no longer had any control over the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The commitment of the children to DCYS in the present case was ordered on September 23,1981, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 (d), by the Superior Court, which had found them to be neglected. Prior to the expiration of this commitment to DCYS, the Superior Court, on May 4, 1982, acting under \u00a7 46b-129 (g) \u201crevoked\u201d the commitment and \u201ctransferred\u201d the custody of the children to the paternal grandmother. The legal effect of that transfer of custody was to \u201cvest\u201d custody-guardianship of the children in the paternal grandmother, in accordance with the second option set forth in \u00a7 46b-129 (d) that was available to the court;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as a result, the children were no longer \u201ccommitted\u201d to the custody of DCYS.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because there was no longer any commitment of the children to DCYS, \u00a7 46b-129 (e) imposed no obligation upon the DCYS commissioner to petition the court to act in accordance with the ninety day rule of that provision. The statutory scheme involving the commitment of the custody of neglected children does not impose an obligation upon the paternal grandmother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>in this case to petition the court to extend their commitment to her in order to avoid any automatic revocation for failure to follow the ninety day time frame that might have arisen had the commitment remained with the DCYS commissioner. In the absence of such a legislative directive, we decline any invitation to impose judicially upon such a third party an obligation corresponding to the statutory mandate that \u00a7 46b-129 (e) imposes on the DCYS commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The result that we reach here comports with the legislative intent to affix time limits to commitments of custody to DCYS. <em>See Skorpios Properties, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Waage, </em>172 Conn. 152, 154-55, 374 A.2d 165 (1976). Statutes should be construed to give effect, when possible, to legislative intent. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 6, 434 A.2d 293 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>180 Conn. 557, 561, 429 A.2d 960 (1980); <em>Winchester v. Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations, </em>175 Conn. 349, 359-60, 402 A.2d 332 (1978); <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>173 Conn. 223, 226, 377 A.2d 299 (1977); <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 505-506, 313 A.2d 53 (1972), appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 911, 34 L. Ed. 2d 678 (1973). We are aware, however, that \u201c[cjourts cannot import into legislation an intent not expressed in some appropriate manner.\u201d <em>Loew </em>v. <em>Falsey, </em>144 Conn. 67, 72, 127 A.2d 67 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The legislative intent underlying the maximum period of commitment is twofold: First, the General Assembly recognized a concern for those children, committed by the court to the DCYS commissioner, and who then were placed in foster care for indeterminate and often lengthy periods of time without any further judicial review. 22 S. Proc., Pt. 17, 1979 Sess., pp. 5859-60, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>5862;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 22 H. R. Proc., Pt. 24, 1979 Sess., pp. 8449-51, 8454, 8455.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The legislative limitation on the period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>of commitment to DCYS clearly promoted periodic judicial review of actions taken, including placements of children in foster homes by that agency. Second, the General Assembly intended to conform the Connecticut State Plan for Foster Care and Adoption Assistance to the requirements of federal law. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 670 through 675. One of these federally imposed requirements was that the state plan must \u201cassure each child in foster care <em>under the supervision of the State </em>of a dispositional hearing to be held, in a family or juvenile court . . . of competent jurisdiction . . . no later than eighteen months after the original placement (and periodically thereafter during the continuation of foster care), which hearing shall determine the future status of the child (including, but not limited to, whether the child should be returned to the parent, should be continued in foster care for a specified period, should be placed for adoption, or should (because of the child\u2019s special needs or circumstances) be continued in foster care on a permanent or long-term basis) . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675 (5) (C); see Sen. Rep., No. 96-336, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 4, reprinted in 1980 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News, 1448, 1453. Provision in the Connecticut plan for judicial review of such cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>at least every eighteen months advanced compliance with that particular federal mandate of Public Law No. 96-272, 94 Stat. 510, 514 (1980) (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675 [5] [C]), and thereby served to satisfy congressionally imposed conditions for the continuance of federal funding in this area.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 671 (a) (16) and (b), 675 (5) (B) and (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The legislative concerns underlying the establishment of the time limits of \u00a7 46b-129 (d) and (e) are thus unambiguous: to establish a durational limitation on the frequently lengthy placement of children in foster homes or other institutions while committed to DCYS so as to require periodic judicial review of their cases. The legislature, however, did not contemplate mandatory, periodic judicial review of cases in which custody, rather than ordered as a commitment of the child to DCYS, had been vested by the court in an appropriate third party in accordance with \u00a7 46b-129 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>In her brief on appeal, the mother argues that the \u201ctransfer of commitment of the children . . . to their paternal grandmother . . . was not a legal appointment of another guardian . . . because appointment of a [legal] guardian for a minor [child] is within the jurisdiction of the Court of Probate\u201d rather than in the Juvenile Court. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45-43a, 45-44c, 45-45.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This issue was not raised in the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>below; in fact, the mother herself agreed, in September, 1983, that custody remain in the paternal grandmother in accordance with the DCYS study, which also provided for continuation of a visitation plan for the mother with the children. The question of subject matter jurisdiction, however, may be raised at any time in the proceedings. Practice Book \u00a7 3110; <em>Laurel Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>194 Conn. 677, 679 n.1, 485 A.2d 1272 (1984); <em>State ex rel.

We address the mother\u2019s argument, but we do not agree with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Since July 1,1978, jurisdiction over juvenile matters in this state has been vested in the Superior Court. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-122 (formerly \u00a7 51-303). The legislature has defined \u201cjuvenile matters\u201d to \u201cinclude all proceedings concerning uncared-for, neglected or dependent children and youth and delinquent children within this state, termination of parental rights of children committed to a state agency, matters concerning families with service needs and contested termination of parental rights transferred from the probate court, but does not include matters of guardianship and adoption or matters affecting property rights of any child or youth <em>over which the probate court has jurisdic</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>tion. </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In addition, the General Assembly has granted to \u201cthe superior court which has venue\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (a); jurisdiction over neglect petitions and the commitment of custody-guardianship of children who have been adjudicated \u201cuncared-for, neglected or dependent.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (d); see <em>Hospital Administrator </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1979-5), </em>35 Conn. Sup. 241, 243, 406 A.2d 871 (1979). As we noted above, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (d) authorizes the court to commit custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>to DCYS or to \u201cvest such child\u2019s or youth\u2019s care and personal custody . . . with any person found to be suitable and worthy of such responsibility by the court . . . and . . . upon such vesting of his care, such other . . . individual shall be the guardian of such child or youth . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">We recognize that the Probate Court holds jurisdiction over certain guardianship matters involving children. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45-43a, 45-44c, 45-45; see also General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121. We also recognize that the ultimate effect of a custody-guardianship vested by the Superior Court in a \u201csuitable and worthy\u201d third party pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 (d) may be identical to that rendered by an appointment of guardianship made by the Probate Court. \u201c[WJhen two statutes relate to the same subject matter every effort should be made to find a reasonable field for the operation of both statutes. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carbone, </em>172 Conn. 242, 256, 374 A.2d 215 [cert. denied, 431 U.S. 967, 97 S.

Accordingly, we construe \u00a7 46b-129 (d) as conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the Superior Court to enter \u201ccustody-guardianship orders\u201d in those cases in which there is a \u201cfinding and adjudging\u201d by that court that the \u201cchild or youth is uncared-for, neglected or dependent,\u201d and this finding, moreover, must be the product of a neglect petition filed with the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129. This construction still allows effect to be given those provisions of our statutes that authorize the Probate Court in cases not brought under \u00a7 46b-129 to remove a parent as guardian and then to appoint a guardian of a minor under such statutes as General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45-43a, 45-44, 45-44c, 45-45.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Finally, we note that the Superior Court\u2019s transfer of \u201ccommitment\u201d of these children vesting custody-guardianship in their grandmother is without question an order subject to modification by that court if such is in the best interests of the children. We have already stated that \u201can adjudication of neglect that results in custody by DCYS is neither final nor irrevocable.\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (844-AB), </em>192 Conn. 254, 264, 471 A.2d 1380 (1984). We perceive no reason, nor did the legislature express one, to insulate such a vesting under \u00a7 46b-129 (d) to a third party from subsequent modification or revocation. Both the attorney general and the paternal grandmother, in their briefs, concede that the natural mother may petition the court any time prior to the child\u2019s eighteenth birthday for revocation of the commitment to the grandmother. A judicial hearing would then provide to the natural mother the opportunity of showing that no cause for \u201ccommitment\u201d exists.

In other words, it provides for a court review of the case in 18 months, rather than at the end of 2 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">\u201cPassage of this bill would put Connecticut in conformity with the Federal Mandate of Public Law 96-272 \u2014 The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act.

The following persons may apply to the court of probate for the district in which the minor resides for the removal as guardian of one or both parents of the minor: (1) Any adult relative of the minor, including those by blood or marriage; (2) the court on its own motion; or (3) counsel for the minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 45-44c. removal of parent as guardian. If the court of probate finds that notice has been given or a waiver has been filed, as provided in section 45-44b, it may remove a parent as guardian, if the court finds one of the following: (1) The parent consents to his or her removal as guardian; or (2) the minor child has been abandoned by the parent in the sense that the parent has failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility for the minor\u2019s welfare; or (3) the minor child has been denied the care, guidance or control necessary for his or her physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being, as a result of acts of parental commission or omission, whether the acts are the result of the physical or mental incapability of the parent or conditions attributable to parental habits, misconduct or neglect, and the parental acts or deficiencies support the conclusion that the parent cannot exercise, or should not in the best interests of the minor child be permitted to exercise, parental rights and duties at this time; or (4) there are no identifiable acts of parental commission or omission as set forth in subdivision (3) of this section, but it nevertheless appears to the court that: (A) There is no ongoing, parent-child relationship which is defined as the relationship that develops as a result of a parent\u2019s having met on a continuing day to day basis the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the minor child; and (B) to allow further time for the establishment or reestablishment of the parent-child relationship, at this time, would be detrimental to the best interests of the minor child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 45-45. appointment of guardian for minor; rights same as of sole surviving parent, (a) If any minor has no parent or guardian of his or her person, the court of probate for the district in which the minor resides may, on its own motion, appoint a guardian of the person of the minor, taking into consideration the standards provided in section 45-45b. Such court shall take of such guardian a written accept<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ance of guardianship and, if the court deems it necessary for the protection of the minor, a probate bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">\u201c(b) When appointing a guardian under this section, the court shall take into consideration the minor\u2019s wishes, if he or she is over the age of fourteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">\u201c(c) The guardian shall have the same right to custody and control which the sole surviving parent of a minor has.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b376-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121 provides: \u201cjuvenile matters defined, authority of COURT. Juvenile matters include all proceedings concerning uncared-for, neglected or dependent children and youth and delinquent children within this state, termination of parental rights of children committed to a state agency, matters concerning families with service needs and contested termination of parental rights transferred from the probate court, but does not include matters of guardianship and adoption or matters affecting property rights of any child or youth over which the probate court has jurisdiction. In such juvenile matters, the superior court shall have authority to make and enforce such orders directed to parents, including any person who acknowledges before said court paternity of a child born out of wedlock, guardians, custodians or other adult persons owing some legal duty to a child or youth therein, as it deems necessary or appropriate to secure the welfare, protection, proper care and suitable support of a child or youth subject to its jurisdiction or otherwise committed to or in the custody of the commissioner of children and youth services. Said court shall also have authority to grant and enforce injunctive relief, temporary or permanent in all proceedings concerning juvenile matters. If any order for the payment of money is issued by said court, the collection of such money shall be made by said court, except orders for support of children committed to any state agency or department, which orders shall be made payable to and collected by the department of administrative services. In juvenile matters, the court shall have authority to make and enforce orders directed to persons liable hereunder on petition of said department of administrative services made to said court in the same manner as is provided in section 17-324, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of section 17-3li, section 17-32,17-82e, 17-295,17-295a, 46b-129 or 46b-130, and all of the provisions of section 17-324 shall be applicable to such proceedings. Any judge hearing a juvenile matter may make any other order in connection therewith within his authority to grant as a judge of the superior court and such order shall have the same force and effect as any other order of the superior court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b378-6\"> This construction is consistent also with General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121, which excludes from Superior Court jurisdiction, \u201cmatters of guardianship and adoption or matters affecting property rights of any child or youth <em>over which the probate court has jurisdiction, \u201d </em>because we hold today that the Superior Court has exclusive jurisdiction to enter a custody-guardianship order that is a product of a neglect petition filed with the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129. Therefore, the Probate Court does not possess jurisdiction to adjudicate custody-guardianship matters that arise under \u00a7 46b-129 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">We add that courts of probate are strictly statutory tribunals and, as such, they have only such powers as are expressly or implicitly conferred upon them by statute. <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Alcorn, </em>140 Conn. 96, 100, 99 A.2d 97 (1953). We do not agree with the natural mother\u2019s argument that the appellants\u2019 view concerning \u201ccustody-guardianship\u201d in effect invokes powers that are within probate jurisdiction. While it is true that some matters of guardianship are within probate jurisdiction, we point out that \u00a7 46b-129 concerns only \u201cany child or youth [who is adjudged] uncared-for, neglected or dependent\u201d rather than all matters of guardianship. <em>Eason </em>v. <em>Welfare </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number><em>Commissioner, </em>171 Conn. 630, 635, 370 A.2d 1082 (1976), cert. denied, 432 U.S. 907, 97 S. Ct. 2953, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1079 (1977). Moreover, prior to court consolidation on July 1,1978, the precursor of \u00a7 46b-129, \u00a7 17-62, was within the jurisdiction of the then Juvenile Court. In any event, we can presume that the legislature, in originally assigning this power to the Juvenile Court and then transferring it to the Superior Court, was aware of existing relevant statutes, including probate statutes, and intended them to be read to make one consistent body of law. <em>Farms Country Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carini, </em>172 Conn. 439, 444, 374 A.2d 1094 (1977). We do not impute to the legislature an intent to pass antagonistic legislation. Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
