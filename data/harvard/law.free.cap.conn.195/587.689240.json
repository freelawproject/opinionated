The trial court, <em>Meadow, J., </em>sustained the defendant\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s application for a refund of the overpayment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>On appeal, the plaintiff contends the trial court erred (1) in concluding that its claim for a refund under General Statutes \u00a7 12-60 was time-barred by the one year statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 12-57, and (2) in failing to find that it was entitled to a refund under the common law principle of unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The trial court could reasonably have found the following facts. The Itel Memory Equipment Corporation (Itel), located in San Francisco, California, leased computer equipment valued at $916,072 to the plaintiff, National CSS, Inc., a Stamford based corporation, in accordance with the terms of a written lease agreement. During the years in which the disputed taxes were paid, the equipment was located in Stamford. The agreement specifically required Itel to pay all local property taxes levied on the equipment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In September, 1973, and October, 1974, the plaintiff and Itel, as required by statute, filed property lists with the defendant city of Stamford\u2019s tax assessor. Both corporations claimed the computer equipment as taxable personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">As a general rule, the Stamford tax assessor does not individually check each item of property listed on these returns to determine actual taxpayer ownership, but instead assumes that a taxpayer provides information only on the property it owns. Because Itel and the plaintiff had each placed the leased computer equipment on their individual lists in 1973 and 1974, and the assessor did not separately verify ownership of the property, the assessor accordingly billed both corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>rations for the single property tax amount accrued on the equipment. Itel and the plaintiff duly paid these taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Evidence presented to the trial court showed that the plaintiff paid taxes on the equipment in the amount of $28,092.26 in 1973 and $25,871.71 in 1974.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the evidence did not reveal the exact date of the plaintiffs tax payments, the trial court presumed that payment had been made before the statutory deadlines of July 1, 1974, and July 1, 1975. Itel also paid property taxes on the computer equipment, on July 25, 1974, and August 1, 1975.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is undisputed that Itel at all times completely fulfilled its contract obligation to pay property taxes accrued on the computer equipment, and Itel\u2019s position as lessor/taxpayer is not an issue in the dispute before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Sometime after the plaintiff paid its 1974 taxes it became aware that, under the lease agreement, it was not obligated to pay property taxes on the computer equipment. On September 16, 1976, pursuant to the provisions of General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 12-129,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the plaintiff made a written demand upon the defendant for reimbursement of the 1973 and 1974 tax over-payments, in an amount totaling $53,963.97. The defendant refused to grant the refund on the ground that \u00a7 12-129 does not authorize refunds of tax over-payments caused by clerical errors of taxpayers, but applies only to overpayments caused by clerical errors of assessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The plaintiff then commenced the underlying action in Superior Court. During a hearing before the trial court, and upon close examination of the facts of the case, it apparently became clear to the judge and to the parties that the dispute could be more appropriately resolved under General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 12-60 rather than under \u00a7 12-129.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The case therefore continued from that point, without objection by either party, as though it had been originally pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>under \u00a7 12-60.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court, in its memorandum of decision, determined that the plaintiff could not obtain a refund under \u00a7 12-60 without first being issued a certificate of correction in accordance with the provisions of General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 12-57.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It found that because the plaintiff had failed to file its claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>and thereby obtain the certificate, within the one year statute of limitations prescribed by \u00a7 12-57, it was not entitled under \u00a7 12-60 to reimbursement for the tax overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The plaintiff raises as its first claim of error the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 12-57 bars the plaintiff from obtaining a refund under \u00a7 12-60.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that the court erred in imputing the \u00a7 12-57 limitation period into \u00a7 12-60, because \u00a7 12-60 specifically permits errors in the payment of taxes to be corrected \u201cat any time.\u201d The plaintiff further urges that if its claims are considered solely under the provisions of \u00a7 12-60, it will be entitled to a refund of the overpaid taxes. We agree with the plaintiff\u2019s contention only insofar as we find that the trial court erred in imputing the \u00a7 12-57 limitation period into \u00a7 12-60, and that the plaintiff\u2019s claim for a refund should be analyzed pursuant to \u00a7 12-60. It is our view, however, that the provisions of \u00a7 12-60 do not authorize payment of a tax refund in the circumstances presented by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Section 12-60 provides that \u201c[a]ny clerical omission or mistake in the assessment of taxes may be at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>time corrected according to the fact by the assessors or board of tax review, and the tax shall be levied and collected according to such corrected assessment.\u201d In its memorandum of decision the trial court found that since \u00a7 12-60 does not specifically \u201crestrict the corrections to mistakes made by assessors, tax collectors, or other Town officers . . . clerical errors on the part of the taxpayer should be correctable.\u201d The court further determined that the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s error in listing the computer on its 1973 and 1974 returns is a clerical mistake within the meaning of C.G.S. Sec. 12-60,\u201d and that the assessor therefore had the \u201cstatutory authority to correct a mistake \u2018according to the fact\u2019 at any time.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s petition for a refund of its tax overpayment was ultimately barred, however, by the court\u2019s application of \u00a7 12-57, which provides in part that \u201c[t]he assessors of any municipality shall, at any time prior to the payment of the tax . . . <em>or within one year subsequent to the date the tax was paid, </em>issue a certificate of correction removing tangible personal property from the list of any person, when such tangible personal property was not taxable on such list in the name of such person by such municipality . . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) The trial court found that the plaintiff could obtain the relief it sought under \u00a7 12-60 only by the issuance of a \u00a7 12-57 certificate of correction, and that since the plaintiff had not applied for the certificate within one year from the date it paid its taxes, it was barred from recovering any of the overpayment. The trial court found that \u00a7 12-60 could operate only in conjunction with \u00a7 12-57 because the issuance of a certificate of correction under \u00a7 12-57 was a mandatory prerequisite to obtaining a refund by \u00a7 12-60. Our analysis of these statutes, however, has uncovered no evidence supporting this construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The duties of tax assessors are prescribed with particularity by Chapter 203 of the General Statutes. \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>power of assessors to alter assessments exists only during the lawful period for the performance of their duties, before the [municipal grand] lists are completed and filed.\u201d <em>Empire Estates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>147 Conn. 262, 264, 159 A.2d 812 (1960). Before the broad authority conferred on them by the statutes is exhausted, assessors have \u201cabundant power to correct omissions or mistakes, clerical or otherwise, independently of [\u00a7 12-60].\u201d <em>Bridgeport Brass Co. </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>102 Conn. 206, 210, 128 A.2d 413 (1925). Once assessors have completed their duties as prescribed by statute, however, they have \u201cno authority to alter a list except to remedy a clerical omission or mistake.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Empire Estates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 264-65. \u201cEvidently the purpose of [\u00a7 12-60] was to give to \u2018assessors or board of relief a limited continuing authority to correct . . . \u2018clerical\u2019 omissionfs] or mistake[s] . . . irrespective of whether their larger jurisdiction had been terminated.\u201d <em>Bridgeport Brass Co. </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>supra, 211. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 12-60 operates only in conjunction with \u00a7 12-57, and that a \u00a7 12-60 cause of action therefore terminates after one year, is against the weight of case law, and frustrates the very purpose for which \u00a7 12-60 was enacted. See <em>Evening Sentinel </em>v. <em>National Organization for Women, </em>168 Conn. 26, 31, 357 A.2d 498 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The legislature, in creating the municipal taxation scheme, placed precise statutes of limitations over most substantive taxpayer claims. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-57,12-112,12-119. It specifically chose not so to restrict claims arising from \u201cclerical omission[s] or mistake[s] in the assessment of taxes\u201d by allowing such actions to be brought \u201cat any time.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-60. While the phrase \u201cat any time\u201d ordinarily would be construed as placing no unreasonable limits on the time such a correction can be made; <em>West Haven </em>v. <em>Aimes, </em>4 Conn. Sup. 391, 393-94 (1937); we note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 12-129 in fact places a six year restriction on refunds under \u00a7 12-60.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We can find no evidence that the legislature intended the clause to be qualified by the one year statute of limitations imposed by \u00a7 12-57. Where the legislature has seen fit not to insert a time limitation into a statute, this court will not undermine legislative intent by imputing such a limitation period. We note, as further support for our conclusion, that if we were to impute into \u00a7 12-60 the \u00a7 12-57 statute of limitations, \u00a7 12-60 would essentially be superseded by \u00a7 12-57 because both statutes would then be available to correct similar, clerical type errors, for an equivalent period of time. We doubt that the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 12-57, intended such a result. See <em>Evening Sentinel </em>v. <em>National Organization for Women, </em>supra, 31; see also <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>176 Conn. 638, 644, 410 A.2d 475 (1979). This court will therefore construe these statutes in a way that favors preserving the integrity and effectiveness of both. Such a construction requires that claims under \u00a7 12-60 be analyzed independently of \u00a7 12-57. The question before us thus becomes whether the plaintiff can recover solely under the provisions of \u00a7 12-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Section 12-60 provides a remedy for \u201cany clerical omission or mistake in the assessment of taxes . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>In order to recover under this statute it must therefore be shown that a mistake is \u201cclerical\u201d and was made \u201cin the assessment of taxes.\u201d We find that the error that occurred here possesses neither of these characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The trial court found that the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s error in listing the computer on its 1973 and 1974 returns is a clerical mistake within the meaning of C.G.S. Sec. 12-60.\u201d We do not agree. Clerical errors are of a character different from errors of substance, of judgment, or of law. <em>Reconstruction Finance Corporation </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>136 Conn. 29, 32, 68 A.2d 161 (1949). Where an error is of a deliberate nature such that the party making it at the time actually intended the result that occurred, it cannot be said to be clerical. See <em>Kuhlemeier </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>2 Cal. 2d 257, 261, 40 P.2d 828 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The plaintiff, at the time it listed the leased computer equipment on its tax return and paid the disputed taxes, operated under the mistaken belief that it actually owed taxes on the equipment to the defendant. Because the plaintiff\u2019s action in listing the property and paying the taxes, although mistaken, was deliberate and intentional, it is not clerical, but can only be characterized as an error of substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Nor can we say that the error here occurred \u201cin the assessment of taxes.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-60. \u201c \u2018 \u201cAssessment is the listing and valuation of property liable to taxation according to law. . . . [A]n assessment can only be made by the officer designated by law to make it.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Northwestern Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>Henneford, </em>184 Wash. 502, 508, 51 P.2d 1083 (1935). The plaintiff, by listing property on its return, was not assessing its property, but was merely informing the taxing authorities that the property was available for taxation. The property did not become legally subject to taxation, or assessed, until the assessor placed it on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>the defendant\u2019s final grand list. The plaintiff\u2019s claim of statutory entitlement to a refund under \u00a7 12-60 must therefore fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s second claim of error concerns the applicability of the common law principle of unjust enrichment to taxpayer refund actions. The right of recovery for unjust enrichment is equitable, \u201cits basis being that in a given situation it is contrary to equity and good conscience for the defendant to retain a benefit which has come to him at the expense of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Schleicher </em>v. <em>Schleicher, </em>120 Conn. 528, 534, 182 A.2d. 162 (1935). Where, however, a statutory scheme exists for the recovery of a benefit that is also recoverable at common law, the common law right may be resorted to only where the statutory procedures are inadequate. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Salafia, </em>29 Conn. Sup. 305, 313, 284 A.2d 576 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">In the present case, the procedure available was more than sufficient in providing the plaintiff a method by which a refund could be obtained.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff simply failed to take advantage of this statutory remedy in a timely manner, and now seeks to circumvent the state taxation scheme by way of the common law. The plaintiff\u2019s failure to show that the existing remedy could not in itself have afforded the plaintiff a refund, however, precludes it from now resorting to the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Public policy requires, furthermore, that this court not permit taxes collected or paid to be the subject of perpetual litigation, at any time, to suit the convenience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>of the taxpayer. <em>See Matter of Hermance, </em>71 N.Y. 481, 488 (1877). A taxpayer who has not sought redress in an appropriate manner is foreclosed from continuing litigation outside these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-7\"> The lease clause read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">\u201cITEL PAYS PROPERTY TAX RIDER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFl\">Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2, \u2018Rental Charges,\u2019 of the Lease Agreement, accrued property taxes, however designated, on the machines shall be paid by ITEL.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\"> The difference in the amount of taxes paid in 1973 and 1974 was caused by a depreciation in the value of the computers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\"> Although the taxes assessed against Itel were identical to those assessed against and paid by the plaintiff, Itel in fact paid only approximately $10,000 in property taxes on the equipment. This was due to the application of a tax relief formula available to out-of-state corporations that are required to pay property taxes in both their home state and the state in which leased property is located.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1975)] Sec. 12-129. refund of excess payments.

Any action taken by such selectmen or such other authority shall be a matter of record, and the tax collector shall be notified in writing of such action.

We find this elaim to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Throughout the trial court proceedings the defendant treated the case as though it had been pleaded under \u00a7 12-60. At no time prior to this appeal did the defendant object to the plaintiffs or the court\u2019s characterization of the case as a \u00a7 12-60 cause of action, and the defendant, in fact, appears to have assented to it by raising numerous contentions regarding \u00a7 12-60 at trial. \u201cThis court has repeatedly indicated its disfavor with the failure of a party ... to object to claimed errors occurring in the course of a trial until it is too late for them to be corrected, and thereafter ... to . . .

Ordinarily a party planning to raise the statute of limitations to bar an opposing claim must raise it prior to trial as a special defense. It was not necessary, however, for the defendant in this case to do so, since here the statute limits the time within which an assessor must issue a certificate of correction, and not the time within which a taxpayer must actually file suit. The affirmative duty is imposed on the assessor and not on the parties, and there is thus no need affirmatively to plead the limitation period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b607-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-129 provides in relevant part: \u201crefund of excess payments.
