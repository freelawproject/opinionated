Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkX\">The petitioner, Seymour Levine, was found guilty after a jury trial of one count of assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2) and three counts of threatening in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62. Thereafter, he petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that he had not received the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a full evidentiary hearing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court denied his petition. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Some of the facts that the jury could reasonably have found from the conflicting versions of the events that resulted in the petitioner\u2019s arrest were the following: The incident that produced the arrest of the petitioner took place on July 24, 1981, on Lyrical Lane in New-town where the petitioner and the victim, Alfred Duchaine, were neighbors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As Duchaine drove up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>his driveway, he saw Susan Levine, the petitioner\u2019s daughter, walking an afghan dog owned by the Levines in front of his (Duchaine\u2019s) house. The dog stopped and defecated in front of Duchaine\u2019s house. Duchaine obtained a short-handled shovel, scooped up the excrement and deposited it on the petitioner\u2019s lawn. At that time, the petitioner was watering his flowers and the lawn with a garden hose that had a detachable metal nozzle. The petitioner, who observed Duchaine do this, became involved in a heated argument with Duchaine in the course of which he struck Duchaine in the back of his head with the metal nozzle. This caused the victim to stagger and resulted in a lump on his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Two brothers, Robert Mandulak and Michael Mandulak, who were working on Robert\u2019s neighboring property, came to the scene upon hearing Duchaine call Robert\u2019s name. With Duchaine there and the two Mandulaks approaching him, the petitioner removed a pistol from his pants pocket and stuck it in Duchaine\u2019s face. He also said to the approaching Mandulaks: \u201cI have enough here for all of you.\u201d Duchaine then walked back to his house with the Mandulaks and he called the police who, after an investigation, arrested the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The petitioner\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel directed against his privately retained trial defense counsel are multiple and do not singly, in clusters or cumulatively persuade us of the merits of his claim. These claims include inadequate pretrial investigation; \u201cnumerous failures to object to highly prejudicial testimony\u201d; \u201cfailure to cross-examine properly,\u201d the cross-examination being variously characterized as \u201cdisorganized,\u201d \u201cdeficient,\u201d \u201cabortive\u201d or \u201cabbreviated\u201d; failure to explore matters important to the defense; failure to call as a witness someone identified in the testimony as present during the commission of the crimes charged; examining the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>so as to prejudice him in the eyes of the jury; failure to prepare properly by obtaining documentary evidence that was a public record; failure to take exception to the trial judge\u2019s rulings; failure to request appropriate jury instructions at the trial; and indulging in contradictory and disjointed trial strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">It is helpful to set out here several postulates that are meaningful to the petitioner\u2019s claim. The right to effective assistance of counsel is guaranteed by the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. This right is equally applicable whether defense counsel is court-appointed or, as in the present case, privately-retained. <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771 n.14, 90 S.

Ed. 2d 864 (1984). \u201cIn <em>Strickland </em>the Court, while holding that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is one of \u2018effective assistance\u2019 . . . nevertheless imposed a two-component showing before a claim of deprivation of that right maybe made: first, it must be shown that the attorney\u2019s performance was so deficient and his errors so serious that \u2018counsel was not functioning as . . . \u201ccounsel\u201d \u2019 . . . and, second, that those errors functioned so \u2018as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable' . . . i.e., that there exists \u2018a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gulliver </em>v. <em>Dalsheim, </em>739 F.2d 104, 107 (2d Cir. 1984), quoting <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 687, 694. <em>Strickland </em>stated not only that \u201cjudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential\u201d but also that the re-viewing court \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under these circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 <em>[Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 689].\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Roche </em>v. <em>Scully, </em>739 F.2d 739, 742 (2d Cir. 1984). In fairly assessing the attorney\u2019s conduct it is required \u201cthat every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra. The petitioner has the burden to demonstrate that counsel\u2019s conduct fell below the required standard and that that lack of competency contributed to his conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>supra, 578; <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 283; <em>In re King, </em>133 Vt. 245, 248, 336 A.2d 195 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>The judge in this habeas corpus proceeding could have reasonably believed from the evidence before him, much of it conflicting, the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The petitioner\u2019s trial defense attorney had been a practicing attorney for about twenty-four years and estimated that he had tried thirty criminal cases to a jury. Prior to trial, the trial defense attorney, who had represented the petitioner in the past and had known him for maybe as \u201cmuch as twenty [years],\u201d had spoken to him concerning this case \u201con perhaps twenty occasions\u201d and \u201cprobably ten phone calls in addition.\u201d These discussions took place before and after the pretrial conferences. Although no pretrial motions were filed by the petitioner\u2019s counsel, the state\u2019s attorney handed this defense attorney his entire file and he \u201cread it \u2014 every single page, both front and back.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 349, 351, 448 A.2d 214 (1982); cf. <em>Siemon </em>v. <em>Stoughton, </em>184 Conn. 547, 554, 556, 440 A.2d 210 (1981). He spoke with the petitioner and the wife, son and daughter of the petitioner and also visited the scene of the crimes charged. He decided that the only witness he would call at trial would be the petitioner himself.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The petitioner sat by his attorney\u2019s side during the entire trial and frequently consulted with him; this included suggesting questions to be asked, which the petitioner would write on a pad. He was also \u201cone hundred percent\u201d involved in jury selection, consulting with the attorney on each prospective juror. One potential juror was challenged because that person was unacceptable to the petitioner. Just before evidence was presented the court granted a motion by defense counsel that the witnesses be sequestered.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Upon examination of the trial transcript and that of the habeas hearing, it is abundantly clear that credibility was key and that self-defense was the theory of the defense. Duchaine, who worked on heavy construction, on cross-examination maintained that he had never been \u201cangry\u201d with the petitioner nor had \u201ccross words\u201d with him. Duchaine said that right after he had placed the dog droppings on the petitioner\u2019s property, the petitioner swore at him. During that part of the \u201cconversation\u201d he said that he did not have the shovel in his hand but that it \u201cwas behind me\u201d as \u201cI threw it down.\u201d On cross-examination, he denied making any comments about the petitioner\u2019s \u201cparentage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Robert Mandulak admitted on cross-examination that he had complained to the police \u201cprobably less than\u201d five times about the petitioner in the past. He also admitted at that time that his wife had done the same and as a result the petitioner was arrested. In addition, his cross-examination disclosed that the petitioner had turned him in to the local building department \u201ca number of times\u201d and that the petitioner had brought a civil suit against him in which he filed a counterclaim. Robert Mandulak,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> who had lived right next to the petitioner for approximately four years, also said on cross-examination that he had never spoken to the petitioner and that \u201c[w]e were never friendly.\u201d On that examination, he indicated that he did not hear anyone threaten the petitioner, make any gesture toward him or \u201craise their hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Examination of Michael Mandulak, Robert\u2019s brother, disclosed that he did not live in Newtown but that he was there simply helping his brother work on his house. While working on that house, Michael and Robert heard Duchaine call Robert. Michael then saw the petitioner and Duchaine facing each other and they were talking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u201cloud,\u201d but he \u201cdidn\u2019t really hear what they were saying.\u201d Just before the petitioner struck Duchaine with the garden hose, the latter, he said, had a shovel \u201cby his side ... it was on the ground and he was just like holding the handle.\u201d On cross-examination, defense counsel noted that this witness wore eyeglasses. He elicited that he \u201calways\u201d wore them and that he needed them \u201cto see distance.\u201d When Michael testified that he was approximately twenty feet away from the petitioner at that time, on cross-examination defense counsel asked what he had observed, including whether Duchaine was wet or not from the garden hose the petitioner was using to water his flowers. He said that he was \u201cnot sure\u201d and also said that he did not think that anyone used the words \u201cwe\u2019ve got him [the petitioner] now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Harry Noroian, a Newtown police detective assigned to investigate this incident, was the final state\u2019s witness at the trial. He took signed statements from Duchaine and the petitioner. Cross-examination elicited that he detected \u201ca mild odor of alcohol\u201d on Duchaine when he responded to the complaint fifteen to twenty minutes after its receipt. Defense counsel asked him if he knew whether there had been a complaint to headquarters earlier that day concerning the petitioner and Duchaine. At that time, Noroian indicated that Duchaine had called him earlier that afternoon about a question and that he did not recall whether the petitioner\u2019s wife had also called to the police department earlier that day. In response to a question by defense counsel, he said that the police department records, \u201cthe log book,\u201d would show if anyone had made a complaint concerning Duchaine the day of the incident involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The petitioner was the only witness produced by the defense. On direct examination, he said Newtown police officer Koch came to his home on the day of the inci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>dent because the petitioner\u2019s wife had called Detective Noroian to complain that Mrs. Duchaine earlier that day \u201chad attempted to hit me with her [motor] vehicle while I was walking a dog on the road.\u201d Koch, he said, suggested that he should not file the complaint, because to do so \u201cwas just going to put more fuel on the fire because of the problematic situation on the street.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He maintained that not only did Duchaine act \u201cangry\u201d toward him and use \u201cbad words,\u201d which were \u201cthreatening words,\u201d but also that Duchaine threw the dog droppings \u201call over me.\u201d It was right after this that he felt he was going to be struck with the shovel because Duchaine \u201craised it above his head.\u201d It was then when they were face to face and \u201che had the shovel raised in his hands\u201d that he struck him with the hose.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Further questioning adduced testimony that Duchaine said \u201che was going to kill me\u201d if the petitioner\u2019s dog repeated the earlier performance. After being struck, Duchaine fell to the ground, dropped the shovel and called Robert Mandulak to come and help him. Counsel developed that, while Duchaine was on the ground and the two Mandulaks<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> came out of their driveway, the petitioner did not feel threatened by all three of them. It was only when Duchaine picked up the shovel, \u201cyelled to them . . . \u2018[l]et\u2019s get \u2018em\u2019 and came at me\u201d that the petitioner pulled out his pistol and told them \u201cto stay back or I would shoot them.\u201d With the loaded pistol in his hand, he told them that \u201cI have enough in here for all of you.\u201d He \u201ccertainly\u201d felt that he had an excuse for pulling out the pistol because \u201cmy life was threatened with this guy trying to hit me with the shovel raised over his head coming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>at me.\u201d His counsel asked if he felt that he was \u201cin eminent [sic] danger of being struck with the shovel\u201d and he opined that he \u201cwas protecting myself, as well as my daughter [who] was behind me.\u201d He further inquired whether, when Duchaine \u201cbacked off,\u201d the petitioner then followed him and tried to continue \u201cthis confrontation.\u201d The petitioner replied: \u201cAt any time during the confrontation I was constantly backing into my driveway away from this guy and I was at my driveway initially.\u201d Defense counsel asked him if he felt that he had any other course of action at that time to avoid injury to himself. He replied: \u201cWell, the only course I could have had was to turn my back and run into the house and possibly have him embed the shovel into my head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">During the hearing on the habeas corpus petition, the petitioner called three witnesses: his trial defense counsel; Susan Levine, the petitioner\u2019s daughter; and an attorney offered as an expert.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The petitioner\u2019s trial counsel testified that the theory of the defense at trial was that of self-defense to all the charges. He said that he tried to show that Duchaine was, in effect, the aggressor, threatening the petitioner with the shovel. He did not object to the state\u2019s question to the petitioner whether or not he would have shot the pistol dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>ing the confrontation \u201cbecause it went to the heart of my claim for self-defense.\u201d The reason for cross-examining Duchaine about the \u201cshort-handled\u201d shovel used by Duchaine was to try to show it was a \u201cdangerous instrumentality.\u201d Further, he maintained that a number of his inquiries or occasional lack of inquiry were to show such things as the following: \u201cprior animosity between the families\u201d; \u201cbad blood between the people living on Lyrical Lane\u201d; \u201cpreexisting animosity\u201d; \u201canimosity\u201d; \u201ca running feud\u201d; that the meeting of Duchaine and the Mandulaks prior to Noroian\u2019s arrival at the scene after the incident had been \u201crehearsed\u201d; and that the alleged victims \u201cwere going to avenge themselves on Mr. Levine as a way of settling old accounts and that they were going to use the judicial system and the Police Department to do this.\u201d The trial defense counsel also attempted to color a witness\u2019 testimony or to bring Duchaine\u2019s credibility into doubt; to establish contradictions; and to give the petitioner the opportunity to explain a matter himself before the state asked the question which he had anticipated. He said that he asked certain questions because \u201cI wanted to ask a whole series of questions showing previous animosity.\u201d He indicated that he made the motion to sequester the witnesses because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want them listening to each other\u2019s testimony and then going out in the corridor and polishing the testimony that was yet to be delivered.\u201d His questions to the petitioner concerning his military service with an honorable discharge and his family, including one son who was a police officer, were intended to cast him in a favorable light. Certain of his inquiries or occasional lack of inquiry were for purposes that reflect a pragmatic sensitivity to a fairly predictable reaction of a jury in a case of this nature. Defense trial counsel did testify that on hindsight he might have done a few things differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>In his brief, the petitioner criticizes the failure to call his daughter, Susan Levine, as a witness at the trial. Susan Levine, who was seventeen years old, testified at the habeas hearing. On direct examination, she stated that she was present during the entire incident and that she had started to tell the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel about it when he came to their home. Once she told him about how Duchaine \u201craised the shovel to my father,\u201d she maintained that he stopped the discussion. She also said that the petitioner told her that she was going to testify, but that her father had talked to his counsel and the latter had told him that it was not necessary. On cross-examination, she was asked whether she told counsel that she was outside her house and saw the whole thing and she replied: \u201cTo tell you the truth, I don\u2019t think he ever asked me.\u201d Although she maintains that she was there when the police took a statement from the petitioner, they did not take one from her.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At the same hearing, the petitioner\u2019s trial defense counsel said that he had asked Susan if she had witnessed the alleged violence; she told him that she had been there earlier but not at that time and he did not call her as a witness.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To add to the conflicting testimony here, Robert Mandulak was asked at the trial who was there and he did not include Susan. This issue presented a question of credibility to the trial judge at the habeas hearing which he was required to resolve and could have resolved against the petitioner. Moreover, going to a claim of prejudice here, our examination of the trial court\u2019s charge shows that there was no instruction that the jury might draw an unfavorable inference from her failure to testify. See <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 165 A.2d 598 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Much is made by the petitioner of trial counsel\u2019s failure to produce a copy of the Newtown police log of the day in question to show the existence of a complaint made by the petitioner. This failure, he asserts, enhanced the credibility of Detective Noroian and \u201cadversely and prejudically\u201d affected the credibility of the petitioner because he had testified to the existence of such a complaint. It might well have been prudent for trial counsel to have produced the log, but its absence, under the circumstances, hardly has been shown to have contributed to the conviction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>170 Conn. 273, 283, 365 A.2d 1167, cert. denied, 425 U.S. 962, 96 S. Ct. 1748, 48 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1976). It is claimed that trial defense counsel should not have let evidence come in that the petitioner had a number of guns. Although trial defense counsel conceded that such questioning was irrelevant, we point out that \u201c[t]he decision of a trial lawyer not to make an objection is a matter of trial tactics, not evidence of incompetency.\u201d <em>In re King, </em>133 Vt. 245, 250, 336 A.2d 195 (1975); <em>see People </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>22 Ill. App. 3d 711, 715, 318 N.E.2d 111 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The petitioner also complains that his trial counsel\u2019s \u201csimple acquiescence\u201d in the trial judge\u2019s \u201cimproper restraint on the right to cross-examine [Duchaine] . . . clearly prejudiced [him] in the eyes of the jury by indicating that relevant issues were being abandoned.\u201d This has no credible basis in the record. <em>After </em>cross-examining Duchaine, counsel stated that he had concluded \u201cmy questioning of this witness\u201d but that he wanted \u201cto reserve the right to request him again before the trial is finished on redirect.\u201d The trial judge said: \u201cNo reservations. You have one chance and this is it,\u201d to which counsel indicated that he had concluded his questions. At the habeas hearing, when asked about this, he testified that he had no more questions at that time or he would have asked them, but that he wanted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>to hear the rest of the evidence in order \u201cto keep the door open.\u201d While he did not take an exception, as the petitioner now points out, trial counsel\u2019s conduct, from the vantage point of trial tactics and strategy, is not subject to criticism under a fair view of all the circumstances. Observing a \u201clawful direction\u201d of the court does not tend to make for ineffective assistance of counsel. See <em>Hindman </em>v. <em>State, </em>597 S.W.2d 264, 272 (Mo. App. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">We have examined the court\u2019s instructions to the jury and agree that it was \u201cmore than fair\u201d to the petitioner and we note that he raises no claim concerning those instructions. We note just two things concerning the instructions: the charge on self-defense was fair to the defendant, and the trial court took trial counsel\u2019s requests to charge \u201cverbatim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Earlier, we have pointed out the guidance afforded by <em>Strickland </em>and other decisional law in assessing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We agree with the New York Court of Appeals when it said: \u201cWhat constitutes effective assistance [of counsel] is not and cannot be fixed with yardstick precision, but varies according to the unique circumstances of each representation.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Baldi, </em>54 N.Y.2d 137, 146, 429 N.E.2d 400, 444 N.Y.S.2d 893 (1981); <em>People </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>43 Ill.2d 368, 374, 253 N.E.2d 451 (1969). Even before <em>Strickland, </em>we had said that \u201c[hindsight is irrelevant\u201d; <em>Siemon </em>v. <em>Stoughton, </em>184 Conn. 547, 554, 440 A.2d 210 (1981); and that \u201c[hindsight will almost always reveal possible alternatives in trial tactics,\u201d so that the claim of ineffective representation must be examined as of the time the questioned representation occurred. <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>167 Conn. 639, 647, 356 A.2d 902 (1975). The <em>Baldi </em>court also said: \u201cHindsight should not escalate what may have been a few tactical errors into ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Baldi, </em>supra, 151; see <em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>430 N.E.2d 771, 775 (Ind. 1982); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number><em>Talley </em>v. <em>State, </em>442 N.E.2d 721, 724 (Ind. App. 1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pullen, </em>266 A.2d 222, 230-31 (Me. 1970); <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>52 N.Y.2d 1027, 420 N.E.2d 97, 438 N.Y.S.2d 299 (1981). It must be underscored that the effectiveness of counsel is not to be measured by the outcome of the trial. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>643 F.2d 713, 714 (10th Cir. 1981); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hammonds, </em>425 F.2d 597, 601 (D.C. Cir. 1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>141 Ariz. 97, 102, 685 P.2d 734 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">In this case, the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel advanced and pressed a defense of substance, i.e., self-defense. He also competently attacked the credibility of all the state\u2019s witnesses. The record reflects a commitment from the outset to the cause of his client whose candor and demeanor were for the jury to evaluate. The petitioner has certainly failed to demonstrate, as he must, not only that his trial counsel\u2019s representation was ineffective but also that any \u201clack of competency\u201d contributed to his conviction. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>195 Conn. 561, 564, 489 A.2d 377 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">His constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, however, does not mean that he is \u201centitled to an attorney who will make no mistakes.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>616 F.2d 1151, 1152 (9th Cir. 1980). We are keenly aware that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 339, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963), recognized that the fountainhead of this right is the specific sixth amendment guarantee of the right to assistance of counsel made obligatory upon the states by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. See, e.g., <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>162 Conn. 316, 294 A.2d 297 (1972). \u201cThe benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel's conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>result.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). This petitioner had a fair trial; <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 687, 688; and he has not sustained his burden of proving a violation of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel under either the United States constitution or the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The petitioner\u2019s remaining claims do not require discussion. It is sufficient to note that we have examined them carefully and conclude that they are without merit. See <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>189 Conn. 518, 538, 457 A.2d 656 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-9\"> We note that this petitioner\u2019s appeal from his criminal convictions has been resolved against him. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Levine, </em>39 Conn. Sup. 494, 466 A.2d 814 (1983). Upon inquiry at oral argument, the petitioner\u2019s counsel informed us that this habeas corpus proceeding was instituted because he was confined to jail unable to post bond. A fair reading of the memorandum of decision of the habeas court demonstrates that it found no deliberate bypass. See <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 418, 439 A.2d 430 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b649-10\"> At the evidentiary hearing, the witnesses testifying were trial defense counsel, the petitioner, his daughter Susan and an attorney offered by the petitioner as an expert witness. The inquiry there went solely to the issue of the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b649-11\"> We have examined the transcript of the jury trial and the two transcripts of the habeas corpus proceedings, one of June 17, 1982, and one of June 22, 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b653-8\"> He admits that he announced to the jury panel that the petitioner\u2019s daughter, Susan Levine, would be called as a witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\"> Robert Mandulak\u2019s father-in-law, Thomas Constandilo, was also at the scene of the incident but he did not testify at the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\"> He also said that \u201cseveral attempts had been made to hit me with the Mandulak\u2019s car and the Duchaine car and there are police complaints and reports on these several incidents,\u201d all of which he said occurred before July 24, 1981, the date of the charged incidents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b656-8\"> The petitioner testified that he did not see Robert Mandulak\u2019s father-in-law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\"> At the habeas hearing, an attorney of twelve years experience, offered as an expert, testified on behalf of the petitioner. He testified that most of his practice was in the criminal area. He had reviewed the trial transcript and it was his expert opinion that the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel had not in this case \u201cmet the standards of someone who tries these cases on an even infrequent basis.\u201d He elaborated on the bases of this opinion. In addition, he agreed that the key issue in the case was credibility, that developing the prior relationships of the state\u2019s witnesses was appropriate trial strategy, and that it was to the petitioner\u2019s advantage for his trial counsel \u201cto portray this as basically a neighborhood quarrel as opposed to your average crime in the street.\u201d He agreed that \u201csometimes a jury is as impressed or unimpressed by the demeanor of a particular witness, perhaps the accused, as it is by the evidence that they have heard\u201d and \u201cperhaps that might contribute to a conviction.\u201d His testimony presented an issue of credibility for the habeas court to pass upon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b659-6\"> Apparently the police took statements from the petitioner, Duchaine and both Mandulaks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\"> See footnote 4, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
