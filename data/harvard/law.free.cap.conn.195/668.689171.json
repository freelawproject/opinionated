Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxtT\">The state has appealed from the granting by the trial court, <em>Conway, J., </em>of both defendants\u2019 motions for the suppression and return of property seized from them by the state police. These appeals present the question whether under the circumstances of this case the officers involved could constitutionally make a valid warrantless investigatory stop of these defendants in their automobile. We hold they could not and affirm the trial court\u2019s suppression and return of the property seized and the dismissal of the informations.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">On October 10, 1981, the Ku Klux Klan (Klan) held a rally in the town of Windham. A counterdemonstration, which included a march from Willimantic to Windham, was also held that day. This march was organized by the International Committee Against Racism (InCAR), an organization that opposes the policies of the Klan. The defendants, James Scully and Alexander Taylor, were both residents of Willimantic at that time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">Trooper Bernard DePrimo was on duty that day in the Windham-Willimantic area. He had previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>monitored three other Klan rallies,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and he and his partner had been assigned to conduct a surveillance of a street demonstration on this particular day. Both officers wore plain clothes and were operating undercover in an unmarked green, two-door Ford LTD automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Early in the afternoon, DePrimo was in Willimantic in his parked vehicle observing an InCAR demonstration that preceded an anti-Klan march to Windham. At approximately 1:15 p.m., the defendants, in a red Ford Mustang automobile, pulled up alongside DePrimo who saw Taylor take his photograph with a camera, giggle and look at him in a \u201cfunny way.\u201d DePrimo claimed that, because of the glare on the windshield, he was unable to identify the Mustang\u2019s driver, Scully.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After photographing DePrimo,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> who at the time was alone in the unmarked police vehicle, the defendants drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Approximately fifteen minutes later, DePrimo, who had then picked up his partner, proceeded in the unmarked automobile on a street described as running parallel to the InCAR march route. He then noticed through his rear-view mirror the same Mustang occupied by the defendants behind him on Route 32. After traveling about an eighth of a mile,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the two vehi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>cles arrived at a traffic light at the intersection of Routes 32 and 6. While stopped at the light, DePrimo looked again in his rear-view mirror and observed the defendants in their car, according to his testimony, making gestures and pointing. These gestures were described by him as neither obscene nor anything \u201ctoo dramatic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">While the light was still red, DePrimo exited from his vehicle intending to arrest both defendants for breach of the peace. While approaching the defendants\u2019 vehicle, which was stopped at the light behind the troopers\u2019 car in the line of traffic, DePrimo held out his badge in one hand and placed his other hand on his undrawn gun. When DePrimo reached the defendants\u2019 vehicle, he then noticed for the first time a gun butt sticking out from between the front bucket seats into the rear of the Mustang and a steel bar in the back seat. He then ordered the defendants to pull into an adjacent convenience store parking lot, which they did. Prior to observing these items in the defendants\u2019 vehicle, DePrimo had not informed them that they were under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">After Scully had complied with DePrimo\u2019s order and pulled the Mustang off the road, DePrimo and his partner had the defendants get out of their vehicle, searched them, and placed them under arrest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The pat down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>search of the defendants uncovered 20-gauge shotgun shells and .22 calibre rifle shells on both defendants. The officers then searched the defendants\u2019 vehicle and found and seized therefrom a rusted eighteen-inch steel bar with a large nut rusted on the end of it, an unloaded 20-gauge shotgun positioned as stated above, an unloaded .22 calibre rifle on the floor of the back seat, two chains approximately two feet long in a plastic bag under the driver\u2019s seat, additional ammunition, a comb, a walkie-talkie, and Taylor\u2019s medical prescriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The defendants were charged by information with breach of the peace in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and possession of a dangerous weapon in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendants, pursuant to \u00a7 54-33f and our Practice Book rules,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>moved for the suppression and return of the evidence arguing it was illegally seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">A suppression hearing was held at which DePrimo was the sole witness. The trial court granted the motion to suppress on the grounds that: the arrest for breach of peace was without probable cause, and hence illegal; the evidence confiscated during the search was therefore \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d and properly suppressed; and even if the search were legal, these items seized were neither deadly nor dangerous weapons within the purview of \u00a7 29-38. Moreover, the court did not find credible DePrimo\u2019s testimony regarding his stated reasons for approaching the defendants\u2019 vehicle.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court, upon the state\u2019s request, dismissed the informations with prejudice in order to allow the state to appeal these rulings. See <em>State </em>v. Ross, 189 Conn. 42, 454 A.2d 266 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">On appeal, the state does not contend that probable cause existed to arrest the defendants at the time DePrimo exited his vehicle to approach them. Nor does the state contend that these defendants in their vehicle were \u201cstopped pursuant to a practice embodying neutral criteria.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47, 51, 99 S. Ct. 2637, 61 L. Ed. 2d 357 (1979). The state instead claims the trial court erred in granting the motion to suppress in that the trooper properly detained the automobile and its occupants in order to conduct an inves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>tigative stop and thus the search and seizure were justified and legal. We do not agree and hold that there were insufficient grounds in this case to justify an investigative stop.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The fourth amendment as applied through the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution and article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution apply to searches and seizures of the person and things, including investigatory stops of an automobile as occurred here. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S. Ct. 690, 66 L. Ed. 2d 621 (1981), reh. denied, 455 U.S. 1008, 102 S. Ct. 1648, 71 L. Ed. 2d 877 (1982); <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 654, 99 S. Ct. 1391, 59 L.

(Citations omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>supra, 417; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Cardinal, </em>194 Conn. 114, 117, 478 A.2d 610 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 148-49, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 584-85. \u201cBased upon the whole picture the detaining officers must have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>supra, 417-18;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>see also <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>supra, 51; <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 585. \u201cThe idea that an assessment of the whole picture must yield a particularized suspicion contains two elements, each of which must be present before a stop is permissible. First, the assessment must be based upon all of the circumstances . . . [which second,] must raise a suspicion that the particular individual being stopped is engaged in wrongdoing.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>supra, 418; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>supra. We also have repeatedly stated that a police officer\u2019s decision to make such an investigatory stop must be predicated \u201con more than a mere hunch.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>supra, 149; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Acklin, </em>171 Conn. 105, 111, 368 A.2d 212 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 585. With this guidance, we examine the relevant circumstances involved in the present case in conjunction with the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">On the day in question, the state police officers involved in this incident were assigned to a detail monitoring Klan and anti-Klan activities. On the basis of prior incidents, these officers could have reasonably been concerned about the potential for acts of civil disobedience or involving violence. At the time when these defendants were \u201cstopped,\u201d however, there had been, at least on their part, no \u201cobjective manifestation\u201d of involvement in any criminal activity. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>supra, 417; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nargi, </em>732 F.2d 1102, 1105 (2d Cir. 1984). The defendants had pho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>tographed DePrimo, who had been dressed in plain clothes, sitting in his unmarked car and then had driven away; while perhaps such an act did not involve the use of the soundest judgment by the defendants, in and of itself it certainly did not constitute criminal activity. The officers never made any claim or arrest on the basis that the defendants were interfering with them in the performance of their police duties. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a. The defendants had at some time later, after having disappeared from DePrimo\u2019s view, appeared behind his unmarked vehicle, and, while stopped in traffic behind DePrimo\u2019s vehicle, they made nonobscene, undramatic hand gestures in the direction of DePrimo\u2019s vehicle. Cf. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a), footnote 7, supra. Even if we assume the accuracy of DePrimo\u2019s testimony regarding his prior experience with the defendant Scully at a prior rally involving the Klan and anti-Klan demonstrators, these acts, viewed as a whole, do not raise a reasonable suspicion, within the meaning of <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968), and its progeny, that the defendants were engaged in any criminal activity. The actions of these defendants in their own hometown were open. They in no way constituted a breach of the peace within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-181 as the trial court correctly concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Nor were any of the putative \u201cweapons\u201d observed by these troopers prior to the actual stop of the defendants by them. Accordingly, and as the trial court noted, when DePrimo first observed the gun butt, he had no valid reason under the circumstances to be situated where he could so view it. Moreover, even if DePrimo did have valid reason to do so, both charges against the defendants were unwarranted. As stated, no breach of peace had occurred; nor was \u00a7 29-38 violated. Section 29-38 specifies those items that are prohibited to be in a motor vehicle in the absence of a permit. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>sole possibly relevant item of those enumerated in that provision is that the items seized were \u201cany other dangerous or deadly weapon[s].\u201d (general Statutes \u00a7 29-38. Under our statutes, an unloaded rifle and shotgun are not per se deadly weapons, and as the trial court also noted, the state tacitly admitted such by not charging these defendants under \u00a7 53-206.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>In addition, no item seized by the state from the defendants\u2019 vehicle under these circumstances could be characterized as a \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d as defined in \u00a7 53a-3 (7),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which requires \u201ccircumstances in which it is used or attempted or threatened to be used . . . Such \u201ccircumstances\u201d were not present, however, and in the words of the trial court: \u201cFrom the testimony, there is no use or attempted use, nor even any threatened use [of the items seized]. In fact, Trooper DePrimo described the Defendants as being gentlemen throughout the encounter. A citizens band walkie-talkie radio, film, chains, etc. are common, everyday possessions which anyone is allowed to transport in their [sic] motor vehicle without subjecting themselves to arrest absent something more. There is nothing more here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">In sum, on this record, there were no grounds for the arrests, and the defendants\u2019 actions that culminated in the investigatory stop by these troopers, viewed either singly or cumulatively, did not constitutionally justify the police intrusion in the present case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>the record \u201csuggests an understandable desire to assert a police presence . . . that purpose does not negate Fourth Amendment guarantees.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>supra, 52. The same rationale applies on this record in applying article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution. We must recognize that \u201c[t]he needs of law enforcement stand in constant tension with the Constitution\u2019s protections of the individual against certain exercises of official power. It is precisely the predictability of these pressures that counsels a resolute loyalty to constitutional safeguards.\u201d <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>413 U.S. 266, 273, 93 S. Ct. 2535, 37 L. Ed. 2d 596 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., Aspell and Brennan, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-11\"> The record does not disclose the ages of the two defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\"> These rallies occurred in: Scotland, Connecticut, in September, 1980; Meriden in March, 1981; and again Meriden in July, 1981.

During the July, 1981 Meriden Klan rally, according to DePrimo, Scully, who had been delivering an anti-Klan speech, recognized DePrimo as a police officer and then allegedly agitated some in the crowd against DePrimo to the point at which they threw stones at his police car. Scully allegedly then began \u201ccheering.\u201d No arrests were ever made in connection with this incident. See footnote 10, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b682-10\"> In the course of their surveillance, DePrimo and his partner were also photographing the events at the rally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b682-12\"> The direction of travel by the two vehicles could have led them to any one of three locations: the announced location of the conclusion of the anti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Klan rally; or the Windham Center School, which was the headquarters established for state police activity on that day to monitor the proceedings; or the picnic area where the Klan had scheduled its rally. At oral argument, the defense counsel also suggested the possibility that the defendants, both Willimantic residents who were driving in their own hometown, could have merely been returning to their residences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b683-13\"> The state makes no allegation that the defendants resisted the detention, arrest, and search and seizure, nor does it claim that the defendants were in any way abusive to the arresting officers.

Ed. 2d 357 (1979) (Burger, C.J.), in which direct observation by two police officers of both the defendant, who \u201clooked suspicious\u201d and had never been seen by them before, and another man walking from an alley in an area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>of town known for a \u201chigh incidence of drug traffic\u201d did not constitute reasonable suspicion sufficient for a justifiable investigative stop. <em>In Brown, </em>the officers did not suspect the defendant of any specific misconduct, nor did they have reason to believe that he was armed. The <em>Brown </em>court stated that the defendant\u2019s \u201cactivity was no different from the activity of any other pedestrians in that neighborhood.\u201d Id., 52. The lesson <em>from Brown </em>v. <em>Texas </em>is simply that physical presence in a geographical area where the police may have reason to anticipate possible violations of the law does not in and of itself justify arbitrary investigatory stops.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b691-8\">Shea, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AnU\">concurring. I disagree with the portion of the majority opinion that concludes that the investigative stop of the defendants\u2019 vehicle was improper, but I agree that the ensuing arrest and seizure were illegal for lack of probable cause. In my judgment the opinion focuses too narrowly upon the crime-detection function of the police and gives insufficient consideration to their crime-prevention function. \u201cThe assumption that the use of an arrest and the criminal process is the primary or even exclusive method available to police should be recognized as causing unnecessary distortion of both the criminal law and the system of crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>nal justice.\u201d A.B.A. Standards for Criminal Justice, Urban Police Function, 1-3.2. \u201cAmong other methods police use are, for example, the process of informal resolution of conflict, referral, and warning. The alternative methods used by police should be recognized as important and warranting improvement in number and effectiveness; and the police should be given the necessary authority and resources to use them under circumstances in which it is desirable to do so.\u201d Id., 1-3.1. The limited detention involved in a car stop was a reasonable measure for averting the serious risk of violent crime presented by the circumstances of this case;</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The action of Officer DePrimo in stopping the defendants\u2019 automobile was taken in the highly charged atmosphere of attempting to avert a violent confrontation between the Ku Klux Klan and an organization, the International Committee Against Racism (InCAR), several of whose members and adherents had assaulted Klan supporters on previous similar occasions in Scotland and in Meriden. Only three months before, in July, 1981, at a Klan rally in Meriden, DePrimo had observed Scully making a speech to InCAR supporters in which he advocated that they should \u201cgo after\u201d the Klan, vilified DePrimo upon recognizing him as a police officer, and cheered youths who then began to stone the officer\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">On the present occasion, October 10, 1981, the defendants must have recognized DePrimo as he was parked observing the InCAR demonstration in Willimantic, because they photographed him. When the InCAR rally began to march from Willimantic to Windham, apparently for the purpose of confronting the Klan, which was holding a rally in Windham, the defendants\u2019 vehicle followed DePrimo and his partner as they proceeded on Route 32. DePrimo received a radio message that a gang of InCAR people had assaulted some person, seriously injuring him. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>red light the defendant Scully was observed making provocative gestures toward the officers. In my judgment these circumstances would reasonably lead a prudent police offficer \u201cto conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous.\u201d <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">\u201cIt is fair to say that the argument the police must have some additional power to make seizures beyond that conferred by the <em>pre-Terry </em>law of arrest is most compelling when stated in terms of the crime-prevention function.\u201d 3 LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 9.2 (a), p. 19. The information known to Officer DePrimo \u2014 the recent incident in which Scully had fomented violence on a similar occasion in Meriden; the bizarre behavior of the defendants on this occasion in maintaining a surveillance of the officers which might well have interfered with their ability to perform their duties in connection with this highly dangerous situation; the actual onset of violence on the part of other supporters of InCAR resulting in serious injuries \u2014 warranted the brief detention involved in a car stop for the purpose of averting or thwarting a risk of serious violence. The judgment of DePrimo as to the serious potential of the defendants for violence on this occasion was clearly vindicated by the small arsenal of weapons found in the defendants\u2019 car as a result of the stop and ensuing search.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">I agree, nevertheless, that the mere presence of these weapons in a motor vehicle does not constitute a crime under the laws of this state and that the circumstances fall short of probable cause to believe that the defendants had committed any crime at the time of the arrest. Accordingly, the motion to suppress was properly granted as well as the motion to dismiss which followed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
