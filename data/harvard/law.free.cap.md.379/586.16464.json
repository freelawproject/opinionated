Somerville, the respondent, in which it was charged that the respondent violated Rules 1.1, Competence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.3, Diligence,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1.4, Communication,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 1.5, Fees,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 8.1, Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 8.4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Misconduct,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, as adopted by Maryland Rule 16-812. Bar Counsel also alleged that the respondent violated Maryland Code (1989, 1995 Replacement Volume) \u00a7 10-306<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the Business and Occupation Article. The alleged violations were committed during the course of the respondent\u2019s handling of the estate of the complainant\u2019s grandmother and, it was alleged, involved, among other defaults, misappropriation of estate funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">We referred the case to the Honorable Stephen M. Waldron, of the Circuit Court for Harford County, for hearing. <em>See </em>16-757. The respondent, although served with process, did not file an answer or appear for the hearing. At the hearing, the hearing court received from the petitioners four exhibits, consisting of affidavits and documents. Following the hearing, it made findings of fact, see 16-757(c),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and drew conclusions of law, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\u201cMelva Miller, a resident of New York, retained Respondent in March 1999 to represent her in connection with her deceased grandmother\u2019s estate. Respondent filed a Petition to Appoint Personal Representative on July 8,1999, and Ms. Miller was appointed Personal Representative on August 26, 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">\u201cRespondent failed to file an inventory, which was due on November 24, 1999. She did not file a first administration account, which was due on May 22, 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">\u201cOn September 20, 2000, Ms. Miller\u2019s lawyer in New York State wrote to Respondent about her failure to file the inventory and account. Ms. Miller and her attorney made numerous attempts to contact Respondent, but she did not respond. Ms. Miller was able to reach Respondent by telephone in August 2002. Ms. Miller told her that a Delinquent Notice had been issued by the Register of Wills for failure to file the account. Respondent acknowledged she had neglected the matter, but promised to conclude the estate administration as soon as possible. Respondent took no action to file the inventory and account. Ms. Miller made repeated attempts to reach Respondent by telephone in December 2002, without success.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">\u201cMs. Miller then retained Robert L. Pierson, Esquire, to replace Respondent as counsel. Mr. Pierson wrote to Respondent on January 2 and February 20, 2003, requesting information about the estate. Respondent did not respond. Mr. Pierson filed a petition to compel Respondent\u2019s testimony before the Orphans\u2019 Court for Harford County. Respondent appeared in the Orphans\u2019 Court on June 6, 2003, and Mr. Pierson was able to obtain documents and information from her. Based on that information, Mr. Pierson concluded that Respondent owed the estate $4,965.85. He wrote to Respondent on July 7, 2003, to try to resolve that claim. He left telephone messages for her on July 17 and 18, 2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>but has received no response to the letter or telephone messages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">Mr. Pierson\u2019s review of the estate checking account records and his interview of Respondent uncovered several improprieties in Respondent\u2019s handling of estate funds. On September 14, 1999, Respondent drew a check for $1,000.00 from the estate account. Ms. Miller never authorized her to take those funds, and Respondent had never filed a petition for approval of counsel fees. Respondent had no authority to take those funds from the estate. Respondent also paid two individuals, Barbara Giles and Elaine Morgan, $500.00 each from estate funds without any apparent justification. Respondent also overpaid the legatees, resulting in the estate having insufficient funds to pay taxes and expenses. The estate cannot be closed because of that deficiency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">\u201cAfter Ms. Miller submitted a complaint to the Attorney Grievance Commission, Office of Bar Counsel wrote to Respondent on October 8, November 4 and December 9, 2002, requesting that she respond to Ms. Miller\u2019s complaint. Respondent did not answer any of those letters. Commission Investigator William M. Ramsey then made several attempts to interview Respondent. Respondent never submitted to an interview. Respondent evaded service of the Statement of Charges when Mr. Ramsey attempted to serve her. Respondent failed to attend the Peer Review meeting regarding Ms. Miller\u2019s complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">\u201cRespondent acted incompetently in her representation of Ms. Miller in violation of Rule 1.1 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct by not filing an inventory and an administration account and by improperly disbursing estate funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">\u201cHer failure to file the inventory and account and her failure to respond to the Delinquent Notice and other inquiries by the Register of Wills and Orphans\u2019 Court was a lack of diligence in violation of Rule 1.3 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">\u201cRespondent violated Rule 1.4 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct by failing to return telephone calls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>from Ms. Miller and her attorneys and by failing to keep her informed of the status of the estate administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">\u201cRespondent took $1,000.00 from the estate checking account on September 14, 1999. Ms. Miller never authorized Respondent to take those funds and Respondent had never filed a petition to authorize her to be paid counsel fees from the estate. By taking those funds without permission. Respondent collected an unreasonable fee in violation of Rule 1.5(a) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent\u2019s unauthorized taking of estate funds was a criminal act in violation of Rule 8.4(b) and \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, Annotated Code of Maryland. Respondent\u2019s action was dishonest, and in violation of Rule 8.4(c) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s failure to respond to letters from Bar Counsel, her refusal to meet with an investigator for the Attorney Grievance Commission and her failure to attend the <em>Peer </em>Review meeting in this matter were knowing failures to respond to requests for information from a disciplinary authority in violation of Rule 8.1(b) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">\u201cBy her failure to take substantial action to administer the estate, her misuse of estate funds to make unauthorized and excessive expenditures, and by taking estate funds without authorization. Respondent engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The petitioner took no exceptions to the findings and conclusions of the hearing court and, as we have seen, the respondent did not participate in these proceedings. The petitioner did, however, file Petitioner\u2019s Recommendation for Sanction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>in which it urged the respondent\u2019s disbarment, noting that the respondent</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\">\u201cneglected the estate matter, failed to file an inventory and account, ignored notices from the Register of Wills and inquiries from her client, made improper and excessive disbursements from the estate account and took $1000.00 without authorization. Respondent also failed to respond to the Petitioner regarding this matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The penultimate observation acknowledges that the respondent misappropriated, appropriated to her own use funds of others entrusted to her, <em>see Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 520, 307 A.2d 677, 682 (1973) (obtaining fee from a workers\u2019 compensation client before approval by the Commission and keeping it and the fee subsequently approved by the Commission); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McBurney, </em>283 Md. 628, 631, 392 A.2d 81, 82 (1978) (after denying their receipt, depositing insurance settlement funds belonging to a client in office rather than his escrow account), estate funds. The hearing court\u2019s characterization was more emphatic and direct: \u201cRespondent\u2019s unauthorized taking of estate funds was a criminal act in violation of Rule 8.4(b) and \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, Annotated Code of Maryland. Respondent\u2019s action was dishonest, and in violation of Rule 8.4(c) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d We have often repeated what is in this State well settled with regard to the sanction for misappropriation of entrusted funds, that it \u201cis an act infected with deceit and dishonesty, and, in the absence of compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction, will result in disbarment.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Spery, </em>371 Md. 560, 568, 810 A.2d 487, 491-92 (2002). <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission v. Smith, </em>376 Md. 202, 237, 829 A.2d 567, 588 (2003); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 410, 773 A.2d 463, 483 (2001); <em>Marshall, </em>269 Md. at 520, 307 A.2d at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">There are no compelling extenuating circumstances in this case or, at least, we have not been informed of any. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>ingly, we agree with the petitioner, the appropriate sanction is disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST SALLY L.
