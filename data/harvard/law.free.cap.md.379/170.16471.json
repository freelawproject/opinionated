We must consider whether the Court of Special Appeals erred when it used the doctrine of law of the case to give preclusive effect to a Circuit Court order denying Scott\u2019s motion to correct an illegal sentence. Moreover, we must decide whether Scott\u2019s sentence was illegal under Maryland Rule 4-345 because his commitment records were corrected without a hearing and in such a way as to allegedly increase his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that the Court of Special Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>erred when it applied the doctrine of the law of the case to a motion to correct an illegal sentence. We affirm, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment on the ground that Scott\u2019s sentence was not illegal under Maryland Rule 4-345.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"Abj\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">On October 1, 1981, Scott was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of the following offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\u2022 <em>Case No. 18035413:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">Count 1: First-degree murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">Count 2: The use of a handgun in the commission of a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">\u2022 <em>Case No. 18035416:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">Count 1: Robbery with a deadly weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-12\">Count 8: The use of a handgun in the commission of a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-14\">\u2022 <em>Case No. 18107511:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-15\">Count 1: Assault with intent to murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-16\">Count 2: The use of a handgun in the commission of a felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-17\">The offenses arose out of the same incident that occurred on November 25, 1980; the State, however, had charged Scott with the crimes in separate indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-18\">On November 5, 1981, the jury determined death to be the appropriate sentence for the first-degree murder charge, and the trial judge, Judge Peter Ward, imposed the following sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-19\">\u2022 <em>Case No. 18035413:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-20\">Count 1: Death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-21\">Count 2: 15 years for the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony \u201cconsecutive to 1st count \u2014 Murder in the First Degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-22\">\u2022 <em>Case No. 18035416:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-23\">Count 1: 20 years \u201cconsecutive to the sentence in 18033413\u201d for robbery with a deadly weapon. Count 8:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>15 years \u201cconsecutive to the 1st count\u201d for the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">\u2022 <em>Case No. 18107511:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">Count 1: 30 years \u201cconsecutive to sentence in 18035416\u201d for assault with intent to murder. Count 2: 15 years \u201cconsecutive to the 1st count\u201d for the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Scott\u2019s total sentence, thus, was death plus ninety-five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">On July 28,1983, while incarcerated pursuant to the murder conviction in Case No. 18035413, Scott pled guilty to first-degree murder in a case involving a different incident, Case No. 18035701, for which Judge Edgar Silver, on the same day, imposed a sentence of life imprisonment, specifically stating, \u201cBalance of Natural Life. Sentence to run consecutive to sentence now serving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">On September 19, 1983, this Court vacated the death sentence for the first-degree murder charge in Case No. 18035413, remanding the case to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for a new sentencing proceeding. <em>Scott v. State, </em>297 Md. 235, 465 A.2d 1126 (1983). A new jury, with Judge John Byrnes presiding, again imposed the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">On August 5, 1987, this Court again vacated the death sentence in Case No. 18035413, remanding the case for another new sentencing proceeding. <em>Scott v. State, </em>310 Md. 277, 529 A.2d 340 (1987). This time, on remand, the State and Scott agreed to a sentence of life imprisonment for the first-degree murder charge. As a result, on February 10, 1988, Judge Byrnes resentenced Scott to \u201cbalance of life,\u201d with this sentence to run consecutive to the sentence imposed by Judge Silver in Case No. 18035701.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">On October 10, 1989, Scott filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence. Judge Byrnes noted that Scott\u2019s motion lacked \u201ccomplete clarity,\u201d but it appeared that Scott intended to argue that both of his life sentences were illegal. In support of his motion, without specifying which sentence he was referring to, Scott first argued that \u201cbalance of Natural Life ... lends to ambiguity in the interpretation of the actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>sentence\u201d because it could be construed as a life sentence without the possibility of parole. He then argued that his commitment records failed to comply with Rule 4 \u2014 351(a)(5),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as the term \u201cconsecutive\u201d was \u201cdeficient\u201d in that it did not indicate a starting date.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Judge Byrnes held a hearing on the motion on May 2, 1990. At that hearing, Scott acknowledged that his complaint essentially concerned the absence of a clear starting date for both life sentences. Scott argued that, even though he had received the death sentence and had been incarcerated since November 27, 1980, his commitment records did not stipulate when his sentence began. On May 17, Judge Byrnes had modified commitment records prepared for all of Scott\u2019s cases. The modified commitment records included information such as the original sentencing judge, the fact that the sentences had been corrected, and the fact that the corrections had been witnessed by the Clerk of the Court. The note \u201cTotal Time Served On All Cases: 2 consecutive life sentences plus ninety-five years\u201d was also included on the final commitment record for the 1983 murder conviction for which a life sentence had been imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">On June 6, 1990, Judge Byrnes issued a memorandum and order denying Scott\u2019s motion to correct the illegal sentence. In his order, Judge Byrnes dismissed Scott\u2019s first contention that the sentence imposed in 1983 by Judge Silver in Case No. 18035701 was ambiguous because the State might interpret \u201cnatural life\u201d to mean no possibility of parole, reasoning that the \u201chistorical record fact is that the State did not invoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Section 412(b)(2)\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cimprisonment for life without the possibility of parole____\u201d As such, Judge Byrnes concluded, there was no basis for Scott\u2019s contention that the correctional authorities would be confused and imprison him without possibility for parole. Judge Byrnes stated, however, that \u201cto clarify the matter fully, an amended commitment will be issued to delete the phrase \u2018natural life.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">With respect to Scott\u2019s second contention, Judge Byrnes concluded that Rule 4-351(a)(5) was not violated because it was clear that the sentences were to run consecutive to each other. Judge Byrnes noted, however, that, because of Judge Silver\u2019s subsequent life sentence in 1983 and because of the fact that Scott\u2019s death sentence was vacated twice and ultimately reduced to a life sentence in 1988, Scott\u2019s commitment records should be corrected to clarify his sentence. Judge Byrne explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">[S]ince this Court\u2019s sentence of February 10,1988 [the life sentence that replaced the vacated death sentence] reads: \u201cBalance of Life ... consecutive to ... No. 18035701 (Silver, J. 7/28/83), and that latter sentence was ordered by Judge Silver to run consecutive to the sentence then being served (J. Peter Ward\u2019s November 6, 1981 sentence in No. 18035413 of 15 years, and in No. 18035416 of 20 years and 15 years, and in No. 18107511 of 30 years and 15 years all consecutive to one another) the <em>result at that time (7/28/83) would have been 95 years consecutive to the death sentence first imposed on November 6, 1981 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>and later reimposed on February H, 1985. </em>When these two death sentences in No. 18035413, Count 1 were vacated and ultimately replaced, with defendant\u2019s concurrence on February 10, 1988, by a life sentence, and the result is that those 95 years are consecutive to that life sentence, and the life sentence imposed in No. 18035701 by Judge Silver on July 28,1983 will run consecutive to it, i.e., the life sentence in No. 18035413. Consequently, the Commitment record in No. 18035413, Count 1 should be corrected to delete the phrase ... \u2018consecutive to # 18035701.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Judge Byrnes also concluded that Scott\u2019s sentences began when he was incarcerated on November 27,1980.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">On January 24, 1997, Scott filed his first petition for post conviction relief, which was dismissed without prejudice. On January 30, 1998, Scott filed a second petition for post conviction relief, arguing, among other things, that Judge Byrnes erred by \u201crevising\u201d Scott\u2019s sentence. Scott contended that, under <em>Robinson v. Lee, </em>317 Md. 371, 564 A.2d 395 (1989), the Court of Appeals had held that the language \u201c[consecutive to] sentence now being served\u201d was deficient. On April 19, 1999, Judge Carol Smith denied Scott\u2019s petition. In her ruling, Judge Smith distinguished Scott\u2019s case from <em>Robinson. </em>Specifically, she noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">Petitioner seems to suggest that his various original commitment records used the term \u201csentence now being served\u201d as the link to each other consecutive sentence in his various cases. This is incorrect. Only in the original commitment record issued in case number 18035701, dated July 7, 1983, is that language used. All of the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>six original commitment records, as well as the four sentence modifications dated May 17, 1990, refer to case numbers and counts to provide clarity for both the Petitioner and the prison authority. Furthermore, any anomaly in Petitioner\u2019s sentencing records was the result of Petitioner\u2019s resentencing after his twice successful appeals of the imposition of death sentences. In this regard, Petitioner\u2019s case is dissimilar to <em>Robinson, </em>wherein the sentences were being imposed for convictions of new and different crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Judge Smith then explained that Scott incorrectly had stated the holding in <em>Robinson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">In that case, the Court of Appeals merely stated that the trial judge has an obligation \u201cto articulate the period of confinement with clarity so as to facilitate the prison authority\u2019s task.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Lee </em>at 379, 564 A.2d 395. \u201cFundamental fairness dictates that the defendant understand clearly what debt he must pay to society for his transgressions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380, 564 A.2d 395. In <em>dicta, </em>the Court encouraged trial judges to \u201cspell out with reasonable specificity the punishment <em>to </em>be imposed commensurate with the defendant\u2019s background, conduct, and personality traits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court did not hold that the use of the phrase \u201cconsecutive to sentence now serving\u201d was, in and of itself, deficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Finally, Judge Smith concluded that Judge Byrnes did not err when he rewrote Scott\u2019s commitment records on May 17,1990, without benefit of a hearing because the modifications did not \u201cchange the substance of Petitioner\u2019s sentences\u201d and a hearing on the motion to correct an illegal sentence was indeed held prior to when the corrections were made. She concluded that it was \u201cabundantly clear that ... Petitioner is to serve two life sentences plus ninety-five years, all to be served consecutively, commencing on November 27, 1980.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">On September 4, 2001, Scott filed another motion to correct an illegal sentence and for a reduction of sentence, repeating his previous claims and including, as a new claim, that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>sentence was rendered illegal because of Governor Glendening\u2019s new parole guidelines. On November 19, Judge Albert Matricciani denied Scott\u2019s motion. He first noted that \u201cpetitioner\u2019s allegations regarding the ambiguity and illegality of his sentences have already been addressed by Judge Carol Smith in her memorandum dated April 16, 1999 [and that] Judge Smith found \u2018no fatal ambiguity or illegality in Petitioner\u2019s sentences.\u2019 \u201d Judge Matricciani then stated that Judge Smith had concluded that Scott\u2019s claim that the Court erred by rewriting his commitment records on May 17,1990, without a hearing as required by Maryland Rule 4-345(c) to be without merit. Judge Matricciani also concluded that, under <em>State v. Kanaras, </em>357 Md. 170, 742 A.2d 508 (1999), Scott\u2019s sentence was not rendered illegal by Governor Glendening\u2019s parole policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">On June 16, 2003, Scott appealed. <em>Scott v. State, </em>150 Md.App. 468, 822 A.2d 472 (2003). He presented two questions for the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">1. Did the motion court abuse its discretion in failing to make its own determination on the merits regarding whether appellant\u2019s sentence was illegal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">2. Did the motion court err in accepting the post-conviction court\u2019s determination regarding whether Md. Rule 4-345(d) was violated?<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 470, 822 A.2d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">With respect to Scott\u2019s contention that Judge Matricciani abused his discretion in failing to make his own determination on the merits about the legality of his sentence, the Court of Special Appeals held that, while Rule 4-345(a) created a \u201climited exception to the general rule of finality,\u201d a \u201ccourt is [not] required to consider anew repeated motions by a litigant setting forth the same facts and contentions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473-74, 822 A.2d at 475. The intermediate appellate court supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>its conclusion by determining that the doctrine of law of the case is applicable to a motion to correct an illegal sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 474, 822 A.2d at 475. It also determined that Judge Matricciani did not abuse his discretion when he adopted Judge Smith\u2019s rationale for denying Scott\u2019s motion. <em>Id. </em>at 477, 822 A.2d at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">With respect to Scott\u2019s contention that a hearing was required when his commitment records were corrected in 1990, the Court of Special Appeals explained that Rule 4-345 requires a hearing when a sentence is modified. <em>Id. </em>at 479, 822 A.2d at 478. When commitment records are modified, however, the intermediate appellate court concluded that a hearing is not required. <em>Id. </em>Because Judge Byrnes did not modify Scott\u2019s sentence but rather clarified his commitment records, the Court of Special Appeals thus concluded that there was no error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Scott then filed in this Court a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted. <em>Scott v. State, </em>376 Md. 543, 831 A.2d 3 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Scott first contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred when it applied the doctrine of law of the case to a motion to correct an illegal sentence. Scott argues that, because Rule 4-345(a) allows a defendant to raise the illegality of a sentence at any time, it is inappropriate to use the doctrine of law of the case to give preclusive effect to earlier orders in a case denying relief. In the same vein, Scott also argues that Judge Matricciani abused his discretion when he adopted Judge Smith\u2019s ruling denying Scott\u2019s motion to correct an illegal sentence. Finally, Scott argues that, when Judge Byrnes corrected his commitment records, he violated Rule 4-345 by doing so without a hearing. Scott, moreover, maintains that his sentence became illegal due to Judge Byrnes\u2019 actions because Judge Byrnes effectively increased his sentence by eighty years when he corrected Scott\u2019s commitment records. This is so, Scott argues, because he was serving his fifteen-year handgun sentence (Case No. 18035413) and not the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>sentence, when Judge Silver imposed the additional life sentence in 1983 (Case No. 18035701). Scott reasons that the life sentence imposed by Judge Silver should run consecutive to the fifteen-year handgun sentence and concurrent with his subsequent sentences because Judge Silver stated that Scott\u2019s life sentence was \u201cto run consecutive to sentence now serving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The State argues that the Court of Special Appeals correctly concluded that the doctrine of the law of the case may be applied in connection with a motion to correct an illegal sentence. The State also contends that Judge Matricciani did not abuse his discretion when he adopted Judge Smith\u2019s ruling denying Scott\u2019s motion to correct an illegal sentence. Finally, the State argues that Judge Byrnes did not impose an illegal sentence when he corrected Scott\u2019s commitment records because a hearing was not required and Scott\u2019s sentence was not increased by eighty years. The State maintains that a hearing was not required because, when Judge Byrnes corrected Scott\u2019s commitment records, he did not modify Scott\u2019s sentence. The State also argues that Scott\u2019s sentence was not increased by eighty years when the corrections were made because Scott was serving the sentence for murder in Case No. 18035413, not the handgun sentence, when Judge Silver imposed the additional life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">A. Law of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">We agree with Scott that the Court of Special Appeals erred in applying the doctrine of law of the case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do not agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>with Scott, however, that the intermediate appellate court erred because Rule 4-345(a) renders the doctrine of law of the case inapplicable to motions to correct an illegal sentence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather, the Court of Special Appeals erred in its conclusion that Judge Matricciani was bound by Judge Smith\u2019s denial of Scott\u2019s motion to correct an illegal sentence because the two judges were \u201ccolleague[s] of coordinate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Stewart v. State, </em>319 Md. 81, 91, 570 A.2d 1229, 1234 (1990). It is for this reason that the doctrine of the law of the case does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In Maryland, as we explained in <em>Goldstein &amp; Baron Chartered v. Chesley, </em>375 Md. 244, 825 A.2d 985 (2003), generally, the \u201claw of the case doctrine is one of appellate procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253, 825 A.2d at 990 (internal quotations omitted). Under the doctrine, once an appellate court rules upon a question presented on appeal, litigants and lower courts become bound by the ruling, which is considered to be the law of the case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Turner v. Housing Authority of Balti</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>more <em>City, </em>364 Md. 24, 32, 770 A.2d 671, 676 (2001). Not only are lower courts bound by the law of the case, but \u201c[djecisions rendered by a prior appellate panel will generally govern the second appeal\u201d at the same appellate level as well, unless the previous decision is incorrect because it is out of keeping with controlling principles announced by a higher court and following the decision would result in manifest injustice. <em>Hawes v. Liberty Homes, </em>100 Md.App. 222, 231, 640 A.2d 743, 747 (1994); <em>see also Goldstein, </em>375 Md. at 260, 825 A.2d at 994 (adopting the reasoning in <em>Hawes); Houghton v. County Comm\u2019rs of Kent. Co., </em>305 Md. 407, 414, 504 A.2d 1145, 1149 (1986)(explaining that the law of the case doctrine does not apply to the Court of Appeals because it is required to review judgments of subordinate courts)(citing <em>Loveday v. State, </em>296 Md. 226, 229-34, 462 A.2d 58, 61(1983)). Here, however, there have been no appellate rulings in Scott\u2019s case with respect to whether Scott\u2019s sentence was illegal; rather, one circuit court judge followed the reasoning of another circuit court judge in the same case. Therefore, the law of the case doctrine is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">With respect to the decisions of circuit courts, we have held that, \u201cas a general principle, one judge of a trial court ruling on a matter is not bound by the prior ruling in the same case by another judge of the court.\u201d <em>Gertz v. Anne Arundel County, </em>339 Md. 261, 273, 661 A.2d 1157, 1163 (1995)(quoting <em>State v. Frazier, </em>298 Md. 422, 449, 470 A.2d 1269, 1283 (1984)); <em>see also Stewart, </em>319 Md. at 91, 570 A.2d at 1234 (stating that \u201cno trial judge is required to abdicate his own individual judgment merely because a colleague of coordinate jurisdiction has made a ruling\u201d). Of course, the second judge may adopt the prior judge\u2019s reasoning as his or her own, as long as that judge does not \u201cabdicate his own individual judgment.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>319 Md. at 91, 570 A.2d at 1234. When Judge Matricciani denied Scott\u2019s second motion to correct an illegal sentence, he cited Judge Smith, his peer on the Circuit Court, and quoted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>her earlier denial of Scott\u2019s first motion, thereby reflecting his agreement with her reasoning. Having so agreed, Judge Matrieciani, as Judge Smith\u2019s colleague of coordinate jurisdiction, thus, was free to adopt Judge Smith\u2019s reasoning, but he was not bound by the doctrine of the law of the case to do so. <em>See Gertz, </em>839 Md. at 273, 661 A.2d at 1163. The Court of Special Appeals erred by determining otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">As earlier mentioned, Scott also argues that Judge Matricciani abused his discretion by failing to make his own determination when he adopted or agreed with Judge Smith\u2019s reasoning. We need not explore this contention further, however, because as explained in Part B below, the determination by both judges that Scott\u2019s sentence was not illegal is correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">B. Issue of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The Court of Special Appeals correctly held that Judge Matrieciani did not err when he concluded that Scott\u2019s corrected commitment records did not result in an illegal sentence under Rule 4-345. We agree that, by correcting Scott\u2019s commitment records, Judge Byrnes did not modify Scott\u2019s sentence and render it illegal. We also agree that Judge Byrnes did not violate Rule 4-345(c) when he corrected Scott\u2019s commitment records.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Scott contends that his sentence was modified because Judge Byrnes\u2019 corrections effectively increased his sentence by eighty years. This occurs, according to Scott, because, when Judge Silver imposed a life sentence in 1983 (Case No. 18035701), he was serving his fifteen-year handgun sentence (Case No. 18035413). Because Judge Silver stated that Scott\u2019s life sentence was \u201cto run consecutive to sentence now serving,\u201d Scott, relying on <em>Robinson v. Lee, </em>317 Md. 371, 564 A.2d 395 (1989), reasons that the life sentence imposed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Judge Silver should run consecutive to the fifteen-year handgun sentence and concurrent with his subsequent sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Because Scott relies so heavily on <em>Robinson, </em>however, we first shall review the case in detail. In <em>Robinson, </em>the defendant, Lee, was convicted of robbery and sentenced by Judge Cardin of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to prison for five years. <em>Id. </em>at 373, 564 A.2d at 395. Lee then escaped and committed other crimes. After Lee was returned to custody, he was convicted of robbery with a deadly weapon and sentenced by Judge Jones of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to six years \u201cconsecutive with any sentence now serving.\u201d <em>Id., </em>564 A.2d at 396. Meanwhile, six months later, Judge Evans of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County sentenced Lee to one year\u2019s imprisonment \u201cconsecutive to any sentences now being served\u201d for escape. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, Lee escaped again, and again committed robbery with a deadly weapon, for which he was convicted by Judge Perrott of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment \u201cconsecutive with sentence now serving.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A year later, Lee was convicted for the second escape and sentenced by Judge Biener of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County to one year of imprisonment \u201cconsecutive to any sentence now being served.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, three years later, Lee was convicted for possession of marijuana, and Judge Boublitz of the District Court of Maryland, Washington County, sentenced Lee to a six-month sentence \u201ccommencing at the expiration of the present term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Lee argued that his fifteen-year sentence for robbery was consecutive to his first five-year sentence for robbery and concurrent with the other additional offenses, four of which had been imposed during his original sentence and were to be served consecutive to the sentence he was \u201cnow serving.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373-74, 564 A.2d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In <em>Robinson, </em>we agreed with Lee that \u201cnow serving\u201d could \u201crefer only to the precise sentence being served at the time the new sentence is imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377, 564 A.2d at 398. We further held that \u201c[t]he trial judge\u2019s obligation is to articulate the period of confinement with clarity so as to facilitate the prison authority\u2019s task,\u201d and we concluded that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>in Lee\u2019s case, \u201cthis was not done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 379, 564 A.2d at 399. As a result, we determined that the rule of lenity applied, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">Fundamental fairness dictates that the defendant understand clearly what debt he must pay to society for his transgressions. If there is doubt as to the penalty, then the law directs that his punishment must be construed to favor a milder over a harsher one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 379-80, 564 A.2d at 399. Therefore, in <em>Robinson, </em>under the rule of lenity, the result was that Lee\u2019s fifteen-year sentence for robbery was consecutive to his first five-year sentence for robbery and concurrent with the other additional sentences that were, in essence, simultaneously imposed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Scott\u2019s case differs from <em>Robinson </em>in several ways. The first is that Scott was still serving the sentence for murder for Case No. 18035413 when Judge Silver imposed the life sentence in 1983 for a separate murder conviction. Scott, citing <em>Robinson, </em>contends that Judge Silver\u2019s statement that the life sentence was to \u201crun consecutive to the sentence now serving\u201d refers \u201conly to the precise sentence being served.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377, 564 A.2d at 398. To a point, we do not disagree. The precise sentence being served in this case, however, was the sentence for murder for Case No. 18035413 \u2014 not the handgun sentence as Scott claims. Although Scott\u2019s death sentence was vacated by this Court twice and ultimately modified to a life sentence in 1988, his death sentence had not been modified when he was sentenced to life in 1983 by Judge Silver. When Judge Silver sentenced Scott, he stated that the life sentence was to \u201crun consecutive to the sentence now serving.\u201d The sentence Scott then was serving was the sentence for murder in Case No. 18035413.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>More importantly, although Scott\u2019s death sentence was ultimately changed, the judgment as to his murder conviction was affirmed. <em>Scott v. State, </em>297 Md. 235, 465 A.2d. 1126 (1983); <em>Scott v. State, </em>310 Md. 277, 529 A.2d 340 (1987). The fact that Scott\u2019s sentence changed from death to life makes no difference as to the order of his \u201cchain\u201d of sentences-his conviction for murder remained. <em>See Harris v. State, </em>303 Md. 685, 692, 496 A.2d 1074, 1077 (1985)(stating that, even though the defendant\u2019s previous death sentence had been vacated, the convictions remained and the subsequent sentences imposed on remand were in full force and effect). We, thus, cannot accept Scott\u2019s argument that, because his death sentence was eventually changed to a life sentence, the first of his consecutive sentences after the death sentence, the handgun sentence, was the \u201cfirst\u201d sentence he was actually serving. <em>See also State v. Jones, </em>218 Neb. 713, 358 N.W.2d 765, 767 (1984) (holding that, when two sentences are pronounced at the same time by the same court without a conseeutiveness direction, they cannot be served concurrently when death is one of the sentences); <em>Commonwealth v. Graham, </em>541 Pa. 173, 661 A.2d 1367, 1374 (1995)(holding that the death sentence is of such magnitude that the trial court does not have the discretion to order that it be consecutive to any other sentences then being imposed or previously imposed). When Judge Silver imposed the second life sentence in 1983, Scott was serving, undoubtedly, his sentence for first-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The second problem with Scott\u2019s reliance on <em>Robinson </em>is that the facts in <em>Robinson </em>are distinguishable from the facts in this case. Unlike Scott, the defendant in <em>Robinson </em>received four additional sentences during the same five-year period for which he was serving his first sentence. 317 Md. at 378, 564 A.2d at 398. In addition, each of the four judges imposing the subsequent sentences used language indicating that the sentence imposed was to be served consecutive to the one the defendant was then serving. As we explained in <em>Robinson, </em>for both the first escape and second robbery, \u201cthe language \u2018now serving\u2019 still related to the initial five year sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378, 564 A.2d at 398. Likewise, when the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>sentenced for his second escape and third robbery, he was serving the same initial five-year sentence. <em>Id. </em>The result was that <em>all of the subsequent convictions, </em>as they were to be served \u201cconsecutive\u201d with any sentence the defendant was \u201ccurrently serving,\u201d began to run after the defendant\u2019s initial five-year conviction <em>at the same time. </em>In other words, several different judges, using essentially the same language, imposed different sentences on the defendant that nevertheless began to run concurrently because they were all imposed while he was serving his first five-year sentence. Given these facts, we concluded that, under the rule of lenity, the subsequent sentences were consecutive to the first sentence and concurrent with each other. <em>Id. </em>at 379-80, 564 A.2d at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In Scott\u2019s case, the facts are much different. As Judge Smith correctly concluded, when Judge Silver used the language \u201cconsecutive to sentence now serving\u201d when he imposed the life sentence in 1983, this language did not create the kind of ambiguity that arose in <em>Robinson. See id. </em>at 379, 564 A.2d at 399 (requiring that the trial judge articulate a period of confinement with sufficient clarity to facilitate the prison authority\u2019s task). After Scott was sentenced to death in Case No. 18035413 in 1980, he was convicted and sentenced for a different murder in 1983 while he was still serving his sentence for murder in the earlier case. Unlike the defendant in <em>Robinson, </em>however, he did not receive multiple additional sentences while he was still serving his original sentence; he, instead, received one additional life sentence. Consequently, the problem of simultaneously overlapping sentences that had occurred in <em>Robinson </em>did not arise in Scott\u2019s case. Further, unlike <em>Robinson, </em>all of Scott\u2019s commitment records for the original murder conviction and related offenses (Case Nos. 18035413, 18035416, 18107511) clearly indicated the order in which they were to be served and referred to both case numbers and counts; as such, the ambiguity that arose in <em>Robinson </em>did not arise in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Finally, when Judge Silver imposed the life sentence in 1983, he said nothing \u201cexpressly or by implication\u201d that would indicate that the life sentence was to be served concurrently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>with Scott\u2019s other sentences; rather, he expressly indicated that the life sentence was a consecutive sentence. <em>See Maryland Correctional Institution v. Lee, </em>362 Md. 502, 523, 766 A.2d 80, 92 (2001)(concluding that the \u201ctrial court said nothing that expressly or by implication would indicate that each of the ... sentences was to be served concurrently with the previously imposed sentence\u201d). Therefore, we conclude that the life sentence imposed by Judge Silver in 1983 was a consecutive and not a concurrent sentence. Because Scott\u2019s sentence in Case No. 18035413 for murder was later changed to a life sentence, the result is that Scott\u2019s total sentence is two life sentences plus ninety-five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Scott\u2019s final argument is that, when Judge Byrnes corrected his commitment records, Judge Byrnes modified his sentence and violated Rule 4-345(c) because he did not hold a hearing when the corrections were made. In 1990, when Judge Byrnes modified Scott\u2019s commitment records, Rule 4-345(c) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">Open Court Hearing. The court may modify, reduce, correct, or vacate a sentence only on the record after notice to the parties and an opportunity to be heard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Although Scott argues otherwise, Scott was indeed afforded a hearing in open court on his motion to correct an illegal sentence. In response to Scott\u2019s motion, Judge Byrnes held a hearing on May 2, 1990. As his June 6 order reflects, Judge Byrnes corrected his commitment records only after Scott had an opportunity to be heard on his motion. <em>Cf. Mateen v. Saar, </em>376 Md. 385, 398-99, 829 A.2d 1007, 1014-15 (2003) (holding that an order revising a sentence resulted in an illegal sentence' because no hearing was held in open court and no notice was given to the defendant). Moreover, as the Court of Special Appeals correctly pointed out, the open hearing requirement found in Rule 4-345 ordinarily applies only when the court intends to \u201cmodify, reduce, correct, or vacate a <em>sentence.\u201d Scott, </em>150 Md.App. at 479, 822 A.2d at 478 (emphasis added). When Judge Byrnes corrected Scott\u2019s commitment records, however, Rule 4-345 did not apply; rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Rule 4-351(a), regarding commitment records, governed his actions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rule 4~351(a), unlike Rule 4-345, does not require a hearing in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Although the Court of Special Appeals erred in applying the doctrine of law of the case to a motion to correct an illegal sentence, the Court of Special Appeals correctly determined that a hearing was not required when Scott\u2019s commitment records were corrected. Moreover, we conclude that Scott\u2019s sentence was not increased by eighty years when Judge Byrnes corrected his commitment records because he was serving his sentence for murder in Case No. 18035413, not the fifteen-year handgun sentence, when he received his second life sentence. It is clear that his sentences, other than his first sentence, the sentence for murder in Case No. 18035413, are to be served consecutively to each other. As such, Scott\u2019s total sentence is two life sentences plus ninety-five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

In 1990, however, it was Maryland Rule 4-345(c) that provided the open hearing requirement. When the rule was amended in 2001, it moved, among other things, the open hearing requirement in part (c) to part (d), so that it read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">(a) Illegal sentence.

The law of the case doctrine differs from <em>res judicata </em>in that it applies to court decisions made in the same, rather than a subsequent, case. <em>Id. </em>We observe that, because motions to correct an illegal sentence occur as \"part of the same criminal proceeding and not a wholly independent action,\u201d <em>State v.

We note, however, that this is unlikely to occur because, although Maryland Rule 4-345(a) provides that \"[t]he court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>may correct an illegal sentence at any time,\u201d we have explained that the rule \"creates a limited exception to the general rule of finality [by sanctioning] a method of opening a judgment otherwise final and beyond the reach of the court.\u201d <em>State v.
