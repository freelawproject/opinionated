Respondent, Myles Lichtenberg (\u2018Lichtenberg\u2019), is an attorney who has been licensed to practice law in Maryland since June 17, 1987. Mr. Lichtenberg received a joint J.D. and Masters of Business Administration Degree from the University of Baltimore Law School in May 1986.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201c2. Since 1980 through the present, Lichtenberg has been employed in the real estate settlement and title business, working as a title agent. Lichtenberg\u2019s professional career has been almost exclusively devoted to the business of conducting real estate settlements as a title agent. He has never been actively involved in the practice of law with the exception of the representation of clients in a very few isolated matters. In conjunction with his separate law practice, Lichtenberg maintains a required Interest on Lawyer Trust Account (IOLTA) and has complied with all IOLTA reporting requirements with respect to this account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201c3. Pursuant to Md.Code Ann., Insur. \u00a7 10-125(b), a title agent who conducts a real estate settlement does not have to be an attorney; and thus, the providing of real estate settlement services does not constitute the practice of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">\u201c4. From June 1995 through June 30,1999, Mr. Lichtenberg was the President and 100% shareholder of a real estate title company, Guaranteed Title and Escrow (\u2018GTE\u2019), which was licensed and regulated by the Maryland Insurance Administration. In addition, Mr. Lichtenberg is personally licensed by the Maryland Insurance Administration as a title insurance agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201c5. During its operation, GTE conducted real estate settlement closings and issued title insurance policies as agent for various title insurance companies. In 1999, GTE had two offices in Owings Mills, Maryland, and Landover, Maryland, with approximately twenty employees, some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>whom were licensed to conduct real estate settlements. Mr. Lichtenberg directed the operations of the company, and maintained an office at the Owings Mills location. He employed an office manager to manage the Landover location. Both Lichtenberg and his employees conducted real estate closings at the offices, averaging approximately 160 closings per month in 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">\u201c6. With regard to the transaction that forms the basis for Bar Counsel\u2019s Petition, in 1999, George Gigioli sought to refinance the mortgage on his home located at 4603 Mercury Drive, Rockville, Maryland, through a mortgage he had obtained from Citywide Mortgage Corporation (\u2018Citywide\u2019). Mr. Gigioli was referred to GTE by Citywide to perform the title and settlement services. GTE Landover office employees worked with Mr. Gigioli, Citywide, and other persons (i.e., prior lenders and creditors, the title abstractor, insurers, taxing authorities, etc.) to prepare the transaction for settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201c7. Lichtenberg had no personal involvement in the preparation of any of the settlement documents for this transaction, including the calculation of the pay-off amount owed to the prior lender, Option One, or the settlement itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\u201c8. Consistent with GTE\u2019s usual and customary practices, a settlement file was maintained for the transaction. The parties have stipulated to the authenticity and admissibility of a copy of the complete GTE Landover office file, #99-55-577, bates labeled GTE INC-0001 through GTE INC-0197, and made a part of this proceeding as Joint Exhibit 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201c9. As part of the preparation for settlement, GTE obtained pay-off information from Mr. Gigioli\u2019s then-existing lender, Option One. Option One calculated the amount Mr. Gigioli owed on his mortgage as of April 14, 1999, and provided a formula for calculating additional interest charges if the settlement was held at a later date. <em>See </em>GTE INC-00028.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>\u201c10. Settlement took place on Thursday, April 29, 1999 at Mr. Gigioli\u2019s house. Prior to settlement, a GTE employee had prepared the settlement sheet (commonly referred to as the \u2018HUD-1\u2019) for closing, and mistakenly reported an incorrect amount on the settlement sheet to collect from Mr. Gigioli\u2019s new lender, Citywide, to pay-off his prior mortgage with Option One. <em>See </em>GTE INC 0084-0086 at line 105.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">\u201c11. At settlement, Mr. Gigioli executed the necessary paperwork to complete the transaction, including a separate document entitled, \u2018HUD Addendum 3, Acknowledgment and Receipt of Settlement Statement\u2019 (\u2018Addendum\u2019). <em>See </em>GTE INC 0087.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">\u201c12. Paragraph five of the Addendum signed by Mr. Gigioli states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">Guaranteed Title, [in] its sole discretion, hereby expressly reserves the right to deposit any amounts held by it in escrow in any interest bearing account in a federally insured institution and to credit any interest so earned to its own account as additional compensation for its service as Settlement Agent in this transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6U\"><em>See </em>GTE INC 0087.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">\u201c13. Paragraph 6 of the Addendum signed by Mr. Gigioli provides that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">Receipt is hereby acknowledged of Pages 1 and 2 of the Settlement Statement and Truth in Lending Disclosure Statements covering the above captioned property and same is hereby approved; and is subject to further adjustment between the parties in the event of errors in calculations and/or omissions, and authorization is given to the Guaranteed Title to advance any necessary funds in the event of errors and/or omissions and to make distribution and payments in accordance therewith. If, after reasonable demand, monies remain unpaid pursuant to this paragraph, and legal action to collect the same is initiated, the responsible party hereto agrees to pay unto Guaranteed Title and any all costs of collection including but not limited to court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>costs, incidental and/or consequential damages and/or reasonable attorney\u2019s fees arising out of the collection of monies due and owing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\"><em>See </em>GTE INC 0087.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">\u201c14. Mr. Gigioli\u2019s transaction was a refinancing, and therefore, he was allowed three business days to rescind. <em>See </em>GTE INC-0083. Upon the expiration of the three-day period on Wednesday, May 5, 1999, GTE received the new mortgage funds from Citywide, which were wired into GTE\u2019s interest bearing escrow account at Allfirst Bank pursuant to Paragraph 5 of the Addendum. The same day, GTE forwarded funds to pay-off the prior mortgage held by Option One, as well as all the parties entitled to be paid from the settlement proceeds of the transaction. <em>See, e.g., </em>GTE INC-0204.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">\u201c15. Because of the GTE employee\u2019s prior erroneous calculation of the payoff amount, GTE forwarded an insufficient amount to Option One. The amount of the shortfall as of the May 6, 1999 date was $1452.31. <em>See </em>GTE INC-0206.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">\u201c16. On or about May 6, 1999, Option One advised GTE that they had not credited the payment to Mr. Gigioli\u2019s account, and therefore, they were not releasing their mortgage on the property. Over the next two weeks, a series of attempts were made by GTE employees to determine the source of the problem with Option One and correct it. At some point during this period, Mr. Lichtenberg was made aware of the pay-off discrepancy by GTE employees. GTE later learned of its employee\u2019s miscalculation of the pay-off amount, and on May 19, 1999, GTE advanced from its operating account the additional funds (which now totaled $1,856.30 as a result of further interest charges) needed by Option One to complete the pay-off and release its mortgage on the property. <em>See </em>GTE INC-0205 and 0211.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">\u201c17. GTE later attempted to collect the $1856.30 it had advanced on behalf of Mr. Gigioli to pay-off his mortgage with Option One. At least two letters were sent to Mr. Gigioli by Mr. Lichtenberg regarding this issue. On February 8, 2000, Mr. Lichtenberg wrote Mr. Gigioli and sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>repayment. <em>See </em>GTE INC-0199. After speaking with Mr. Gigioli, on February 18, 2000, Mr. Lichtenberg wrote again and reduced his demand for repayment to $1452.31; the amount due Option One by Mr. Gigioli as of May 6, 1999, when Option One first advised GTE that it would not accept the payment. <em>See </em>GTE INC-0206.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\">\u201c18. Ultimately, GTE was forced to file suit in the District Court for Montgomery County seeking repayment of the monies it advanced in Mr. Gigioli\u2019s behalf. On January 24, 2001, the Court awarded judgment to GTE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">\u201c19. On January 8, 2001, Mr. Gigioli\u2019s attorney in the District Court case filed a complaint with the Attorney Grievance Commission, alleging that, paragraph 5 and 6 of the Addendum violated certain provisions of the Maryland Rules of Professional Responsibility and Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u201c20. On October 16, 2001, Bar Counsel filed a statement of charges against Lichtenberg, alleging possible violations of Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.15 and 8.4(b), (c), and (d), solely as it related to GTE\u2019s retention of interest derived from settlement funds, and the matter was referred to a Peer Review Committee for consideration pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-741.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">\u201c21. A hearing was held before the Peer Review Committee on January 17, 2002. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Peer Review Committee issued its recommendation to the Attorney Grievance Commission that the statement of charges be dismissed against Lichtenberg pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-743(e).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">\u201c22. On March 20, 2002, the Attorney Grievance Commission rejected the Committee\u2019s recommendation, and directed Bar Counsel to file a Petition for Disciplinary Action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">\u201c23. On October 4, 2002, Bar Counsel filed its Petition for Disciplinary Action. On January 10, 2003, Bar Counsel filed the instant Amended Petition. The misconduct alleged against Lichtenberg in the Petition is solely related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>GTE\u2019s retention of interest derived from the settlement funds in Mr. Gigioli\u2019s refinancing transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">\u201c24. Section 22-103(b) of the Insurance Article, Md. Ann.Code, requires a title insurer or its agents to pool settlement/trust funds from its clients that otherwise would not generate interest of more than $50.00, or an insufficient amount to cover the cost of maintaining a separate account for the proceeds of each individual settlement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">(b) <em>Pooling and commingling trust money authorized. </em>\u2014 A title insurer or its agent shall pool and commingle trust money received from clients or beneficial owners in connection with escrows, settlements, closings, or title indemnifications if, in the judgment of the title insurer or its agent, a separate deposit of the trust money would generate interest in an amount not greater than $50 or the cost of administering a separate account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">Insurance Article \u00a7 22-103(b). <em>See </em>Joint Exhibit 2 (attached hereto). Section 22-103(c) provides that, the interest earned on funds deposited into this account shall be paid to the Maryland Affordable Housing Trust (\u2018MAHT\u2019).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">\u201c25. Section 22-103(f) provides for the procedures to be followed for settlement proceeds (or \u2018trust money\u2019) that are expected to generate interest in excess of $50.00:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">(f) <em>Other deposits of trust money allowed. </em>\u2014 Except for trust money that a title insurer or its agent places in a commingled account under subsections (b) and (c) of this section, and subject to the regulations of the Commissioner, trust money in the possession of the title insurer or its agent may be deposited in any other deposit or investment vehicle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">(1) specified by the client or beneficial owner; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">(2) as agreed on by the client or beneficial owner and the title insurer or its agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-11\">Section 22-103(f). <em>See </em>Exhibit 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-12\">\u201c26. The term \u2018client\u2019 referenced in Section 22-103(f) is not defined in the statute; however, COMAR 31.16.03.05 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>interprets the term as <em>referring to the buyer of the home, or </em>in this case, the person refinancing his mortgage. <em>See </em>Joint Exhibit 3 attached. A \u2018beneficial owner\u2019 is defined in the statute as, \u2018a person, other than the buyer in a real estate transaction, for whose benefit a title insurer or its agent is entrusted to hold trust money.\u2019 Section 22~103(a). Thus, beneficial owner includes any local and state taxing authorities, utility companies, real estate agents, condominium associations, or any other third-parties who may be paid from real estate settlement trust funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">\u201c27. GTE maintained both a MAHT account for settlement proceeds generating less than $50.00 in interest, and a non-MAHT account for proceeds generating more than $50.00 in interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">\u201c28. In order to assist title companies in complying with Insurance Article Section 22-103, MAHT publishes a table on its website for title agents to use as a guide in determining when settlement proceeds are held in sufficient amount and for a sufficient period of time to generate interest in excess of $50.00. <em>See </em>Exhibit 4 attached. MAHT also requires an annual report to be filed by title companies detailing the amount of interest earned on both MAHT accounts and non-MAHT accounts. <em>See </em>Exhibit 5 attached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\u201c29. Pursuant to Paragraph 5 of the Addendum, GTE retained all of the interest earned on the settlement proceeds received by Citywide in the Gigioli transaction, which were maintained in GTE\u2019s non-MAHT escrow account. The amount of the interest earned was more than $50.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">\u201c30. Lichtenberg believed that GTE was complying with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as the MAHT guidelines, in establishing the procedures at GTE for the creation and use of both a MAHT and a non-MAHT account. Lichtenberg is aware from his membership in the Maryland Land and Title Association that it is common in the title industry for title companies to have customers sign agreements similar to the Addendum in this case authorizing the title company to retain the interest in excess of $50.00 on settlement funds as additional compensation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>their settlement services. <em>See, e.g., </em>Joint Exhibit 6 (1991 Report and Recommendation of Inquiry Panel. BC Docket # 91-52-14-5).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\">\u201c31. The total amount of interest earned by GTE in 1999 on all settlement funds held in GTE\u2019s non-MAHT accounts was $33,436.55.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">\u201c32. In December 1991, and prior to the enactment of the current version of Section 22-103, a prior Inquiry Panel considered whether a lawyer could retain interest earned on settlement proceeds in his capacity as the owner of a title company, notwithstanding any requirements of Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts (\u2018IOLTA\u2019) rules. (Opinion attached as Exhibit 6). The Inquiry Panel concluded that the retention of such interest by a lawyer in a non-IOLTA account did not violate any rules of professional conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">\u201c33. On February 12, 1992, in response to a letter from multiple requesting attorneys, Bar Counsel, Melvin Hirshman, reiterated the holding of the 1991 Inquiry Panel and its findings. Stating that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">Section 10-301 <em>et. seq. </em>of BOP [Business, Occupations, Professionals Article, Md. Ann.Code] does not apply to real estate settlement practices of an attorney who owns a corporate title company, since no attorney/elient relationship exists between Respondent (or the other attorney-employees of the title company) and the parties to the real estate transaction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">The BU Rules are similarly inapplicable to a corporate title company escrow account, because such an account is not an \u2018Attorney Trust Account,\u2019 as defined in Rule BU2.c. of the Maryland Rules of Procedure. The Respondent clearly complies with IOLTA requirements by virtue of the IOLTA account related to his separate law practice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">The Respondent has not violated any of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct of which he is subject as a licensed Maryland attorney, solely by virtue of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>practice of retaining escrow account interest through his corporate title company;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">And Attorneys who choose to conduct real estate closings as part of their law practice, rather than through an independent title company, <em>must </em>maintain their settlement escrow accounts as IOLTA accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\"><em>See </em>Exhibit 7 (February 12, 1992 letter from Bar Counsel Melvin Hirshman).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">\u201c34. Legislation was introduced in the Maryland Senate around this same time to create the Maryland Affordable Housing Trust. This legislation would eventually become Insurance Article section 22-103. Prior to the passage of this legislation, on May 5, 1992, the Maryland Attorney General, in a letter to then Governor William Donald Schaefer, stated his opinion that the proposed legislation (then titled Senate Bill 594) \u2018does not work [as] an unconstitutional taking\u2019 by the Maryland Affordable Housing Trust. <em>See </em>Exhibit 7 (attached).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u201c35. As it applies to the Addendum referenced in at paragraph 11 above, and pertains to the particular language contained therein as set forth in paragraph 12 above, CO-MAR 31.16.03.05 (\u2018Separate Accounts\u2019) is attached as Joint Exhibit 8.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">After the evidentiary hearing of May 12, the hearing court made the following conclusions of law (footnotes omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">\u201cFor the following reasons, the Court finds that, based on these facts, Petitioner has failed to sustain its burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent has engaged in any misconduct as alleged by Petitioner. The facts demonstrate that Respondent complied with the applicable statutes governing the title company industry in which he was engaged, specifically, Insurance Article \u00a7 22-103. Accordingly, this Court finds that Respondent has not violated any of the Rules of Professional Conduct, or any applicable statutes or regulations alleged by Petitioner to support the allegations in the Amended Petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>\u201cFirst, Respondent committed no criminal violation and Petitioner\u2019s contentions in this regard are completely unfounded. There is simply no evidence of any fraudulent and willful intent \u2018to appropriate to any use and purpose not in the due and lawful execution of his trust any money1 in his care as a fiduciary as is required for a violation of Article 27 \u00a7 132 of Md. Ann.Code. Nor is there any evidence that Respondent \u2018willfully or knowingly obtained control which is unauthorized .... over property of the owner .... \u2019 as is required for a violation of Article 27 \u00a7 342 of Md. Ann.Code. The facts establish that Respondent honestly believed he was complying with all applicable laws and regulations, <em>see </em>\u00b6 30, and had disclosed to Mr. Gigioli that GTE would retain the interest on the settlement funds pursuant to the Addendum Agreement Mr. Gigioli signed. <em>See </em>Joint Exhibit 1 (GTE INC 0087). Accordingly, there is no violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(b) and 8.4(c), because there was no evidence of a \u2018criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty,\u2019 nor any \u2018conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.\u2019 Similarly, Respondent has not violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) and its prohibition against \u2018conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice\u2019 inasmuch as Respondent\u2019s good faith compliance with the applicable insurance statute cannot amount to conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\">\u201cSecond, there is no evidence of a statutory violation of Business Occupations and Professions Article, \u00a7 10-306. Section 10-306 provides that a lawyer \u2018may not use trust money for any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.\u2019 In this case, the trust funds for Mr. Gigioli\u2019s settlement were, in fact, used by GTE for that settlement and to pay off all the required parties. Indeed, the buyer and every beneficial owner in the transaction were paid exactly the amount they were owed. The interest earned on these funds was retained by GTE pursuant to its separate Agreement with the \u2018buyer,\u2019 Mr. Gigioli, as allowed by the applicable insurance statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>\u201cThird, there is no evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15 regarding the safekeeping of a client\u2019s property. Sections (a) and (c) of Rule 1.15 apply to client property <em>in connection with a representation </em>by the lawyer. Here, there is no lawyer/client relationship with the buyer, especially when Respondent did not even conduct the settlement transaction at issue. Further, the parties have agreed that the providing of real estate settlement services does not constitute the practice of law, <em>see </em>\u00b6 3, an identical position articulated by Bar Counsel in an earlier letter to requesting attorneys and placed into the record of this case. <em>See </em>Joint Exhibit 7 (February 12, 1992 letter from Melvin Hirshman) and \u00b6 33 above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\">\u201cWhile Rule 1.15(b) may impart duties on a lawyer beyond the lawyer/client relationship, the rule merely requires the lawyer to promptly deliver to the client or third person any funds that the client or third person is \u2018entitled to receive,\u2019 or as is \u2018otherwise permitted by law or by agreement with the client....\u2019 Petitioner here has failed to demonstrate that the buyer, or any of the other beneficial owners in the transaction were entitled to receive any of the interest earned on the settlement funds. Indeed, GTE had obtained the signature of the buyer on GTE\u2019s separate Addendum Agreement indicating GTE\u2019s intention to retain the interest on the settlement funds. <em>See </em>Joint Exhibit 1 (GTE INC 0087). The evidence establishes that Respondent delivered to the client and all applicable third parties all funds due them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">\u201cPetitioner\u2019s remaining allegations of misconduct turn on its interpretation of Insurance Article \u00a7 22-103. Section 22-103(b) of the Insurance Article, Md. Ann.Code, requires a title insurer or its agents to pool settlement/trust funds from its clients that otherwise would not generate interest of more than $50:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">(b) <em>Pooling and commingling trust money authorized. </em>\u2014 A title insurer or its agent shall pool and commingle trust money received from clients or beneficial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>owners in connection with escrows, settlements, closings, or title indemnifications <em>if, </em>in the judgment of the title insurer or its agent, a separate deposit of the trust money would generate interest in an amount not greater than $50 or the cost of administering a separate account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Insurance Article \u00a7 22-103(b) (emphasis added). Further, section 22-103(c)' provides that, the interest earned on funds deposited into this account shall be paid to \u2018the Maryland Affordable Housing Trust [MAHT] to enhance the availability of affordable housing throughout the state.... \u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">\u201cSection 22-103(f) describes the procedures used for settlement proceeds (or \u2018trust money\u2019) that is expected to generate interest in excess of $50.00, which may be retained by the title agent in a non-MAHT account:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">(0 <em>Other deposits of trust money allowed. </em>\u2014 Except for trust money that a title insurer or its agent places in a commingled account under subsections (b) and (c) of this section, and subject to the regulations of the Commissioner, trust money in the possession of the title insurer or its agent may be deposited in any other deposit or investment vehicle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">(1) specifically by the client or beneficial owner, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">(2) as agreed on by the client <em>or </em>beneficial owner and the title insurer or its agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">Section 22-103(f) (emphasis added). The \u2018client\u2019 referenced in the statute refers to the buyer of the home, or in this case, the person refinancing his mortgage. A \u2018beneficial owner\u2019 is defined in the statute as \u2018a person, other than the buyer in a real estate transaction, for whose benefit a title insurer or its agent is entrusted to hold trust money.\u2019 Section 22-103(a). Conceivably, this could include all local and state taxing authorities, utility companies, real estate agents, condominium associations, and any other parties paid out of real estate settlement trust funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">\u201cIn the instant case, because the settlement at issue was expected to generate interest in excess of $50.00 pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Section 22 \u2014 103(f), GTE had the client/buyer sign a separate Addendum to the HUD-1 statement in which he agreed that GTE could retain any interest earned on the settlement funds. <em>See </em>Joint Exhibit 1 (GTE INC 0087). Thus, Respondent complied with all statutory requirements. Petitioner\u2019s argument that section 22-103 requires that GTE must obtain the agreement of <em>all </em>the beneficial owners of the trust funds before it can retain the interest on those funds, <em>see </em>Amended Petition \u00b6 18, ignores the disjunctive use of the word, \u2018or,\u2019 in Section 22-103(f) and the plain meaning of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\">\u201cWhen a statutory provision is \u2018clear and unambiguous and express[es] a plain meaning,\u2019 a court must give effect to the statute as it is written. <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 428 (1995) (citations omitted). Further, where the statute is clear, \u2018no construction or clarification is needed or permitted, it being the rule that a plainly worded statute must be construed without forced or subtle interpretations designed to extend or limit the scope of its operation.\u2019 <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Dept. of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, </em>356 Md. 180, 189, 738 A.2d 856, 861 (1999). If the interpretation offered by Petitioner is accepted, and not only the client/buyer, but <em>all </em>\u2018beneficial owners\u2019 would need to agree to an alternative use of the interest earned on settlement trust funds in excess of $50, then the word \u2018or\u2019 would have no meaning in the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">\u201cFurther, under Petitioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute, title agents such as GTE would have to obtain the consent of every conceivable \u2018beneficial owner\u2019 of settlement proceeds such as mortgage companies, banks, lien holders, taxing authorities, utility companies, condominium associations and other entities before retaining the interest earned. Clearly, obtaining this consent from multiple parties would be logistically difficult, if not impossible, given the short time the funds are in the title company\u2019s account before closing, and conceivably could render the statute unconstitutional as applied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>\u201cPetitioner contends that it merely seeks to apply the common law principle that \u2018the interest follows the principal.\u2019 In the instant matter, however, the Court must apply the Maryland statutory law that governs this situation, and there is no clear and convincing evidence that Respondent has violated the applicable statute. Further, to adopt Petitioner\u2019s position would create two meanings of the statute: one for lawyers, and one for non-lawyers authorized to conduct real estate settlements in Maryland who would not otherwise be restricted from obtaining the interest earned in these transactions. In the instant matter, GTE obtained the consent of GTE\u2019s client or buyer, Mr. Gigioli, to retain this interest, and therefore, neither GTE nor Respondent violated the requirements of Section 22-103. Petitioner\u2019s attempt to place an additional requirement that Respondent <em>also </em>obtain the consent of <em>any </em>other \u2018beneficial owner\u2019 of these funds is contrary to the clear, plain reading of the statute, and not specifically supported by any case law, or any ruling of the Maryland Insurance Administration, which is charged with enforcing the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">\u201cIn sum, GTE and Respondent complied with the plain language of \u00a7 22-103 in this case. Accordingly, Petitioner has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated any statute or Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">This Court has original jurisdiction over attorney disciplinary proceedings. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harris, </em>371 Md. 510, 539, 810 A.2d 457, 474-75 (2002). In the exercise of our obligation, we conduct an independent review of the record, accepting the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Garfield, </em>369 Md. 85, 97, 797 A.2d 757, 763-64 (2002). We review the hearing judge\u2019s proposed conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>of law <em>de novo. See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McLaughlin, </em>372 Md. 467, 493, 813 A.2d 1145, 1160 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The heart of Bar Counsel\u2019s complaint against respondent boils down to one contention: that by depositing into his title insurance company\u2019s account the interest from funds entrusted to him by clients of the title insurance company, without the express consent of the \u201cbeneficial owners,\u201d respondent violated the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent does not engage in the active practice of law but instead was acting as a title agent whose main business activity is to conduct real estate settlements, which is governed, pursuant to the Insurance Article of the Maryland Code, by the Commissioner of the Insurance Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">A title insurance agent or broker \u201cmeans a person that, for compensation, solicits, procures, or negotiates title insurance contracts.\u201d \u00a7 10 \u2014 101(i)(l) of the Insurance Article.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A title insurance agent or broker \u201cincludes a person that provides escrow, closing, or settlement services that may result in the issuance of a title insurance contract.\u201d \u00a7 10 \u2014 101(i)(2). Before a person may act as a title agent or broker in the State, that person must obtain a license, which issued by the Insurance Commissioner. \u00a7 10-103. Respondent received such license from the Insurance Administration. <em>See </em>Joint Stipulation of Facts, at \u00b6 4. As a duly licensed title agent, respondent became subject to the authority of the Insurance Commissioner who, in the exercise of his authority, could revoke respondent\u2019s license or impose other penalties, such as fines or financial restitution, for violations of the Insurance Article. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-126.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The Insurance Article contains a detailed structure for the denial, suspension or revocation of a license. Section 10-126 authorizes the Insurance Commissioner to deny, revoke, suspend or refuse to renew or reinstate a license if the applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>or holder has, <em>inter alia, </em>violated the insurance article; misappropriated, converted or unlawfully withheld money belonging to an insurer, agent, broker, beneficiary or insured; or committed fraudulent or dishonest practices in the insurance business. Section 10-131 provides that certain violations of the insurance article constitute a misdemeanor, subject to a fine or imprisonment up to six months or both for each violation. Before a license may be revoked or suspended, the holder must be afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard. \u00a7 10-126(a). The actions of the Insurance Commissioner are subject to judicial review. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-215.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">It is undisputed that the Commissioner has taken no administrative action against respondent, and more specifically, we were advised at oral argument that the Insurance Administration was contacted by Bar Counsel for guidance on the matter but provided none. Bar Counsel urges us to take the initiative and to interpret the Insurance Article in a matter of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Bar Counsel argues that respondent violated the statute and that as a result, we should discipline him in his capacity as a lawyer. Bar Counsel maintains that respondent violated \u00a7 22 \u2014 103(f) by not securing the consent of any \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d before he retained the interest on settlement proceeds, notwithstanding the fact that he secured the consent of his client. Bar Counsel also alleges that the statute requires consent that conformed to the applicable administrative regulation, which mandates that any funds not deposited into a MAHT account must be pursuant to a written agreement that is either (1) a separate agreement, or (2) \u201cif part of another agreement, in conspicuous type and initialed by the buyer or beneficial owner.\u201d COMAR. 31.16.03.05B.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Respondent argues that although GTE retained all of the interest earned on the settlement proceeds which were received in the Gigioli transaction and maintained by GTE\u2019s nonMAHT escrow account, he complied with all the statutory requirements of \u00a7 22 \u2014 103(f). Respondent\u2019s argument is twofold: First, respondent argues the statute is written in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>disjunctive and that the use of the word \u201cor\u201d clearly contemplates that consent of either the beneficial owner <em>or </em>the client satisfies the statute; and respondent obtained the consent of Mr. Gigioli in the HUD-1 Addendum in accordance with all applicable statutes, a finding of fact by the hearing court to which Bar Counsel does not take exception. Second, respondent argues that obtaining consent from every conceivable \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d is not possible and was not contemplated by the statute. As result, he argues the disciplinary petition must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">We shall not proceed down the path suggested by Bar Counsel. While this Court has the authority to proceed in the manner suggested by Bar Counsel in this case of first impression, we think it injudicious under the circumstances to engage in an analysis of the Insurance Article and to construe the statute and the obligations of a title agent <em>vis-a-vis </em>the trust account and MAHT account. In order for us to address this issue, we would be required to interpret a provision of the Insurance Article that has not previously been addressed judicially. Specifically, we would need to determine whether \u00a7 22-103(f) of the Insurance Article was violated when respondent did not inform the \u201cbeneficial owners\u201d of the interest-sweeping provision in the contract. This interpretation of \u00a7 22 \u2014 103(f) is not at all self-evident, which is demonstrated by the lengthy arguments from both parties regarding this issue, and as a consequence, the culpability of respondent\u2019s conduct becomes highly questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">There is the complete absence of any case or authority on this issue in this State or elsewhere in the country. In addition, the Insurance Commissioner is not a party to these proceedings and thus would be precluded from input on an issue of significant importance to many title insurance agents and brokers practicing in this State. <em>Cf. Luskin\u2019s v. Consumer Protection, </em>338 Md. 188, 196, 657 A.2d 788, 791-92 (1995) (noting that \u201c[w]e find that the mere nature of this dispute indicates the need for the interpretation of the facts and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>application of the law to the facts to be done, in the first instance, by the agency with special expertise in the area\u201d); <em>Fosler v. Panoramic Design, Ltd., </em>376 Md. 118, *, 829 A.2d 271, * (2003) (noting that \u201cwhen an administrative agency like the Home Improvement Commission is charged with administering a statute, the administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts\u201d (citations omitted)). Under the circumstances presented herein, it makes sense to us to construe the statute in question, as a matter of first impression, in a judicial case other than in the exercise of our role to supervise and discipline attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Respondent has argued vigorously that he has complied with \u00a7 22-103 under any reasonable reading of that statute. He argues the statute does not require consent from both the title agent\u2019s client <em>and </em>the beneficial owners but from the client <em>or </em>the beneficial owners, as indicated by the plain language of the statute. The trial court found that respondent received the consent of his client, Mr. Gigioli, in accordance with the statute, a finding which Bar Counsel does not dispute. Bar Counsel disputes respondent\u2019s statutory construction and argues that the statute required consent from the beneficial owners in addition to the clients. What is striking, however, is that neither party can refer us to a single opinion, decision, or action issued by the Insurance Administration on this question; indeed, at oral argument, Bar Counsel informed us that he had contacted the Commissioner of the Insurance Administration but had received no answer to his inquiry on the issue. Instead, they both would have us opine without receiving any input from the agency in charge of administering this statute. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Neither a criminal conviction nor a statutory violation is a prerequisite for this Court to proceed with disciplinary action against an attorney. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Childress, </em>364 Md. 48, 55, 770 A.2d 685, 689 (2001) (recognizing that a criminal conviction is not necessary to show that attorney\u2019s conduct was criminal, but in the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>of a conviction, Bar Counsel must prove the conduct was criminal by clear and convincing evidence). Nonetheless, under the circumstances of this case, where the basis of Bar Counsel\u2019s complaint relates to conduct not connected with the practice of law, it would be inappropriate for this Court to determine in the first instance if respondent violated the Insurance Article, and then to impose sanctions with respect to his license to practice law, particularly where the Commissioner was aware of the conduct and declined to exercise his authority to regulate respondent\u2019s conduct as an agent or broker. Accordingly, Bar Counsel\u2019s exception to the hearing court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 22-103 is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Bar Counsel\u2019s exception to the hearing court\u2019s finding that \u00a7 342 of Article 27<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was not violated is also overruled. Respondent did not commit theft as defined in \u00a7 342 of Article 27. Bar Counsel argues that because respondent \u201chad the purpose of depriving the owner of property,\u201d <em>id., </em>this intent was sufficient to render his actions theft. We need not decide whether respondent had the intent necessary to satisfy \u00a7 342 because his actions do not fall within \u00a7 342 in another respect: Respondent never had any unauthorized control over the property as required by the statute because his client consented to respondent\u2019s retention of the disputed interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Nor did respondent violate Maryland Code (1989, 2000 RepLVol., 2003 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article. Bar Counsel excepts to the findings of the hearing court on this matter, but provides no theory explaining why the hearing court\u2019s legal analysis was incorrect. We agree with the hearing court, and the exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Bar Counsel alleges that respondent violated Rule 1.15(a), (b), and (c), dealing with a lawyer\u2019s safekeeping of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>property. We agree with the hearing court with respect to Rule 1.15(a) and (c), and find no violation of those provisions because respondent\u2019s actions were not in connection with legal representation of a client. Rule 1.15(b), unlike (a) and (c), does not indicate explicitly whether it applies to actions outside the course of legal representation. We do not decide the question of whether 1.15(b), like (a) and (c), contemplates some sort of nexus with legal representation, because the only plausible violation of this provision by respondent arises only if he violated \u00a7 22-103(f) of the Insurance Article by not notifying the beneficial owners, which we have already discussed and dismissed. Thus, Bar Counsel\u2019s exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Finally, Bar Counsel excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that respondent did not violate Rule 8.4(b), (c), and (d). We agree with the hearing judge=s analysis that Bar Counsel has not proven by clear and convincing evidence that respondent committed a criminal act that reflects adversely on respondent\u2019s honesty, nor has Bar Counsel proven that respondent engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice or involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. The exception is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">There being no violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, the petition is hereby dismissed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\n<em>PETITION FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION DISMISSED.

I would dismiss the petition because I do not believe that Bar Counsel has presented to us any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>basis for overturning Judge Kahl\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Lichtenberg did not violate any of the rules or statutes alleged by Bar Counsel. I write separately only to express my disagreement with the Court\u2019s refusal to construe \u00a7 22 \u2014 103(f) of the Insurance Article. When charges are brought against an attorney based on the violation of a statute, even one that is subject to administrative enforcement by some Executive agency, it is the proper and necessary function of this Court to construe the statute in the attorney grievance proceeding, if such construction is necessary to determine whether a violation of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">I am not aware of any other instance in which this Court has shied from that responsibility simply because the statute has not previously been construed, or because it may be ambiguous, or because it is also subject to administrative enforcement by an Executive agency. If construction of the statute is relevant to a determination of the issue presented to us in the disciplinary proceeding, it is our duty and responsibility to construe the statute, even if the administrative agency is not a party. We are, in this case, ignoring that duty and responsibility and thus leaving uncertain, for every lawyer who operates or works for a title or settlement company, an issue of grave importance to them. The notion that the Court should construe statutes only when adjudicating disputes in the normal litigation context is unprecedented, unwarranted, and unworkable. If this strange notion is intended as a disguised application of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, it is, for the reasons stated in my dissent in the companion case of <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Davis, </em>379 Md. 361, 842 A.2d 26, 2004 WL 243842 (2004), also Constitutionally inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">As noted, Judge Kahl found that, by obtaining his client\u2019s consent to retain the interest, over $50, on the escrow funds, Mr. Lichtenberg did not violate \u00a7 22-103(f). Bar Counsel excepted to the conclusion, but only on the ground that the statute, in his view, requires the consent of not only the client but also of every other person who may qualify as a beneficial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>owner. Because the consent requirement is stated in the disjunctive \u2014 the client <em>or </em>the beneficial owners \u2014 and because the term \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d is defined to exclude the client, I do not accept Bar Counsel\u2019s argument that, in a case such as this, any other person\u2019s consent was necessary. There may be situations in which third parties will have a property interest in escrowed funds and will therefore be \u201cbeneficial owners\u201d whose consent will be required. This was not such a case, however. No one other than Mr. Gigioli could have had any beneficial ownership with respect to the interest generated by the escrow funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Bar Counsel did not except to the conclusion on any other basis, including that Mr. Lichtenberg failed properly to obtain his client\u2019s consent. Although, in light of the requirement of COMAR 31.16.03.05, that a client\u2019s consent be obtained either in a separate document or in conspicuous type and initialed by the client, and the absence from this record of evidence of compliance with that regulation, a question may be raised whether Mr. Lichtenberg did properly obtain his client\u2019s consent, Bar Counsel has not argued a violation on that ground, and it would therefore be inappropriate for us, on this record, to find a violation on that basis. We should, however, address and construe the statute based on Bar Counsel\u2019s exception, find no violation on that basis, and not leave Mr. Lichtenberg wondering whether, if he does the same thing tomorrow, he will again be haled before the Attorney Grievance Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Judge Harrell has authorized me to state that he joins in this concurring opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Dissenting Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AqS\">BELL, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">For the reasons set forth in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.
