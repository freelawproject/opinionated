The question of Maryland law set forth in the Certification Order is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AMs-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The borrowers, the Drews, argue that Maryland\u2019s Secondary Mortgage Loan Law (Secondary Mortgage Law) requires the lender to disclose to the borrower that a lender is required to postpone a balloon payment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at maturity -without charge at the borrower\u2019s request. When a lender does not do so, the Drews maintain that the Secondary Mortgage Law is violated and its penalty provisions apply. Wilshire Credit Corporation, the current holder of the Drews\u2019 secondary mortgage, argues that the Secondary Mortgage Law does not require the lender to disclose to the borrower the one-time postponement right. Wilshire also argues that the Drews were not harmed by the loan provision at issue because the balloon payment provision was not triggered and that the Secondary Mortgage Law\u2019s penalty provisions could apply in this case only if they had denied the Drews their right to postponement when the balloon payment matured.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Whether Md.Code Ann.

Because we so hold, we do not reach the question as to whether the penalty provisions found in Section 12-413 apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Alton and Verne Drew purchased a new residence in Frederick, Maryland, from Ryan Homes. Part of the purchase price was issued in the form of a loan, signed on December 15, 2000, secured by a secondary mortgage, now held by Wilshire Credit Corporation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with a balloon payment of an amount that approximates 92% of the principal of the secondary mortgage after payments for 15 years. The promissory note provided for principal and interest payments of $763.98 monthly, commencing February 1, 2001, with the last payment due January 1, 2016. Under the balloon payment disclosure, the amount due at maturity is estimated to be $54,063.30. The balloon payment provision was disclosed to the Drews in writing, and they inscribed their agreement to the provision. The loan documents did not reflect the fact, however, that Section 12-404(c)(2) of the Commercial Law Article requires lenders, in this case, Wilshire, to postpone the maturity date of the loan one time for six months at the borrower\u2019s request. Rather, the loan provisions stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">Unless otherwise expressly disclosed in the Note, or in an Addendum or a Rider to the Note, THE LENDER IN THIS TRANSACTION IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO REFINANCE THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THIS LOAN DUE ON MATURITY DATE. You may be required to payoff the entire principal balance, plus any unpaid interest due thereon, on the maturity date using personal assets. If this Lender, or any other Lender, agrees to refinance the outstanding balance due on the maturity date, you may be required to pay the then prevailing interest rate, which may be higher or lower than the interest rate specified in the Note, plus loan origination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>costs and fees as are typically incurred when creating a new loan. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The balloon payment is not due until 2016, and the Drews have not requested an extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">We will examine Section 12-404(e)(2) of the Secondary Mortgage Law to resolve whether the provision requires the lender to disclose in writing to the borrower that a one-time six-month postponement period is available to the borrower at the time the entire principal payment or balloon payment matures. To do so, we will explore the statute\u2019s plain language and legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">A. The Secondary Mortgage Law</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Balloon payments have long been identified as loan transactions that are particularly problematic for consumer borrowers. <em>See, e.g., </em>HUD Task Force at 97 (explaining how balloon terms can be \u201conerous\u201d and result in higher payments for the borrower); William N. Eskridge, Jr., <em>One Hundred Years of Ineptitude: The Need for Mortgage Rules Consonant With Economic and Psychological Dynamics of the Home Sale and Loan Transaction, </em>70 Va. L.Rev. 1083, 1158 (1984) (describing balloon payments as a \u201chigh-stakes gamble by the home purchaser that he can refinance the principal -with a new loan, or that he can sell the house for a price close to or higher than the balloon\u201d). While some states forbid them altogether, <em>see, e.g., </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 24-l.lE(b) (2001), other states, like Maryland, allow balloon payments in certain circumstances. The Uniform Consumer Credit Code, for example, which influenced many state statutes in this area, provides that, with respect to balloon payments, a \u201ccontract evidencing the consumer credit transaction gives the consumer the right to refinance the amount of the final payment.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-308 of the Uniform Consumer Credit Code. In Iowa, the state requires lenders to offer to refinance the balloon payment twenty days prior to the balloon payment date. Iowa Code \u00a7 534.205(6)(2001). Likewise, California requires the lender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>to offer or arrange for refinancing upon the balloon payment\u2019s maturity. Cal. Health &amp; Saf.Code \u00a7 52513.5(a) (2003). In Maine, balloon payment provisions are allowed only if the contract gives the consumer the right to refinance. Me.Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.9-A, \u00a7 3-308 (2002). In Kansas, the borrower has the right to refinance the amount of a balloon payment at maturity without penalty. Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 16a-3-308 (1995). Although their approaches differ, the goal of all of these statutes is to provide borrowers with the knowledge and ability to refinance their balloon payment without penalty if they are unable to pay it off at maturity.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The General Assembly of Maryland enacted the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law in 1967.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 1967 Md. Laws, Ch. 390. When the Secondary Mortgage Law first was enacted, balloon payments were prohibited in secondary mortgages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, providing that \u201c[n]o lender shall make or offer to make any secondary mortgage loan except within the terms and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>conditions authorized by this subtitle,\u201d 1967 Md. Laws, Ch. 390, Section 60, the Secondary Mortgage Law included a civil penalty provision<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and a criminal penalty provision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Secondary Mortgage Law was recodified without modification as part of the Commercial Law Article in 1975. 1975 Md. Laws, Ch. 49, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">From 1975 to 1985, the General Assembly modified the Secondary Mortgage Law several times. In 1975, the General Assembly changed the statute to allow balloon payments in commercial loans and residential secondary loans designed to help a borrower sell his residence. 1975 Md. Laws, Ch. 574. It also added two express disclosure provisions, requiring that the balloon payment be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">I. Expressly disclosed to the borrower, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">II. Agreed to by both the borrower and the lender/seller in writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Md. Laws 1975, Ch. 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">In 1982, during a savings and loan crisis, the General Assembly modified the Secondary Mortgage Law as part of a comprehensive effort to make mortgages more available to prospective homeowners during a period of heightened interest rates. <em>See </em>Bill file for House Bill 305, testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Delegate John W. Quade, 1982. House Bill 305, which amended the provision at issue here, was passed as part of this effort. Its primary intent was the expansion of the availability of balloon payment provisions and the establishment of the maximum rate of interest lenders could charge on secondary mortgage loans.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Extracts from House Bill 305\u2019s bill file, however, indicate that the legislation as introduced was perceived as weakening the consumer protection provisions in its companion legislation, House Bill 1853. Summary of Testimony of Delegate Stephen V. Sklar on House Bill 305 (1982); Letter from Stephen Sachs, Attorney General, to Senator Harry J. McQuirk, Chairman of the Senate Economic Affairs Committee (April 7, 1982). Three days after the Attorney General expressed his concerns about the bill, the Senate Economic Affairs Committee adopted an amendment to the bill adding a postponement provision to the statute. Substitute Committee Amendment No. 4 to House Bill No. 305 (April 10, 1982). Consequently, after the amendment, Section 12-404(c)(2) required that a balloon payment must be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">I. Expressly disclosed to the borrower;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">II. Agreed to by both the borrower and the lender/seller in writing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">III. Required to be postponed one time, upon becoming due, at the borrower\u2019s request, for a period not to exceed 24 months, provided that the borrower continues to make the monthly installments provided for in the original loan agreement, and no new closing costs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>processing fees or similar fees are imposed on the borrower as a result of the extension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Maryland Code, \u00a7 125 \u2014 404(c)(2)(i)\u2014(iii) of the Commercial Law Article (1975,1983 RepLVoL).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Finally, in 1985, the General Assembly changed the statutory postponement period from twenty-four to six months, the postponement period presently available to consumer borrowers. 1985 Md. Laws, Ch. 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">B. The Postponement Provision Does Not Require Written Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Turning now to the provision at issue, we begin our analysis by examining Commercial Law Article, Section 12-404(c)(2), which governs balloon payments in secondary mortgage loans. As we explained in <em>Beyer, </em>ascertaining legislative intent is the principal goal of statutory interpretation. <em>Beyer v. Morgan State Univ., </em>369 Md. 335, 349, 800 A.2d 707, 715 (2002). The most important goal of statutory interpretation, we have emphasized often, is to \u201cidentify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute(s) at issue.\u201d <em>Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 335, 748 A.2d 478, 483 (2000). <em>See also Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 444-45, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997); <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730, 731 (1986). The plain statutory language is the best source of legislative intent, and, when the language is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends there. <em>Beyer, </em>369 at 349, 800 A.2d at 715. Even so, while the plain language of the statute guides our understanding of legislative intent, we do not read the language in a vacuum. <em>See Derry, </em>358 Md. at 336, 748 A.2d at 483-84. We read statutory language within the context of the statutory scheme, considering the \u201cpurpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body.\u201d <em>Beyer, </em>369 Md. at 350, 800 A.2d at 715; <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 711, 782 A.2d 332, 346 (2001)(quoting <em>Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 387, 614 A.2d 590, 594 (1992)). We have explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>When we pursue the context of statutory language, we are not limited to the words of the statute as they are printed____ We may and often must consider other \u201cexternal manifestations\u201d or \u201cpersuasive evidence,\u201d including a bill\u2019s title and function paragraphs, amendments that occurred as it passed through the legislature, its relationship to earlier and subsequent legislation, and other material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal, which becomes the context within which we read the particular language before us in a given case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 711-12, 782 A.2d at 346 (quoting <em>Williams v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 101, 116, 753 A.2d 41, 49 (2000)). In short, our role is to apply a \u201ccommonsensical\u201d approach to the information available to us so that we may best effectuate the General Assembly\u2019s intent. <em>Graves v. State, </em>364 Md. 329, 346, 772 A.2d 1225, 1235 (2001); <em>see also Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994); <em>Dickerson v. State, </em>324 Md. 163, 171, 596 A.2d 648, 652 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Section 12-404(c)(2) of the Secondary Mortgage Law provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">(2) A lender, including a seller who takes a mortgage or deed of trust to secure payment of all or a portion of the purchase price of a residence sold to a borrower, may make a loan for the purpose of aiding the borrower in the sale of the borrower\u2019s residence or the purchase of a new residence, and may create a balloon payment at maturity of this loan if the balloon payment is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">(i) Expressly disclosed to the borrower;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">(ii) Agreed to by both the borrower and the lender/seller in writing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">(iii) Required to be postponed one time, upon becoming due, at the borrower\u2019s request, for a period not to exceed 6 months, provided that the borrower continues to make the monthly installments provided for in the original loan agreement, and no new closing costs, processing fees or similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>fees are imposed on the borrower as a result of the extension ____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Code, \u00a7 12-404(c)(2) of the Commercial Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Although the disclosure provisions listed in (i) and (ii) explicitly require lenders to expressly inform borrowers in writing that a balloon payment provision is included within the loan, whether the postponement provision found in part (iii) is a necessary part of the express disclosure provisions listed in (i) and (ii) is less than clear. Informed by the maxim <em>\u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius,\u201d </em>meaning the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of another, <em>Baltimore Harbor Charters, Ltd. v. Ayd, </em>365 Md. 366, 385, 780 A.2d 303, 314 (2001), we conclude that, because the General Assembly expressly required written notice in the first two parts of the statute, the fact that it did not expressly require written notice in part (iii) reveals an intent to exclude notice for that provision, particularly in view of the fact that the provision was enacted at a later time than the other provisions. <em>See Macht v. Department of Assessments, </em>266 Md. 602, 618-19, 296 A.2d 162, 171 (1972)(explaining that, where the Legislature enumerates specific instances allowing assessments, they have excluded any others by implication, and, thus, the maxim \u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d appropriately controls such a situation); <em>see also Ridge Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing, Inc. v. Brennen, </em>366 Md. 336, 352, 783 A.2d 691, 700 (2001)(stating that, when we attempt to harmonize different statutory provisions, we \u201cpresume that, when the Legislature enacted the later of the two statutes, it was aware of the one earlier enacted\u201d); <em>Alan J. Cornblatt, P.A. v. Barow, </em>153 N.J. 218, 708 A.2d 401 (1998)(explaining that, \u201cwhere the Legislature has carefully employed a term in one place and excluded it in another, it should not be implied where excluded\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Moreover, we are unable to find an instance, and have been referred to none, where this Court has inferred express notice from one provision in which express notice was required to another provision where express notice was not required. <em>Cf. Liverpool v. Baltimore Diamond Exch., Inc., </em>369 Md. 304, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>313 n. 11, 799 A.2d 1264, 1269 n. 11 (2002) (noting that Section 14-1102 of the Maryland Sales Layaway Act requires that a \u201clayaway agreement shall be in writing and contain all of the agreements of the parties and shall be signed by all of the parties to it\u201d); <em>General Motors Corp. v. Schmitz, </em>362 Md. 229, 236, 764 A.2d 838, 841 (2001)(observing that the statute at issue required that notice be \u201cconspicuously disclosed to the consumer in writing\u201d); <em>Anderson v. Ford Motor Credit Corp., </em>323 Md. 327, 335, 593 A.2d 678, 682 (1991)(finding that the lessor did not provide the lessees with a written statement containing the required disclosures under a statute requiring, among other things, a \u201cwritten statement\u201d); <em>Rockville Grosvenor, Inc. v. Montgomery County, </em>289 Md. 74, 77, 422 A.2d 353, 356 (1980) (noting that the statute at issue was a \u201cconsumer protection disclosure statute\u201d because it required a developer to prepare a \u201cproperty report\u201d). As we have explained, \u201c[i]n order for one statute to alter or limit another, the intention of the Legislature to do so must be clear and manifest.\u201d <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Clerk of Superior Court, </em>270 Md. 316, 319, 311 A.2d 261, 263 (1973). Therefore, because the Legislature has not clearly manifested any intention to read the disclosure provisions found in parts (i) and (ii) into part (iii), we hold that Section 12 \u2014 404(c)(2)(iii) does not require the lender to notify the borrower in writing about the statutory one-time postponement right.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>The Drews do cite a 1985 Attorney General Opinion construing Section 12 \u2014 404(c)(3)(i), the Secondary Mortgage Law provision regarding balloon payments in commercial loans, as requiring the lender to give the residential borrower notice of the statutory postponement right under Section 12-404(c)(2)(iii). 70 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 87 (1985). Section 12-404(c)(3)(i) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">A commercial loan of $75,000 or less made under this subtitle need not be amortized in equal or substantially equal payments and may contain a balloon payment at maturity <em>if the borrower is authorized, to postpone the maturity date one time </em>and continue to make installment payments as provided in the original loan agreement and the postponed maturity date does not exceed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">1. 24 months if the original maturity date is more than 12 months after the loan is made; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">2. 6 months if the original maturity date is 12 months or less after the loan is made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Maryland Code, \u00a7 12-404(c)(3)(i) of the Commercial Law Article (1975, 2000 Repl.Vol.) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">The Attorney General found that the ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201cauthorized to postpone\u201d required \u201cthe loan transaction [to] clearly give the borrower the right to postpone on a one-time basis ... the maturity date of the loan.\u201d 70 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. at 89. The Attorney General then concluded that, because of the Secondary Mortgage Law\u2019s evident remedial purpose, Section 12^104(c)(2)(iii) also required the lender to give the borrower notice of the one-time postponement provision. <em>Id. </em>at 89-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Although we carefully consider Attorney General opinions, we are not bound by them. <em>See State v. Crescent Cities Jaycees Found., Inc., </em>330 Md. 460, 470, 624 A.2d 955, 960 (1993); <em>Valentine v. Board of License Comm\u2019rs, </em>291 Md. 523, 534, 435 A.2d 459, 465 (1981); <em>Read Drug &amp; Chem. Co. v. Claypoole, </em>165 Md. 250, 257, 166 A. 742, 745 (1933). While the issue of whether Section 12 \u2014 404(c)(3)(i) requires notice of the one-time postponement option with respect to commercial loans of $75,000 or less is not before us, we are doubtful that under the Attorney General\u2019s reasoning that it does, particularly given the fact that Section 12-404(c)(3) does not even include the express disclosure provisions found in the first two portions of Section 12-404(c)(2). We also point out that, in addition to disagreeing with the Attorney General that Section 12 \u2014 404(e)(2)(iii) requires notice, we also disagree with his comparison of Section 12-404(e)(2)(iii) and Section 12-404(c)(3)(i). We note that, unlike Section 12 \u2014 404(c)(3)(i), Section 12 \u2014 404(c)(2)(iii) does not use the phrase \u201cif the borrower is authorized,\u201d and, contrary to the Attorney General, we do not think the language \u201cat the borrower\u2019s request\u201d and \u201cauthorized to postpone\u201d are \u201cparallel.\u201d <em>See </em>70 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. at 89. The phrases, in fact, are very different from each other, as one depends on the borrower taking the initiative to \u201crequest\u201d postponement, while the other puts the onus on the lender to \u201cauthorize\u201d it. <em>See </em>Section 12-404(c)(2)(iii)(stating \u201c[r]equired to be postponed one time, upon becoming due, at the borrower\u2019s request ... \u201d). As we have explained, \u201c[i]t is a common rule of statutory construction that, when a legislature uses different words, especially in the same section or in a part of the statute that deals with the same subject, it usually intends different things.\u201d <em>Toler v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>373 Md. 214, 223, 817 A.2d 229, 235 (2003).

A balloon payment occurs at the end of a fixed-rate loan term when the loan principal is not fully amortized by the regular monthly payments. In other words, it is the payment of the unpaid principal and/or interest due in its entirety at the end of a loan term. <em>See </em>HUD-Treasury Task Force on Predatory Lending, <em>Curbing Predatory Home Mortgage Lending, 96 </em>(June 2000) <em>&lt;http://www.huduser.org/publications/pdf/treasrpt.pdf&gt; </em>(hereinafter HUD Task Force). With respect to balloon payments, we have explained that, \u2018\u2018[c]alculations of a pay-out figure based on a time period different from that over which the payments are to run are not unusual in modern real estate financing. This method of repayment results from a desire to have lower monthly payment requirements and still have the mortgage debt paid in full at an earlier date than would otherwise result.\u201d <em>Paape v.

We further note that Section 12-404(c)(3) giving commercial borrowers a one-time postponement right was added to the statute after Section 12 \u2014 404(c)(2)(iii), the provision at issue. 1985 Md. Laws, Ch. 115. During the same session, the General Assembly passed House Bill 195, which amended Section 12 \u2014 404(c)(2)(iii) by reducing from 24 months to 6 months the amount of time residential borrowers could postpone the balloon provision payment. 1985 Md. Laws, Ch. 597. The bill file for House Bill 195 includes a Committee Report noting that Section 12-404(c)(2)(iii) requires lenders to expressly disclose the balloon payment; but, while it refers to the borrower's right to request a one-time six-month postponement option, like the legislative history for previous versions of Section 12-404(c)(2), it does not state that this option must be disclosed in writing to the borrower. <em>See </em>Committee Report on House Bill 195 at 1 (1985). We note, however, that the Committee Report also states, \"[B]alloon payment transactions must give the consumer the right to request a postponement of the balloon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>payment once for a period not to exceed six months.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.

The Court correctly identifies the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law, from which this dispute arises, as a consumer protection law. It was designed to curb predatory practices that had caused many people, often minorities and older people who were in debt and ignorant of the intricacies of the law, to lose their homes and become subject to crushing deficiency judgments for hugely inflated interest, costs, and fees. It is quintessential^ remedial in nature and must be liberally construed to achieve the Legislature\u2019s objective. Regrettably, the Court fails to give the statute that required reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The Court acknowledges the problem caused by balloon payments. It recognizes that many States prohibit them altogether, as Maryland once did, but that the General Assembly later chose to allow them in two limited circumstances, both of which were subject to certain express conditions. Section 12-404(e) of the Commercial Law Article begins with the mandate that \u201c[a] loan shall be amortized in equal or substantially equal monthly installments without a balloon payment at maturity.\u201d Three exceptions are stated to that mandate, two of which allow for a balloon payment. Section 12-404(c)(2) \u2014 the subsection at issue here \u2014 permits a lender who makes a loan for the purpose of aiding the borrower in the sale of the borrower\u2019s residence or the purchase of a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>residence to create a balloon payment at maturity of the loan, <em>but only</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">\u201cIf the balloon payment is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">(1) Expressly disclosed to the borrower;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">(2) Agreed to by both the borrower and the lender/seller in writing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">(3) Required to be postponed one time, upon becoming due, at the borrower\u2019s request, for a period not to exceed 6 months, provided that the borrower continues to make the monthly installments provided for in the original loan agreement, and no new closing costs, processing fees or similar fees are imposed on the borrower as a result of the extension.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Unless those three conditions \u2014 all of them \u2014 are satisfied, the balloon payment is not allowed; it is expressly prohibited. The simple fact \u2014 noted but then ignored by the Court \u2014 is that the loan agreement here does not require the balloon payment to be postponed one time at the borrower\u2019s request. Because the agreement does not contain that requirement, the balloon payment is illegal. It violates the general mandate that a loan be amortized in substantially equal monthly installments \u201cwithout a balloon payment at maturity.\u201d Indeed, the problem in this case goes beyond the mere absence of an affirmative right of the borrower to postpone payment. The agreement states affirmatively that there is no such right. How else can the statement, in capital letters, that \u201cTHE LENDER IN THIS TRANSACTION IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO REFINANCE THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THIS LOAN DUE ON MATURITY DATE,\u201d be read?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Instead of reading the statute as it should, to carry out the clearly expressed intent of the General Assembly, the Court adopts the obfuscation offered by the holder of the mortgage \u2014 that the requirement of a one-time postponement does not have to be disclosed to the borrower, that the borrower does not have to be informed in the agreement that he/she has this right. What, then, is the point of having the right if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>does not have to be disclosed in the agreement \u2014 if, indeed, it can, in capital letters, be negated in the agreement? How are borrowers with fewer resources or less luck than the Drews supposed to know that they have the right to a one-time postponement when the balloon payment comes due? The Court says that its role is to apply the statute in a \u201ccommonsensical\u201d manner. Why, then, does it not do so? It cannot possibly have been the legislative intent to impose this requirement as an express condition to allowing a balloon payment and yet permit the agreement not to contain the condition, much less to disavow the requirement, hoping, perhaps, that, in the end, the holder of the mortgage will gratuitously do the right thing. I would answer the certified question as I believe the Legislature intended it to be answered, in the affirmative. A negative answer, preferred by the Court, effectively repeals that provision of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge HARRELL have authorized me to state that they join in this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
