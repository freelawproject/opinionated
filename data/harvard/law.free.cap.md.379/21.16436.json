To put it in its simplest terms, this is a dispute between petitioner, on the one hand, and Choptank, on the other, over who has the authority to provide electrical service to the annexed area.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">On March 5, 2001, petitioner filed a petition with the Public Service Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d), respondent, for authority to provide electric service to the entirety of the annexed land. On May 25, 2001, the case was delegated by the Commission to the Hearing Examiner Division.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Hearing Examiner issued a Proposed Order dated January 18, 2002, which found that Choptank was legally authorized to continue to provide electric service to the portion of the annexed land within its service territory. On May 9, 2002, the Commission unanimously adopted the Hearing Examiner\u2019s Proposed Order. On May 28, 2002, petitioner filed in the Circuit Court for Talbot County a Petition for Judicial Review of the Commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Order. In a well-reasoned decision dated January 14, 2003, Judge William S. Horne of the Circuit Court affirmed the Commission\u2019s Order. On January 30, 2003, petitioner filed an appeal of the Circuit Court\u2019s decision with the Court of Special Appeals. On June 19, 2003, prior to consideration by the Court of Special Appeals, we issued a Writ of Certiorari. <em>Easton v. PSC, </em>376 Md. 49, 827 A.2d 112 (2003). Petitioner presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">\u201c1. Can a rural electric cooperative lawfully provide electric service to the residents of a new housing development located within the boundaries of a Maryland municipal corporation without the consent of the governing body of that municipality?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">\u201c2. Did the Public Service Commission of Maryland err in arbitrarily denying most of the residents of a new housing development in Easton of their right to receive electrical service from the utilities department of that municipality?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">In regard to petitioner\u2019s first question, we hold that Chop-tank does not need petitioner\u2019s consent to provide service in the disputed area, that petitioner has no right or authority on its own to expand electric service into the area currently serviced by Choptank, and that only through the procedure established in \u00a7 7-210(d) of the Public Utility Companies Article can the existing service boundaries between petitioner and Choptank be altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">In answering petitioner\u2019s second question, we hold that the Commission did not err in maintaining the historical territorial electrical service area that Choptank was granted by the Commission in a 1966 Order. There exists no fundamental personal right for Easton Club East (\u201cECE\u201d) residents to receive electrical service from petitioner or from any specific provider, nor are the ECE residents\u2019 Equal Protection rights violated by the Commission\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Talbot County.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">On March 5, 2001, pursuant to Md.Code (1998), \u00a7 7-210(d) of the Public Utility Companies Article,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> petitioner filed a petition seeking authority from the Commission to exclusively supply electricity to an area annexed by petitioner in 1993. The annexed area that is the subject of the petition is known generally as \u201cLyons Farm\u201d and consists of approximately 217.1 acres of land that is presently being developed into a subdivision, Easton Club East.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the time of the annexation in 1993, portions of the Lyons Farm were situated in the electric service territories of two electric companies: the Easton Utilities Commission (\u201cEaston\u201d), which is petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>municipal electric utility, and Choptank.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a 1966 Order (Order No. 56203 in Case No. 6017) (\u201c1966 Order\u201d), the Commission demarked the service territories of the various electric companies, including Choptank and petitioner. Of the more than 200 acres annexed by petitioner in 1993, only a small amount of the area, approximately 10%, was, pursuant to the 1966 Order, located within petitioner\u2019s electric service territory boundaries with the remainder, and majority, being located, and serviced, by Choptank.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In its 2001 petition to the Commission, petitioner asserted that granting Easton the exclusive right to supply electricity to all of the annexed area would serve the public interest in the following ways: 1) future ECE subscribers would pay the same rates as other residents of the Town; 2) Easton\u2019s rates for electric service are now and have been historically lower than Choptank rates; 3) ECE residents would receive a consolidated statement of all utility usage, including electricity, natural gas, water and sewerage services; 4) the Easton sendee center is located 2.5 miles from ECE, while the Choptank service center is located 18.5 miles away; 5) ECE residents would be spared the confusion of having neighbors who receive a different service; 6) Easton owns and maintains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>generators in Easton, while Choptank has only partial ownership in two generators in Virginia; and 7) Easton can extend its distribution system to ECE more economically than Chop-tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">As noted above, petitioner filed this petition with the Commission on March 5, 2001. On January 18, 2002, a Proposed Order of Hearing Examiner (\u201cProposed Order\u201d) was issued. In the Proposed Order, the Hearing Examiner analyzed the Commission\u2019s practices with respect to electric service area disputes. The Hearing Examiner found that before an electric service territory boundary established by the Commission in the 1966 Order could be modified, the Commission must first find that the modifications are \u201cin the \u2018public interest\u2019 which requires strong and clear evidence of the need, equity and practicality of the proposed changes.\u201d The Hearing Examiner found that petitioner did not provide adequate evidence that such a change would be in the public interest and, thus, by the Proposed Order, recommended denial of petitioner\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">On February 11, 2002, petitioner noted an \u201cappeal\u201d from the Proposed Order. At the Commission level, petitioner raised two issues: 1) whether Choptank lacks the legal authority to install and maintain electric facilities within petitioner\u2019s corporate limits; and 2) whether maintenance of the existing boundary between Easton and Choptank is contrary to the public interest. The Commission, after considering the arguments of the parties and the record evidence, adopted the Proposed Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Petitioner filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Talbot County on May 28, 2002. By a judgment dated January 14, 2003, Judge Horne, sitting for the Circuit Court for Talbot County, affirmed the Commission\u2019s Order. Thereafter, on January 30, 2003, petitioner noted its appeal of the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment to the Court of Special Appeals. On June 19, 2003, prior to consideration by the Court of Special Appeals, we issued a Writ of Certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Md.Code (1998), \u00a7 3-203 of the Public Utility Companies Article sets forth the limited \u201cscope of review\u201d by this Court over decisions by the Public Service Commission. It states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">\u201cEvery final decision, order, or regulation by the Commission shall be prima facie correct and shall be affirmed unless clearly shown to be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">(1) unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">(2) outside the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the Commission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">(3) made on unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">(4) arbitrary or capricious;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">(5) affected by other error of law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">(6) if the subject of review is an order entered in a contested proceeding after a hearing, the order is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">In addition, while this Court has made clear that a decision of the Commission is subject to judicial review, it will not be disturbed on the basis of a factual question except upon clear and satisfactory evidence that it was unlawful and unreasonable. <em>See Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>305 Md. 145, 161-62, 501 A.2d 1307, 1315 (1986); <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec.

Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Before we delve into the specifics of the case before us, it would perhaps be of some service to delineate the process by which electric service providers, such as Choptank, are granted the right to provide electric service to designated areas. In Maryland, a public service company cannot operate within the state absent 1) a franchise,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 2) the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>sion\u2019s authorization to operate or exercise that franchise. As this Court has stated, \u201ca franchise may be granted either directly by the Legislature or by a municipal corporation, provided the latter is clothed with the power, but it must emanate from the State.\u201d <em>Water Co. v. Baltimore County, </em>105 Md. 154, 162, 66 A. 34, 37 (1907). <em>See also Cambridge v. Eastern Shore Pub. Serv. Co., </em>192 Md. 333, 64 A.2d 151 (1949). The Commission itself, therefore, does not have the authority to grant such a franchise. <em>See Cambridge, </em>192 Md. at 339, 64 A.2d 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">While the Commission cannot grant a franchise to use the streets in Easton, its authority to designate the areas in which the service rights may be exercised gives it an important role in that process and further enables it to assure the efficient and non-duplicative provision of utility service in geographic areas where more than one electric utility claims a franchise.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Of special importance to the case before us, the Commission has the sole authority to authorize the areas in which a public utility may provide service and the power to transfer such rights following an annexation \u2014 provided it finds that such a transfer is in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code (1998), \u00a7\u00a7 5-201(a) &amp; 7-210(d) of the Public Utility Companies Article. It is with these principles in mind that we turn to petitioner\u2019s first question: whether Choptank can continue to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>provide electrical service, without petitioner\u2019s consent, to the 217.1 acres that have been annexed by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">As noted above, \u00a7 7 \u2014 210(d) of the Public Utility Companies Article specifically deals with the authority to supply electricity within an annexed area and, therefore, is directly on point in this case. The statute, as relevant here, states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">\u201c(d) <em>Authority to supply electricity within annexed </em>area.\u2014 If the boundaries of a municipal corporation are enlarged by annexation, the municipal corporation may acquire the exclusive right to supply electricity within the annexed area if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">(1) the municipal corporation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">(1) files a petition with the Commission seeking approval to acquire the exclusive right to supply electricity within the annexed area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">(ii) provides a copy of the petition to each electric company whose service territory or electric plant will be affected by the annexation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-10\">(iii) attaches to the petition a copy of the amendment to the municipal corporation charter that describes the area annexed and a description of the service territory, plant, equipment, and customers of each electric company that is likely to be affected by the annexation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-11\">(2) the Commission determines that modification of the service territory of an electric company and the transfer of a franchise or right under the franchise is in the public interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">On March 5, 2001, petitioner began the process under \u00a7 7-102(d) by filing its petition with the Commission. The Commission, however, after examining the findings of the Hearing Examiner, did not find that a transfer of electrical service rights from Choptank to petitioner was in the public interest, as is required by \u00a7 7 \u2014 102(d)(2). We cannot say that such a finding was erroneous under the limited standard of review provided by \u00a7 3-203 of the Public Utility Companies Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Of particular relevance to the case before this Court is the decision by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Mayor &amp; Council of Berlin v. Delmarva Power &amp; Light Co., </em>95 Md.App. 585, 622 A.2d 763, <em>cert. denied, </em>331 Md. 480, 628 A.2d 1067 (1993) <em>(\u201cDelmarva Power </em>\u201d). In that case, the Town of Berlin sought to supply electricity to an area of approximately 60 acres that it had annexed, and it filed a petition for an order modifying Delmarva Power\u2019s service area to the 60 acres as established in 1966 by the Public Service Commission. The petition was denied by the Commission, but the Town of Berlin decided to supply electricity to the area anyway, and Delmarva Power filed a complaint to confirm its exclusive right to provide service to the area. The intermediate appellate court held that Delmarva Power had a perpetual and exclusive state franchise<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to serve the area in question, and the 1966 Order authorized Delmarva Power to serve the area by exercising its franchise. Furthermore, the intermediate appellate court held that Delmarva Power did not need the town\u2019s consent to provide service to the area, and the town had no right or authority on its own to extend electrical service to that area. The Town of Berlin\u2019s utility entity had a limited right, <em>but its exercise was limited by the authority of the Commission.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Petitioner\u2019s contention, much like that of the Town of Berlin in <em>Delmarva Power, </em>appears to be that a legally operating utility\u2019s authority to provide electrical services to an area is automatically negated by an act of municipal annexation. This simply is not the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">\u201c[T]he general rule seems to be that if a company is granted a franchise in certain territory that is afterwards annexed to another municipality, the franchise does not extend beyond the old limits of the territory annexed. <em>However, the right conferred to exercise the franchise within the limits of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>territory annexed is not annulled thereby. If the annexed area is being served by a private utility, the utility owned by the annexing city has no right to invade such area. </em>In addition, upon expansion of city limits, the franchise of a utility serving the annexed city has been held not to supersede the franchise of the utility that had serviced the annexed area before it came within the city limits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">12 Eugene McQuillin, The Law of Municipal Corporations \u00a7 34.71 (3d ed.1995) (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted). <em>See, e.g., Delta Elec. Power Ass\u2019n v. Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co., </em>250 Miss. 482, 149 So.2d 504, <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 77, 84 S.Ct. 196, 11 L.Ed.2d 142 (1963); <em>Town of Culpeper v. Virginia Elec. and Power Co., </em>215 Va. 189, 207 S.E.2d 864 (1974) (both cases holding that municipal annexation cannot affect a rural electric association\u2019s right to serve current and future members within the utilities\u2019 certified areas).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">To adhere to petitioner\u2019s theory would be to completely ignore the statute enacted by the Maryland Legislature to cover the specific situation in the case at bar; \u00a7 7-210(d) of the Public Utility Companies Article. As appropriately noted by Judge Horne, if petitioner were correct, \u201cannexation would allow Petitioner and other municipalities to undo [the Commission\u2019s] service territory designations at will, circumventing ... \u00a7 7-210(d) and thwarting [the Commission\u2019s] stated policy for establishing stable electric service territories in the first place.\u201d In <em>Delmarva Power, </em>the Court of Special Appeals stated that when municipalities are granted limited franchises to provide electric service by the Legislature, \u201cthe exercise of that franchise, like the exercise of any public service company\u2019s franchise, is subject to the jurisdiction and authority of the PSC.\u201d <em>Delmarva Power, </em>95 Md.App. at 591, 622 A.2d at 766. We agree. Petitioner\u2019s power to provide electrical service to annexed areas is subject and subordinate to the Commission\u2019s power to designate the provider of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The language of \u00a7 7-210(d) makes it clear that the General Assembly intended that, before the existing service area of an electric company can be modified and before there can be a \u201ctransfer of a franchise or a right under the franchise\u201d due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>annexation, the Commission must determine that the transfer is in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d Petitioner cannot oust Choptank, operating under a lawful, pre-existing franchise and territorial designation, by way of an annexation unless the Commission determines that modification of the existing franchise is in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d This \u201cpublic interest\u201d analysis is based in part on the need, equity, and practicality of the proposed modification in respect to providers. Here, the Commission did not find that petitioner\u2019s desire to service the annexed area was in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">As stated earlier, we shall not overturn a factual decision by the Public Service Commission unless it proves to be unlawful or unreasonable. <em>See Office of People\u2019s Council v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>355 Md. 1, 14, 733 A.2d 996, 1003 (1999); <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>305 Md. 145, 161-62, 501 A.2d 1307, 1315 (1986); <em>Mayor and Council of Crisfield v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>183 Md. 179, 185-87, 36 A.2d 705, 708-09 (1944). Therefore, this Court\u2019s review is generally limited to whether a reasonable mind could have reached the same conclusion, <em>i.e., </em>that a change in electrical service territories was not in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d \u2014 the interests of the public generally and not just the interests of the ECE residents. In its acceptance of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding that Choptank should continue to provide service to the annexed area, the Commission adopted the Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings that Choptank demonstrated that it is capable of providing service to the entire Lyons Farm subdivision and therefore there is no need for petitioner to take over as provider. As petitioner has not shown by clear and satisfactory evidence that the Commission\u2019s decision was unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>or unlawful, we hold that the Commission did not err in its decision that a transfer of electrical service rights from Chop-tank to petitioner was not in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d as intended under \u00a7 7 \u2014 210(d)(2) of the Public Utility Companies Article. <em>See Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Delmarva Power &amp; Light Co., </em>42 Md.App. 492, 400 A.2d 1147, <em>cert. denied, </em>286 Md. 746 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">In regard to petitioner\u2019s argument that Choptank cannot continue service in the annexed area without petitioner\u2019s \u201cconsent,\u201d which petitioner may refuse to grant, we hold that petitioner is not in the position to dictate where Choptank can provide its service within the annexed land area; that is exclusively the domain of the Commission. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1998), \u00a7 5-201 of the Public Utility Companies Article. It was made clear in <em>Delmarva Power </em>that the electric service provider did \u201cnot need the Town\u2019s consent to provide service in the disputed area.... \u201d <em>Delmarva Power, </em>95 Md.App. at 590, 622 A.2d at 766. As such, whether or not petitioner \u201cconsents\u201d to Choptank providing electric services to the annexed area has no bearing on this Court\u2019s decision. It is <em>only </em>the determination, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cconsent\u201d of the Commission, by granting a modification of electric service territories through the process of \u00a7 7-210(d) of the Public Utility Companies Article, that has any weight in such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">In <em>Delmarva Power, </em>Berlin argued that it received rights via its annexation that, in effect, repealed the franchise or territorial designation granted to Delmarva Power by the State. Here, petitioner argues that its annexation, in effect, repeals the franchise previously granted to Choptank by Talbot County and the territorial designation by the Commission. As in <em>Delmarva Power, </em>in the present case Choptank does not need petitioner\u2019s permission to provide service and petitioner cannot unreasonably withhold consent for Choptank to utilize its public ways to provide that service.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">In the latter respect, petitioner argues that, under both the Electric Cooperative Act, Chapter 179 of the Laws of Maryland of 1976 (\u201cCo-op Act\u201d) and \u00a7 7-103 of the Public Utility Companies Article, its consent is required in order for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Choptank to install additional electric lines into the area that has been annexed. With respect to the Co-op Act, Section 4(j) authorizes electric cooperatives:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">\u201c[t]o construct, maintain and operate electric transmission and distribution lines along, upon, under and across publicly owned lands and public thoroughfares, including, without limitation, all roads, highways, streets, alleys, bridges and causeways, after first securing the proper assent of the municipal authorities of the city or town, or of the county commissioners or county council of the county in which such electric lines are proposed to be constructed, under such reasonable and proper regulations and conditions as may be prescribed in such assent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Similarly, \u00a7 7-103 states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">\u201c(a) <em>Manufacture, sell, and furnish light and power. </em>\u2014 An electric company incorporated in Maryland may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">(1) manufacture, sell, and furnish electric power in any municipal corporation or county of the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">(2) construct a power line to transmit power under, along, on, or over the roadways or public ways of any municipal corporation or county of the State; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\">(3) connect the power line from the place of supply to any other structure or object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-11\">(b) <em>Laying of power lines </em>\u2014 Consent <em>of local government required. </em>\u2014 (1) An electric company must have the consent of the governing body of the municipal corporation <em>or </em>county before laying or constructing any power line in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-12\">(2) The governing body of the municipal corporation or county may adopt reasonable regulations and conditions for the laying of a power line, including regulations requiring the electric company to refill and repave any roadway or public way under which the power line is laid.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">Petitioner contends that the language above makes the right of Choptank to continue to provide service to the annexed area contingent upon petitioner\u2019s assent. A closer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>inspection of the language reveals that this reading is erroneous. The territorial rights granted are determined as of the time of the original grant. In other words, the \u201cor\u201d refers to the governing entity in control of the service area at the relevant point in time, <em>i.e., </em>when the service rights are first granted by the Commission. The Co-op Act authorizes an electrical cooperative to operate in a given area once it has received the assent of the municipal authorities <em>or </em>the county authorities, whichever is in control at the relevant time, and to continue that service until, and if, that right is transferred by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 7-210(d) of the Public Utility Companies Article. Likewise, \u00a7 7-103(b) also uses similar \u201cmunicipal corporation or county\u201d language. In other words, absent a statute to the contrary, municipal corporations during annexations, in respect to the provision of electric services, annex subject to the existing franchises and territorial designations, unless the Commission finds that it is in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d to change the territorial designations.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Therefore, the obvious response to petitioner\u2019s argument is that Choptank has not sought a franchise from petitioner to construct, maintain, and operate electrical lines within the Lyons Farm area because it received a franchise from Talbot County to serve this area in 1940, and it has been doing so since that time. The position taken by petitioner would serve to revoke the rights previously granted by the governing entity, the county, that then had the power to grant such rights. In the case of <em>Town of Culpeper v. Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co., </em>215 Va. 189, 207 S.E.2d 864 (1974), the Supreme Court of Virginia, faced with facts similar to the ones before us,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\u201cAdmittedly, where a utility proposes to enter an incorporated town and intends to install its facilities therein, the utility must first obtain the consent of the municipality. However, we are not dealing here with a utility that seeks original entry into a town, but with franchised companies which have been serving the area involved for approximately twenty years prior to its being annexed by the town.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">\u201cWe think it clear that the intention of the framers of the constitutional provision in question [requiring consent] was to prohibit a utility from <em>entering </em>the town without prior consent. The intent was not to require the ouster of a utility and its facilities from an area where such facilities were already franchised and lawfully in existence and the utility was operating therein prior to such area becoming a part of a town.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-6\"><em>Culpeper, </em>215 Va. at 191-94, 207 S.E.2d at 866-68 (alteration added). We agree with the analysis of the Virginia Supreme Court in <em>Culpeper </em>concerning its own \u201cconsent\u201d provisions; the intention of neither the Co-op Act nor \u00a7 7-103 was to prevent a utility such as Choptank from continuing its service of an area annexed by a municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">While it may be true that Choptank will not be given free reign over the placement of new electrical lines within the annexed area, it is also true that petitioner may not unreasonably withhold its consent from Choptank, believing itself to be impervious to scrutiny under \u00a7 7-103(b). The very nature of the franchise that has been granted to Choptank confers upon it the right to use the public streets (whether in a municipality or otherwise) in the course of providing its electrical service. The municipality may, of course, impose reasonable conditions. It would be difficult to conceive of a utility company serving individual households without the right to make some use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>the public streets or other public property in order to transmit its product to its customers, whether this is accomplished by hanging wires from poles, laying cables in the ground, or running pipes along a road. To hold otherwise would allow for all municipalities to dictate who services an annexed area. It would permit petitioner to improperly usurp the functions of the Public Service Commission. That it cannot do. Under \u00a7 7-103(b)(2), however, petitioner, as we have said, \u201cmay adopt reasonable regulations and conditions for the laying of a power line,\u201d and these regulations, if reasonable, must be complied with by Choptank.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Petitioner next asks this Court to decide whether the Commission\u2019s decision in maintaining Choptank\u2019s service area in relation to the annexed land wrongfully deprived the residents of ECE of a right to receive their electrical service from petitioner. We hold that it does not. Petitioner claims that by not allowing all residents of ECE to have their electrical service provided to them by petitioner, the residents of ECE are being unfairly discriminated against in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 24 of Maryland\u2019s Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even if petitioner has standing to raise such a claim on behalf of private persons who are not parties to this proceeding, we do not find this claim to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The Commission is charged with ensuring that all of the residents in this State, including the residents of Easton, receive adequate and reliable electric service at just and reasonable rates. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1998), \u00a7 2-113 of the Public Utility Companies Article. No two electric utilities have the same rates or costs of service. Simply because the rates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>between Choptank and petitioner may vary by a negligible amount does not mean that the rates charged by Choptank are either unjust or unreasonable. It would be contrary to the law for this Court to hold that a resident in one service territory is being denied equal protection of the law merely because a resident in a different service territory, with a different cost of service, is paying a lower rate. The Commission determines what is in the best interest of the public as a whole, i.e., all residents of the State, not just those residents of ECE. The General Assembly has ensured, via the Commission, that each and every consumer in this State will have access to adequate, reliable electricity at a just and reasonable rate, without <em>unjust </em>discrimination. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1998), \u00a7\u00a7 2-113 &amp; 4-102 of the Public Utility Companies Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Petitioner continues its constitutional argument by arguing that \u201cno rational basis\u201d can support the Commission\u2019s decision to allocate utility service among ECE residents between Choptank and petitioner. Even if the issue is appropriate for us to address in the present context of this case, because we would not view the future residents of ECE as belonging to an inherently suspect class, the Commission\u2019s decision to maintain the <em>status quo </em>of the electric service territories in ECE would only need to pass, as petitioner correctly suggests, the \u201crational-basis\u201d test, <em>ie., </em>whether \u201cthe classification challenged be rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\u201d <em>City of New Orleans v. Dukes, </em>427 U.S. 297, 303, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 2517, 49 L.Ed.2d 511, 517 (1976). We must therefore look to the reasoning behind the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">In finding that the electric service territories established by the 1966 Order continued to serve the public interest, the Commission observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">\u201cIn this proceeding, [petitioner] has not shown that there is a need to displace Choptank as the electricity provider in the Lyons Farm subdivision because the record demonstrates that Choptank can and will provide reliable service. In terms of equity, [petitioner\u2019s] assertions are not sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>ported by the record. Finally, as a practical matter, Chop-tank is ready, willing, and able to serve the Lyons Farm subdivision, and in fact is doing so today.\u201d (2002 Public Service Commission Order at 21) (alterations added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">As did Judge Horne, we find that providing reliable electric service to the public is clearly a legitimate state interest and that the Commission\u2019s decision to maintain the pre-existing electrical service territories of petitioner and Choptank is rationally related to that interest. Stable electric service territories encourage electricity providers to invest in their infrastructure. Were the service territories unstable, the service providers would have little incentive to improve infrastructure they may lose in the future. Improvements in electrical infrastructure increase both the safety and the reliability of the electrical distribution system throughout Maryland. These purposes are not only unquestionably legitimate, they are the very core of the Commission\u2019s statutory duties. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1998), \u00a7 2-113 of the Public Utility Companies Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Lastly, despite petitioner\u2019s claims to the contrary, the right for residents of ECE to receive their electric service from petitioner, or any specific provider, is not a fundamental personal right. Tellingly, petitioner cites no relevant legal authority to support such a position. The fact that numerous Maryland municipalities are served by more than one electric service provider further weakens petitioner\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">We hold that petitioner\u2019s 1993 action of annexing an area in Talbot County, to which a majority of that area Choptank Electrical Cooperative, Inc. provides electrical service, does not automatically abrogate Choptank\u2019s franchise that was lawfully granted to Choptank by Talbot County in 1940 and territorially delineated by the Commission in a 1966 Order. Petitioner has no right to extend its electrical service area beyond that allocated to it by the Commission without the Commission\u2019s approval. We find no compelling reason to find that the Commission\u2019s decision regarding the territorial ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>vice areas of the annexed land was erroneous under our limited standard of review as stated by \u00a7 3-203 of the Public Utility Companies Article. Because the Commission did not find that a modification of the existing territorial service areas was in the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d as is required under \u00a7 7-210(d) of the Public Utility Companies Article, Choptank shall retain its present territorial service area within the 217.1 acres of annexed land.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">We also hold that the Commission\u2019s decision to maintain the historical territorial electrical service boundaries established in its 1966 Order does not violate ECE residents\u2019 Equal Protection rights, nor does there exist any fundamental personal right for ECE residents to receive electrical service exclusively from petitioner or from any specific provider for that matter. Choptank has lawfully been granted the right to-serve a majority of the annexed area, and this includes the right to provide electrical service to those ECE residents who reside within Choptank\u2019s service area boundaries. Choptank is their electrical service provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR TALBOT COUNTY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-10\">.
