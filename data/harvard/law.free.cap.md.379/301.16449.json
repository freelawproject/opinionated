Relevant to the present declaratory judgment action, the insured, a student employed as a part-time pizza delivery driver, was involved in a two car motor vehicle accident while on the job. His insurer, relying on a so-called \u201cpizza exclusion\u201d in the insurance policy contract, declined to indemnify or defend its insured regarding claims brought by the other driver. The \u201cpizza exclusion,\u201d which purports to allow the insurer to deny coverage if an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>insured driver was delivering \u201cproperty for compensation\u201d at the time of the accident, is not authorized expressly under the statute. Thus, we shall hold that the exclusion is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">On 9 April 2001, Michael Salamon was delivering pizzas for The Pizza Connection, an enterprise operated by GLW Enterprises (\u201cGLW\u201d). On that day, his vehicle collided with a vehicle owned and operated by Carol Dennis. Salamon, the owner of the vehicle he was operating, maintained no commercial vehicle insurance, but instead had a personal automobile policy issued by Progressive Classic Insurance Company (\u201cProgressive\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Salamon secured his insurance five months before the accident, before he began employment with The Pizza Connection. There is no indication in the record whether Salamon had contemplated seeking such employment either at the time he applied for the policy or when it was issued by Progressive. The policy contained a series of exclusions, including one referred to here as the \u201cpizza exclusion:\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">\u201cCoverage under this Part I [Liability to Others], including [Progressive\u2019s] duty to defend, does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u201c1. bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a vehicle while being used to carry persons or property for compensation or a fee, including, but not limited to, delivery of magazines, newspapers, food, or any other products. This exclusion does not apply to shared-expense car pools</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">\u201cCoverage under this Part IV [Damage to a Vehicle] does not apply for loss:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">1. to a covered vehicle, non-owned vehicle, or trailer, while being used to carry persons or property for compensation or a fee, including, but not limited to, delivery of magazines, newspapers, food, or any other products. This exclusion does not apply to shared-expense car pools ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">After Salamon informed his insurer of the occurrence and circumstances of the accident, Progressive filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County seeking a declaratory judgment that, based on the \u201cpizza exclusion,\u201d it was not liable under the policy to Salamon, Dennis, or the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO) (Dennis\u2019s insurer).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a separate, subsequent action, Dennis filed suit in the same court against Salamon, GLW, and Progressive for her injuries and property damage stemming from the accident. The Circuit Court granted a stay in Dennis\u2019s suit pending final resolution of this declaratory judgment action brought by Progressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Progressive filed a motion for summary judgment in its declaratory judgment action. Salamon opposed Progressive\u2019s motion and filed a counter-motion for summary judgment. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>memoranda and in oral argument at an 11 December 2002 hearing on the cross-motions, Progressive contended that the pizza exclusion in the policy unambiguously excused it from both coverage and the duty to defend. Salamon countered that the exclusion was void because it was inconsistent with Maryland\u2019s compulsory insurance statute. The trial court granted Progressive\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Salamon appealed, presenting only the question of whether Progressive\u2019s exclusion \u201ccontravenes Maryland public policy ... and, as a result, is invalid and unenforceable.\u201d Before the Court of Special Appeals could decide the appeal, this Court granted certiorari on its own initiative. <em>Salamon v. Progressive, </em>376 Md. 139, 829 A.2d 530 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Maryland Rule 2-501(e), governing summary judgment, states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">\u201cEntry of Judgment. The court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The facts relevant to the declaratory judgment action \u2014 that Salamon, Progressive\u2019s insured, was delivering pizzas, in violation of the \u201cpizza exclusion\u201d in the policy, when his car collided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>with Dennis\u2019s vehicle \u2014 are not in dispute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cWhen reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we must make the threshold determination as to whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists, and only where such dispute is absent will we proceed to review determinations of law.\u201d <em>Remsburg v. Montgomery, </em>376 Md. 568, 579, 831 A.2d 18, 24 (2003). \u201cAn appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo. </em>The trial court will not determine any disputed facts, but rather makes a ruling as a matter of law. The standard of appellate review, therefore, is whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The only issue presented in this case is a question of law involving statutory interpretation, which we review <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">During the 11 December 2002 hearing, the trial judge explained his reasoning for granting Progressive\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The majority of the judge\u2019s comments were directed toward his determination that Sala<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>mon\u2019s actions fell within the unambiguous language of the contractual \u201cpizza exclusion,\u201d a point that Salamon essentially conceded. Salamon\u2019s main contention before the trial court, as before this Court, was that the exclusion was invalid as contrary to Maryland public policy. The trial judge gave the following substantive response to Salamon\u2019s \u201cpublic policy\u201d argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\">\u201c[I]n this case Progressive Insurance provides insurance to Mr. Salamon with the understanding that he\u2019s not going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>to use his car for business purposes, to deliver pizzas. And I don\u2019t think that anyone who would read the policy would have any doubt about that, that we don\u2019t provide coverage if you do that. Well, that was the contract. That\u2019s the contract. I don\u2019t see anything against public policy for an insurer to contract with an insured under those conditions. Yeah, we will provide you coverage as long as you don\u2019t use your car for commercial purposes. I don\u2019t see how that can be against public policy, [it] doesn\u2019t seem to me to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">\u201cOne would have to wonder if an insurer can\u2019t make that a condition of a policy, a contract of insurance, what would all of our insurance rates be? If all of us could get a personal use policy and then use our cars to engage in business which involves the car, the use of the car, my God, what would the rates have to be? That may be a policy, a public policy consideration that would overcome any other, but I\u2019m not deciding that, but I am saying that this was a contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">\u201cIt was an unambiguous contract, it was clear, the contract was violated by Mr. Salamon. And Progressive does not have to provide coverage because it is not provided for in the contract that was entered into between the parties. So, the motion for summary judgment ... is granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The judge, however, failed to address the true gravamen of Salamon\u2019s argument: that Maryland\u2019s compulsory insurance law, codified at Maryland Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 17-101 to 17-110 of the Transportation Article and Maryland Code (1995, 2002 RepLVol.), \u00a7\u00a7 19-501 to 19-516 of the Insurance Article, renders void the exclusion that Progressive relied upon to deny Salamon coverage and defense. As we shall explain, Salamon was correct in arguing that Progressive may not deny him what he purchased, the statutory minimum levels of coverage, even though the accident occurred while he was employed as a pizza delivery driver. The trial judge\u2019s determination to the contrary was erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The 73rd Act of the 1972 session of the Maryland General Assembly was a \u201ccomprehensive law that, among other things, inaugurated compulsory insurance or other required security, established [the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund] as an insurer of last resort, prohibited the arbitrary cancellation and non-renewal of motor vehicle insurance policies, and required policies to contain collision and [personal injury protection] coverage.\u201d <em>Maryland Auto. Ins. Fund v. Perry, </em>356 Md. 668, 674, 741 A.2d 1114, 1117 (1999). Those provisions are now codified at title 19, subtitle 5 of the Insurance Article and title 17, subtitle 1 of the Transportation Article. The portions of that statute relevant to this case are those intended to \u201cmake certain that those who own and operate motor vehicles in this State are financially responsible. This legislative policy has the overall remedial purpose of protecting the public by assuring that operators and owners of motor vehicles are financially able to pay compensation for damages resulting from motor vehicle accidents.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 154, 416 A.2d 734, 736 (1980) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The General Assembly advanced its goal of assuring that every motorist has adequate insurance by enacting provisions requiring each vehicle owner to obtain motor vehicle insurance or a substitute security, limiting the ability of insurers to cancel or refuse to renew insurance policies, establishing the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (MAIF) as an insurer of last resort, and requiring the Motor Vehicle Administration to suspend the registration of any motor vehicle for which the required insurance or security lapsed until replaced. 1972 Md. Laws, Chap. 73. Maryland Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 17-103 of the Transportation Article now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">\u201cThe security required under this subtitle shall provide for at least:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">(1) The payment of claims for bodily injury or death arising from an accident of up to $ 20,000 for any one person and up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>to $ 40,000 for any two or more persons, in addition to interest and costs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\">(2) The payment of claims for property of others damaged or destroyed in an accident of up to $ 15,000, <em>in </em>addition to interest and costs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">(3) Unless waived, the benefits described under \u00a7 19-505 of the Insurance Article [personal injury protection coverage] as to basic required primary coverage; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">(4) The benefits required under \u00a7 19-509 of the Insurance Article [uninsured motorist coverage] as to required additional coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">More than thirty years after the General Assembly originally enacted compulsory insurance provisions, the requirement that every driver maintain at least these minimum levels of motor vehicle insurance remains an integral part of Maryland statutory law and public policy. Any portion of a motor vehicle insurance policy that is inconsistent with this statutory scheme is void and unenforceable. <em>Lewis v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>368 Md. 44, 47, 792 A.2d 272, 274, (2002). <em>See also Enterprise Leasing Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>341 Md. 541, 550, 671 A.2d 509, 514 (1996) (\u201cinsurance policy exclusion clauses that are inconsistent with the public policy of this State\u201d are invalid).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">\u201cIn light of the comprehensive nature of the statutory provisions regulating motor vehicle insurance, and the various limitations, conditions, exceptions and exclusions expressly authorized by the Legislature, this Court has consistently \u201cheld invalid insurance policy limitations, exclusions and exceptions to the statutorily required coverages which were not expressly authorized by the Legislature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-9\"><em>Lewis, </em>368 Md. at 48, 792 A.2d at 274 (quoting <em>Van Horn, </em>334 Md. at 686, 641 A.2d at 203).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">This Court consistently has declared invalid insurance policy exclusions that excuse or reduce the insured parties\u2019 coverage below the statutory minimum level where such exclusions are not authorized explicitly by the General Assembly. Examples of this are legion. A policy provision that reduced the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>of uninsured motorist benefits by the amount of money the insurer previously had paid to the insured under a medical payments endorsement in the policy was not authorized by statute and was, therefore, invalid. <em>Lewis, </em>368 Md. 44, 792 A.2d 272. Where no statute authorized a reduction in coverage for payments from other insurers, an automobile insurance provider was required to pay personal injury protection coverage even though the insured\u2019s treatments already had been paid for by his health insurance provider. <em>Dutta v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>363 Md. 540, 769 A.2d 948 (2001). The exclusion of vehicles \u201cOwned or operated by a self-insurer\u201d or \u201cOwned by any governmental unit or agency\u201d from the definition of \u201cuninsured/underinsured vehicles\u201d for the purposes of the state\u2019s compulsory uninsured/underinsured coverage requirement was unauthorized and void. <em>West Am. Ins. Co. v. Popa, </em>352 Md. 455, 723 A.2d 1 (1998). In <em>Enterprise Leasing, </em>341 Md. 541, 671 A.2d 509, a car rental company had not authorized its lessee to allow third party drivers to drive the rental car without the company\u2019s authorization. Nevertheless, the car rental company was liable as a self-insurer for an accident caused by a third-party driver, who was driving the vehicle with the lessee\u2019s permission, but without the car rental company\u2019s permission, because the General Assembly had not authorized an exclusion of this type.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Similarly, a moving company\u2019s insurer was liable to provide coverage for the injuries of one of the moving company\u2019s employees who was injured by a truck driven by another employee because the \u201cfellow employee\u201d exclusion in the policy was not authorized by statute. <em>Larimore v. American Ins. Co., </em>314 Md. 617, 552 A.2d 889 (1989). Although the General Assembly had authorized insurers to reduce their benefits by the amount of worker\u2019s compensation payments the insured party already had recovered, an exclusion that reduced the insured party\u2019s benefits by the amount of worker\u2019s compensation the insured party was entitled to receive <em>in the future </em>was unauthorized and void. <em>Gable v. Colonial Ins. Co., </em>313 Md. 701, 548 A.2d 135 (1988). The \u201chousehold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>exclusion,\u201d preventing one family member\u2019s recovery for injuries sustained in an accident with another member of the same household, was held to be unauthorized and invalid. <em>Jennings v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>302 Md. 352, 488 A.2d 166 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Where an insurer had notice of a suit between its insured and the uninsured driver of the other vehicle involved in an accident, it could not rely on a \u201cconsent to sue\u201d clause in its policy to refrain from paying the judgment against the uninsured driver because \u201cconsent to sue\u201d clauses were not authorized by the General Assembly. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Webb, </em>291 Md. 721, 436 A.2d 465 (1981). A personal injury protection exclusion that denied coverage when an accident occurred while the insured was riding a \u201cmotor vehicle owned by the named insured ... which is not an insured motor vehicle\u201d has been held invalid. <em>Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 416 A.2d 734. An insurer was not authorized to require the insured party to secure a judgment against a tortfeasor before recovering uninsured motorist benefits. <em>Reese v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>285 Md. 548, 403 A.2d 1229 (1979). An insurer was not entitled to limit uninsured motorist coverage to situations in which there was actual contact between the insured vehicle and a phantom vehicle. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Maryland Auto. Ins. Fund, </em>277 Md. 602, 356 A.2d 560 (1976); <em>see also Lee v. Wheeler, </em>310 Md. 233, 528 A.2d 912 (1987) (actual contact requirement was invalid even though the accident occurred outside the State of Maryland).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Where the General Assembly authorized exclusions or exemptions, we upheld contractual terms that excused or reduced an insurer\u2019s coverage below the statutory minimums. In <em>Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund v. Sun Cab Co., </em>305 Md. 807, 506 A.2d 641 (1986), we concluded that the General Assembly had exempted taxicabs from certain of the compulsory insurance provisions, and therefore they were not required to carry (or be covered by) uninsured motorist insurance. In <em>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company v. Miller, </em>305 Md. 614, 505 A.2d 1338 (1986), an insurer was not required to pay uninsured motorist benefits to a passenger in a vehicle driven by the husband of the vehicle\u2019s owner because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>husband/driver, who had his own insurance with another carrier, was excluded under that vehicle\u2019s coverage as authorized by statute. In <em>DeJarnette v. Federal Kemper Insurance Company, </em>299 Md. 708, 475 A.2d 454 (1984), we upheld an exclusion for injuries sustained while using a motorcycle, an exclusion authorized specifically by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Progressive argues that, for analytical purposes, we implicitly have distinguished between insurance policy exclusions \u201cpertaining to <em>classes </em>of insureds, as opposed to exclusions pertaining to <em>acts </em>of individual insureds,\u201d upholding exclusions based on actions, but invalidating those that leave entire classes of people uninsured. Although Progressive finds some support in a footnote in <em>Jennings, </em>this argument is not supported by the bulk of our eases relating to insurance exclusions or compulsory insurance requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In <em>Jennings, </em>we distinguished a prior case with the following footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">\u201cGEICO also argued that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>National Grange Mut. Ins. v. Pinkney, </em>284 Md. 694, 399 A.2d 877 (1979), in which this [C]ourt declined to adopt the so-called \u201cliberal\u201d rule in interpreting omnibus clauses, stands for the proposition that adoption of mandatory liability insurance does not alter prior Maryland case law regarding liability insurance. This is an overbroad interpretation of <em>Pinkney. </em>The instant case deals with a policy exclusion that would exclude classes of people. For example, family members of the named insured\u2019s household as well as the named insured are precluded from recovery. The person qua person is precluded from recovery. <em>Pinkney, </em>on the other hand, dealt with an exclusion based upon an action taken by a person \u2014 in that case, acquiring permission, or failing to do so, to drive the vehicle. In <em>Pinkney, </em>this Court stated \u201cthat the public policy of this State as enunciated by the General Assembly is that there should be liability coverage ... for any one person. . . .\u201d 284 Md. at 704, 399 A.2d [at 882].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-9\"><em>Jennings, </em>302 Md. at 360 n. 9, 488 A.2d at 170 n. 9. In no other case, however, has this Court made such a distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>between actions and classes, nor has any exclusion that excused or reduced benefits below the statutory minimums, and that was not authorized by the General Assembly, been deemed valid on this basis. To the extent that the <em>Jennings </em>footnote makes our analysis of arguments challenging automobile insurance exclusions unclear, we clarify today that we shall not uphold any exclusion, not authorized by the General Assembly, that excuses or reduces benefits below the statutory m\u00ednimums. There is no meaningful class/action distinction to be made in this analysis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\"><em>Pinkney, </em>the case distinguished in the footnote in <em>Jennings, </em>is best understood as a case interpreting an omnibus clause in an insurance contract, rather than one focusing on an exclusion. An omnibus clause in an automobile insurance policy extends coverage to a third party who operates the vehicle with the permission of the named insured. <em>See Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Lowe, </em>135 Md.App. 122, 138 n. 10, 761 A.2d 997, 1006 n. 10 (2000). This Court has treated omnibus clauses differently with regard to the requirements of the compulsory insurance law, such as personal injury protection and uninsured motorist coverage, because the dominant purpose of an omnibus clause is \u201can intent to extend coverage.\u201d DeJ<em>arnette, </em>299 Md. at 714, 475 A.2d at 457. In <em>Pinkney, </em>we declined to follow the \u201cliberal rule\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of omnibus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>clause interpretation, which would have invalidated all \u201cscope of permission\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> clauses. Instead, we held that such clauses could be valid and, when they are, they should be interpreted in the same manner as any other term in an insurance contract. <em>Pinkney, </em>284 Md. at 706, 399 A.2d at 883. <em>See also BGE Home Products &amp; Services, Inc. v. Owens, </em>377 Md. 236, 833 A.2d 8 (2003) (declining to read a \u201cscope of permission clause\u201d into a self-insurance guarantee where it did not appear, but implying that \u201cscope of permission clauses\u201d are still valid where express).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">With that background in mind, we turn to the exclusion Salamon challenges. Progressive argues that it is entitled to deny Salamon coverage because, at the time of his accident, he was delivering food for compensation in violation of the terms of the insurance contract. Because Progressive seeks to deny all coverage to Salamon, rendering him uninsured for the accident, the exclusion reduces coverage below the statutory minimum levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The \u201cpizza exclusion\u201d has not been authorized by the General Assembly. Progressive has not pointed to any Maryland statute that either expressly or implicitly gives insurers the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>authority to add such an exclusion to their insurance contracts, and thereby to reduce or eliminate benefits below the statutory minimum levels. Upon review of title 17 of the Transportation Article and title 19 of the Insurance Article of the Maryland Code, we too are unable to find any such provision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, Progressive\u2019s commercial use exclusion in Salamon\u2019s policy is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED.

The insurance contract in question provided for only the minimum statutory limits of bodily injuiy/property damage coverage \u2014 $20,000/ $40,000. Thus, this case does not present the additional question of whether, if the relevant exclusion is invalid, the insurer\u2019s potential liability is the full amount of the purchased coverage limits or merely the statutory minimum requirements for coverage. <em>See West Am.

The trial court judge also ruled that a discovery motion, filed by Salamon prior to the filing of Progressive\u2019s motion for summary judgment, was rendered moot by his decision to grant Progressive's motion for summary judgment. Salamon asks that this Court, as an alternative to ordering the grant of his counter-motion for summary judgment, remand the case to the Circuit Court with instructions to rule on the discovery motion. Because we conclude that the trial court should have granted Salamon's counter-motion for summary judgment, the discovery motion remains moot.

We have admonished trial courts that, when a declaratory judgment action is brought and the controversy is appropriate for resolution by declaratory judgment, the court must enter a declaratory judgment and that judgment, defining the rights and obligations of the parties or the status of the thing in controversy, must be in writing. It is not permissible for the court to issue an oral declaration. The text of the judgment must be in writing. <em>See Harford Mutual Ins. Co. v. Woodfin, </em>344 Md. 399, 414-15, 687 A.2d 652, 659 (1997); <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 87, 660 A.2d 447, 455 (1995); <em>Christ v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>335 Md. 427, 435, 644 A.2d 34, 38 (1994). Nor, since the 1997 amendment to Maryland Rule 2-601(a), is it permissible for the declaratory judgment to be part of a memorandum. That rule requires that \u2018each judgment shall be set forth on a separate document.' When entering a declaratory judgment, the court must, in a separate document, state in writing its declaration of the rights of the parties, along with any other order that is intended to be part of the judgment. Although the judgment may recite that it is based on the reasons set forth in an accompanying memorandum, the terms of the declaratory judgment itself must be set forth separately. Incorporating by reference an earlier oral ruling is not sufficient, as no one would be able to discern the actual declaration of rights from the document posing as the judgment. This is not just a matter of complying with a hyper-technical rule. The requirement that the court enter its declaration in writing is for the purpose of giving the parties and the public fair notice of what the court has determined.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-v\"><em>Jackson, </em>369 Md. at 594-95, 801 A.2d at 1045-46 (quoting <em>Allstate v.
