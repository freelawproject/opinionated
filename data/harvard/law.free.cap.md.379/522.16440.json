Laney was convicted in the Circuit Court for Howard County of unlawful possession of a destructive device and unlawful possession of an explosive without a license. We now review the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of Laney\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized during several warrantless searches of Laney\u2019s former residence, 3612 Fels Lane in Ellicott City, Maryland. Laney asserts that, although he did not hold title to 3612 Fels Lane, he had an expectation of privacy in the property, and the entry upon the premises violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. We hold that Laney had no reasonable expectation of privacy in 3612 Fels Lane because ownership of the property had passed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (hereinafter the \u201cDVA\u201d), which, accordingly, had authority to enter, possess, and give consent for the authorities to search the property. Therefore, no Fourth Amendment violation occurred in this case, and the Circuit Court was correct in denying Laney\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"Ana\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Some time prior to December of 1998, Laney purchased improved real property located at 3612 Fels Lane in Ellicott City, Maryland. To finance the purchase, Laney acquired a loan, which was secured by 3612 Fels Lane and guaranteed by the DVA. Under the DVA loan guarantee, if the lender foreclosed on the loan, it could convey title to the property to the DVA. Laney failed to make payments according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>loan agreement, and, on December 13, 1999, the loan was foreclosed. On December 27, Commercial Federal Mortgage Corporation, the purchaser of 3612 Fels Lane at the foreclosure sale, initiated the process of conveying the property to the DVA by providing it with a \u201cnotice of intention to convey.\u201d Commercial Federal subsequently conveyed title to 3612 Fels Lane to the DVA on March 17, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The DVA assigned Brad Criddle the responsibility to \u201cmanage\u201d the property, meaning that he would \u201cattend to or look after\u201d the foreclosed property. As part of the management responsibilities, if Criddle were to find a property occupied, he would attempt to contact the person occupying the house to discuss the DVA\u2019s eventual possession of the property. Criddle made his first visit to 3612 Fels Lane in December of 1999 and knocked on the door of the house. When he received no response, he left his business card, which provided his name and phone number, identified Criddle as the property manager, and stated that the property was owned by the DVA. During this and subsequent visits, which Criddle made at least once a month, the house appeared to be occupied because personal property could be seen through the windows and objects around the outside of the house would appear to have been moved between visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Criddle, however, could not establish contact with anyone at the house until 11:00 a.m. on July 14, 2000, when he stopped by 3612 Fels Lane to encourage whomever was in the home to abandon the property. As he walked toward the front door, he encountered two men, one of whom was Joseph Winkle, who lived across the street. Winkle explained to Criddle that he was there to \u201crescue\u201d some geese on the property for Laney, the former occupant of the house, who had been his neighbor for fifteen years and was currently in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Winkle explained further that, although he had obtained a key to the house from Laney\u2019s brother, he was afraid to enter the house because he believed there were \u201cexplosives and weapons\u201d kept there.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Because one of Criddle\u2019s responsibilities as a property manager was to \u201cmake every effort to get in the house,\u201d he asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Winkle to let him inside the house to look around. Winkle agreed and opened the door. Inside the house, Criddle observed, in one room, a couple of olive green objects shaped like \u201ctwo liter bottle[s]\u201d and marked with \u201cU.S. Army\u201d in black writing and, in another room, \u201cfive or six grenades\u201d in a trash can. When he went upstairs, he found \u201cseveral guns, gun barrels, ... camouflage^]____kni[v]es, ... [and] numerous shell casings.... \u201d Criddle went to the outside shed where he observed \u201csomething that looked like a small rocket ... [and] other empty cartridge containers [and] shell casings ... everywhere.\u201d Other than the weapons and ammunition, Criddle saw that the bathtub had been removed and that some of the home appliances were sitting on the front porch. This gave Criddle the impression that \u201csomebody was dismantling the house[,] ... selling it off piece by piece.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Criddle left the house, called the DVA for instructions on how to proceed, and was told to grant access to the property to local authorities. He called the Howard County Police Department. About an hour and a half after his initial visit to 3612 Fels Lane on July 14, Criddle returned to the property and met Frank McCreary of the DVA and Officer Keith Berry of the Howard County Police Department. Criddle identified himself to Officer Berry and described what he had seen in the house. Criddle then led Officer Berry into the unlocked house, where they looked around for five minutes. Other police officers, including Officer Keith Fisher and the State Fire Marshall arrived at the house and obtained written consent from the DVA to inspect the property. Thereafter, at the request of those officials, personnel of the fire department, Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\u201cATF\u201d), Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d), and the U.S. Army\u2019s Explosive Ordnance Disposal Company (\u201cEOD\u201d) arrived at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The police and Army officials thoroughly searched the house, spending several hours taking objects from the house and laying them on a tarp outside on the lawn. The following items, as listed on the EOD Incident Report, were seized and later disposed of by the authorities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>26 M228 Fuze, Grenade; 1 M201A1 Fuze, Grenade; 2 Grenade body, practice; 1 Grenade fuze, model unknown; 9 M117 Boobytrap simulators; 2 Commercial blasting caps; 3 20mm projectile, practice; 1 60mm mortar, illumination; 1 M51 projectile fuze; 1 60mm mortar, practice with residue; 2 M18 smoke grenade; 1 M7A3 smoke grenade, riot; 2 40mm illumination projectiles; 1 British Mill Bomb (grenade); 1 M158 Red star cluster signal; 1 M604 Fuze, mine practice; 1 Boobytrap flare on stake; 3 PML 62 Friction fuze; 1 Vial of black powder; 1 KDM 51A2(20); 1 2.36 inch Rocket; 7 flare pens, with ignitors; 1 20-foot piece of commercial detonating cord; 1 40mm projectile, practice; 10 15mm projectiles, German; 18 Blast simulator; 1 6000psi pressure bottle; 1 81m projectile, practice; 4 pounds of smokeless powder; 1 model rocket motor; 1 DM 28 subcaliber projectile (UEB-T); 1 SWAT Distraction Device (flash-bang); 9 fuzes, German; 1 M48 subcaliber projectile; 6 M73 35mm subcaliber rockets, practice (for LAW).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Criddle had the locks of the house changed to a DVA master key lock after all of the law enforcement and military personnel left the house at around 10:00 p.m. on July 14. Three days later, on July 17, 2000, Criddle unlocked 3612 Fels Lane and allowed police officers and agents of the State Fire Marshall to search the house with a K-9 unit. As a result of that search, other items were seized. On July 21, 2000, Criddle again unlocked the house, this time to permit Army officials to look for a radio. He then hired a contractor to clean the property, making it possible for the DVA to market and eventually sell the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The State charged Laney in the Circuit Court for Howard County with nine counts of possession of a destructive device in violation of Maryland Code, Article 27, Section 139C (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> one count of reckless endanger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ment in violation of Maryland Code, Article 27, Section 12A-2 (1957, 1996 Repl.VoL, 2000 Supp.),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and one count of possession of explosives without a license in violation of Maryland Code, Article 38A, Sections 27A and 34C (1957, 1997 Repl. VoL).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Laney moved to suppress the evidence obtained from 3612 Fels Lane on the ground that it was seized in violation of Laney\u2019s Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures. The court denied Laney\u2019s motion to suppress, concluding that the searches of 3612 Fels Lane and the seizures of property during those searches were lawful. Assuming that Criddle was a state agent for the purpose of its decision, the court reasoned that Criddle was a legal representative of the DVA, which had acquired title to 3612 Fels Lane and, thus, was the lawful owner of the property on the day of the initial search. The court determined that, as the agent of the lawful owner of the property, Criddle did not need to seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>action by the court to enter the house legally. As an alternative basis for its ruling, the court concluded that Criddle \u201chad the right to rely upon the consent\u201d of Winkle, who \u201carguably was entitled to ... enter the premises.\u201d Finally, the court found Criddle\u2019s entry was justified because of the \u201cexigency\u201d created when he learned that \u201cmunitions\u201d and \u201cexplosives\u201d were in the house and that Winkle may have been selling house \u201cfixtures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The judge then conducted a bench trial on an agreed statement of facts and found Laney guilty of unlawfully possessing an explosive device without a license and one count of unlawfully possessing a destructive device. The State later <em>nolle prossed </em>all remaining counts. The court sentenced Laney to ten years\u2019 imprisonment for the possession of a destructive device and five years\u2019 imprisonment for the possession of an explosive device. The court suspended the sentences except for time served and ordered probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Laney appealed, challenging the denial of his motion to suppress, and the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling. The intermediate appellate court determined that Laney\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights had not been violated on any of the occasions when 3612 Fels Lane was searched. The court concluded that, assuming Criddle was acting on behalf of the state, his first entry on July 14 was supported by probable cause and justified by exigent circumstances. Probable cause existed, in the court\u2019s view, because a person of reasonable caution would have believed contraband might be inside the house based on information learned from Winkle that explosives and weapons were inside the house and that he was afraid to go inside. According to the court, this same information, described as \u201ccredible evidence that the house was filled with explosive materials of unknown age and stability,\u201d validated Criddle\u2019s initial July 14 search also because \u201cillegal explosives, or dangerous chemicals in a home has been repeatedly held to constitute exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless search.\u201d The court then held that the discovery of the weapons and munitions in the house escalated the exigency, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>justifying the subsequent searches by law enforcement authorities on July 14. With respect to the July 17 search, the court determined that it was \u201ca continuation of lawful initial entry,\u201d \u201cconfined to \u2018the scope of the original invasion,\u2019 and therefore did \u2018not require a warrant.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">We granted Laney\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, <em>Laney v. State, </em>376 Md. 139, 829 A.2d 530 (2003), to determine whether the seizure of the items in the house located at 3612 Fels Lane constituted infringements of Laney\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We hold that, because Criddle, the agent of the title owner of the premises, had authority to possess and enter the house, Laney had no reasonable expectation of privacy in it. Therefore, Laney\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were not violated when the authorities seized the evidence from the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">When reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we ordinarily consider only the evidence before the court at the suppression hearing. <em>State v. Green, </em>375 Md. 595, 607, 826 A.2d 486, 493 (2003); <em>State v. Rucker, </em>374 Md. 199, 207, 821 A.2d 439, 444 (2003). We view the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn from that evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion. <em>Green, </em>375 Md. at 607, 826 A.2d at 493; <em>Dashiell v. State, 374 </em>Md. 85, 93, 821 A.2d 372, 376-77 (2003). Although we extend great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>deference to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, we review, independently, the application of the law to those facts to determine if the evidence at issue was obtained in violation of the law and, accordingly, should be suppressed. <em>Green, </em>375 Md. at 607, 826 A.2d at 493; <em>Wallace v. State, </em>373 Md. 69, 78, 816 A.2d 883, 888-89 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Laney avows that the multiple warrantless searches of 3612 Fels Lane as well as the seizures of the items on those premises impinged upon his Fourth Amendment rights. He claims that the Fourth Amendment is applicable because he maintained a legitimate expectation of privacy in the property even though title had passed to the DVA. He argues further that the searches and seizures were not supported by probable cause or any of the exceptions to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement, such as exigent circumstances or consent. Proper consent did not exist, Laney contends, because the DVA\u2019s ownership interest in 3612 Fels Lane \u201cwas inferior to [his] possessory and privacy interests.\u201d Although conceding that the DVA had a property interest in the premises, Laney claims that Criddle, as DVA\u2019s agent, did not have authority to consent to search 3612 Fels Lane because Laney was a \u201ctenant of the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The State responds that the searches were supported by probable cause, exigent circumstances, and consent. It asserts that the DVA could enter the property as owner of 3612 Fels Lane and take possession, as it did. Moreover, under the State\u2019s view of consent, the DVA\u2019s sole possession of the house entitled its agent, Criddle, to search the premises and provide consent for other government officials to do so as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">A. Property Interests</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Answering the issues in this case requires some discussion of the principles of Maryland property law, particularly those governing the conveyance of foreclosed property. Under Maryland law, as the following discussion demonstrates, Laney lost and the DVA acquired the right to possess the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>3612 Fels Lane before Criddle entered the premises and discovered the contraband therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The Real Property Article of the Maryland Code and the Maryland Rules strictly govern foreclosure procedures. Generally, in the event that a purchaser of real property secured by a mortgage or deed of trust (\u201cmortgagor\u201d) defaults under the terms of the mortgage or deed of trust, the holder of the security interest (\u201cmortgagee\u201d or \u201ctrustee\u201d) may initiate foreclosure proceedings. Maryland Code, \u00a7 7-105 of the Real Property Article (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.) (governing the summary procedure for a power of sale in deed of trust); Maryland Rule 14-203 (setting forth the conditions precedent to commencing an action to foreclose a mortgage)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; <em>see Fairfax Savings, F.S.B. v. Kris Jen Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>338 Md. 1, 15, 655 A.2d 1265, 1271-72 (1995) (discussing briefly the procedures for foreclosure pursuant to a power of sale clause in a deed of trust). Those proceedings lead to the eventual sale and conveyance of the property, which allows the mortgagee to attempt to recover the money owed on the mortgage debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Before the foreclosure sale may take place, however, the provisions of the Real Property Article and Maryland Rules require that the mortgagee fulfill certain notice requirements. Code, \u00a7 7-105 of the Real Property Article<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>land Rule 14 \u2014 206(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under Section 7-105 of the Real Prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>erty Article, written notice of the proposed foreclosure sale must be sent by certified mail and first-class mail to the record owner of the property, who in many cases is the mortgagor. Maryland Rule 14-206 provides that the person authorized to conduct the foreclosure sale \u201cshall publish notice\u201d of the proposed sale in a newspaper of general circulation and further send notice by certified and first-class mail to the mortgage debtor, record owner, and the \u201cholder of any subordinate interest in the property.\u201d Maryland Rule 14 \u2014 303(b) provides that, where a third party trustee is appointed by the court to conduct the foreclosure sale, the trustee shall give notice by advertising \u201cthe time, place, and terms of sale in a newspaper of general circulation....\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Once proper notice has been provided, the one authorized to conduct the foreclosure sale may sell the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Complete title does not immediately pass to the purchaser upon the sale of the property. The mortgagee first must submit to the court a report of the sale and an affidavit affirming the fairness of the sale and the truth of the report. Md. Rule 14-305(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The purchaser also must file an affidavit setting forth, in part, that the purchaser has not discouraged anyone from bidding for the property. Md. Rule 14-305(b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thereafter, the court shall issue notice of the sale by publishing a description of the property and a statement that the sale will be ratified by the court unless exceptions are taken within 30 days. Md. Rule 14-305(c).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">If no exceptions are filed within that period and the court is satisfied the sale was fair, the court shall ratify the sale. Md. Rule 14-305(e).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is the court\u2019s ratification of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>sale that allows title of the property to pass to the purchaser. <em>See Plaza Corp. v. Alban Tractor Co., </em>219 Md. 570, 151 A.2d 170 (1959); <em>Fisher v. Federal Nat\u2019l Mtg. Ass\u2019n., </em>360 F.Supp. 207 (D.Md.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Foreclosure, sale, and ratification operate to cut off the mortgagor\u2019s right of redemption \u2014 the right to repay the mortgage debt \u2014 and terminates the mortgagor\u2019s interest in the property. Section 7-105 of the Real Property Article states that the sale of foreclosed property and subsequent conveyance of the property to the purchaser \u201coperates to pass all the title which the borrower had in the property at the time of the recording of the mortgage or deed of trust.\u201d <em>See Lippert v. Jung, </em>366 Md. 221, 235, 783 A.2d 206, 214 (2001) (recognizing that if an owner of foreclosed property \u201cfails to redeem, the purchaser acquires absolute title to the property\u201d) (quoting <em>LaValley v. Rock Point, </em>104 Md.App. 123, 127, 655 A.2d 60, 62 (1995)); <em>Moss v. Annapolis Savings Inst., </em>177 Md. 135, 144, 8 A.2d 881, 884-85 (1939) (\u201cThe mortgagee [who purchased property at a foreclosure sale] ... acquired the same title to the property that any other purchaser would have taken, and had the same power to rent, sell, or mortgage it that the mortgagor had when the mortgage was recorded.\u201d); <em>Sullens v. Finney, </em>123 Md. 653, 657, 91 A. 700, 701-02 (1914); <em>Duval v. Becker, </em>81 Md. 537, 548-49, 32 A. 308, 310 (1895).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">As this Court has held as early as 1869 in <em>Lannay\u2019s Lessee v. Wilson, </em>30 Md. 536 (1869), foreclosure, sale, and ratification also cause the mortgagor to lose the right of possession in the property. In <em>Lannay\u2019s, </em>the Court of Chancery issued a decree for the sale of mortgaged property and appointed a trustee to conduct the sale. <em>Id. </em>at 548. The mortgagee purchased property at the foreclosure sale, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>the Chancellor later ratified, and the mortgagor then turned possession of the premises over to the purchaser. <em>Id. </em>Arguing that the sale was defective because the trustee allegedly failed to deliver the property deed to the purchaser, the mortgagor\u2019s successor in interest filed an ejectment action. <em>Id. </em>at 545-46. The Court rejected the mortgagor\u2019s claim, favoring, instead, the view that ratification of the foreclosure sale divests the mortgagor of the right of possession, a requisite for prevailing on an action for ejectment. <em>Id. </em>at 550. Explaining the effect of the foreclosure sale, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">[T]hough the decree [for the sale of mortgaged property] does not operate as a conveyance of the legal title, the purchaser, holding possession under it, does not hold wrongfully or unlawfully; and, consequently, all right of possession of those bound by the decree, and the proceedings under it, other than the purchaser, is divested and taken away, and, of course, with it the right to maintain ejectment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The Court in <em>Lannay\u2019s </em>explained further that, after ratification of the sale, the right of possession to the foreclosed property lies solely with the purchaser:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">A purchaser under a decree in equity, becomes the substantial owner of the property from the moment of final ratification of the sale, and he is entitled to and can recover the rents and profits of the estate. He is not only entitled to possession of the property, but it remains at his risk, notwithstanding the legal title may not be conveyed. By such sale the dry legal title, and the right of possession often become completely severed, at least for a time, \u2014 the legal title remaining in some of the parties to the cause, while the equitable estate and right of possession become vested in the purchaser.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-9\"><em>Id.; see also Merryman v. Bremmer, </em>250 Md. 1, 8, 241 A.2d 558, 563 (1968) (stating that the purchaser of property at a foreclosure sale is entitled to possession of the property after the court ratifies the sale). After ratification of a foreclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>sale, therefore, the right to possess the sold property lies with the purchaser, not the former mortgagor.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">When a mortgagor loses the right to possess foreclosed property but fails to vacate the premises, the purchaser of that property, in lieu of actually taking possession, may seek a court order to remove the holdover mortgagor. <em>Zeller v. Silverman, </em>143 Md. 339, 343, 122 A. 255, 256 (1923); <em>Applegarth v. Russell, </em>25 Md. 317, 319-20 (1866). We embraced this concept in <em>Applegarth:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">The practice is settled in this State, that when a purchaser at a [foreclosure] sale under a [judicial] decree has fully complied with the terms of sale, and possession of the premises purchased is withheld by a party to the suit, ... the purchaser may obtain an order under which possession will be delivered to him by proper process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">25 Md. at 319-20. Also in recognition of the purchaser\u2019s right of possession, Maryland Rule 14-102(a) provides the right to use judicial process to acquire actual possession of an occupied premises. The Rule states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">Whenever the purchaser of an interest in real property at a sale conducted pursuant to these Rules is entitled to possession, and the person in actual possession fails or refuses to deliver possession, the purchaser may file a motion requesting the court to enter a judgment awarding possession of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">When the landowner receives such a judgment awarding possession, upon the landowner\u2019s request, the \u201cclerk [of the court] shall issue a writ directing the sheriff to place [the landowner] in possession of the property.\u201d Maryland Rule 3-647.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although this judicial process may be used to oust a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>mortgagor who no longer is entitled to possession, the use of the term \u201cmay\u201d in Rule 14-102(a) and in <em>Applegarth </em>reflects the fact that the ouster process is not mandatory to obtain possession of the purchased property. In other words, seeking the court\u2019s assistance in dispossessing the holdover mortgagor is only one option available to the purchaser to obtain possession from a holdover mortgagor. Failure to exercise that option does not undermine the mortgagee\u2019s ownership of the property nor the right to possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Rather, a purchaser with the right to possess property may take possession of that property peacefully without the court\u2019s assistance. This right was incorporated into Maryland law through the adoption of Article 5 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which establishes that \u201cthe Inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the Common Law of England ... and to the benefit of such of the English statutes as existed on the Fourth day of July, seventeen hundred and seventy-six. . . .\u201d In <em>Moxley v.

The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the State through the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees the people\u2019s right \u201cto be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>See Mapp v.

The Fourth Amendment guarantees do not apply, however, unless the individual maintained \u201ca legitimate expectation of privacy\u201d in the houses, papers, and effects searched or seized. <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 143, 99 S.Ct. 421, 430, 58 L.Ed.2d 387, 401 (1978); <em>Wallace, </em>373 Md. at 79, 816 A.2d at 889; <em>Simpson v.

Ruckman, </em>806 F.2d 1471, 1472-74 (10 Cir.1986); <em>Amezquita v. Hernandez-Colon, </em>518 F.2d 8, 11-12 (1st Cir.1975); <em>see Zimmerman v. Bishop Estate, </em>25 F.3d 784, 787-88 (9th Cir.1994). <em>Ruckman </em>involved a search of a natural cave located on land owned by the United States and controlled by the Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d). 806 F.2d at 1471-72. The cave had been inhabited by Ruckman, a trespasser, for eight months when authorities discovered and seized illegal \u201canti-personnel booby traps\u201d during a warrantless search of the cave. <em>Id. </em>at 1472. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that Ruckman\u2019s expectation of privacy was not reasonable under the circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9T\">Ruckman was admittedly a trespasser on federal lands and subject to immediate ejectment. With respect to its own lands, the government has the rights of the ordinary proprietor, i.e., to maintain its possession and to prosecute trespassers. While he had been living off the land for several months, the cave could hardly be considered a permanent residence. Counsel himself describes Ruckman as \u201cjust camping out there for an extended period of time.\u201d Ruck-man\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy is not reasonable in light of the fact that he could be ousted by BLM authorities from the place he was occupying at any time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1472-73 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">In <em>Amezquita, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that squatters did not have a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>expectation of privacy in the structures they had constructed on government-owned land. 518 F.2d at 11. Explaining its reasoning, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">Nothing in the record suggests that the squatters\u2019 entry upon the land was sanctioned in any way by the Commonwealth. The plaintiffs knew they had no colorable claim to occupy the land; in fact, they had been asked twice by Commonwealth officials to depart voluntarily. That fact alone makes ludicrous any claim that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 11. The court also found it persuasive that, in an eviction action prior to the alleged illegal search, a local court had ordered the squatters to evacuate the land and remove their structures. <em>Id. </em>The outcome of the eviction action, the court stated, \u201cis further proof that the plaintiffs could not have any reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In <em>Zimmerman, </em>police officers searched a piece of property, which several individuals (squatters) improved and occupied against the expressed will of the owner, Bishop Estate. 25 F.3d at 786. Bishop Estate had made its objection to the squatters known by sending a letter and making several visits warning the squatters of their status as trespassers prior to the search. <em>Id. </em>at 786-87. After the search, Zimmerman, a house guest of the squatters, filed a civil rights claim, arguing that his Fourth Amendment rights had been violated by the search. <em>Id. </em>at 787. The court stated that Zimmerman had no greater right to be on the property than the squatters, and the squatters\u2019 \u201cimprovement of the property does not give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy when they had no legal right to occupy the land.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 787-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Unlike the privacy rights of squatters or trespassers, the tenant of a leased premises may maintain an expectation of privacy in the leased premises after the termination of the tenancy. <em>Stoner v. California, </em>376 U.S. 483, 490, 84 S.Ct. 889, 893, 11 L.Ed.2d 856, 861 (1964), <em>reh. den. </em>377 U.S. 940, 84 S.Ct. 1330, 12 L.Ed.2d 303 (1964); <em>Chapman v.

This is so, even if the tenant falls behind in his or her obligation to pay rent. <em>Browning v. State, </em>176 Ga.App. 420, 336 S.E.2d 41, 43 (1985) (stating that non-payment of rent \u201cis not conclusive\u201d in determining whether the tenant relinquished her expectation of privacy in her apartment); <em>United States v. Botelho, </em>360 F.Supp. 620, 625 (D.Haw.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Nevertheless, where a lease agreement has expired, a tenant\u2019s expectation of privacy in that property also may diminish depending on the circumstances of the tenancy. Several courts have held that the hotel guest\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy expires completely when the rental contract lapses. <em>United States v. Rahme, </em>813 F.2d 31, 34 (2d Cir.1987) (\u201c[W]hen a hotel guest\u2019s rental period has expired or been lawfully terminated, the guest does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the hotel room.\u201d); <em>United States v. Akin, </em>562 F.2d 459 (7th Cir.1977); <em>United States v. Parizo, </em>514 F.2d 52 (2d. Cir.1975); <em>United States v. Croft, </em>429 F.2d 884, 887 (10th Cir.1970); <em>State v. Roff, </em>70 Wash.2d 606, 424 P.2d 643 (1967); <em>see also United States v. Allen, </em>106 F.3d 695, 697, 699 (6th Cir.1997) (holding that a hotel guest lost a legitimate expectation of privacy when the motel management lawfully \u201ctook possession of the motel room\u201d); <em>United States v. Larson, </em>760 F.2d 852, 855 (8th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 849, 106 S.Ct. 143, 88 L.Ed.2d 119 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Other courts have maintained that the hotel guest\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy may survive the expiration of the room agreement if the hotel has a practice of allowing guests to overstay the check-out time without consequence. <em>United States v. Kitchens, </em>114 F.3d 29, 32 (4th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Owens, </em>782 F.2d 146, 150 (10th Cir.1986). If it is clear to the guest, however, that he or she must vacate the room after the rental period, the expectation of privacy in the room expires. In <em>Kitchens, </em>the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the warrantless entry of a motel room after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>the defendant guest had overstayed the rental period. 114 F.3d at 32. The court recognized that a hotel guest may retain a legitimate expectation of privacy after the rental period \u201cif there is a pattern or practice which would make that expectation reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because there was no evidence that the motel had \u201ca pattern or practice\u201d of allowing patrons to stay past check-out time but instead required them to check-out, the court held that the defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">According to at least one court, where a rental agreement for a hotel room has expired, the hotel guest loses a reasonable expectation of privacy only as to the hotel owner, who may consent to the search of the room after the rental period without risk of Fourth Amendment violations. <em>Carter v. State, </em>72 P.3d 1256, 1260 (Alaska App.2003). In <em>Carter, </em>the defendant was the only one of four guests who remained in a hotel room \u201cslightly past\u201d the one o\u2019clock check out time. <em>Id. </em>at 1258. Without authorization from the hotel management, the police ordered the defendant to gather his belonging and vacate the room. <em>Id. </em>While the defendant was following the officers\u2019 orders, he opened a drawer and exposed evidence that the police seized. <em>Id. </em>The court held that a hotel-room search by police without consent from the hotel proprietor violated the defendant\u2019s legitimate expectation of privacy even after the rental period passed. <em>Id. </em>at 1261. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANM\">Carter\u2019s expectation of privacy in the hotel room did not come to an abrupt end [at the check-out deadline]. In particular, Carter continued to have a right of privacy <em>vis-avis </em>the police. If the police had any authority to remain in Carter\u2019s room and order him to vacate the room, that authority had to be derived from the express consent of the hotel management.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\"><em>Id.; see also Allen, </em>106 F.3d at 699 (holding that, after the motel management lawfully took possession of the defendant\u2019s room, \u201c[t]he [motel] manager\u2019s consent to the officers\u2019 search of the room was all that was required to avoid constitutional infirmity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>As the previous discussion illustrates, courts consider a number of factors in determining the reasonableness of one\u2019s expectation of privacy in property occupied without permission of the owner. Some of these factors include the following: whether the individual had an ownership or possessory interest in the property, <em>Zimmerman, </em>25 F.3d at 787-88; <em>Ruckman, </em>806 F.2d at 1472-74; <em>Amezquita, </em>518 F.2d at 11-12; whether the occupier of the property owned by another has been informed that he or she must vacate, <em>Kitchens, </em>114 F.3d at 30, 31-32; <em>Zimmerman, </em>25 F.3d at 787-88; <em>Ruckman, </em>806 F.2d at 1472-74; <em>Amezquita, </em>518 F.2d at 11-12; and the nature or outcome of any judicial remedies available to the land owner, <em>Amezquita, </em>518 F.2d at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Laney asks this Court to consider the issues within the context of a legitimately held-over tenant. We believe, however, that Laney\u2019s interest in 3612 Fels Lane is more akin to that of a trespasser and, therefore, any expectation of privacy that Laney had in 3612 Fels Lane was unreasonable. First, Laney at one time had owned 3612 Fels Lane, but he lost title to the premises as a result of the foreclosure of the mortgage and subsequent conveyance of title to the DVA. Indeed, Laney concedes that the DVA possessed the deed to the property at the time of the government searches in question. Therefore, he no longer had any right to occupy the premises. Further, as required by the Maryland foreclosure laws, Laney also had been notified that the foreclosure sale would take place and that 3612 Fels Lane had been purchased. It is clear that, after the sale, Laney no longer was entitled to occupy 3612 Fels Lane and that the new title owner could take possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">With respect to the final element, the DVA had become the owner of the property and had the right to enter the premises by complying with all of the procedures required under Maryland foreclosure law. Once the DVA had the right to possess 3612 Fels Lane, Maryland law did not require the DVA to pursue some additional judicial remedy to evict Laney from the premises. Criddle, as the DVA\u2019s agent, acted consistently with the landowner\u2019s right to enter the premises with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>out court assistance by peaceably obtaining access to the house and entering without force.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">For these reasons, we hold that Laney had no reasonable expectation of privacy in 3612 Fels Lane. Consequently, the Fourth Amendment does not apply to the entry of the home on that property and the seizure of the evidence that formed the basis for Laney\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Circuit Court correctly denied Laney\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\">.

Another remedy available to a mortgagee seeking to gain possession of property from a holdover mortgagor is through a cause of action of forcible detainer. After the enactment of the peaceable self-help provision under 5 Richard 2d, Chapter 8, England enacted two statutes providing for the cause of action of forcible detainer, a judicial remedy originally available only to an owner against a wrongful possessor who uses force to maintain possession. <em>See </em>15 Richard 2, Chapter 2 (1391); 8 Henry 6, Chapter 9 (1429); <em>see Moxley v. Acker, </em>294 Md. 47, 50-51, 447 A.2d 857, 859 (1982); <em>Greenbelt Consumer Servs., Inc. v. Acme Markets, Inc., </em>272 Md. 222, 227-28, 322 A.2d 521, 524 (1974); <em>Clark v. Vannort, </em>78 Md. 216, 219-20, 27 A. 982, 983 (1893). This cause of action, applicable to mortgagees seeking to oust holdover mortgagors, has been modified by \u00a7 8-402(b) of the Real Property Article (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.) to \u201cinclude a remedy by which a landlord may recover possession of leased premises from a tenant 'Holding over\u2019 without force and by delineating the procedure for bringing any one of them.\u201d <em>Greenbelt Consumer Servs., </em>272 Md. at 227-28, 322 A.2d at 524. In <em>Moxley, </em>this Court further modified the \"forcible detainer\u201d action by deleting the requirement of force so that one can bring the cause of action to regain possession of property wrongfully detained in any way. 294 Md. at 53, 447 A.2d at 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Laney contends that, to obtain possession of 3612 Fels Lane, the DVA should have complied with the statutory procedures set forth by \u00a7 8-402(b) of the Real Property Article, the provisions governing ejectment of a holdover tenant. He relies on <em>Eubanks v. First Mount Vernon Industrial Loan Assoc., Inc., </em>125 Md.App. 642, 660, 726 A.2d 837, 846 (1999), in which the Court of Special Appeals held that the provisions of \u00a7 8-402(b) applied to mortgagees and mortgagors as well as landlords and tenants. The mortgagee in <em>Eubanks </em>brought actions of forcible detainer and for ejectment seeking to oust the mortgagor who refused to vacate the property after foreclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 648, 726 A.2d at 840. After the mortgagor elected a jury trial and the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, that court, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 8-402 and 8-818 of the Real Property Article, ordered the mortgagor to make monthly escrow payments for the use and occupancy of the property during the litigation. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the mortgagor argued that \u00a7 8-402 did not apply because that section only governed actions between landlords and tenants, not actions between mortgagees and mortgagors. <em>Id. </em>at 659, 726 A.2d at 846. The Court of Special Appeals rejected this argument, stating that \"forcible entry and detainer actions are properly brought pursuant to RP \u00a7 8-402(b), and therefore are actions subject to the rent escrow provisions of RP \u00a7 8-118.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660, 726 A.2d at 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\"><em>Eubanks </em>does not control and is distinguishable from the present case. The intermediate appellate court in <em>Eubanks </em>held only that \u00a7 8-402 applies when a mortgagee brings an action of forcible detainer. The court did not mandate that a mortgagee <em>must </em>pursue remedies under \u00a7 8-402 in order to oust a holdover. Indeed, the <em>Eubanks </em>court discussed 5 Richard 2, Chapter 8, the English statute providing for peaceable self-help, and acknowledged that it had not been repealed. <em>Id. </em>at 662-63, 726 A.2d at 847.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\">.
