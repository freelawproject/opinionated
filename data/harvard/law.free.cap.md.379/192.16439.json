The Circuit Court held that the State Board acted within its statutory authority conferred by the General Assembly. Before argument in the Court of Special Appeals, the Union filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari. We granted the petition and shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Governance of the Maryland public school system is two-tiered. The Maryland State Board of Education is the head of the State Department of Education, a principal department of the State government. Maryland Code (1978, 1999 RepIVol.), \u00a7\u00a7 2-101 and 2-102 of the Education Article. Twenty-three county boards of education and the New Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners (the \u201cNew Board\u201d) operate as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>statutory heads of the twenty-four local public school systems.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State Board is charged with the general supervision of the Maryland public schools, including the development and implementation of educational policies. \u00a7 2-205 of the Education Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The State Board is authorized to adopt rules and regulations for the administration and enforcement of the education law. \u00a7 2-205(c). In 1993, the Board promulgated regulations establishing public school performance standards that were adopted and codified in the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 13A.01.04.01-.08. Regulation .01 establishes the scope of the regulations and regulation .02 is the definition section. The student performance areas tracked by the State are set forth in regulation .03. Regulation .04 establishes the standards that apply to the student performance areas. Regulation .05 sets out the reporting requirements, and the mandate that each public school develop a school improvement plan is set forth in regulation .06.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The regulations further set forth a two-phased process for public schools that fail to meet the prescribed student performance standards. Regulations .07 and .08 describe \u201clocal reconstitution\u201d where, if a school fails to meet all standards at a level of satisfactory or better in the student performance areas, the State Board may require the overall program and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>management of a school to be placed under the direct control of the local school board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By February 2000, the State Board had ordered 97 schools throughout Maryland to be placed under local reconstitution. Of these, 83 schools were in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">If a school under local reconstitution fails to show sufficient improvement, regulation .10 provides for \u201cstate reconstitution\u201d by which the State Board determines the overall program and management of the school. In 1999, the State Board reconstituted three of the lowest performing public elementary schools in Baltimore City, Furman L. Templeton, Montebello, and Gilmor. Student performance remained stagnant at these elementary schools despite being under local reconstitution for at least three years. No more than 10% of the students at the schools had met the State\u2019s standard in all student performance areas in any year since 1993 when the school performance regulations were adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The State Board examined the feasibility of closing one or more of the underperforming elementary schools. The Board determined that any closure would result in increased transportation costs and the transfer of students to other low performing public schools already under local reconstitution. The Board concluded that the most viable option was to contract out the operation and management of the three schools to a third party.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following a request for proposals in accordance with the State procurement procedure, the State Board and the New Board entered into a \u201cContract for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Operation and Management of Schools Under State Reconstitution in Baltimore City\u201d with Edison Schools, Inc., for a term of five years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The contract with Edison was approved by the Maryland Board of Public Works on March 22, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Edison is a private company specializing in the management of public schools. It operates under contracts with local school districts and boards of charter schools. Pursuant to its contract with the State Board, Edison is required to provide the three public elementary schools with curriculum and curriculum development, instructional services, instructional and support personnel, teaching tools, special education and related services, educational services with limited or no English proficiency, and other services which may be necessary. Edison serves as the employer of all employees hired for the elementary schools and is responsible for providing management and professional development for all personnel working in the three schools. Edison has the power to hire, assign, discipline, and dismiss all personnel hired at the schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The Baltimore Teachers Union initiated the present action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against the State Board and the New Board. The gist of the Union\u2019s action was set forth in the beginning of its complaint as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">\u201c1. This is an action for declaratory judgment, injunctive and equitable relief. The facts and claims in this action are solely a matter of statutory law and turn on the authority of the Maryland State Board of Education (\u2018MSBE\u2019) and the New Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners (\u2018Local Board\u2019) as granted by the State legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">\u201c2. Plaintiff shall request that the Court find that MSBE acted <em>ultra vires </em>in its promulgation of C.O.M.A.R. 13A.01.04.08. and 13A.01.04.02(B)(8)(b).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The State Board and the New Board filed motions to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing. Alternatively, the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Board moved for summary judgment, maintaining that the Board acted within the scope of its statutory authority by promulgating the challenged regulations and contracting with a private vendor for the operation of the three elementary schools. The Union filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. Edison filed a motion to intervene which was unopposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Following a hearing, the Circuit Court issued an order declaring that the Union had standing, that the challenged regulations were within the State Board\u2019s statutory authority, and that the two Boards were statutorily authorized to enter into the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The Union filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and the State Board filed a cross-appeal on the standing issue. Prior to argument in the intermediate appellate court, the Union filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted. <em>Baltimore Teachers v. State Board of Education, </em>362 Md. 359, 765 A.2d 142 (2001). The petition presented the single question of whether the challenged regulations and contract were authorized by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">As a threshold matter, we must first consider whether the Baltimore Teachers Union had standing to challenge the reconstitution regulations and the Edison contract. The respondent State Board filed a motion to dismiss the Union\u2019s complaint for declaratory judgment on the ground that the Union lacked standing to bring the instant matter, and the Board\u2019s cross-appeal challenges that portion of the declaratory judgment upholding the Union\u2019s standing. <em>See Joseph H. Munson Co. v. Secretary of State, </em>294 Md. 160, 168, 448 A.2d 935, 939 (1982), <em>affirmed, </em>467 U.S. 947, 104 S.Ct. 2839, 81 L.Ed.2d 786 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The Board argues that for an organization like the Union to have standing \u201cto bring a judicial action, it must ordinarily have a \u2018property interest of its own ... separate and distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>from that of its individual members.\u2019 \u201d <em>Medical Waste Associates, Inc. v. Maryland Waste Coalition, Inc., </em>327 Md. 596, 612, 612 A.2d 241, 249 (1992), quoting <em>Citizens Planning and Housing Association v. County Executive, </em>273 Md. 333, 345, 329 A.2d 681, 687 (1974). The Board further argues that the Union has not \u201c \u2018suffered some kind of special damage from such wrong differing in character and kind from that suffered by the general public.\u2019 \u201d <em>Medical Waste, </em>327 Md. at 613, 612 A.2d at 249, quoting <em>Rogers v. Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, </em>253 Md. 687, 691, 253 A.2d 713, 715 (1969). We disagree. The Union\u2019s interests are sufficient to satisfy standing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">The Union is an unincorporated association and the exclusive collective bargaining agent for the employees of the Baltimore City Public School System. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 6-401 and 6-407 of the Education Article. As the designated collective bargaining agent, the Union is charged with statutory rights and fiduciary duties to negotiate for, and to act in the best interests of, the public school employees. \u00a7 6-510(b). The Union has a legal relationship with the New Board by way of the protection and benefits embodied in the negotiated labor agreement on behalf of Baltimore City public school employees. The function of the labor agreement is to set wages and establish minimum labor standards for the bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The reconstitution regulations and the Edison contract disturb those established standards and interject a competing labor pool with the bargaining unit. Additionally, the labor agreement does not apply to Edison; thus, the Edison contract reduces the size and scope of the Union\u2019s bargaining unit. The contract removes the Union from three schools, thus making its bargaining unit that much smaller. While no employee may be compelled to be a \u201cmember\u201d of the Union, every Baltimore City Public School employee is a member of the Union\u2019s bargaining unit. The Union is empowered and, indeed, obligated by statute to represent all employees of the bargaining unit whether members of the Union or not. If more positions are included in the bargaining unit, the Union may have greater power to negotiate more advantageous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>agreements and to carry out more effectively its fiduciary duties. The Union\u2019s status as the representative of public employees is diminished by the Edison contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Accordingly, we hold that the Union has demonstrated that, as the designated collective bargaining representative of Baltimore City Public School employees, it has standing to maintain the present judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Turning to the merits of the case, Baltimore Teachers Union argues that COMAR 13A.01.01.02B(8) and 13A.01.04.08 exceed the statutory authority of the Maryland State Board of Education, and that the State Board\u2019s contractual delegation of the operation and management of the reconstituted schools illegally grants powers to Edison which are vested exclusively in the New Board. While the State Board exercises general supervisory authority, the Union argues that the State Board lacks statutory authority to take over the basic functions of the local boards. The Union contends that there exists \u201cno statute which directly and without equivocation authorizes the State Board\u201d to turn over a public school to a third party and place it under the sole control of a private business.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">We need not and shall not decide whether the State Board was statutorily authorized to adopt the reconstitution regulations in 1993. Even if the State Board lacked the statutory authority to promulgate the reconstitution regulations in 1993, subsequent enactments by the General Assembly remove any doubt as to the statutory authorization for the State Board\u2019s actions. The General Assembly has passed legislation which confirms and ratifies the State Board\u2019s power to issue the reconstitution regulations and to enter into third party contracts pursuant to those regulations. The legislation makes clear that the General Assembly knew of and approved of the State Board\u2019s exercise of its statutory authority to contract with Edison for the operation and management of the three public elementary schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The principle of legislative ratification is well-established in the law. In the situation where a governmental entity takes action which may or may not be statutorily authorized, but where the appropriate legislative body later ratifies that action, the ratification clearly validates the action prospectively and, in the absence of constitutional limitations, may validate the action retroactively. As Justice Harlan stated for the Supreme Court long ago, \u201cit is not perceived why subsequent legislative ratification is not, in the absence of constitutional restrictions upon such legislation, equivalent to original authority.\u201d <em>Grenada County v. Brown, </em>112 U.S. 261, 271, 5 S.Ct. 125, 130, 28 L.Ed. 704, 708 (1884). This Court has also recognized \u201cthat whatever a legislative body \u2018may authorize in prospect, it may adopt and validate in retrospect, so long as there is no interference with vested rights,\u2019 \u201d <em>Washington Nat\u2019l Arena v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>287 Md. 38, 45, 410 A.2d 1060, 1064, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 834, 101 S.Ct. 106, 66 L.Ed.2d 40 (1980) (emphasis deleted), quoting <em>County Council v. Carl M. Freeman </em>Assoc., 281 Md. 70, 79, 376 A.2d 860, 865 (1977). <em>See also, e.g., Bolles v. Town of Brimfield, </em>120 U.S. 759, 762, 7 S.Ct. 736, 737, 30 L.Ed. 786, 788 (1887) (\u201cthe legislature, by subsequent ratification, [can] make that legal which was originally without legal sanction\u201d); <em>Anderson v. Township of Santa Anna, </em>116 U.S. 356, 364, 6 S.Ct. 413, 417, 29 L.Ed. 633, 636 (1886) (\u201c \u2018Unless ... there be a constitutional inhibition, a legislature has power, when it interferes with no vested right, to enact retrospective statutes ... to ratify and confirm any act it might lawfully have authorized in the first instance,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>United States Mortgage Co. v. Gross, </em>93 Ill. 483, 494 (1879)); <em>Dryfoos v. Hostetler, </em>268 Md. 396, 404, 302 A.2d 28, 32-33 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">In 1997, the General Assembly directed the New Board to take actions necessary to \u201c[i]mprove the status of schools that are subject to a State reconstitution notice.\u201d \u00a7 4 \u2014 309(d)(15) of the Education Article. In 1999 the General Assembly passed legislation regarding stipends for classroom teachers and, in doing so, distinguished between a local school board as an employer and a private employer of a teacher in a reconstitut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ed school.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 6-306(b)(4) mandates that a classroom teacher holding an advanced professional certificate, who teaches in a public school identified by the State Board \u201cas a reconstitution school, a reconstitution-eligible school, or a challenge school, shall receive a stipend from the State in the amount of $2,000 for each year that the teacher performs satisfactorily in the classroom.\u201d This language is in contrast to subsection (b)(2) that authorizes a stipend from the State for a classroom teacher \u201cwho is employed by a [local] board and who holds a certificate issued by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The General Assembly enacted legislation in 2000 protecting the pension rights of teachers previously employed by the local boards, working for a third party contractor operating a school under the reconstitution regulations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>provisions specifically reference \u201can employee of the New Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners or another county board of education\u201d who is \u201chired by a third-party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>contractor to work in a school that is reconstituted by order of the Maryland State Board of Education.\u201d \u00a7 22-216(a). The statute authorizes public school employees, whether vested or not in the retirement system, who are hired by a private contractor operating a school under state reconstitution, to withdraw their accumulated retirement or pension benefits without penalty, to receive service credit for the time employed with the private contractor, and to purchase up to five years of service credit at the employee rate for the period of employment with a third party contractor in a reconstituted school.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The 1997, 1999 and 2000 legislation demonstrates the General Assembly\u2019s awareness and approval that the State Board would be entering into contracts with private vendors in accordance with the reconstitution regulations. The statutory language directly references schools \u201csubject to a State reconstitution notice\u201d in addition to those schools \u201cidentified by the State Board as a reconstitution school, reconstitution-eligible school, or a challenge school.\u201d The language distinguishes between teachers \u201cemployed by a [local] board\u201d and those who teach \u201cin a public school identified by the State Board as a reconstitution school\u201d for purposes of stipends and bonuses. The legislation affirmatively makes provisions to protect the pension rights of school teachers employed by third party contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Given the language incorporating the reconstitution regulations and protecting the retirement benefits of those working in reconstituted schools, it is clear that the General Assembly recognized that the employer of a teacher in a public school under State reconstitution may be a private employer, and, thus, it is reasonable to infer legislative ratification of the regulations. As the Circuit Court correctly observed, \u201cthe General Assembly has considered and ... countenanced and condoned the [Board\u2019s] authority to enter into a third party contract.\u201d The General Assembly has clearly ratified the reconstitution regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">The Union in its brief before this Court, for the first time in this case, argues that the challenged regulations and the Edison contract violate Article VIII, \u00a7 1, of the Maryland Constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Union, in making such constitutional argument, chiefly relies upon <em>St. Mary\u2019s Industrial School for Boys v. Brown, </em>45 Md. 310 (1876).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">As earlier mentioned, the Union in its Circuit Court complaint emphasized that the \u201cclaims in this action are solely a matter of statutory law.\u201d In its complaint, cross-motion for summary judgment, and memoranda filed in the Circuit Court, the Union never raised a constitutional issue. The Circuit Court\u2019s memorandum and its declaratory judgment made no mention of a constitutional issue, as the Union had raised no such issue. The Union\u2019s certiorari petition did not present a constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Maryland Rule 8-131(a) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">\u201cRule 8-131. Scope of review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">(a) Generally. The issues of jurisdiction of the trial court over the subject matter and, unless waived under Rule 2-322, over a person may be raised in and decided by the appellate court whether or not raised in and decided by the trial court. Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Since the constitutional issue raised in the Union\u2019s brief was not raised in the trial court, we shall decline to address it. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>is particularly important not to address a constitutional issue not raised in the trial court in light of the principle that a court will not unnecessarily decide a constitutional question. <em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 306-307 n. 18, 765 A.2d 97, 114 n. 18 (2001); <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>356 Md. 324, 342, 739 A.2d 41, 51 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Moreover, the case of <em>St. Mary\u2019s Industrial School for Boys v. Brown, supra, </em>relied on by the Union, did not involve any holding under the Maryland Constitution. The Court in that case simply held that a tax and an appropriation, by Baltimore City, giving funds to certain private organizations, were not authorized by the City Charter or by any enactment of the General Assembly. The challenged action in the case at bar was ratified and authorized by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">BELL, C.J., concurs and dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-5\">.

Clearly, the holding that the appellant has demonstrated its standing by showing how the regulations and the contract disturbed \u201cminimum labor standards for the bargaining unit,\u201d 379 Md. 192, 199-200, 840 A.2d 728, 732-33 (2003) and diminished its \u201cstatus as the representative of public employees,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 200, 840 A.2d at 732, is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>I do not agree with the majority\u2019s decision on the merits, however. On this appeal, the appellant asks the Court to answer a single question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">\u201cWhen the Maryland State Board of Education exercises its Visitatorial\u2019 power to \u2018reconstitute\u2019 a public school, may it compel a local board of education to fully privatize the school, so that the school\u2019s curriculum, administration and faculty members are selected, employed, and controlled, not by a local board, but instead by a for profit business corporation whose stock is publicly-traded?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Rather than answer that question, the majority holds that, whether originally authorized or not, the General Assembly, by virtue of the enactment of legislation subsequent to the promulgation of the challenged regulations and the execution of the challenged contract, has ratified both the regulations and the operations and management contract with the private concern. More particularly, it says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">\u201cEven if the State Board lacked the statutory authority to promulgate the reconstitution regulations in 1993, subsequent enactments by the General Assembly remove any doubt as to the statutory authorization for the State Board\u2019s actions. The General Assembly has passed legislation which confirms and ratifies the State Board\u2019s power to issue the reconstitution regulations and to enter into third party contracts pursuant to those regulations.

The provision of that system is a two-tiered endeavor, shared by the State Board, the head of the State Department of Education and a principal department of State government, \u00a7 \u00a7 2-101 and 2-102 of the Education Article, and the twenty four local boards, including Baltimore City, of education. The State Board\u2019s powers and authority are enumerated in \u00a7 2-205 of the Education Article. They include determining the elementary and secondary educational policies of the State, subsection (b)(1); causing implementation of provisions of the Education Article that are within its jurisdiction, subsection (b)(2); enforcing the provisions of the Education Article within its jurisdiction and its bylaws, rules, and regulations, through legal proceedings where necessary, subsection (d); finally deciding controversies and disputes concerning the meaning of the Education Article and the bylaws, rules, and regulations adopted pursuant to it, subsection (e); exercising, through the State Superintendent, \u201cgeneral control and supervision over the public schools and educational interests of this State,\u201d subsection (g); establishing basic policy and guidelines for the program of instruction for the public schools, subsection (h)(1); investigating, employing additional expert assistance for the purpose, the educational needs of this State and methods to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>improve educational conditions, subsection (i)(l)(i). In addition, the State Board is required to adopt bylaws, rules, and regulations, applicable to all jurisdictions and having \u201cthe force of law when adopted and published,\u201d for the administration of the public schools, \u00a7 2-205(c), as well as \u201cfor the approval and accreditation of all public schools.\u201d \u00a7 2-206(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">On the other hand, the local boards, including the New School Board of Baltimore City, has some responsibilities for public education in their jurisdictions.

Allegany County Sch. Com\u2019rs, </em>51 Md. 401, 405-06 (1879) (after noting the State Board\u2019s duty with regard to the public education law, to make by-laws for the administration of the public school system, and to suspend or remove examiners or teachers, characterizing the provision requiring it to \u201cexplain the true intent and meaning of the law, and ... decide, without expense to the parties concerned, <em>all controversies and disputes that may arise under it,\u201d </em>as \u201ca visitatorial power of the most comprehensive character.\u201d), which we have held, gives it the \u201clast word on any matter concerning educational policy or the administration of the system of public education.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Board of Educ., </em>234 Md. 561, 565, 200 A.2d 67, 69 (1964). In <em>Board of Education v. Waeldner, </em>298 Md. 354, 360, 470 A.2d 332, 335 (1984), we referred to the State Board\u2019s general control and supervision over the public schools and educational interests, its authority to determine the elementary and secondary educational policies, its obligation to adopt bylaws, rules, and regulations and its responsibility for the interpretation of the public education law and the resolution of disputes arising under it to explain the extent of the visitatorial power. Nevertheless, we have described the visitatorial power \u201cas one of supervision, regulation and direction.\u201d <em>Zeitschel v. Board of Education of Carroll County, </em>274 Md. 69, 80-81, 332 A.2d 906, 912 (1975), citing <em>Peter v. Prettyman, </em>62 Md. 566, 576 (1884), a case involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the visitatorial power of circuit court judges. More particularly, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-4\">\u201cWe think it beyond question that the power of visitation vested in the State Board is one of general control and supervision; it authorizes the State Board to superintend the activities of the local boards of education to keep them within the legitimate sphere of their operations, and whenever a controversy or dispute arises involving the educational policy or proper administration of the public school system of the State, the State Board\u2019s visitatorial power authorizes it to correct all abuses of authority and to nullify all irregular proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 81, 332 A.2d at 913.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">We have also said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">\u201cOf course, the visitatorial power of the State Board is not without limits. It cannot be asserted to finally decide purely legal questions. <em>Hobbs v. Hodges, </em>176 Md. 457, 5 A.2d 842 (1939); <em>Board of Education v. Cearfoss, </em>165 Md. 178, 166 A. 732 (1933). Neither can the State Board exercise the visitatorial power fraudulently, in bad faith, or in breach of trust. <em>Coddington v. Helbig, </em>195 Md. 330, 73 A.2d 454 (1950). Another obvious limitation is that the visitatorial power cannot be exercised in direct contravention of statute. The State Board is manifestly of legislative creation; it has only such powers as the legislature has vested in it, expressly or by necessary implication. <em>See Purnell v. State Bd. of Ed., </em>125 Md. 266, 93 A. 518 (1915). <em>Cf. Peters v. Hobby, </em>349 U.S. 331, 75 S.Ct. 790, 99 L.Ed. 1129 (1955); <em>Stark v. Wickard, </em>321 U.S. 288, 64 S.Ct. 559, 88 L.Ed. 733 (1944). At one time, State Board bylaws were expressly required not to be at variance with statute. Ch. 463, Acts of 1874. This language was later eliminated. Ch. 506, Acts of 1916. But with or without such language, it is clear that \u2018rules and regulations adopted by administrative agencies, to be valid, must be reasonable and consistent with the letter and policy of the statute under which the agency acts.\u2019 <em>Farber\u2019s, Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>266 Md. 44, 50-51, 291 A.2d 658, 662 (1972); <em>Comptroller v. M.E.

Cook, </em>168 Md. 475, 178 A. 219 (1935), a case involving an alleged conflict between a State Board bylaw requiring new teachers to graduate in the upper 4/5ths of their class and an existing statute which provided that teaching certification may be issued to college graduates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIj\"><em>Halsey v. Board of Education, </em>273 Md. 566, 572-573, 331 A.2d 306, 310 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">None of the legislation on which the majority relies for ratification expressly and directly does so. To be sure, each mentions reconstitution in some context, \u00a7 4-309(d)(15) referring to \u201cschools that are subject to a State reconstitution notice;\u201d \u00a7 6-306(b)(4) mentioning \u201ca reconstitution school, a reconstitution-eligible school;\u201d and SPP \u00a7 22-216(a) referencing an individual \u201chired by a third party contractor to work in a school that is reconstituted by order of Maryland State Board of Education,\u201d not one of the three statutes expressly ratifies, or even refers specifically to, the COMAR regulations or the reconstitution contract with the private concern. Nor does any one of them define what is meant by reconstitution. According to COMAR 13A.01.04.02B(8), reconstitution could occur if only one of the four components of a public school operation has been taken over and the third party is involved only with that component and, therefore, some control is retained by the local board. And the statutes do not distinguish between local reconstitution and state reconstitution. That is important because, if the former, the shared relationship is not disrupted, because the local board would retain the responsibility for the local school\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In my view, these three fleeting and imprecise references are simply insufficient to constitute legislative ratification of the State Board\u2019s promulgation of regulations authorizing reconstitution, a process of recent vintage and inconsistent with the two tiered approach to the provision and governance of public education or of the reconstitution contract at issue. As the appellant points out, the public education law is comprehensive and a part of a statutory scheme. Given that scheme and the responsibilities it places on local boards and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>this case, on the New Board, for reconstitution as proposed in this case to occur, it submits and I agree, would require, in effect, repeal or amendment of several sections of the Education Article, <em>i.e.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">\u201c\u00a7 4-101 (a) (\u2018Educational matters that affect the counties shall be under the control of a county board of education in each county\u2019); \u00a7 4-303(d) (\u2018The Board shall have authority and be responsible for all functions relating to the Baltimore City Public School System\u2019); \u00a7 4-103(a) (\u2018[E]ach county board shall: (1) Appoint all principals, teachers, and other certificated and non-certificated personnel; and (2) Set their salaries\u2019); \u00a7 4-311(a) (\u2018the [N]ew Board shall establish a personnel system governing certificated and non[-]eertificated employees\u2019); \u00a7 6-201(a) (\u2018The county board shall employ individuals in the positions that the county board considers necessary for the operation of public schools in the county\u2019); \u00a7 6-201(b)(2) (\u2018T}he county superintendent shall (i) Assign [personnel] to their positions in the schools; (ii) Transfer [personnel] as the needs of the schools require; (iii) Recommend them for promotion; and (iv) Suspend them for cause and recommend them for dismissal in accordance with \u00a7 6-202 of this article\u2019); \u00a7 6-402(d) (defining \u2018public school employer\u2019 as the county board of education or the New Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners); \u00a7 4-123(e) (mandating that if a county board enters into an agreement for the cooperative or joint administration of a program it \u2018does not relieve any county board or other participant of any obligation or responsibility imposed on it by law\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">If the majority is correct, the public education statutory scheme can be disrupted and undermined, not by specific legislative direction, <em>i.e. </em>legislation that, by its express terms, is intended to do so, but by implication, on the basis of legislation that repeals or amends those parts of the Public Education Law that gives local boards a role to play in the governance of the public schools within their jurisdiction. It is well settled that repeals by implication are not favored. <em>Ronald Fishkind Realty v. Sampson, </em>306 Md. 269, 286, 508 A.2d 478, 487 (1986); <em>Dep\u2019t of Nat. Resources v. France, </em>277 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Md. 432, 460, 357 A.2d 78 (1976). In <em>State v. Harris, </em>327 Md. 32, 39, 607 A.2d 552, 555-56 (1992), this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At9\">\u201c[A] repeal by implication does not occur unless the language of the later statute plainly shows that the legislature intended to repeal the earlier statute. <em>Montgomery County v. Bigelow, </em>196 Md. 413, 423, 77 A.2d 164 (1950); <em>Pressman v. Elgin, </em>187 Md. 446, 450, 50 A.2d 560 (1947). Generally, therefore, a later statute will not be held to repeal an earlier statute by implication unless there is some express reference to the earlier statute. <em>Gannon &amp; Son v.

State, </em>173 Md. 676, 681, 197 A. 296 (1938).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In any event, as the majority acknowledges, in order for legislative ratification to be viable, the legislative body must have been empowered prospectively to authorize the act it would adopt and validate in retrospect. <em>Washington Nat\u2019l Arena v. Prince George\u2019s Co. </em>287 Md. 38, 45, 410 A.2d 1060, 1064, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 834, 101 S.Ct. 106, 66 L.Ed.2d 40 (1980); <em>Co. Council v. Carl M. Freeman Assoc., </em>281 Md. 70, 79, 376 A.2d 860, 865 (1977). I am not convinced that the State Board was authorized to promulgate the regulations at issue or that the General Assembly could have authorized it to do so without providing some guidelines to inform its decision in that regard. After all, it is the General Assembly, and not the State Board, that is charged with the establishment and maintenance of a thorough and efficient system of public schools in the State. Md. Const. Art. VIII \u00a7 1. In the discharge of that responsibility, the General Assembly enacted the statutory scheme under which the State\u2019s public schools presently operate. To the State Board the Legislature gave substantial authority, general supervision over the system, even the last word on matters of educational policy and the administration of the system. But it also gave substantial responsibility to the local boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The regulations at issue are significantly at odds with the statutory scheme established by the Legislature. So much so that, in my view, they are more appropriately the subject of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>legislation and, indeed, constituted law making, and, so, were beyond the authority of the State Board to promulgate. The State Board is an administrative agency, a part of the executive branch of government. The Legislature, without, at the least, providing safeguards and standards to direct its exercise, may not delegate the power to make laws to an administrative agency, an arm of the executive branch of government. <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, </em>311 Md. 64, 80, 532 A.2d 1056, 1063 (1987); <em>Pressman v. Barnes, </em>209 Md. 544, 555, 121 A.2d 816, 822 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">I addressed this issue at great length in dissent in <em>Lussier v. Md. Racing Commission, </em>343 Md. 681, 701-720, 684 A.2d 804, 813-823 (1996). For the reasons there expressed, I believe the State Board inappropriately promulgated the regulations and that the General Assembly, because it gave no advance guidance, did not ratify, and, indeed could not have ratified, the State Board\u2019s actions in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Therefore, and for the foregoing reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\">.
