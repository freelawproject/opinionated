Specifically, we concluded that coram\n   nobis may be available for a defendant who demonstrated that he or she timely requested that trial counsel file a notice of appeal, the attorney failed to comply, and the omission could not reasonably have been discovered within the one-year time limit (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3742719\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/15/391/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3742719\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/15/391/\">\n    at 400-401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3742719\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/15/391/\">\n    912 N.Y.S.2d 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3742719\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/15/391/\">\n    938 N.E.2d 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Defendant now asks us to expand\n   <em>\n    Syville\n   </em>\n   to situations in which retained trial counsel filed a timely notice of appeal but allegedly failed to advise the defendant of his or her right to poor person relief, or to take any action when served with a motion to dismiss the appeal years after the notice of appeal was filed. Because defendant has not met his burden of proving that counsel was ineffective, we decline to expand\n   <em>\n    Syville\n   </em>\n   under the circumstances presented here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant, an English-speaking immigrant from Suriname, asserts that he is minimally literate and has cognitive limitations, which admittedly did not prevent him from maintaining employment in construction, managing independent living skills, taking his elderly mother to doctor appointments and ensuring that she took her medication, and helping his girlfriend's teenage child complete her homework. Defendant immigrated to the United States in 2006. In 2008, he was charged with attempted murder in the second degree, assault in the first degree, tampering with physical evidence, and possession of a weapon in the fourth degree. The charges arose out of an incident in which defendant used a boxcutter to stab another man in the chest, stomach and leg, and then hid the boxcutter-which was covered in blood-in a ceiling tile in the bathroom of the restaurant where the stabbing took place. Defendant retained counsel, who asserted a justification defense at the ensuing jury trial. Counsel was able to obtain defendant's acquittal on the attempted murder and first-degree assault charges. Defendant was convicted, however, of tampering with physical evidence and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree. He was sentenced to an aggregate term of 1 to 3 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At sentencing, the court clerk stated, \"[l]et the record reflect the defendant is being handed a notice of appeal.\" The People\n   have provided us with the standard \"Notice of Defendant of His Right to Appeal\" that is handed to all Queens County defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel filed a notice of appeal on defendant's behalf the day after sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant was released from prison in March 2010, four months after being sentenced. He did not retain an attorney, move for poor person relief or attempt to obtain assistance in perfecting the appeal. In October 2013, approximately four years after the notice of appeal was filed, the People moved in the Appellate Division to dismiss the appeal as abandoned. As required by CPL 470.60, the People sent a copy of the motion to dismiss both to defendant at his last known residence and to counsel. Neither defendant nor counsel\n   responded, and the Appellate Division dismissed the appeal in December 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   One year later, in December 2014, defendant was remanded to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n   for deportation and was released on bond. Defendant's immigration attorney referred him to an appellate indigent defense provider, who moved to reinstate defendant's appeal in April 2015. Although the People filed a response taking no position on the motion, the Appellate Division denied it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In October 2015, nearly six years after the notice of appeal was filed, defendant moved for a writ of error coram nobis, claiming that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in perfecting his appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In connection with his coram nobis application, defendant submitted an affidavit in which he stated, without proof, that counsel did not speak with him during or after his trial about an appeal, about the fact that his conviction could subject him to deportation, or about poor person relief. He averred that he did not know that a notice of appeal was filed and that he would have pursued the appeal if he knew about the deportation\n   consequences of his conviction and his right to an attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trial counsel also submitted an affirmation in which he stated that he was retained to represent defendant at trial and filed a notice of appeal on defendant's behalf but,\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he did so, he did not remember speaking to defendant about how to perfect the appeal. Counsel indicated that he believed his representation, as retained trial counsel, ended after the filing of the notice of appeal because \"[i]t was understood that [he] was trial and not appellate counsel.\" Counsel also stated that he had no recollection of receiving the People's motion to dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Appellate Division denied the coram nobis motion, without opinion (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4243274,4237860\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/138/877/\">\n    138 A.D.3d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4243274\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/138/877/4243274/\">\n    29 N.Y.S.3d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2d Dept.2016] ), and a Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789251\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/1148/\">\n    27 N.Y.3d 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20N.Y.S.3d%20383\">\n    39 N.Y.S.3d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20N.E.3d%20123\">\n    62 N.E.3d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2016] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Despite trial counsel's having secured an acquittal on the charges of attempted murder and first-degree assault, as well as a sentence that resulted in defendant being released from prison four months after his trial ended, defendant now claims that counsel was ineffective. Defendant argues that, due to his purported cognitive limitations, he was ill-equipped to obtain poor person relief in connection with the process of appealing his conviction, to oppose the dismissal of his appeal or to perfect it without any guidance from an attorney. Defendant and Judge Rivera, in dissent, cite the rules of all four Appellate Division Departments, which were in effect at the time of his conviction, requiring trial counsel to inform his or her client, in writing, of the right to appeal and provide basic information necessary to pursue the appeal, including the right to seek poor person relief and how to do so if the client is indigent (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   22 NYCRR 606.5 [b]; 671.3[a]; 821.2[a]; former 1022.11[a] ). Defendant and Judge Rivera, in dissent, maintain that the existence of such directives-as well as bar association standards mandating that counsel assist in procuring poor person relief and take steps to ensure that an appeal is not unwittingly\n   forfeited-establishes defendant's entitlement to a writ of error coram nobis based upon his unsupported claims that counsel failed to assist him in obtaining poor person relief or to respond\n   to the People's motion to dismiss four years after the notice of appeal was filed.\n   This argument is undermined by this Court's holdings, in two cases, that defendants are not \"constitutionally entitled to appointment of counsel to assist in preparing a poor person application\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Although the dissenters\n   fail to recognize the distinction, we emphasize that defendant does not challenge the dismissal of his appeal by the Appellate Division for failure to perfect, as in\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   ; nor does this appeal involve the Appellate Division's resolution of a motion to extend the time to appeal under court rules (\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Rather, this appeal is from the denial of a coram nobis motion. Therefore, defendant bore the burden of demonstrating that he was denied meaningful assistance-that counsel's actions in allegedly failing to assist defendant in obtaining poor person relief were not \"consistent with those of a reasonably competent ... attorney\" (\n   <em>\n    People v. Borrell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734961\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/365/#p368\">\n    12 N.Y.3d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 368,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734961\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/365/#p368\">\n    881 N.Y.S.2d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734961\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/365/#p368\">\n    909 N.E.2d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2009] ). He failed to meet that burden here, both in terms of his specific claim that counsel did not advise him of his right to seek poor person relief in connection with his appeal and the more general claim, advanced by both Judge Rivera and\n   Judge Wilson in dissent, that counsel did not consult with him regarding an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   With respect to the other prong of defendant's coram nobis motion (based on failure to respond to the dismissal motion four years after the notice of appeal was filed) defendant and Judge Rivera, in her dissent, essentially seek a rule that\n   <em>\n    trial\n   </em>\n   counsel has a constitutional responsibility in connection with an appeal for an indefinite period of time extending for years after the notice of appeal is filed. Neither defendant nor that dissent cite any legal support for the imposition of such a rule. Moreover, the cases that defendant cites concerning ineffectiveness of counsel and entitlement to coram nobis relief-including\n   <em>\n    Syville\n   </em>\n   -do not support imposing either such an open-ended obligation on behalf of trial counsel or a rule that counsel is ineffective for failing to assist a defendant in obtaining poor person relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    III.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The federal rule on ineffectiveness of counsel when an attorney completely fails to file a notice of appeal was enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Roe v.

Nevertheless, the Supreme Court rejected a per se rule because holding \"as a\n   <em>\n    constitutional\n   </em>\n   matter, that in every case counsel's failure to consult with the defendant about an appeal is necessarily unreasonable, and therefore deficient [,] ... would be inconsistent with both ...\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   and common sense\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Court further explained that \"detailed rules for counsel's conduct have no place in a\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   inquiry\"-i.e., in an ineffective assistance of counsel inquiry under the federal standard (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [internal quotation marks and citation omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Thus, the Supreme Court held that-although the better practice is to routinely consult with a client-an attorney has a\n   <em>\n    constitutional\n   </em>\n   obligation to consult with a client regarding taking an appeal only when \"there is reason to think either (1) that a rational defendant would want to appeal (for example, because there are nonfrivolous grounds for appeal), or (2) that this particular defendant reasonably demonstrated to counsel that he was interested\n   in appealing\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Court expressly defined \"consult\" as \"advising the defendant about the advantages and disadvantages of taking an appeal, and making a reasonable effort to discover the defendant's wishes\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Indeed, defendant never even denied that the form handed to him at\n   sentencing-while counsel presumably stood next to him-was the standard form handed to every defendant. He averred only that he did \"not remember getting anything in writing about an appeal.\" Nor did defendant establish that he was unable to understand the form, including its instruction on how to obtain poor person relief, particularly given the fact that he was previously capable of retaining trial counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Further, even if the receipt of the standard form was not sufficient under\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   , defendant failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that he was unaware of his appellate rights, how to seek poor person relief, or how to otherwise perfect the appeal, or that counsel failed to comply with the relevant court rules.

However, that affirmation consists largely of hearsay, which parrots the claims asserted in defendant's own affidavit, and therefore also fails to satisfy defendant's burden on this coram nobis application. The affirmation of his current attorney-which recounts a conversation that she had with defendant's mother in\n   which the mother allegedly stated that she and her husband paid defense counsel to represent defendant and that she did not remember defense counsel mentioning an appeal-similarly reflects a lack of firsthand knowledge of the relevant facts. Notably, while both of defendant's parents submitted their own sworn affidavits recounting defendant's background, neither parent was willing to\n   <em>\n    swear\n   </em>\n   that trial counsel failed to discuss an appeal with them or to inform them that he was not\n   acting as appellate counsel. In any event, current counsel's claim is contradicted by defendant's own affidavit stating that\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   \"paid [counsel] to represent [him] at [his] trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Rosario,\n   </em>\n   we are asked to expand\n   <em>\n    Syville\n   </em>\n   to hold that a defendant is entitled to coram nobis relief based on an otherwise unsupported affidavit claiming that counsel did not consult with the defendant regarding an appeal and, had counsel done so, the defendant would have appealed.

Here, defendant has not even attempted to make such a showing, apart from his unsupported claim that he was not aware of his right to appeal. In fact, the record suggests that the reason defendant waited years to pursue further relief was that he was not interested in appealing his conviction and relatively short sentence until his status as a convicted felon led to further consequences.

Counsel failed to comply with the Appellate Division Department's own rules, which dictate that counsel must advise a defendant in writing of the right to apply for poor person relief if indigent and submit the application on defendant's behalf if defendant so requests. The record demonstrates that counsel's representation falls below applicable professional standards adopted by the American Bar Association, New York State Bar Association, and National Legal Aid and Defender Association. As a consequence of counsel's failures, the Appellate Division dismissed defendant's appeal for failure to timely perfect, and thereafter denied his motions to reinstate as well as the instant petition for a writ of error coram nobis. Notwithstanding these facts, the majority concludes that counsel was not ineffective and that defendant is to blame for his own dire situation. I cannot agree. As we have made clear, \"there is no justification for making the defendant suffer for his attorney's failing\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Under well established statutory and case law, Appellate Division rules, and prevailing professional\n   standards applicable then and now, counsel could not desert his client. Defendant's coram nobis petition should be granted and his appeal reinstated. Therefore, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant was a 22-year-old construction worker with no criminal history when he was arrested on charges arising from a fight at a local restaurant, where he had stopped for dinner after work. Defendant maintained that he acted in self-defense when a group of seven men surrounded and attacked him, and that he fought back after one of the men tried to cut him. After using a knife to defend himself, defendant felt frightened and impulsively hid it in the restaurant before waiting for the police to arrive. A jury acquitted defendant of attempted murder and assault, but convicted him of fourth-degree criminal weapon possession and tampering with evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, neither the judge nor defendant's retained counsel mentioned defendant's appellate rights. In rebutting defendant's assertions that he\n   never received notice of an appeal nor information about his rights, the People offered only a court clerk's statement from the close of the proceeding: \"Let the record reflect the defendant is being handed a notice of appeal. Paperwork to follow.\" The record before us does not contain this notice, only a document the People assert is the standard notice given to all Queens County defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The day after sentencing, counsel filed a notice of appeal. Counsel admits he took no further steps to perfect the appeal and\n   that he has no recollection of any post-sentencing contact with defendant or defendant's family. As he explained, \"in [his] view, as retained counsel, [his] representation of [defendant] ended with the trial, sentenc[ing] and filing of the notice of appeal.\" According to counsel, \"[i]t was understood that [he] was trial and not appellate counsel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After defendant's release from prison, he was placed in deportation proceedings based on his conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The appellate indigent defense counsel representing defendant in the immigration proceeding learned that, approximately four years earlier, the Appellate Division had granted the People's unopposed\n   motion to dismiss defendant's appeal for failure to timely perfect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Appellate counsel moved to reinstate the appeal. The supporting affidavit from defendant averred that defendant was unaware of his appellate rights and believed the case finished when he was released from prison. It stated that defendant did not remember receiving any notice of appeal, and that if he had known he could obtain a public defender he would have requested one to pursue his appeal. In appellate counsel's own affirmation, she described a conversation with defendant's mother in which the mother stated that she and her husband had paid for trial defense counsel but exhausted their finances and could not afford an attorney for an appeal. The mother also did not remember counsel mentioning an appeal, and, consequently, she too believed the conviction was \"the end.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Appellate counsel also submitted a psychologist's evaluation in which an expert concluded that defendant has severe cognitive limitations. The expert explained that defendant's verbal intellectual functioning is in the \"Extremely Low\" range, his nonverbal cognitive functioning in the \"Borderline\" range, and that defendant has low, if any, literacy. The expert remarked that defendant's impulsive actions in the underlying incident-hiding the weapon while waiting for police-\"would be consistent with a concrete and simplistic thinking style.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The People took no position on the motion to reinstate the appeal. Nevertheless, the Appellate Division denied it. Appellate counsel then made a motion to reconsider \"in light of the substantial rights at stake in this case,\" noting that \"[defendant] will be deported as a result of a conviction that he has been unable to appeal through no fault of his own.\" The People opposed defendant's motion to reconsider on the basis that defendant had\n   \"failed to meet his burden of showing that the Court misapplied relevant law or overlooked relevant facts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, the Appellate Division denied the motion.\n   Appellate counsel subsequently filed a petition for a writ of error coram nobis in the Appellate Division, alleging defense\n   counsel was ineffective for failing to protect defendant's appellate rights. Counsel argued that defendant had a fifth-grade education and cognitive limitations, that trial counsel had done nothing after filing the notice of appeal, and that defendant's constitutional rights were violated as a result of trial counsel's failure to take basic steps to ensure defendant was able to perfect his appeal. The Appellate Division denied the petition without opinion (\n   <em>\n    People v.

If defense counsel ignores them, and defendant is thereby foreclosed from pursuing a direct appeal as of right, counsel has not complied with either the federal \"objectively reasonable\" or New York's less-stringent meaningful representation requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   New York's four Appellate Division Departments have longstanding rules that \"it shall be the duty of the counsel for the defendant, immediately after the pronouncement of sentence,\" to advise defendant in writing of the right to appeal, the time limitations involved, how to institute an appeal and obtain a transcript of trial testimony, and of the right to poor person relief ( 22 NYCRR 671.3 [a];\n   <em>\n    West,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"579608\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/100/23/#p28\">\n    100 N.Y.2d at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"579608\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/100/23/#p28\">\n    759 N.Y.S.2d 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"579608\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/100/23/#p28\">\n    789 N.E.2d 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"the Appellate Divisions in 1964 promulgated rules that require assigned or retained counsel 'immediately after the pronouncement of sentence' to advise a defendant in writing of the right to appeal and the time limitations involved\" (citations omitted) ] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Second Department, the Court that denied defendant co-ram nobis relief, requires \"written notice to [the] client advising [the client] of the right to appeal,\" which shall \"also set forth ... the appellant's right, upon proof of [the client's] financial inability,\" to apply for \"the following relief\": \"the assignment of counsel,\" \"leave to prosecute the appeal as a poor person and to dispense with printing,\" and a copy of the trial transcript \"without charge\" ( 22 NYCRR 671.3 [b][3] ). In addition, \"counsel shall also request the written instructions of [the] client,\" and upon\n   written notice of a desire to appeal or to apply for poor person relief, \"counsel shall proceed promptly to do so\" ( 22 NYCRR 671.3 [b][4] ). The Second Department is not alone in requiring that counsel ensure a client's indigency is no barrier to pursuing an appeal. The Fourth Department also mandates that counsel submit the application for poor person relief upon the client's request ( 22 NYCRR 1015.7 [a] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The majority ignores the significance of counsel's violation of these rules, minimizing the Division Department standards as a basis for measuring the quality of counsel's\n   representation. Rather than deny that the conduct here is deficient, we should recognize that defendant has been denied meaningful representation as a direct result of counsel's inaction. Apart from the injustice suffered by defendant, the holding here risks disincentivizing compliance with the rules. Instead, we should be conveying their centrality to criminal legal practice.\n   <em>\n    C.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In addition to considering rules promulgated by the states, the Supreme Court looks to \"the legal profession's maintenance of standards sufficient to justify the law's presumption that counsel will fulfill the role in the adversary process that the [Sixth] Amendment envisions,\" since the Amendment \"refers simply to 'counsel,' [without] specifying [the] particular requirements of effective assistance\" (\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 688,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1984] ). Promoted by the bodies charged with supervising the practice of law, professional standards seek to lessen the institutional and structural obstacles that prevent defendants who want to appeal their criminal convictions from doing so. As relevant here, these standards address a \"representation gap\" between when the notice of appeal is filed and when the appeal is perfected. As the ABA commentary explains, \"[t]his is a critical stage in a criminal prosecution, and no defendant should lack legal counsel during this period\" (ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Criminal Appeals, Transition from Trial Court to Appellate Court, standard 21-2.2[a] ). Furthermore, \"[the ABA] standard, in stressing the continuing responsibility of the trial attorney, seeks to avoid the problem of a hiatus in legal representation during a critical period\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The relevant New York State Bar Association standards state that \"representation at the trial court stage means, at a minimum,\" not only \"advising the client of the right to seek appointment of counsel and a free copy of the transcript\" but also \"applying for appointment of counsel and a free copy of the transcript if the client requests\" (N.Y. St. Bar Assn., Revised Standards for Providing Mandated Representation \u00a7 I-7[j][iii], [iv] [2015] ). The National Legal Aid and Defender Association similarly instructs trial counsel to \"inform the defendant of [the] right to appeal,\" and \"the action that must be taken to perfect an appeal\" (Performance Guidelines for Criminal Defense Representation, guideline 9.2[a], [b] [2011] ). If the defendant wants to file an appeal but is unable to do so without the assistance of counsel, the attorney should file the notice and \"take such other steps as are necessary to preserve the defendant's right to appeal\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The American Bar Association makes clear that counsel cannot simply walk away from a client. Its standards specify that\n   trial counsel should explain the \"meaning and consequences of the court's judgment and defendant's right of appeal,\" and \"take\n   whatever steps are necessary to protect the defendant's rights of appeal\" (ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Defense Function, standard 4-8.2[a], [b] [1993] ). Counsel must also \"continue to represent a sentenced defendant until a decision has been made whether to appeal and, if an appeal is instituted, to serve the defendant at least until new counsel is substituted,\" unless the court allows counsel to withdraw (ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Criminal Appeals, Transition from Trial Court to Appellate Court, standard 21-2.2[a] [1978] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The majority cites to\n   <em>\n    Roe\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that professional standards are mere guides that the Supreme Court meant to have limited relevance when analyzing whether defense counsel was ineffective\n   (majority op. at 354 n. 5, 67 N.Y.S.3d at 531 n. 5, 89 N.E.3d at 1212 n. 5). This interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Roe\n   </em>\n   is incorrect. The Supreme Court's reference to the ABA standards in that case as guides must be understood in context. While the Court did not render its holding based on ABA standards, it went on to conclude that it would be the rare case in which counsel's constitutional duty could be met absent compliance with those very same standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The majority's misplaced focus on \"guides\" also takes that word out of context in light of other Supreme Court precedent. The Supreme Court has continuously treated professional standards as essential to the Court's effective assistance analysis. In\n   <em>\n    Strickland,\n   </em>\n   the Court held that \"[t]he proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In\n   <em>\n    Padilla v. Kentucky,\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court held that \"[t]he first prong [of an ineffective assistance of counsel analysis]-constitutional deficiency-is necessarily linked to the practice and expectations of the legal community\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 366,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2010] ).

Thus, when evaluating an attorney's representation, professional norms are at the center of the analysis.\n   <em>\n    Roe\n   </em>\n   is not to the contrary, as the majority implies, nor establishes that counsel here was other than ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    IV.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In the case before us, counsel was ineffective and failed to provide meaningful representation to defendant, resulting in the loss of defendant's only appeal as of right.

The affirmation, however, is revealing more for what it omits than for what it includes, and does not support an inference of effective representation. This \"carefully worded\" document\n   says nothing about whether counsel's usual practice includes informing defendants about their right to appeal or how to request appellate indigent representation. While the People's motion to dismiss defendant's appeal and the court's order granting that motion were both sent to counsel's business address, counsel states he has no recollection of receiving the motion to dismiss the appeal and \"carefully\" makes no mention of whether he received the order.

Nevertheless, the burden is on counsel, not the court, to ensure that defendant thoroughly understands the right to appeal and how to pursue it.

As the NACDL argues, \"[t]o do otherwise presents an egregious risk to criminal defendants' fundamental right to counsel in their appeals as of right and undermines exactly what the ABA Standards are designed to prevent-'a hiatus in legal representation during a critical period' \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   [citation omitted] ). Such a rule would provide \"criminal defense attorneys, prosecutors, and judges with a precise guidepost to determine the point at which the duties of counsel end\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25) and would place a \"minimal burden on criminal defense attorneys,\" since \"[for lawyers] experienced with the criminal justice system, providing advice about these subjects and preparing the necessary papers is easily and quickly accomplished\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   On the other hand, the approach adopted by the majority today:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \"place[s] an immense burden on defendants, especially uneducated, non-English-speaking defendants, who must (i) come to understand the right to appellate counsel, (ii) then understand that to receive appellate counsel requires papers demonstrating\n   one's indigence and requesting the appointment of counsel, and (iii) then prepare such papers despite potential deficiencies in language and legal knowledge\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendant's case evidences this point, and highlights the vulnerability of many who find themselves in such a position.

To the contrary, the rule assures the transition between trial and appeal progresses efficiently, effectively, and expeditiously.\n   In contrast, the majority's holding widens the gap in representation and increases the chances of a defendant's loss of the\n   right to appeal. The majority's approach also runs counter to sister federal and state jurisdictions, and the overwhelming consensus of the profession that criminal defendants and the justice system are best served by ensuring representation throughout the criminal appellate process. Other jurisdictions have found this type of rule workable, and, as discussed, the NACDL, whose members will be held to this high standard, champions the duty be imposed on defense counsel. The majority's decision today is an unfortunate step in the wrong direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    VI.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The applicable legal standards forbid counsel from creating a gap in representation.

Mr. Arjune, a lawful permanent resident with cognitive impairments who defended himself against a group of attackers with a drywall knife that he carried for work, made the mistake of hiding the knife in fright. The day after his conviction, his trial counsel filed a notice of appeal and then walked away from all further obligation to or communication with Mr. Arjune. When he, and not Mr. Arjune, received in the mail the People's motion to dismiss the appeal for failure to timely perfect, he made no attempt even to contact Mr. Arjune or Mr. Arjune's parents,\n   who had paid for his trial representation of their son. His actions left Mr. Arjune ignorant of his appellate rights and bereft of meaningful counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Even if we assume that Mr. Arjune was handed a court-issued form notice of appeal, with \"paperwork to follow,\"\n   <em>\n    Flores-Ortega\n   </em>\n   contemplated and rejected such a scenario as insufficient to avoid constitutional violation. The Supreme Court considered a circumstance in which \"a sentencing court's instructions to a defendant about his appeal rights in a particular case are so clear and informative as to substitute for counsel's duty to consult. In some cases, counsel might then reasonably decide that he need not repeat that information\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    at 479-480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). That hypothetical situation differs materially from the one before us. Leaving aside that Mr. Arjune does not recall receiving the written notice, that the notice he may have received is not in the record, and that he is borderline illiterate (which his trial counsel surely knew), the sample of the type of form the People say he likely received is not remotely sufficient \"to substitute for counsel's duty to consult\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). Remember, \"consult\" means \"advising the defendant about the advantages and disadvantages of taking an appeal\"; no one contends the standard form does so.\n   <em>\n    Flores-Ortega's\n   </em>\n   example, coupled with its holding, strongly suggests the Supreme Court of the United States would have unanimously reinstated Mr. Arjune's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In short, at the conclusion of his trial, Mr. Arjune was denied the protections of the Constitution. Today, he-like all other defendants whose trial counsel believe that they may leave their clients unadvised and unrepresented in considering whether, when, and how to appeal-is denied them again by this Court despite the imperatives of justice and the dictates of the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Chief Judge DiFIORE and Judges FAHEY, GARCIA and FEINMAN concur; Judge RIVERA dissents in an opinion, in which Judge WILSON concurs in a separate dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Order affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    The concurring justices preferred a still more stringent inquiry, but agreed attorneys must \"almost always\" consult with their clients and can \"hardly ever\" leave a defendant uncounseled about his appeal rights (\n    <em>\n     Flores-Ortega,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n     528 U.S. at 488\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n     120 S.Ct. 1029\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [Breyer, J., concurring];\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n     at 494\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/\">\n     120 S.Ct. 1029\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [Ginsburg, J., concurring] ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
