WRIGHT, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, James D. Askew, III, appeals the trial court's denial of his public records request. He contests the court's ruling that he failed to state a justiciable claim requiring the clerk of courts to provide the requested records. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Pertaining to the request at issue, appellant pleaded guilty to one count of felonious assault and the accompanying repeat violent offender specification. After finding him guilty, the trial court imposed an aggregate sentence of fifteen years, eight years on the primary charge and seven years on the specification. Appellant did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In the first thirteen month after the conviction, appellant filed two petitions for postconviction relief, both of which were denied by the trial court. Appellant did not appeal the ruling on his first petition, but he did appeal the ruling on the second petition. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Askew\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist.

According to the motion, he needs the copy in order to \"present to [the trial] Court a substantive and procedural due process claim pertaining to purported waiver of arraignment so jurisdiction issues can be asserted via ineffective assistance of counsel issues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court denied the motion concluding that appellant failed to demonstrate that he has a justiciable claim or that the public record he seeks is necessary to support the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant raises one assignment for review:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} \"The trial court abused its discretion by denying appellant's request pursuant to R.C. 149.43(B)(8) when a justiciable claim was presented via jurisdiction issues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} R.C. 149.43(B) generally sets forth procedures governing disclosure of records maintained in a public office.\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

In trying to interpret R.C. 149.43(B)(8), some appellate districts have concluded that an inmate cannot satisfy the \"justiciable claim\" requirement without a pending proceeding to which the requested public record would be material.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203667353\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Wood No. WD-10-062,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-1397\">\n    2011-Ohio-1397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201102790\">\n    2011 WL 1102790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12}\n   <em>\n    Seal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Atakpu\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   are not persuasive. The statute does not require that a justiciable claim is pending, only that the inmate has a justiciable claim to be advanced. Moreover, there are times when an inmate is required to attach copies of court documents to initial pleadings in order to state a viable claim for relief such as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus R.C. 2725.04(D) (copies of commitment papers must be attached to petition).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Nevertheless, the public records request must allege a justiciable claim. Here, appellant did not carry his burden. Although appellant bandies about various legal terms such as due process, jurisdiction, and ineffective assistance, he does not give any explanation as to how these terms relate to a justiciable claim. He does not allege operative facts demonstrating a due process violation, a lack of jurisdiction, or a denial of effective assistance of counsel. Necessarily, his motion, likewise, does not state how a copy of the\n   \"waiver\" judgment is necessary to advance a justiciable claim. Therefore, the trial court properly held that the lack of an alleged justiciable claim warranted denial of his public record request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant's sole assignment of error is without merit and the trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   CYNTHIA WESTCOTT RICE,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   COLLEEN MARY O'TOOLE,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
