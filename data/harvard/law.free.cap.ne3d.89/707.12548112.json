VII, \u00a7 B(2) (amended July 28, 1992)). The circuit court of Cook County dismissed the charges, finding that the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to the defendants. The appellate court reversed, holding that the ordinance did not violate the defendants' right to assembly under the first amendment of the United States Constitution. On remand from this court's supervisory order directing it to review defendants' claim under article I, section 5, of the Illinois Constitution of 1970, the appellate court again reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20IL%20App%20%281st%29%20122858-B\">\n    2015 IL App (1st) 122858-B\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 67,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=399%20Ill.%20Dec.%20707\">\n    399 Ill.Dec. 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20N.E.3d%201207\">\n    46 N.E.3d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 We allowed defendants' petition for leave to appeal pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 315 (eff. Jan. 1, 2015) to determine whether the ordinance, which closes all Chicago public parks between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. and prohibits people from being inside any park during these hours, is unconstitutional as applied to defendants under article I, section 5, of the Illinois Constitution ( Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, \u00a7 5 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the appellate court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 Beginning on September 22, 2011, participants in the \"Occupy Chicago\" movement demonstrated in the financial district of Chicago, generally near the intersection of Jackson and LaSalle Streets. Initially, plaintiff, the City of Chicago (City), allowed the protestors to remain on sidewalks in the financial district with no time limitations. The City, however, prohibited the protestors from storing provisions, erecting structures, or blocking traffic. The Chicago Police Department (CPD) enforced those restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 For approximately three weeks, protestors engaged in rallies, marches, protests, and assemblies in Chicago's financial district and adjacent downtown areas. CPD was present to maintain order and assist with traffic control but otherwise engaged in minimal policing of protestors' activities. CPD did, however, repeatedly require the protestors to remove or relocate supplies stored on the sidewalks. In at least one instance, CPD issued a \"move it or throw it away\" ultimatum, an order some protestors believed conflicted with prior CPD instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 On October 15, 2011, Occupy Chicago demonstrators conducted a rally near the intersection of Jackson and LaSalle Streets and then marched through the city for about an hour. CPD directed them to\n   move into Grant Park near the intersection of Michigan Avenue and Congress Parkway, an area commonly known as Congress Plaza. After their arrival there, protestors made speeches on a public address system. Some protestors erected tents and announced their intention to \"occupy\" the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8 During that evening, CPD personnel communicated with protestors and attorneys from the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) and informed them that protestors would not be permitted to remain in Grant Park after its posted 11 p.m. closing time. Specifically, the police informed the protestors and their lawyers that chapter VII, section B(2), of the Chicago Park District Code (Code) prohibited persons from remaining in Chicago parks from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. See Chicago Park District Code, ch. VII, \u00a7 B(2) (amended July 28, 1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9 CPD estimated that approximately 3000 protestors were in Grant Park at around 7:15 p.m. on October 15, 2011. After repeated warnings about potential arrests for violation of the Code, the number of protestors in the park decreased to between 200 and 300 people by about 10:45 p.m. Many protestors who left the park went to adjacent sidewalks on Michigan Avenue and continued to protest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 10 At approximately 1 a.m. on October 16, 2011, CPD again used the public address system to warn protestors about Grant Park's closure at 11 p.m. Chicago police officers then asked each protestor individually whether he or she wanted to leave the park or be arrested. Ultimately, police officers arrested 173 protestors who refused to leave the park for violating chapter VII, section B(2), of the Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 11 A few days later, on October 22, 2011, Occupy Chicago protestors staged another rally in the vicinity of Jackson and LaSalle Streets and again moved their rally to Grant Park. As before, protestors indicated their intention to remain in Grant Park after its 11 p.m. closure. CPD personnel followed a similar procedure, warning protestors about potential arrests and affording them the opportunity to leave. After 12:45 a.m. on October 23, 2011, Chicago police officers asked the remaining protestors if they wanted to leave the park or be arrested. After these warnings, 130 protestors were arrested for refusing to leave the park.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 12 All of the protestors arrested on both dates were given court dates. Ninety-two protestors, the defendants in this appeal, filed motions to dismiss the charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Eighty of the defendants were represented by NLG, and the remaining twelve defendants were represented by the law firm of Durkin &amp; Roberts. Both groups of defendants argued that they were engaged in constitutionally protected expressive conduct or symbolic speech and that the City selectively enforced the ordinance against them in violation of their constitutional rights to equal protection. Defendants noted that the City and CPD let people remain in Grant Park after its 11 p.m. closure\n   for President Obama's presidential election rally in 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 13 Relevant to this appeal, the NLG defendants also argued that the ordinance violated their \"rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to freedom of speech, to assemble, and to petition the government for redress of grievances.\" The Durkin &amp; Roberts defendants argued that the charge for violating the ordinance \"fails to constitute an offense under the circumstances of this very unique case and violates Defendants' rights to freedom of speech, peaceable assembly, and to petition the Government for redress of grievances,\" as guaranteed by the first amendment to the United States Constitution and related provisions in the Illinois Constitution of 1970. On the motion of defendants, the circuit court consolidated their cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 14 The City filed a response, arguing that defendants' motions to dismiss should be denied because the ordinance constituted a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction on the use of Grant Park and the City's enforcement of the ordinance was appropriate. The City also argued that the ordinance was applied in a content-neutral manner and left open ample alternative channels of communication. The City attached three supporting affidavits, two of them from law enforcement officials involved in supervising the Occupy Chicago protests and the subsequent arrests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 15 The third City affidavit was from Deputy Director of Park Services Alonzo Williams. His affidavit described his duties, outlined the development of the ordinance that effectively closes Chicago parks during overnight hours, and defended the ordinance as being necessary to \"keep the parks safe, clean, attractive, and in good condition.\" Williams's affidavit noted that groups could apply for exceptions if \"both the group and its proposed activity comply with our permitting process.\" The fourth and final paragraph of Williams's affidavit provided additional justification for the park-closure ordinance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"4. We believe the Code's standard hours of closure is [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] necessary to properly protect and maintain our parks. The park hours of closure allow park employees to collect trash, make repairs to park facilities, and maintain the landscaping. Park employees are therefore able to make sure the parks remain sanitary and pleasing the [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] eye with limited disruption and maximum safety to park patrons. Park closures also ensure that certain park facilities do not become over-fatigued. Further, limited access by pedestrians during park closure hours reduces crime against park patrons and park property. As we are charged with keeping Chicago's parks beautiful and vibrant for current and future generations, we have made certain rules to that effect. Round-the-clock use of the parks by the general public would not further our mandate and would instead make it impossible to uphold.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 16 The City also attached decisions from trial courts in Sacramento, Boston, and San Diego that addressed Occupy movements in those cities. Lastly, the City attached \"Chicago Police Department Special Order 4-22-01,\" detailing CPD's procedure for issuing administrative notice of ordinance violation citations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 17 Defendants filed a reply and included supporting affidavits from various participants in the Occupy Chicago movement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 18 After oral arguments on the motions, the City filed motions to strike defendants' affidavits, and defendants filed a motion for discovery. The court denied in part and granted in part the City's motion to strike the affidavits and denied defendants' motion seeking discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 19 On September 27, 2012, the circuit court issued a 38-page \"memorandum opinion and order,\" finding chapter VII, section B(2), of the Code unconstitutional on its face and as applied to defendants. The court held that the ordinance violated defendants' right to assembly under both the United States and Illinois Constitutions. The court explained that \"the City's claim that citizen safety, park maintenance, and park preservation constitute the substantial government interest that justifies closing the park seven hours nightly fails because the City routinely closes the park for fewer than seven hours nightly, making\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   exceptions to the curfew for permitted groups.\" The court further explained that the ordinance \"violates the Illinois Constitution which provides a more vigorous right to free assembly, embracing even non-expressive assemblies.\" Lastly, the court concluded that the ordinance violates defendants' right to equal protection because it treats similarly situated citizens differently, noting that the City did not arrest anyone during President Obama's rally in 2008, despite their presence in Grant Park after its 11 p.m. closure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 20 On appeal, the appellate court reversed the circuit court's decision but did not expressly address the trial court's findings under the Illinois Constitution. This court denied defendants' petition for leave to appeal but entered a supervisory order directing the appellate court to vacate its opinion and review the circuit court's judgment that the chapter VII, section B(2), of the Chicago Park District Code violates the right to free assembly under\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the first amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 5, of the Illinois Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 21 The appellate court vacated its original opinion and issued a new opinion, again reversing the circuit court's judgment. Rejecting defendants' facial challenge under the first amendment to the United States Constitution, the court reasoned that the ordinance was not unconstitutional in every circumstance and was not overbroad. Addressing defendants' as-applied challenge under the first amendment, the court applied intermediate scrutiny, traditionally applicable to content-neutral regulations, and determined that defendants' first amendment rights were not violated.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20IL%20App%20%281st%29%20122858-B\">\n    2015 IL App (1st) 122858-B\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 28-48,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=399%20Ill.%20Dec.%20707\">\n    399 Ill.Dec. 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20N.E.3d%201207\">\n    46 N.E.3d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 22 Turning to defendants' claims under the Illinois Constitution, the appellate court explained that its \"review of the 1970 Illinois Constitution debates and convention supports the conclusion that the framers intended for article I, section 5 to extend a broader right of assembly than that afforded under the United States Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. Nevertheless, the appellate court found \"nothing to indicate that the time, place and manner analysis,\" which would be applicable to first amendment claims, \"should be abandoned\" for defendants' state claims and, after applying that analysis, concluded that the ordinance did not violate article I, section 5, of the Illinois Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 23 This court allowed defendants' petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315 (eff. Jan. 1, 2015). We also granted the Illinois Municipal League leave to file an\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   brief in support of the City. Ill. S. Ct. R. 345 (eff. Sept. 20, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 24 ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 25 The ordinance at issue in this case prohibits any person from being or remaining in any city park \"between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. on the following day.\" Chicago Park District Code, ch. VII, \u00a7 B(2) (amended July 28, 1992). The penalty for violating the ordinance is a fine not to exceed $500 and\n   restitution in the event of property damage. Chicago Municipal Code \u00a7 10-36-185 (added Apr. 21, 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 26 Defendants' petition for leave to appeal sought review of two issues. First, defendants asked whether the protections afforded by article I, section 5, of the Illinois Constitution of 1970 are subject to the same \"time, place, or manner\" analysis that applies to the first amendment right of assembly. Defendants' position is that the Illinois Constitution grants broader protection than the first amendment and, thus, strict scrutiny applies to an ordinance that restricts the right to conduct demonstrations in public forums such as parks, at least when the gathering is political in nature. This question requires this court to decide whether article I, section 5, of the Illinois Constitution provides broader protection than the assembly clause of the first amendment to the United States Constitution under this court's limited lockstep doctrine. Second, if this court determines that the ordinance is not subject to strict scrutiny and that the intermediate standard of time, place, or manner analysis applies, defendants ask us to apply the analysis \"more robustly\" than the appellate court did here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 27 The Chicago Park District Code has the same force as a municipal ordinance.\n   <em>\n    Chicago Park District v.

Our first state constitution provided in article VIII, section 19, that \"the people have a right to assemble together in a peaceable manner to consult for their common good, to instruct their representatives, and to apply to the general assembly for redress of grievances.\" Ill. Const. 1818, art. VIII, \u00a7 19. Unfortunately, most of the records of the 1818 Constitutional Convention were lost or destroyed by 1891. See Elliott Anthony, The Constitutional History of Illinois (1891). We do know that the first state constitutional convention lasted for three weeks in August 1818 and that the drafters relied heavily on the constitutions of other states to provide the wording. Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Indiana were specifically noted as providing \"[t]he wording of the Illinois Bill of Rights ***, with little thought given to changes in these basic statements of individual rights.\" Janet Cornelius, Constitution Making in Illinois, 1818-1970, at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 41 This provision remained unchanged in the 1848 Constitution, which provided in article XIII, section 21, that \"the people have a right to assemble together in a peaceable manner to consult for their common good, to instruct their representatives, and to apply to the general assembly for redress of grievances.\" Ill. Const. 1848, art. XIII, \u00a7 21. However,\n   <em>\n    The Constitutional Debates of 1847\n   </em>\n   contains no relevant discussion of this provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 42 This language was altered slightly in the 1870 Illinois Constitution, which continued to protect a right to assembly through its guarantee that \"[t]he people have the right to assemble in a peaceable manner to consult for the common good, to make known their opinions to their Representatives, and to apply for redress of grievances.\" Ill.

This is a limitation on the general right ***.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 338.

Defendants argue that the addition of this comma creates an independent right to assemble, with no limitation on its purpose so that it would apply to those that involve traditionally expressive conduct, like political protests, and those that do not. This, they assert, indicates that the Illinois provision provides broader rights than the federal provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 53 The records of the 1970 Constitutional Convention, however, demonstrate the delegates' awareness of the incorporation doctrine, the link between the state right of assembly provision and the cognate provision in the United States Constitution, as well as their intent that the two provisions remain in harmony. For example, the vice president of the convention observed that existing section 17 was \"quite parallel *** to the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\" 3 Record of Proceedings, Sixth Illinois Constitutional Convention 1488 (statements of Vice President Smith). Another delegate referred to the bill of rights in the state constitution as \"almost surplusage\" in light of the guarantees of the federal constitution but urged retention of Illinois's language, that is, the common good clause, for its \"historical resonance.\" 4 Record of Proceedings, Sixth Illinois Constitutional Convention 3645 (statements of Delegate Foster).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 54 We conclude that the addition of the comma, as a matter of grammatical construction, altered the meaning of this section but not in the manner suggested by the defendants. Under the 1870 Constitution, the right to peaceably assemble was limited to three purposes: to consult for\n   the common good, to make known opinions to elected representatives, and to apply for redress of grievances. As such, it had been out of step with the United States Constitution since 1937, and these limitations were, therefore, ineffective. See\n   <em>\n    Terminiello\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"572361\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/337/1/#p4\">\n    337 U.S. at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"572361\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/337/1/#p4\">\n    69 S.Ct. 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The addition of the comma corrected this inconsistency, resulting in a state constitutional provision that now lists four independent rights: the right of the people to peaceably assemble, their right to consult for the common good, the right to make known their opinions to their representatives, and their right to apply for redress of grievances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 55 Our conclusion is supported by the 1970 Illinois constitutional debates and convention. Specifically, Father Francis Lawlor, speaking on behalf of the Bill of Rights Committee, explained that \"[t]he purpose of inserting a comma after the word 'manner' was to assure that the right to assemble in a peaceable manner was an independent right, not subject to qualification by any of the succeeding phrases.\" 3 Record of Proceedings, Sixth Constitutional Convention 1480 (statements of Delegate Lawlor). Father Lawlor further explained that \"people have the right to assemble in a peaceable manner, even though their purpose is other than to consult for the common good, or to make known their opinions to their representatives, or to apply for redress of grievances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"572361\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/337/1/#p4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Father Lawlor's comments echo the concerns raised by Rishe in his comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 56 Further, the official text of the proposed new constitution and the accompanying explanation that were provided to voters described the change from the 1870 language to the proposed new language of article I, section 5, as \"requiring only that an assembly for any purpose be peaceable.\" 7 Record of Proceedings, Sixth Illinois Constitutional Convention 2683.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 57 We therefore hold that because the two provisions are virtually identical in language and were intended by the drafters of the Illinois Constitution of 1970 to express the same meaning, the right to assemble guaranteed in article I, section 5, of the Illinois Constitution of 1970 is to be interpreted and applied in lockstep with the federal precedents interpreting and applying the assembly clause of the first amendment of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 58\n   <em>\n    Presence of Language Unique to the Illinois Constitution of 1970\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 59 In\n   <em>\n    Caballes\n   </em>\n   , we noted that a provision \"may be unique to the state constitution and, therefore, must be interpreted without reference to a federal counterpart.\"\n   <em>\n    Caballes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5703639\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/221/282/#p297\">\n    221 Ill.2d at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=303%20Ill.%20Dec.%20128\">\n    303 Ill.Dec. 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=851%20N.E.2d%2026\">\n    851 N.E.2d 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Both parties have fully briefed the issue. This case is not only important for the parties but also involves a matter of public interest. On multiple separate occasions, and as recently as this year, Illinois citizens have assembled in public forums in Chicago and throughout the state to engage in constitutionally protected speech activity on a variety of political, social, and governmental concerns. Defendants also chose to assemble in a public space. They assembled in Chicago's Grant Park to protest wealth inequality, corporate political influences, and the government's response to those issues.

The trial court, however, denied the motion for discovery and did not conduct an evidentiary hearing. Ultimately, the trial court determined, in relevant part, that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to defendants under article I, section 5, of the Illinois Constitution of 1970, without conducting an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 88 In my opinion, the trial court's ruling on defendants' as-applied constitutional issue was premature. This conclusion becomes readily apparent after reviewing the record. Notably, the record contains minimal evidence on the most critical issues in this case-whether, as applied to defendants' case, the ordinance's nightly closing of Chicago public parks is narrowly tailored to serve a significant\n   government interest and whether it allows ample alternative channels of communication.

It is not clear from the record how much space within that expansive public area was actually used by defendants. Presumably, it was much less than 319 acres. Nor is there any evidence in the record on how much time is needed within the nightly 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. closure to maintain the limited area used by defendants. Defendants note that other large urban areas, including Washington, D.C., San Diego, and Boston, successfully maintain 24-hour access to their large public parks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 90 The bulk of the record consists of affidavits that provide largely irrelevant general background information but not specific facts that address defendants' as-applied challenge. Only one of the City's three affidavits, from Deputy Director of Park Services Williams, provides pertinent information on the rationale underlying the ordinance's closing requirements. Even that information, however, consists of a single paragraph that fails to address the circumstances presented here. Highlighting the sheer lack of information specific to defendants' as-applied challenge, the only evidence in the record arguably relevant to defendants' claims provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   \"4. We believe the Code's standard hours of closure is [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] necessary to properly protect and maintain our parks. The park hours of closure allow park employees to collect trash, make repairs to park facilities, and maintain the landscaping. Park employees are therefore able to make sure the parks remain sanitary and pleasing the [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] eye with limited disruption and maximum safety to park patrons. Park closures also ensure that certain park facilities do not become over-fatigued. Further, limited access by pedestrians during park closure hours reduces crime against park patrons and park property. As we are charged with keeping Chicago's parks beautiful and vibrant for current and future generations, we have made certain rules to that effect. Round-the-clock use of the parks by the general public would not further our mandate and would instead make it impossible to uphold.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   These generic statements of park policy are not supported by any evidence in the record, let alone evidence specific to the facts of defendants' case.

A few conclusory statements from a City representative are insufficient to resolve such an important issue, and the record contains no other evidence specific to defendants' as-applied challenge. Consistent with this court's refusal to make \"as applied\" constitutional determinations without evidentiary hearings, I would remand this case for an evidentiary hearing on defendants' as-applied challenge to the ordinance under article I, section 5, of the Illinois Constitution.
