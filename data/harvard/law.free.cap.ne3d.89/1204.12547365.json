Realty raises several issues, specifically, that the judge (1) erred in denying its motion for directed verdict where Hydro failed to introduce expert evidence on damages and had committed a material breach of the contract that relieved Realty of its contractual duties; (2) erred in denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and its motion for new trial on its counterclaim for unjust enrichment; (3) gave erroneous instruction to the jury that improperly shifted the burden of proof onto Realty, and (4) erred in imposing double damages on a mere breach of contract. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . Hydro and Realty each acquired property in what had once been a manufacturing complex owned by a single company. When Hydro purchased its property in 2001, it entered into a \"Cross-Easements, Covenants, and Restrictions Agreement\" (the agreement) allowing it to send hydroelectricity that it produced through a mill, later purchased by Realty, to an interconnection with Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO). According to the agreement, any electricity that the mill used before the electricity was transferred to WMECO would be billed to the owner of the mill on a monthly basis. Hydro charged Realty the same price per kilowatt that WMECO would have charged, without any additional costs. The agreement also required Hydro to remove the electrical distribution facilities from Realty's acquired mill and build a new interconnection directly with WMECO, no later than the fifteen-month anniversary date of the agreement (i.e., September 6, 2002). However, Hydro continued to send electricity through the mill and send Realty invoices on a monthly basis until July, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   At some point in time, a dispute arose and Realty stopped paying Hydro for the electricity. By the time Hydro disconnected the electric supply to the mill in July, 2006, Realty had accrued over $73,000 in unpaid electric bills. Hydro filed suit, seeking damages under a breach of contract theory and for violations of G.L.c. 93A. Realty filed a counterclaim for unjust enrichment, alleging that Hydro had overcharged Realty for electricity and benefited from continuing to supply power through the mill after September 6, 2002. After trial, the jury found in favor of Hydro on its breach of contract claim and on Realty's unjust enrichment claim. The judge found that Realty intentionally induced Hydro to continue providing power, and ordered the entry of an amended judgment granting Hydro double damages under c. 93A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Motion for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding verdict\n   </em>\n   .

However, Realty's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Esturban\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    Esturban\n   </em>\n   , the absence of expert testimony forced the jury to speculate as to whether the design of an elevator was dangerous and whether it complied with the relevant industry standards because there was no other evidence that supplied that information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3497670\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/68/911/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3497670\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/68/911/\">\n    . at 911-912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The jury heard the testimony of Hydro's owner and Hydro's station manager, who both explained how the electric bills were calculated. This evidence was sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Next, Realty contends that it was entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict because Hydro materially breached the agreement when it failed to remove the interconnection by September 6, 2002, as agreed to and, thereby, relieved Realty from further performance under the contract. We disagree. \"Whether a breach is material or immaterial normally is a question for the jury to decide.\"\n   <em>\n    Lease-It, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts Port Authy\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4012039\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/33/391/#p396\">\n    33 Mass.

Realty presented no evidence that it relied on Hydro to disconnect the power supply by September, 2002, and Realty did not act on the agreement's self-help clause and disconnect the power supply on its own. Rather, Realty continued to accept power without protest. Based on this evidence, the jury could have found that the removal of the interconnection was not an essential and inducing feature of the agreement and, thus, that Realty was not excused from continuing to pay for electricity after September, 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Motion for a new trial\n   </em>\n   . Realty also asserts that the jury's verdict rejecting its unjust enrichment counterclaim was against the weight of the evidence and, therefore, the judge should have granted its motion for a new trial. A judge's discretion to grant a motion for a new trial should be exercised \"only when the verdict 'is so greatly against the weight of the evidence as to induce ... the strong belief that it was not due to a careful consideration of the evidence, but that it was the product of bias, misapprehension or prejudice.' \"\n   <em>\n    Turnpike Motors, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Newbury Group, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902619\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/413/119/#p127\">\n    413 Mass. 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127 (1992), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Scannell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Boston Elev.

Here, there was evidence that, while Hydro channeled the power supply through Realty's mill, Realty received the benefit of electricity from Hydro at a reduced rate. Realty also asserts that Hydro was enriched because of discrepancies with its billing, which it claims was acknowledged by Hydro's representative. However, the jury also heard conflicting testimony from Hydro's owner and station manager regarding Hydro's billing practices. The jury were free to credit this testimony, and the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Jury charge\n   </em>\n   . Realty contends that the judge's instructions to the jury erroneously relieved Hydro of its burden of proving that it did in fact deliver electricity to Realty and suggested that the judge supported Hydro's theory of the case. Specifically, Realty takes issue with the judge's statement, \"I have already instructed you that there was a contract here, there was electrical power provided, there was consideration, in other words, money paid for that power.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A trial judge has \"wide discretion\" in choosing the language of jury instructions, and on review, this court considers only whether \"a critical issue ... was dealt with erroneously as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    General Dynamics Corp\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Federal Pac.

Judges \"shall not charge juries with respect to matters of fact, but they may state the testimony and the law.\" G.L.c. 231, \u00a7 81. In this case, the parties agreed that the formation of the contract was not a question before the jury,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the judge merely explained what the terms of that contract were. The judge's instructions did not intrude on the jury's role as fact finder in determining whether Realty had breached the contract or whether Hydro had been unjustly enriched. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Pfeiffer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Salas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317595\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/360/93/#p99\">\n    360 Mass. 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99 (1971) (holding that judge's instructions erroneously recalled key portions of testimony which \"resulted in the denial of a fair trial to a litigant\").

Realty raises a number of issues related to Hydro's c. 93A claim, including that it was barred by the statute of limitations, that its conduct does not support c. 93A liability, that there was no causal connection between Realty's actions and harm to Hydro, and that it was an error to award double damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The judge issued detailed factual findings and legal conclusions on the question of c. 93A liability.

The judge found that Realty made its last payment to Hydro on January 14, 2005, although Hydro did not finally cut off electricity until July, 2006.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Throughout the fall of 2006, there were ongoing conversations about payment, in which Realty \"stalled\" and \"intentionally misled\" Hydro into believing that it would pay the outstanding bills.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   These conversations culminated in Hydro sending a letter to Realty, offering to reduce the finance charges if Realty paid by the end of the first week of January, 2007. When Realty still did not pay after this final offer date, the judge found that the cause of action had accrued. \"Where compliance with a statute of limitations is at issue, factual disputes concerning when a plaintiff knew or should have known of his cause(s) of action are to be resolved by the [fact finder].\"\n   <em>\n    Patsos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343507\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/433/323/#p328\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343507\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/433/323/#p328\">\n    at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).

Because Hydro filed suit on December 24, 2010, the judge found that the suit was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We review the judge's determination of a c. 93A violation de novo.

Although nonpayment of a debt does not usually justify a finding of c. 93A liability, a pattern of inducing another party to continue to provide services by agreeing to make payments and then failing to pay may justify c. 93A liability.

App. Ct. 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 559 (1998). Additionally, because one of the goals of G.L.c. 93A, \u00a7 11, is to encourage reasonable settlement offers, c. 93A liability may result when a party fails to make a payment or reasonable settlement offer and forces another party to litigate the issue.

The judge found that Realty made representations that its electrical needs would grow in order to induce Hydro to continue providing electricity, that Realty continued to suggest that it would make payments, and that Hydro suffered a loss when Realty failed to pay for the electricity. Here, where the judge found that Realty induced Hydro to continue providing it with electricity with no intention of paying and forced Hydro to litigate the unpaid bills, this conduct violated c. 93A.
