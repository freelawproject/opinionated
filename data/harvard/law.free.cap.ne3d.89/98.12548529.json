He raises the following assignment of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court erred in denying defendant-appellant's motion to suppress, and the trial court's decision must be reversed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} After careful review of the record and relevant case law, we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural and Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In November 2015, Jackson was named in a three-count indictment, charging him with carrying a concealed weapon in violation of R.C. 2923.12(A)(2) ; improperly handling a firearm in a motor vehicle in violation of R.C. 2923.16(B) ; and having weapons while under disability in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In February 2016, Jackson filed a motion to suppress evidence seized from his person as a result of a traffic stop. The state filed a brief in opposition, and a suppression hearing was held in March 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} At the suppression hearing, Detective Carl Robinson (\"Det. Robinson\") testified that he is a detective with the Cleveland Police, Narcotic Gang Unit. Det. Robinson explained that detectives in the Gang Unit conduct neighborhood sweeps and often make \"normal stops\" during their patrols. He stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   If we see anything that looks suspicious on the streets, we stop and investigate it. Guys hanging around on the corners, in front of the stores, drug activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Anything like that we would stop and check it out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} With respect to the night in question, Det. Robinson testified that in October 2015, he was patrolling with Detective David Siefer (\"Det. Siefer\") in an area of Cleveland known for \"heavy gang activity.\" At approximately 11:00 p.m., the detectives observed a suspicious vehicle parked on the side of the road. Det. Robinson testified that the vehicle was running and had three occupants inside. Based on this observation, Det. Robinson activated his overhead lights and initiated a traffic stop. Det. Robinson summarized the stop as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   We were in the area of 93rd and Raymond going westbound from 102 on Raymond. We got like halfway down the block a little further, we saw a car sitting with three occupants in it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   We pulled the car over. We activated our lights, got out of the car. I approached the driver. We did an investigatory stop and saw an open bottle. Detective Siefer saw the driver drinking what he thought to be a bottle of liquor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Det. Robinson testified that he asked Jackson, who was sitting in the driver's seat of the vehicle, for his driver's license. Jackson indicated that he did not have his license on him at that time. Det. Robinson testified that during this initial conversation, he observed an open bottle of liquor in the center console of Jackson's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Det. Robinson stated that Jackson appeared \"fidgety and nervous\" and \"kept reaching towards his right\" despite Det. Robinson's commands to not reach for anything. Det. Robinson testified that he asked Jackson to step out of the vehicle in order to investigate what Jackson was reaching for on his right side. Jackson complied with Det. Robinson's instruction, but removed his jacket before exiting the vehicle. Believing something inside Jackson's jacket posed a safety concern, Det. Robinson collected the jacket, patted it from the outside and discovered a loaded handgun. Jackson was arrested at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On cross-examination, Det. Robinson confirmed that he initiated the traffic stop \"because there were three occupants sitting in [the vehicle]\" in a high gang area. Det. Robinson further confirmed that the open container was observed \"after\" the traffic stop was initiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 10} At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court denied Jackson's motion to suppress, stating, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Based on the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, this court, in reviewing the totality of the circumstances, finds there is a reasonable basis for the search of both defendant's person and his jacket.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In April 2016, Jackson pleaded no contest to all counts and was sentenced to a two-year term of community control sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Jackson now appeals from the trial court's judgment denying his motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In his sole assignment of error, Jackson argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized as a result of the traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} This court reviews a decision on a suppression motion under a mixed standard of review. \"In a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of trier of fact and is in the best position to resolve questions of fact and evaluate witness credibility.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, he contends that the firearm found on his person was \"the fruit of the poisonous tree\" and should have been suppressed. In contrast, the state argues that the traffic stop was supported by a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity based on Det. Robinson's testimony that Det. Siefer observed Jackson drink from an open container while sitting in the driver's seat of a running vehicle. The state contends that Jackson's conduct violated R.C. 4301.64 (consumption of alcohol in a motor vehicle) and R.C. 4301.62 (open container law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Our review of Det.

Robinson testified that \"Det. Siefer saw the driver drinking what he thought to be a bottle of liquor,\" his testimony suggests that Det. Siefer did not make this observation until after the stop was initiated. At no point did Det. Robinson expressly state or clarify that the traffic stop was initiated because Det. Siefer observed Jackson drinking from an open container. Defense counsel attempted to clarify the chronology of the detective's observations during Det.

Robinson's testimony, Jackson argues that the investigative stop was not valid because it was based solely on his presence in a high drug area, a circumstance that does not constitute a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. We agree. Based on the testimony before this court, we find the state's case \"rests solely on the character of the area.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The facts and circumstances before the officer must yet reasonably suggest that some specific criminal misconduct is afoot. That specificity requirement focuses on the criminal character of the act, not on its setting. Acts that are essentially neutral or ambiguous do not become specifically criminal in character because they occur in a high-crime area. Acts that are not specifically criminal in character do not become criminal because they are inapposite to their setting and, therefore, 'suspicious.' The setting can inform the officer's judgment, but it does not make the act criminal.

Rather, the record supports Jackson's position that the detectives initiated the traffic stop based on a mere hunch and their belief that Jackson's parked vehicle was suspicious based on the character of the area. There was no allegation that Jackson's vehicle was illegally parked, and there was no express testimony that the alleged violations of R.C. 4301.64 and 4301.62 were observed before the traffic stop was initiated. Accordingly, we resolve this case in favor of Jackson's Fourth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Having determined that the trial court erred in failing to grant Jackson's motion to suppress, Jackson's first assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Judgment reversed. Case remanded to the trial court with instructions to grant Jackson's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   KATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, A.J., and MARY J.
