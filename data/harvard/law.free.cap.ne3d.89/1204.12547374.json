The plaintiffs, BayState Discounts, Inc. (BayState) and Essex Development Nominee Trust (Essex), colessees, commenced an action seeking judicial enforcement of the lease against Haven Real Estate Group, LLC (Haven), the defendant, which purchased the subject real estate in 2011: an eight-story building and related land parcel. Haven, moving for partial summary judgment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserted that it had made the purchase without notice of the lease, and thus, under G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 4, the lease was invalid as against Haven. After a hearing, a judge allowed Haven's motion and dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint. BayState and Essex appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Based on our de novo review, we conclude there is a genuine issue of fact whether Haven had actual notice of the 2002 lease when it purchased and took title to the property in 2011. We therefore reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n   . Briefly stated, the undisputed material facts established on the summary judgment record are thus. In 2002, Baystate Heritage Trust (Heritage), as the lessor, and Essex, as lessee, entered into a written lease contract as to certain space in an eight-story building in Lawrence. Located at 11-21 Lawrence Street, this mixed-use building\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and parcel of land (hereinafter the property) was then owned by Heritage. The leased premises, known as unit 1B, are situated on the first floor and basement of this building. The lease was for a term of thirty years, starting March 1, 2002, and ending on February 28, 2032;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the lease was never recorded. Haven purchased the property at a foreclosure sale in 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, Haven, BayState, and Essex quarreled over an array of issues involving the premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   They later outlined their respective claims in writing: BayState and Essex served a G. L. c. 93A demand letter on Haven, which in turn issued a response. This suit followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Trial court proceedings\n   </em>\n   . By their verified complaint, the plaintiffs, BayState and Essex, alleged that Haven had not only breached the lease contract, but had also engaged in unlawful conduct, including a violation of G. L. c. 93A, causing harm to them. With its answer, Haven asserted a counterclaim against BayState for breach of the lease and violation of c. 93A. In its pleading, Haven did not assert that the lease was invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Later, in moving for partial summary judgment, Haven asserted that the lease was invalid and offered the testimony of its sole member and officer, Albert Adriani.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Adriani had submitted Haven's winning bid for the note at a July, 2009, online auction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Adriani acknowledged that records or \"documents\" pertaining to the property were made available to him prior to the auction. He flatly denied that the lease was among the records he viewed at that time. Adriani further testified that the lease was not a part of the closing documentation that Haven had relied on in foreclosing on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Opposing Haven's motion, BayState and Essex brought out the fact that a \"certified rent roll\" for the 11-21 Lawrence Street building was made available to Adriani in July, 2009, prior to the mortgage note being offered for sale at auction. That Adriani was aware of, and personally saw the certified rent roll, prior to bidding, is not refuted by any other material in the summary judgment record. The plaintiffs offered the certified rent roll as an exhibit at the evidentiary hearing. The rent roll listed \"Bay State Discount\" as a tenant on the first floor, indicated the \"net rentable\" square footage was \"4,000,\" identified the lease start date as \"5/1/2002\" and the end date as \"2/28/2032,\" and provided that the amount of BayState's annual base rent was \"$54,000.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n   .

It has long been the law in this Commonwealth that an unrecorded lease for a term of more than seven years (or other similar instrument) is invalid against any person,\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   , as is pertinent here, those who have \"actual notice\" of it.
