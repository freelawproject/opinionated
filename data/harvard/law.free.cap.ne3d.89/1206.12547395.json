ULEBOR.\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-2\">\n  16-P-1139\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-3\">\n  Appeals Court of Massachusetts.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  Entered: September 29, 2017.\n </decisiondate>\n <p id=\"p-5\">\n  <em>\n   MEMORANDUM AND ORDER PURSUANT TO RULE 1:28\n  </em>\n </p>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   The defendant appeals from the denial of her motion, pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 30, as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20Mass.%201501\">\n    435 Mass. 1501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), seeking to withdraw her plea of guilty to larceny over $250 and insurance fraud. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   As the defendant acknowledges, collateral consequences generally may not be used to satisfy the prejudice prong of the two-part test required to support a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sylvester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462654\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/1/#p6\">\n    476 Mass. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6 (2016). The Massachusetts appellate courts have considered, and rejected, consideration of such collateral consequences as sex offender registration, see\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Shindell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1582840\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/63/503/#p505\">\n    63 Mass. App. Ct. 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 505 (2005), limitations on parole eligibility, see\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stanton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3942658\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/2/614/#p621\">\n    2 Mass. App. Ct. 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621-622 (1974), and civil confinement for sex offender treatment, see\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362138\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/355/#p362\">\n    472 Mass. 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 362-363 (2015). Though the United States Supreme Court created an exception to that general rule in the context of deportation as a consequence of conviction, see\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kentucky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 369, 374 (2010), our cases continue to view that exception as a narrow one, limited to the specific and \"unique\" context of deportation.\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362138\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/355/#p362\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 363 n.10. The defendant suggests that her case is an appropriate occasion to extend the holding of\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , and the exception created therein, to adverse collateral employment consequences resulting from a criminal conviction. We decline the invitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Because we conclude that the adverse employment consequences claimed by the defendant may not be used to satisfy the prejudice prong of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel, we need not, and do not, consider whether she has demonstrated that a more favorable disposition, avoiding the claimed adverse consequences, could have been achieved had her plea counsel furnished constitutionally adequate representation. Similarly, because her claim of prejudice rests on an ineligible ground, we discern no abuse of discretion in the failure of the motion judge to conduct an evidentiary hearing on her motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Order denying motion to withdraw plea affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-12\">\n    Among other things, the range and extent of any impact of a criminal conviction on an individual's future employment prospects is highly variable and uncertain. We note, for example, that counsel advised at oral argument that the defendant in the present case has been able to gain employment in her chosen field, despite her criminal record. We note as well that the United States Supreme Court specifically recognized, and distinguished, the potential for adverse employment consequences resulting from a criminal conviction in\n    <em>\n     Padilla\n    </em>\n    itself. See\n    <em>\n     Padilla\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Kentucky\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n     at 376-377\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Alito, J., concurring).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
