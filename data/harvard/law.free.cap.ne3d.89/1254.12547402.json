Defendant's request was supported by specific allegations regarding counsel's performance (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v. Porto,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3746278\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/16/93/\">\n    16 N.Y.3d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3746278\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/16/93/\">\n    917 N.Y.S.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3746278\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/16/93/\">\n    942 N.E.2d 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2010] ). Under these circumstances, the court had a duty to inquire into defendant's request for new counsel before it proceeded to sentence defendant (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v. Sides,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4417319\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/75/822/\">\n    75 N.Y.2d 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=552%20N.Y.S.2d%20555\">\n    552 N.Y.S.2d 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=551%20N.E.2d%201233\">\n    551 N.E.2d 1233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1990] ). Accordingly, defendant must be afforded the opportunity\n   to decide whether to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea upon the advice of counsel. Defendant's remaining contentions lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Chief Judge DiFIORE and Judges RIVERA, STEIN, FAHEY, GARCIA, WILSON and FEINMAN concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of\n   Appeals ( 22 NYCRR 500.11 ), order reversed and case remitted to County Court, Monroe County, for further proceedings in accordance with the memorandum herein.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
