In this appeal, the defendants assert that (1) because the plaintiffs did not sign the amended lease, the lease document containing a right of first refusal (ROFR) for the purchase of the rental property was invalid and unenforceable; (2) even assuming the existence of a valid lease, when the plaintiffs breached the lease, it was voided and the ROFR nullified; and (3) in any event, the plaintiffs failed to properly exercise the ROFR option.

Then, before signing the lease themselves, the defendants changed only the lease term from thirty-six months to thirty months. The remainder of the lease, including the ROFR option, remained intact. Accordingly, as the \"part[ies] to be charged,\" when the defendants signed the document, they created a binding written lease that satisfied the Statute of Frauds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2147683\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/104/407/#p412\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2147683\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/104/407/#p412\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Breach of the lease.\n   </em>\n   The defendants next contend that summary judgment is barred because, according to the defendants, the plaintiffs were in breach of the lease terms, voiding the lease and nullifying the ROFR option before it was triggered. This argument also fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendants sent the plaintiffs a notice to quit in a letter dated April 22, 2014, alleging violations of several of the lease terms and condominium rules. While the plaintiffs dispute the allegations, they continued to send rent payments, which the defendants accepted without reservation. Generally, a \"landlord's acceptance of rent for a time subsequent to the expiration of the notice to terminate, may constitute a waiver of the notice.\"\n   <em>\n    Slater\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krinsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3966777\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/11/941/#p942\">\n    11 Mass.

Accordingly, possession remained with the tenants, and the lease remained valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In any event, even if the defendants are correct that they did not waive possession of the premises because the plaintiffs' breach was continuous, the plaintiffs' alleged breach of the lease still would not render the ROFR option void.

Here, the defendants did not condition the ROFR option upon the plaintiffs' compliance with all of the lease terms, therefore, their purported noncompliance with the lease terms would not render the ROFR option unenforceable.

Before the expiration of that time, on June 14, 2014, the plaintiffs sent the defendants written notice of their intention to purchase the property under the terms specified in the third-party offer. The defendants contend this notice did not constitute proper acceptance because, according to the defendants, acceptance was conditioned upon the plaintiffs tendering the full purchase price.
