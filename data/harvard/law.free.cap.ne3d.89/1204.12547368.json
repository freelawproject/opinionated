L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . This case involves a dispute between property owners on Byron Avenue, a residential street in Lexington (town). Byron Avenue is a double dead end street with six single-family homes and no through traffic. The relevant properties, 11 Byron Avenue and 21 Byron Avenue, are located at opposite ends of the street and are separated by three other homes. Vehicles going to 21 Byron Avenue turn left from Lockwood Avenue. Vehicles going to 11 Byron Avenue turn right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The defendant developer, 11 Byron, LLC (developer), obtained building permits from the town to demolish an existing single-family residence at 11 Byron Avenue and build a larger one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Access to the existing building was on Maple Street, but the developer proposed having the driveway for the new building exit onto Byron Avenue. The plaintiff, Christopher Neurath, the owner of 21 Byron Avenue, objected to the issuance of the building permits before the defendant board and, subsequently, appealed the board's affirmance of those permits to the Land Court pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Land Court judge rejected the plaintiff's assertion that the new residence would increase traffic on Byron Avenue in a way that impacted the plaintiff's property. He reasoned that \"[i]t is completely speculative to assume, as [the plaintiff] does, that the addition of one single-family home, on the opposite end of the dead end street that has hardly any traffic, will have any material traffic-based impact on the [plaintiff's] property.\" As to the plaintiff's concerns regarding aesthetics and density, the judge concluded that the plaintiff's claims failed because they were supported only by the plaintiff's personal opinion, which was insufficient to confer standing. The plaintiff challenges these conclusions on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

Here, the plaintiff's property does not abut 11 Byron Avenue, is not directly opposite on any private or public way, and is not an abutter to an abutter. Accordingly, he does not qualify as a \"party in interest\" and, to establish standing, \"must put forth credible evidence to substantiate his allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waltham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1582843\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/63/435/#p441\">\n    63 Mass.

Bearing in mind these principles, we conclude that the plaintiff's affidavit, the primary evidence offered in opposition to the defendants' motions to dismiss, was quantitatively and qualitatively insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   First, we agree with the judge's assessment that the plaintiff's affidavit does not adequately assert \"a harm specific to [his] property.\"\n   <em>\n    Schiffenhaus\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842741\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/79/600/#p603\">\n    79 Mass. App. Ct. 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 603 (2011). See\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waltham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1582843\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/63/435/#p441\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1582843\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/63/435/#p441\">\n    at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he plaintiff must show that the injury ... is special and different from the injury the action will cause the community at large\"). For example, even assuming some increase in traffic on Byron Avenue from the addition of a larger home at one end of the street, the affidavit does not adequately explain how such an increase would adversely impact his property at the opposite end of the street.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Second, we also agree that the statements in the affidavit regarding increased traffic and the aesthetics of the neighborhood are merely statements of the plaintiff's personal opinion. The plaintiff's assertion of \"increased exposure to the lights, noise, and view of traffic on Maple Street from [his] home\" lacks evidentiary support. Such speculative and unsupported personal opinion is not sufficient to establish aggrievement under G. L. c. 40A. Accordingly, we discern no error in the judgment of dismissal for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While we find the plaintiff's arguments unpersuasive, we do not think sanctions are warranted as we cannot say the appeal was frivolous or initiated in bad faith. See\n   <em>\n    Avery\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902913\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/414/450/#p455\">\n    414 Mass. 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 455 (1993).
