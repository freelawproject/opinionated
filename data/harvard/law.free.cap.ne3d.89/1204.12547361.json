The defendants also argue that the judge erred in finding that the plaintiff had demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendants' petitioning activities were devoid of any reasonable factual support or arguable basis in the law. We vacate the portion of the order denying the special motions to dismiss and remand for additional discovery for the reasons discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . \"We summarize the relevant facts from the pleadings and affidavits that were before the motion judge.\"\n   <em>\n    477 Harrison Ave., LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    JACE Boston, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451895\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/162/#p164\">\n    477 Mass. 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 164 (2017) (\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The defendant, Michael Astrofsky, is the father of a three year old child. The defendant, Denise Woolf is Astrofsky's mother and the paternal grandmother of the child. The plaintiff, James Nicholson, is the stepfather of the child's mother and the child's maternal stepgrandfather.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Woolf took care of the child during the late summer of 2014. While the child was in her care, Woolf alleges that the child told her that the plaintiff liked to \"smell her bum\" and that \"it tickles when he smells it all the time.\" Woolf discussed the child's alleged statements with her coworker, Samantha Edwards, at the Law Office of George Miller and asked Edwards what she should do. She also told her employer, Attorney George Miller, about these alleged statements and sought advice on the steps she should take.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This discussion was not pursuant to an attorney-client relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Woolf further discussed the child's alleged statements with her family therapist, Julia Swartz, during a regularly scheduled therapy session and inquired as to what she should do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Five days after the child's alleged initial statements, Woolf claims that when she attempted to dry off the child after a bath, she noticed that the child was resisting opening her legs to be dried off. The child allegedly stated that she did not want to open her legs because \"it hurt.\" When Woolf asked the child why she was in pain, the child allegedly explained that the plaintiff \"bumped her\" five times each in the front and the back, pointing between her legs and to her backside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Woolf called the police and informed them of the child's statements. Woolf and Astrofsky then took the child to a hospital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   There, the defendants ordered a \"rape kit\" examination be performed without the knowledge or consent of the child's mother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The hospital ultimately turned the matter over to the Department of Children and Families (DCF). Following an investigation, DCF found no merit to the defendants' allegations. The hospital also found no signs of abuse after conducting the rape kit. Nonetheless, Astrofsky moved to reverse an order by a judge of the Probate and Family Court, which had temporarily granted the child's mother full legal and physical custody, and requested that he be granted full custody of the child. Subsequent to a hearing, the probate judge denied the request, further limited Astrofsky's visitation, and prohibited Woolf from seeing or interacting with the child in any manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff then commenced this action against the defendants, alleging that Woolf and Astrofsky falsely accused him of sexual assault of the child in an effort to defame and inflict emotional distress upon him, and to secure custody of the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants each brought a special motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint, pursuant to the Massachusetts anti-SLAPP statute, G.

First, Woolf alleges that the police directed her to bring the child to the hospital. The plaintiff, on the other hand, alleges that the defendants took the minor child to multiple hospitals in an effort to generate false reports of abuse. Second, Woolf claims that the child repeated the statements of abuse to a nurse at a hospital. The plaintiff claims the contrary, stating that Woolf created these false allegations and that she made these false statements of abuse to the police, DCF, and the hospital. Moreover, the plaintiff does not simply support his claims \"merely by presenting affidavits contradicting the factual basis of the [defendants'] petitioning activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   , 477 Mass. at 173. The plaintiff's claims are also supported by several other allegations, including: that the defendants generated these false reports two months after the child's mother had obtained an abuse prevention order against Astrofsky and after the probate judge had temporarily granted the mother full custody of the child; that the defendants filed a motion with the Probate and Family Court to reverse the child custody order shortly after their visit to the hospital; that DCF ultimately found no merit in Woolf's allegations against the plaintiff and suspended their investigation; and that the probate judge rejected the defendants' motion and entered an order prohibiting Woolf from having any contact with the child and further limiting Astrofsky's visitation with the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   If the plaintiff's statements are found credible, the plaintiff will have established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendants' actions of calling the police and bringing the child to multiple hospitals were \"devoid of any reasonable factual basis,\" and therefore the plaintiff will have satisfied his burden under the second prong of the augmented\n   <em>\n    Duracraft\n   </em>\n   analysis. However, if Woolf's statements in her affidavits are found credible, the defendants will have protection under the anti-SLAPP statute. In light of these credibility issues, we conclude that this case presents appropriate circumstances in which further discovery is necessary before a ruling can be made on the defendants' motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Keegan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836051\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/76/186/#p190\">\n    76 Mass.

The tort of defamation, regarding a private citizen, does not require intentional conduct. \"Assuming the other elements of defamation are present, the publication of a false statement about a private party is equally tortious whether it is made intentionally, recklessly, or negligently.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 628-629.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Defamation is essentially spoken or written words or expressions that injure reputation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 628. The tort of defamation is not inconsistent, however, with a person's right to petition activity. We recognize that, on certain occasions and for certain purposes, the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of free speech and petition for redress of grievances outweighs the interest in protecting reputation. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts ch. 25, topic 3 scope note, at 258. \"Statements,\" for example \"made by public officials while performing their official duties are conditionally privileged....

He can meet that burden in either of two ways. The plaintiff may \"establish 'by a preponderance of the evidence that the special movant lacked any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law for its petitioning activity,' ... i.e., that its petitioning activity is illegitimate.\"\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   , 477 Mass. at 168. If the plaintiff here is unable to meet that burden he may still defeat the special motion to dismiss within the augmented\n   <em>\n    Duracraft\n   </em>\n   framework \"by showing that its claim was not brought primarily to chill, ... the special movant's legitimate petitioning activities but rather to seek damages for the personal harm to [it] from [the] defendant's alleged ...

Subsequent to further discovery, the plaintiff will bear the burden of demonstrating that the defendants' petitioning activities were \"devoid of any reasonable factual support.\" G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. The plaintiff will, upon remand, have the opportunity to show that his claims against the defendants' petitioning activity \"do not give rise to a 'SLAPP' suit\" and were \"not primarily brought to chill the special movant's legitimate petitioning activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Blanchard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451894\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/141/#p147\">\n    477 Mass. at 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Vacated in part; remanded.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The child and her mother began living with the plaintiff and the plaintiff's wife (the child's maternal grandmother) after Astrofsky became physically and emotionally abusive toward the child's mother.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Woolf states in her affidavit that she \"spoke with Attorney Miller and Ms. Edwards because [Woolf] was struggling with the issue and [she] did not want to wrongfully accuse anybody of anything.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    As the judge properly noted, Woolf has the burden of proving any claims of privilege.
