(\"Kent's Excavating\") appeals the trial court's summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee David M. Leneghan, Esq. in Kent's Excavating legal malpractice action against Leneghan, its former counsel. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On May 21, 2015, Kent's Excavating filed a complaint against Leneghan, alleging that its former counsel committed legal malpractice in his representation of Kent's Excavating in relation to the filing of a mechanic's lien in 2008. In its complaint, Kent's Excavating specifically alleged that Leneghan was negligent when he failed to pursue actions to enforce the mechanic's lien, failed to pursue a claim for unjust enrichment, and failed to advise Kent's Excavating of the statute of limitations with respect to the mechanic's lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On September 11, 2015, the court held a case management conference, at which time, the court set a trial date and ordered the plaintiff-appellant to file its expert report by February 29, 2016, and the defendant-appellee to file his expert report and any dispositive motions by May 6, 2016. Thereafter, the court granted Kent's Excavating additional time until March 7, 2016, in which to file its expert report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On May 6, 2016, Leneghan filed a motion for summary judgment. In support of his motion, Leneghan attached numerous exhibits, including portions of the transcripts of the deposition testimony of Kent's Excavating president, W. Kent Phillips. On June 1, 2016, Kent's Excavating filed an opposition to summary judgment. In support of its response, Kent's Excavating attached the affidavit of company president, Phillips, and the affidavit of Patrick Gallagher, an attorney who represented a different subcontractor who performed work on the same project as Kent's Excavating. Thereafter, Leneghan filed a reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On July 5, 2016, Kent's Excavating filed its pretrial statement \"pursuant to Local Rule 21,\" attaching a purported expert report. On July 7, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Leneghan,\n   finding that Leneghan did not breach any duty owed to Kent's Excavating, nor did he \"commit negligent conduct that proximately caused any damages.\" The trial court therefore found no genuine issue as to any material fact and Leneghan was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Kent's Excavating now appeals from this judgment, raising as its sole assignment of error that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of Leneghan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Summary judgment is appropriate when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) after construing the evidence most favorably for the party against whom the motion is made, reasonable minds can reach only a conclusion that is adverse to the nonmoving party.

(\"Designwise\") to supply labor and materials to Designwise for the construction of a commercial building for Sean &amp; Co. for real property in Munroe Falls, Ohio. Kent's Excavating states that it fully performed the contract to supply labor and materials in a workmanlike manner to Designwise, yet neither Designwise nor Sean &amp; Co. paid Kent's Excavating for the labor and materials supplied. Kent's Excavating therefore engaged Leneghan to \"prepare and record\" a mechanic's lien upon the real property of Sean &amp; Co. In 2008, Leneghan did, in fact, file a mechanic's lien on behalf of Kent's Excavating. The appellant stated that when the lien lapsed in 2014, after having taken no action to enforce the lien within the six years of the lien filing date, Kent's Excavating could no longer enforce the lien or seek recovery from Designwise or Sean &amp; Co. Kent's Excavating then filed a complaint against Leneghan, claiming that Leneghan had a duty to either take action on the mechanic's lien or advise Kent's Excavating of the applicable statute of limitations, and consequences thereof, for taking such action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In his motion for summary judgment, Leneghan denied that he breached a duty of care to Kent's Excavating. Leneghan further stated that Kent's Excavating's claim fails for the following reasons: the company rejected Leneghan's timely advice to pursue litigation against the property owner; Kent's Excavating cannot maintain an action in unjust enrichment because it cannot show that the general contractor is unable to pursue the owner for the money the subcontractor is seeking; Kent's Excavating failed to pursue the contractor in privity; it does not have an economically viable mechanic's lien; the company is barred from recovery based upon executed waivers and releases; and Kent's Excavating cannot establish proximate cause, because Kent's work was performed in an unworkmanlike manner and caused the owner damages that were proven in a trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 20} On appeal, Kent's Excavating alleges that Leneghan had a duty to take action on the mechanic's lien or to inform his client of the applicable statute of limitations regarding taking such action. The appellant asserts that its evidentiary materials submitted in opposition to Leneghan's motion for summary judgment create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Leneghan breached that duty. Kent's Excavating contends that it also provided an expert report supporting its position. In the alternative, it claims that expert testimony is not necessary to show that Leneghan breached a duty owed to Kent's Excavating by not acting within the statute of limitations period, citing\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.

Rather, there are many factors that relate to when and under what circumstances liens can expire or be terminated. Moreover, a claim that an attorney failed to file certain documents or take what is deemed to be appropriate legal action is not generally within the ordinary knowledge and experience of the lay person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Compston v.

The report, however, was not properly authenticated by affidavit as required by Civ.R. 56.
