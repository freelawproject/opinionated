Reynolds stabbed the victim with a knife, killing him, and then moved the body to the railroad tracks. Within 24 hours, the Toledo Police Department\n   had Reynolds in custody. During the police interview, Reynolds confessed that he \"poked [the victim's] neck out\" and then moved the body to the railroad tracks. The police arrested Reynolds and charged him with murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} During a bench trial before the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Reynolds argued that he was not guilty of the offense by reason of insanity. Reynolds suffers from long-standing schizophrenia. The trial court rejected Reynolds' affirmative defense and found him guilty of felony murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On appeal, Reynolds claims that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence because he proved he was criminally insane at the time of the offense. Reynolds also alleges that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel based upon his attorney's failure to move to suppress the police video of his interrogation. Reynolds argues that he was incapable of providing a voluntary confession, given his mental disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} For the reasons that follow, we find that the guilty verdict is not against the manifest weight of the evidence and that Reynolds did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel as a matter of law. Accordingly, we affirm his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The facts of this case are not in dispute. On May 2, 2014, around 9:00 p.m., Officer Russell of the Toledo Police Department received a report that a pedestrian had been struck by a train, near Airline Road, in Toledo, Ohio. Officer Russell reported to the scene, where he found the severed body of a man under a rail car, on the tracks. The body was naked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Sergeant Roy Kennedy was also there. He noted the absence of blood at the scene. Kennedy testified that \"if [the victim] had been alive when he was struck by the train, * * * there would have been a large amount of blood at the scene, and there wasn't.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In an effort to learn the identity of the victim, Officer Russell and his partner walked door-to-door in the neighborhood adjacent to the railroad tracks. Their first stop was about a block and one-half away, at a \"group home\" for men, located at 129 Dale Street. Russell was familiar with the home, as he had been called there a few weeks earlier, in response to a call that two men were sword fighting in the front yard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} A resident answered the door and allowed the officers to come inside. Russell testified that there was blood throughout the house including a \"large chunk of coagulated blood\" on the living room carpet and more blood on the couch, on the steps going upstairs, and on the upstairs leading to a bedroom. The bedroom had \"a very large pile of gelled coagulated blood under the bed.\" The officers radioed the police department to report a possible crime. They found Reynolds in his bedroom, lying on his bed, and watching television. Officer Russell and Sergeant Kennedy described Reynolds as \"very calm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} After they made sure that there were no other victims inside, the police suspended their search of the home until a search warrant was obtained. Officer Russell transported Reynolds and the other two residents to the police department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Reynolds' interview with Toledo Police Detectives Deborah Hahn and Quinn began at about 5:19 a.m. on May 2, 2014. They provided Reynolds with his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, which he acknowledged in writing. The interview was recorded and was entered as an exhibit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Detective Hahn described Reynolds, and the video demonstrates, that his demeanor was \"very calm\" and \"cooperative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Hahn testified that Reynolds was responsive to questions, orientated to time and place, gave appropriate responses, and did not appear to be intoxicated. Hahn observed that Reynolds had an injured, bloody right eye, a scratch on his upper body, and blood under his fingernails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The taped interview lasted approximately three hours, although a large block of that time consisted of the forensic team taking skin, fingernail, and buccal swab samples of Reynolds. There were also two extended periods of time, during which no one was in the room, except Reynolds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In the beginning of the interview, Reynolds claimed he had not seen the victim for several weeks, since before Reynolds went to jail on an unrelated matter. In fact, Reynolds had just been released from jail on May 1, 2014, one day before the offense, after serving 17 days at the Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio for fighting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} When asked about his eye injury, Reynolds said that he had injured it while in jail. He explained that he had gotten blood on his hands while cleaning up the bathroom. He said that it was his housemate Shannon's blood, and that it was common for Shannon to bleed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Steadily over the course of the interview, however, Reynolds admitted that he had hurt the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} It began with his admission that he \"found\" the victim in a large recycling bin and that the victim \"did not look good.\" Ultimately, he told the following story: that during the early morning hours of May 2, 2014, the victim had come into Reynolds' room naked. Reynolds said that the victim did that on occasion and Reynolds did not like it. He claimed that the victim had touched his buttocks. Reynolds responded by \"pok[ing] his neck out with my hands.\" He also said that he \"karate chopped\" the victim about 20 times in the neck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Reynolds claimed that he acted in self-defense because he feared being sexually assaulted by the victim. Reynolds can be heard in the video saying, \"I don't want to be gay.\" Written on Reynolds' bedroom wall was \"Roy GBIV Ambassador American money toy 10,000 E.\" No definitive evidence was offered to explain what was meant by that writing. On the one hand, the victim's first name was \"Roy.\" Also, Detective Kristie Eycke, who gathered evidence in this case, testified that \"roygbiv\" is a common acronym for the colors of the rainbow, i.e. red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. Eycke also testified that the rainbow is a symbol for gay rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} After the assault, Reynolds pushed the victim's body out of his bedroom and into the victim's room, leaving a blood trail. The largest concentration of blood was found underneath the victim's bed. Reynolds said that he hid the victim's coat in a pile of clothes, wiped down the floor with his own bedsheet, and then hid the bedsheet in between his own mattress and box spring. He hid the victim's body under some clothes, and kept him there all day. After dark, he brought the large recycle bin inside, put the victim's body in it, took him downstairs, outside, and wheeled him to the railroad tracks. He admitted that he placed the victim's body over the railroad tracks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Reynolds estimated that he had fought with the victim between 4:00 and 5:00 a.m. on May 2, 2017, roughly 24 hours before his police interrogation. Reynolds also estimated that he last received an injection to treat his schizophrenia in January of 2014, although he may have taken someone else's prescribed psychotropic medication that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 20} After admitting what he had done, Reynolds was left alone in the interview room for several minutes. During that time, Reynolds appeared to say to himself, \"Why did you open your mouth like that?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Cynthia Beisser, M.D., a deputy coroner with the Lucas County Coroner's Office, testified that the victim died as a result of a stab wound to the right side of his neck. She opined that an incision on the victim's finger appeared to be defensive in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Detective Eycke gathered evidence and took pictures at the railroad tracks and Reynolds' home. Eycke observed evidence of an \"attempt to clean the blood off the wall in the victim's bedroom.\" She also testified that the sheet that was between Reynolds' mattress and box spring appeared to have been hidden there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Based upon information learned during the autopsy and from Reynolds' interview, Detective Eycke returned to the house a second time, with a second warrant. Investigator Hahn instructed the detective to look for a bloody coat and the murder weapon. This time, she found the black hooded coat that Reynolds referenced during his interview. It was covered in blood in the victim's closet, \"buried\" under other clothes. She also went looking for a knife, which she found in a kitchen strainer. Neither the blade nor the handle was blood-stained, but trace amounts of blood were found where the blade met the handle. Eycke also secured and photographed the inside of the recycle bin, which had blood at the bottom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Test results from the Bureau of Crime Investigations showed that the blood on the knife belonged to the victim. Also, a forearm swab of blood taken from Reynolds contained the victim's DNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Following the interrogation, Reynolds was arrested. The Lucas County Grand Jury indicted Reynolds on two counts of murder: aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A) and 2929.02 and felony murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B) and 2929.02.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Over the course of the next several months, Reynolds' mental health deteriorated, and he was taken to Twin Valley Behavioral Healthcare, a state institution located in Columbus, Ohio. On August 6, 2014, the trial court found Reynolds not competent to stand trial, based upon his treatment records at Twin Valley. The court also ordered that Reynolds be placed on forced medications. Six months later, on March 18, 2015, the court found that Reynolds was competent, based upon the opinion of Aracelis Rivera, Psy.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Reynolds entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. A bench trial took place over four days, beginning on December 7, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 28} During the course of the trial, the state called the five state officials previously identified. The defense called John Fabian, Psy.D., J.D., who opined that Reynolds was not guilty by reason of insanity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 29} In rebuttal, the state put forth its own expert, Dr. Rivera. Both experts are highly qualified, with years of experience in evaluating criminal defendants for the purpose of a not guilty by reason of insanity (\"NGRI\") defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    The Medical Experts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The experts agree that, at the time of the offense, Reynolds was suffering from a severe mental disease. They also agree with the diagnosis of \"schizoaffective disorder\" which includes the primary diagnosis of schizophrenia but also includes, in Reynolds' case, bipolar disorder. In Dr. Fabian's words,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   He has manic states, and these states are acute where an individual has racing thoughts, racing speech, disorganized speech, lots of activity, hypertalk, hyperactivity, irritability, and often one is manic with schizoaffective disorder, they would be psychotic at the time of those manic states. So, not only are they high with energy and disorganized and thinking and talking a mile a minute, acting fast, pressured thoughts, speech and behaviors, but also having, again, the hallucinations and delusions where they are activity psychotic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 31} While there is no dispute that Reynolds suffered from schizoaffective disorder at the time of the offense, the experts differ as to whether Reynolds understood the wrongfulness of his act, that is, whether Reynolds was not guilty by reason of insanity. Their respective opinions are discussed in greater detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Dr. Fabian's Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The defense expert, Dr. Fabian, evaluated Reynolds 13 months after the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Dr. Fabian noted that Reynolds has suffered from a mental disease since at least 2001, at the age of 21, when he was discharged from the United States Navy because of his mental illness. He began receiving Social Security Disability benefits based upon his mental illness at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Dr. Fabian found significant a letter written by Reynolds from the county jail in the days prior to the offense. The letter is non-sensical and directs others to kill sons of former world leaders. Dr. Fabian opined that the letter reflects \"delusional thinking and cognitive disorganization and evidence of mental illness\" just days prior to the offense. After his arrest, Reynolds authored three more letters to the trial court, all of them entered as exhibits, that indicate Reynolds' delusional thinking continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 35} During the evaluation, Reynolds told Dr. Fabian that, at the time of the offense, a witch told him to \"whup his ass.\" As he stabbed the victim, the voices encouraged him, saying \"yeah, yeah.\" Those voices also told him to bring the victim's body back to his own room and to dispose of him on the railroad tracks. Reynolds believed that the victim could possibly rape him and/or hurt his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 36} In his 24-page report and while testifying, Dr. Fabian identified many \"goal directed behaviors\" that suggest Reynolds \"knew the wrongfulness of his acts.\" Those actions cited by Dr. Fabian include: moving the body, hiding the body, covering the body, rinsing off the knife, washing his hands, changing his clothes, and hiding the body on the tracks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 37} On the other hand, Dr. Fabian also noted that Reynolds reported that \"many of these [same actions] were in part due to hearing voices * * * which would be due to psychotic symptoms.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Dr. Fabian concluded that \"this is a close call case\" and that the ultimate issue should be resolved \"by the trier of fact.\" For his part, he opined that \"there was at least some partial evidence that [Reynolds] did not know the wrongfulness of his acts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    Dr. Rivera's Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 39} The state's expert, Dr. Rivera, testified that Reynolds' conduct after killing the victim was indicative of \"goal-directed behavior and that perhaps [he] was trying to get rid of possible incriminating evidence in the case.\" She explained that individuals who are unaware of the wrongfulness of their conduct,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   do not go to the length of getting a knife, washing a knife, moving a body, covering a body, putting them in the\n   trash can, dragging them and disposing of the body, because they don't know that they have done anything wrong. So, why engage in that behavior? Someone who is psychotic and disorganized is likely to just leave the knife where they found it, leave the body where it was, and perhaps not even change clothing because they are oblivious of what they have done. There is no need for them to conceal what they have done because they don't know that they did anything wrong. They are disorganized, the behavior is random, it is not linear, it is not goal-oriented.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Unlike Dr. Fabian, Dr. Rivera detected no psychotic motive when she evaluated Reynolds. That is, Reynolds did not tell Dr. Rivera that he had heard voices commanding him to harm the victim, as he had told Dr. Fabian. Dr. Rivera denied that this alleged psychotic motive, as reported by Dr. Fabian, should cause her to change her opinion. As she explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [Reynolds] did not provide a psychotic motive to me when I interviewed him. But most significantly, he neither provided a psychotic motive during the police interrogation that took place within hours of the index offense. What was significant is that he changed the story.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Finally, Dr. Rivera denied that Reynolds could have been \"floridly psychotic\"-i.e. in the throes of full-blown psychosis-at the time of the offense but nonetheless appear \"calm, cooperative [and] polite\" and \"be able to answer questions, follow directions\" during the police interview only 24 hours later. She testified, \"Someone who is totally out of control because of [his] psychosis is not going to be able to conform their behavior [24 hours later] in particular during such a stressful process * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Dr. Rivera concluded that Reynolds understood the wrongfulness of his conduct at the time he killed the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    The Verdict and Sentence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Following the bench trial, the trial court rejected Reynolds' insanity and self-defense arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 44} The court found Reynolds guilty of Count 2, that Reynolds had proximately caused the victim's death in the commission of a felony offense of violence (felonious assault). The court made no finding with regard to the allied murder charge set forth in Count 1. It sentenced him to fifteen years to life in prison, to be served in a prison psychiatric unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 45} The court appointed appellate counsel, who filed an appeal on Reynolds' behalf. Reynolds asserts two assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   1. Reynolds' conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence because he proved the insanity defense by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   2. Trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to suppress Reynolds' statements in the interrogation on grounds of involuntariness due to mental illness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    Manifest Weight of the Evidence Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 46} In the first assignment of error, Reynolds argues that the conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence because the evidence demonstrated that he is not guilty by reason of insanity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 47} In determining whether a verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence, we sit as a \"thirteenth juror.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Reynolds had a paranoid, delusional belief that [the victim] attempted to sexually assault him when [the victim] walked around naked and squeezed his butt. Reynolds psychotically believed that it was necessary to defend himself and that it was not wrong to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 50} In further support, counsel cites the state's expert, arguing \"Dr. Rivera agreed that if [the victim] did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   try to rape Reynolds, then Reynolds' 'motive was delusional' and indicative of insanity.\" (Emphasis added.) On this point, the experts agree, although Dr. Fabian stated it differently. He said, \"[i]f [Reynolds] did in fact respond in a self-defensive manner and kill the victim due to threats of rape, there may be some rational motive in the case.\" These are two sides of the same coin, meaning that if the victim did, in fact, threaten Reynolds, then Reynolds' response was rational, not psychotic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 51} The record supports the conclusion that Reynolds attacked the victim because he felt threatened. According to him, the victim walked into his room, naked, in the middle of the night, and touched his buttocks. Reynolds then \"karate chopped\" the victim 20 times in the neck and dragged the victim's body to his room. The blood trail from Reynold's room to the victim's room, and the fact that the victim's body was naked when found by police, both support Reynolds' story. Thus, if the threat was real, the experts agree that Reynolds, when he attacked the victim, may have been acting out of a fear that the victim was going to assault him, rather than in response to some \"paranoid homosexual conspiracy.\" We find that the evidence supports the trial court's conclusion that Reynolds acted without a psychotic motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Next, Reynolds points to references he made during his interrogation, where he stated that he was a \"premier\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   and \"an ambassador.\" Indeed, thirty minutes into the interview, Reynolds announced to Detective Hahn that he was \"an Italian premier.\" He also twice described himself as an \"ambassador.\" Reynolds argues that these statements indicate that he was criminally insane at the time of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 53} The experts, and the trial court, noted that Reynolds displayed some delusional thinking before, during and after the interrogation. In considering all of the evidence, however, the trial court concluded-and this court agrees-that while Reynolds may have exhibited some signs of delusional thinking, it was outweighed by other, clear evidence of lucidity, appropriateness and an understanding of wrongfulness. In the trial court's own words,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   The Court also notes that the defendant provided no psychotic motives during the interview with police and did not provide any psychotic motives to Dr. Rivera. Why is that important? Dr. Rivera observed what this Court observed. I watched that tape, and I watched it while it was played in court and subsequent to. * * * [T]he interview at the police department * * * was in close proximity to the time of death. * * * This Court did not observe throughout the entire two plus hours of the video interview of [Reynolds] anything that would suggest that he was suffering at least from a mental disease or defect at the time, or even when [Reynolds] began to articulate what he had done * * *. There was nothing about his articulation of those events that this Court could convincingly and compellingly hang its hat on with respect to whether or not he knew the wrongfulness of his acts at the time of the assault on the victim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   There were a number of things throughout that video interview of [Reynolds] this Court observed, many of which have already been articulated in open court. Oriented to time and place, responsive to questions, with the exception to, and this Court concedes, at the beginning of the conversation there was a very brief, very faint, very slight reference to something about a premier and something about an ambassador. Everything else-there was no other time, no other comments that the Court observed that would have been strange, for lack of a better word, or inconsistent with a person who was operating of their own free will and fully understanding the wrongfulness of their acts. There was no reference to witches or voices during this interview, nothing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Finally, like Dr. Rivera and the trial court, this court also finds significant that Reynolds took steps after the offense to avoid detection, by washing the knife, hiding clothes, concealing the body, and cleaning up blood. Reynolds' \"goal oriented\" behavior indicates that he appreciated right from wrong. Indeed, efforts by a defendant to conceal his crime indicate an understanding of wrongfulness.\n   <em>\n    State v. Myers,\n   </em>\n   10th Dist.

The law is clear: the touchstone of an involuntary confession is police misconduct and the defendant's mental condition is merely one factor in the totality of the circumstances to be considered in determining constitutional voluntariness.\n   <em>\n    Hughbanks\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61. The defendant's mental illness may, however, play a more significant role in the \"voluntariness\" calculus in instances where \"[t]he police exploited this weakness with coercive tactics.\"\n   <em>\n    Connelly\n   </em>\n   at 164-65,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213196\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/157/#p164\">\n    107 S.Ct. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the focus of the court's analysis should always remain on the central issue of whether the police \"overreached\" by using improper interrogation techniques.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 70} Here, Reynolds does not allege that the police exploited his mental illness by eliciting either his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver or subsequent confession through coercive tactics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 71} Instead, Reynolds claims that the detectives should have terminated the interview after he told them that he was schizophrenic, took Risperal, and had not had any in a while, and because he occasionally referred to himself as a \"premiere\" and an \"ambassador\" during the interview, which demonstrates some delusional thinking. But, as discussed, a suspect's mental illness, standing alone, is insufficient to render either a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver or subsequent confession involuntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 72} A similar argument was made in\n   <em>\n    State v. Hughbanks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"149262\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/99/365/\">\n    99 Ohio St.3d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003-Ohio-4121\">\n    2003-Ohio-4121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20N.E.2d%201081\">\n    792 N.E.2d 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 50-66. In\n   <em>\n    Hughbanks,\n   </em>\n   the defendant was brought in for questioning on a ten year old, unsolved murder case. During the initial interview, the police advised the defendant of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. The defendant told the police that he had \"conferred with a psychiatrist off and on\" over the years. The interrogation lasted several hours, during which he did not confess. He was then given his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights again and given a polygraph test which proved to be inconclusive. A week later, following the defendant's consent and additional\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, another polygraph test was given. During the pretest interview, the defendant disclosed that he had an extensive psychiatric history, though he\n   had received no treatment or medication in the last year or two. Following the second test, the defendant admitted to the double murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 73} On appeal, the defendant argued that because the police knew that he was mentally ill, they should have consulted a psychiatrist before any further questioning to find out whether his decision to waive his rights and answer police questions was \"truly voluntary.\" Alternatively, he claimed that the police should have found him a lawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 74} Relying on\n   <em>\n    Colorado v. Connelly,\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court of Ohio rejected the argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   The police officers were not required to consult a psychiatrist or have [the defendant] evaluated by a psychiatrist to ensure that his waiver of rights and his statements were the product of his free will. * * * The police officers never subjected [him] to threats of physical abuse or deprived him of food, sleep, or medical treatment. Moreover, the police interview and polygraph testing * * * lasted only several hours. We find no evidence of police coercion or overreaching that might show [the defendant's] confession to be involuntary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61, 63.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 75} Similarly here, we find that the police had no obligation to discontinue their interview of Reynolds because he was mentally ill, and their failure to do so did not impact the voluntariness of the waiver of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights or his subsequent confession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 76} This court's review of the record reveals no evidence of police coercion or overreaching: the videotaped interview demonstrates that the detectives always spoke to Reynolds in a calm and clear manner, they never threatened Reynolds or raised their voices, and they provided Reynolds with food and water at various intervals. In addition, the interview and forensic testing lasted less than three hours, which given all other circumstances was not an unreasonable length of time. Although detectives encouraged Reynolds throughout the interview to tell them what really happened, \"admonitions to tell the truth made by police officers are considered neither threats nor promises and are permissible.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Worley\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2001-T-0048,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002-Ohio-4516\">\n    2002-Ohio-4516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%202022742\">\n    2002 WL 2022742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 171. Finally, Reynolds remained alert, responsive, and lucid throughout the entire interview; there was nothing objectively apparent from his demeanor that should have alerted the detectives that he was incapable of understanding either the nature of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights or the consequences of his waiver of those rights. Indeed, Reynold's own expert, Dr. Fabian, testified that Reynolds \"was not internally preoccupied\" and described Reynolds as \"well-mannered,\" \"responsive,\" and \"appropriate.\" Dr. Rivera concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 77} In sum, after considering the totality of the circumstances, we find that Reynolds' waiver of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and subsequent confession to the police were constitutionally voluntary. Reynolds therefore does not demonstrate that the trial court would have suppressed the statements he made to police had his counsel filed a motion to suppress. Accordingly, trial counsel was not ineffective. Reynolds' second assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b6 78} On consideration whereof, we find that Reynolds was not prejudiced or prevented from having a fair trial, and the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Pursuant to App.R. 24, Reynolds is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Arlene Singer, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   James D.
