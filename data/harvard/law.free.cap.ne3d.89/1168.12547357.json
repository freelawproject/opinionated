It appears, however, that the recordings are not available to Tavares or his counsel. Although the Commonwealth is under no obligation to produce any postconviction discovery unless it is ordered to do so under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (4), as appearing in\n      <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20Mass.%201501\">\n       435 Mass. 1501\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2001), it is difficult to see any harm to the Commonwealth in producing a new copy of material it previously produced.\n     </p>\n    </footnote>\n    <div type=\"majority\">\n     <p id=\"p-8\">\n      Paulo Tavares appeals from a judgment of the county court denying his petition for relief under G.

Before trial, Tavares successfully moved to suppress evidence of surreptitiously recorded conversations between him and a confidential informant. We affirmed the suppression order on the Commonwealth's interlocutory appeal.\n      <em>\n       Commonwealth\n      </em>\n      v.\n      <em>\n       Tavares\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4271055\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/459/289/#p303\">\n       459 Mass. 289\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 303,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=945%20N.E.2d%20329\">\n       945 N.E.2d 329\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2011). After he was convicted, Tavares moved for a new trial and for postconviction discovery of copies or transcripts of the recorded conversations.\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n      The trial judge denied both motions. Tavares's appeal from his convictions and from the denial of his posttrial motions is pending in this court and has not yet been briefed. In his G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition, Tavares sought relief from the denial of his motion for postconviction discovery. A single justice of this court denied the petition as well as a subsequent motion for reconsideration.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      <em>\n       Judgment affirmed\n      </em>\n      .\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
