The defendant is Battery Park City Authority (BPCA). BPCA was established by the State Legislature as a public benefit corporation to redevelop blighted areas in lower Manhattan and to expand the supply of safe and sanitary housing for low-income families (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Public Authorities Law \u00a7\u00a7 1971, 1973[1] ). Plaintiffs initially brought claims between 2006 and 2009 alleging that they developed a host of illnesses as a result of their exposure to harmful toxins at BPCA-owned properties in the course of their cleanup duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, in July 2009, the District Court dismissed plaintiffs' claims, together with hundreds of other similar claims against BPCA, on the grounds that the plaintiffs did not serve BPCA with timely notices of claim (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-e ; Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1984 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The legislature responded to these dismissals by enacting Jimmy Nolan's Law, which became effective September 16, 2009 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   L. 2009, ch. 440). The law amended the General Municipal Law to provide, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, including ... section fifty-e of this article ... any cause of action against a public corporation for personal injuries suffered by a participant\n   in World Trade Center rescue, recovery or cleanup operations as a result of such participation which is barred as of the effective date of this subdivision because the applicable period of limitation has expired is hereby revived, and a claim thereon may be filed and served and prosecuted provided such claim is filed and served within one year of the effective date of this subdivision\" ( General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-i[4][a], as added by L. 2009, ch. 440, \u00a7 2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The effect of the law was to revive the plaintiffs' time-barred causes of action for one year after its enactment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Many of the 9/11 cleanup workers whose claims had previously been dismissed, including plaintiffs, served new notices of claim on BPCA within the one-year revival period prescribed by Jimmy Nolan's Law. BPCA moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Jimmy Nolan's Law was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the State Constitution (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   N.Y. Const., art. I, \u00a7 6 ). Upon due notice, the Attorney General intervened to defend the constitutionality of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of BPCA and held that Jimmy Nolan's Law was unconstitutional as applied (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re World Trade Ctr.

A public benefit corporation is \"a corporation organized to construct or operate a public improvement wholly or partly within the state, the profits from which inure to the benefit of this or other states, or to the people thereof\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 66[4] ).

In addition, \"[a]lthough created by the State and subject to dissolution by the State, these public corporations are independent and autonomous, deliberately designed to be able to function with a freedom and flexibility not permitted to an ordinary\n   State board, department or commission\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Plumbing, Heating, Piping &amp; A.C.

We have therefore understood the primary utility of public benefit corporations as twofold: to \"protect the State from liability\" and to \"enable public projects to be carried on free from restrictions otherwise applicable\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 423,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=185%20N.Y.S.2d%20534\">\n    185 N.Y.S.2d 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=158%20N.E.2d%20238\">\n    158 N.E.2d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In this context, we have sometimes described public benefit corporations as \"enjoying an existence separate and apart from the State, its agencies and political subdivisions\" (\n   <em>\n    Schulz,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4431549\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/84/231/#p244\">\n    84 N.Y.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   246 n. 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4431549\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/84/231/#p244\">\n    616 N.Y.S.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4431549\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/84/231/#p244\">\n    639 N.E.2d 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [collecting cases] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   These properties, however, do not bring public benefit corporations outside of the scope of our capacity rule. It is true that much of our analysis in\n   <em>\n    City of New York\n   </em>\n   rested on the \"historical fact\" that municipalities are \"mere[ ] subdivisions\" having no \"right to contest the actions of their principal or creator\" (\n   <em>\n    City of New York,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4438481\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/86/286/#p289\">\n    86 N.Y.2d at 289-291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4438481\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/86/286/#p289\">\n    631 N.Y.S.2d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4438481\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/86/286/#p289\">\n    655 N.E.2d 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). However, our capacity rule is not a stilted axiom governing the position of the parts to the whole, or the relationship between the State as principal and its subdivisions as agents. Rather, as discussed above, it is nothing more than a commonsense presumption of legislative intent, informed by practical concerns about judicial overreach. The features that arguably render public benefit corporations something more than mere subdivisions, namely, the separation of \"their administrative and fiscal functions from the State\" (\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

German authorities arrested Gutmann and deported him to a concentration camp; it was later learned that he was murdered there. Between May 14 and May 22, 1940, only days after the invasion, his New York brokerage firm executed a series of unauthorized securities transactions on his account. It was not until the liberation of the Netherlands in 1945 that a curator was appointed under Dutch law to administer Gutmann's assets. After the unauthorized transactions were discovered in 1946, the administrator of Gutmann's estate filed suit in 1948, but because the suit commenced more than six years after the cause of action accrued, it was barred by the statute of limitations.

The law in effect in 1938 provided that an employee who contracted an occupational disease and then left his employer was not entitled to compensation unless the disease was contracted \"within the twelve months previous to the date of disablement\" (L. 1931, ch. 344). In 1946, the legislature \"recognized that it was unjust to apply this general rule to a disease like caisson disease which was of a slow-starting or insidious nature,\" and therefore amended the law to exclude \"compressed air illness\" from this time limitation (L. 1946, ch. 642) (\n   <em>\n    McCann,\n   </em>\n   282 App.Div. at 446-447,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20N.Y.S.2d%20509\">\n    123 N.Y.S.2d 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In 1947, the legislature also amended the then-governing statute of limitations so that claims for slow-starting diseases could be commenced \"within ninety days after disablement and after knowledge that the disease is or was due to the nature of the employment\" (L. 1947, chs. 77, 624).

No such deprivation is at issue where a defendant seeks merely to cut short the time during which a plaintiff may sue. A defendant has no separate vested right in the timing of a lawsuit or the final date upon which a plaintiff may seek relief.

That rule would appear to be no barrier to enactment of claim-revival laws. The standard is easily met. It is not difficult to establish that a statute is \"a reasonable response.\" Indeed, every time this Court has considered the issue in the past it has upheld the legislature's claim-revival statute as a proper response to the problem the legislature sought to address\n   (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1970664\" index=\"466\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/238/271/\">\n    238 N.Y. at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"467\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=144%20N.E.%20579\">\n    144 N.E. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Gallewski,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2080326\" index=\"468\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/301/164/#p174\">\n    301 N.Y. at 174-175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"469\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20N.E.2d%20620\">\n    93 N.E.2d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Matter of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCann v.

Instead, and appropriate to its position in our democratic system of government, the judiciary will defer to the legislative determination of what constitutes an injustice precisely because \"there is no principled way for a court to test whether a particular injustice is 'serious' or whether a particular class of\n   plaintiffs is blameless; [and] such moral determinations are left to the elected branches of government\" (majority op. at 400, 67 N.Y.S.3d at 562, 89 N.E.3d at 1243).\n   Just as has been true every other time the Court has considered the constitutionality of a claim-revival statute, the rule announced by the majority will result in a finding that the statute does not deprive the defendant of due process. Rather than have a court attempt to balance policy considerations that are in fact consigned to the legislature, I would resolve the question directly and recognize the obvious: unless it impinges on a separate vested property right and not merely the hope of avoiding litigation, a claim-revival statute does not violate due process, because defendant has no fundamental right to a statute of limitations in perpetuity.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    As a general rule, the Court considers only those arguments raised by the parties or which arise by necessity in our analysis of the questions explicitly presented. These limitations are grounded in prudential concerns closely connected with the consideration of concrete cases and controversies. However, here we are not deciding the appeal of a case, subject to our usual jurisdictional and reviewability limitations. Instead, we are presented with a certified question from the Second Circuit, which it has invited us to reformulate as we deem appropriate. Thus, this case does not raise the usual prudential concerns that arise when we pronounce on issues not properly developed below or by the parties.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    Moreover, the argument I advance here is hardly novel or in need of greater prior elaboration. As the majority's comprehensive discussion of our case law makes abundantly clear, the constitutionality of claim-revival statutes has been before us on several earlier occasions, and each time this Court has discussed the Supreme Court's Fourteenth Amendment analysis. I do no more here. We are in no way disadvantaged by deciding the applicability of the federal rule now, when it is obvious the Court is already well familiar with the issues, our constitutional standards, and the federal analysis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-102\">\n   WILSON, J. (concurring).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   I subscribe fully to the Court's answer to the second certified question. I write separately because I do not view the first certified question as involving an issue of \"capacity,\" even though a few of our decisions describe it that way. Nor do I view it as a question of when a public benefit corporation should be treated as if it were the State. The question, as I see it, is whether and under what circumstances a public benefit corporation can challenge a legislative act as unconstitutional. That is not a question of capacity, which has a firm and long-standing legal meaning relating to the binary ability to sue and be sued (or not), but of the power of a legislatively-created entity to challenge an action of its creator. The answer to that question is derived from the structure of government and the roles of the coordinate branches. We have most often articulated that doctrine not as one of capacity, but of \"standing\" or \"power,\" which comes closer to describing the forces at work here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The general presumption that legislatively created entities cannot challenge acts of the legislature derives from \"the supreme power of the Legislature over its creatures\" (\n   <em>\n    Black Riv.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Regulating Dist. v.

That presumption is rooted in the structure of government; legislatively-created entities, such as public benefit corporations, are subservient political entities. An entity's power is given by the legislature, and \"[h]ow long it shall exist or how it may be modified or altered belongs exclusively to the people to determine\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"480\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20N.E.2d%20428\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"480\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20N.E.2d%20428\">\n    at 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"481\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20N.E.2d%20428\">\n    121 N.E.2d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Accordingly, it is the rare case when the entity may challenge an act of the legislature. Admittedly, our decisions have not always been\n   clear in terminology; from time to time, we have muddied the waters.

Whether a governmental entity may sue to challenge a governmental action could properly be thought of as one of general justiciability, but equally could be expressed as one of standing, which is the way most of our decisions have framed it. Standing has two components: a jurisdictional component, so that if a party suffers no injury, it may not sue; and a prudential component, involving \"rules of self-restraint,\" which includes the determination that a party is well-situated to bring an action on its own or on behalf of another (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Society of Plastics Indus. v.

Indeed, the issue here is as much one of justiciability as of standing:\n   in the ordinary case, the judiciary would not interfere in a legislative decision to eliminate, modify or impair an entity of its own creation. It is not our function to second-guess the wisdom of legislation that adversely affects only a legislatively-created entity. The majority explains that the rationale for the so-called \"capacity bar\" reflects concerns of \"judicial restraint\" and \"governmental and public policy,\" and that the \"capacity bar closes the courthouse doors to internal political disputes between the State and its subdivisions.\" Those principles, by their own words, implicate standing and justiciability, not capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   I would tackle the certified question in stages.

Those cases do not relate to the power of public benefit corporations to sue or be sued, or under what circumstances they might be able to challenge an act of the State.

First, the general rule is that a legislatively-created artificial\n   entity cannot challenge an action of the legislature, because that entity is a creature of the legislature, the legislature is vested with lawmaking authority, and the legislature may abolish or alter its creatures at will (\n   <em>\n    see Black Riv.\n   </em>\n   at 487,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"549\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20N.E.2d%20428\">\n    121 N.E.2d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"The number and nature of (the regulating district's) powers are within the State's absolute discretion and any alteration, impairment or destruction of those powers by the Legislature presents no question of constitutionality\"] ). In that sense, those subordinate legislative creations have no cognizable injury resulting from legislative action, because our system of government vests the lawmaking power in the legislature, not to be challenged by subordinate entities, whether those are municipalities, public authorities, public\n   benefit corporations, or otherwise. Second, there are circumstances in which the general rule can be overcome. Those fall into two basic categories: (A) when the State Constitution grants a right specific to the subordinate governmental unit, that unit may challenge legislative action as violative of the specific constitutional grant to it (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Town of Black Brook v.

In category (B), the concerns animating prudential standing come into play: there must be some actual injury to the subordinate governmental entity, but that alone is not sufficient; the courts must determine as a matter of prudence whether it is appropriate for the entity to bring the suit, taking into account the strong presumption that legislatively-created entities cannot challenge legislative actions (\n   <em>\n    see Black Riv.\n   </em>\n   at 488,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"556\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20N.E.2d%20428\">\n    121 N.E.2d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"The concept of the supreme power of the Legislature over its creatures has been respected and followed in many decisions\"] ) and the \"general prohibition on one litigant raising the legal rights of another\" (\n   <em>\n    Society of Plastics,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4418497\" index=\"557\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/77/761/#p772\">\n    77 N.Y.2d at 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"558\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=570%20N.Y.S.2d%20778\">\n    570 N.Y.S.2d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"559\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20N.E.2d%201034\">\n    573 N.E.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Generally, if the third parties are the better-suited litigants, then the entity would not have standing to sue. However, sometimes the entity will be the better-suited litigant, and standing doctrine allows suit in those instances. In this regard, the inquiry is necessarily case-specific, and could be characterized as \"particularized.\" Even the consideration of the applicability of the majority's four exceptions drawn from\n   <em>\n    City of New York\n   </em>\n   is case-specific-as is each of our prior decisions and of the decisions of the lower courts. Those same factors would figure into the determination if the issue was framed as one of justiciability rather than standing: a claim by a legislatively-created entity purporting to challenge a statute should not be justiciable if there is no specific constitutional guarantee to that entity and the only injury is to the entity itself, or the injury is to some third party who is better suited to bring the claim on its own behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Our case that best encompasses the above structure is\n   <em>\n    Patterson v. Carey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"560\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20N.Y.2d%20714\">\n    41 N.Y.2d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"561\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=395%20N.Y.S.2d%20411\">\n    395 N.Y.S.2d 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"562\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=363%20N.E.2d%201146\">\n    363 N.E.2d 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977). The Jones Beach Parkway\n   Authority raised the parkway toll from 10\u00a2 to 25\u00a2, and the State enacted legislation repealing the toll. The Jones Beach Parkway Authority and the trustee for bondholders sued the State, challenging the legislation as unconstitutional. Although the decision does not expressly delineate between plaintiffs and claims, the structure of the decision does so quite clearly. As to the claims that the legislation unconstitutionally impaired the Authority's finances and with it, the value of the bonds, we were silent as to the impairment\n   of the Authority's finances, focusing exclusively on the bondholders' rights when finding the statute unconstitutional (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 720-722,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"563\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=395%20N.Y.S.2d%20411\">\n    395 N.Y.S.2d 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"564\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=363%20N.E.2d%201146\">\n    363 N.E.2d 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In contrast, when addressing the claim that the legislation's restriction on the State Comptroller's procedures for auditing the Authority encroached on the Comptroller's constitutional authority, we focused exclusively on the Authority's claim (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 723-725,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"565\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=395%20N.Y.S.2d%20411\">\n    395 N.Y.S.2d 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"566\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=363%20N.E.2d%201146\">\n    363 N.E.2d 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Implicitly, we determined that the Authority did not have standing to pursue the claims relating to impairment of its finances, though the bondholders did, and the Authority had sufficient standing to challenge the statute's restriction of the Comptroller's auditing powers, because the Authority was affected by the restrictions and well-suited to challenge them. The majority, too, understands\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   as a decision about standing, not capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The four exceptions set out in\n   <em>\n    City of New York\n   </em>\n   are an application of the above principles in the context of municipal corporations, which-unlike public benefit corporations-have constitutional protections running directly to them. For that reason, however unlikely it is that a county, city, town or village would be able to challenge a legislative action, the possibility that a public benefit corporation would be able to do so is substantially more remote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <em>\n    C.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Unlike the majority, I would accept the Second Circuit's invitation to provide \"specific guidance ... as to the appropriate result of the inquiry in this particular case\" (\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    World Trade Ctr.

It is uncommon for the Second Circuit to suggest that we provide guidance as to the proper disposition of a case before it, but in this case, the Second Circuit's suggestion makes eminent sense. The legislature made a choice, in the wake of an unprecedented terrorist attack, to extend the statute of limitations\n   for claims brought by first responders. The questions here purely concern New York public policy surrounding relief efforts in the wake of that attack-including what future first responders might expect from the legislature; the structure of New York State government; and the power of the New York State Legislature. Those are not in any sense federal questions, and relate powerfully to New York's status as a sovereign state. As implicitly recognized by the Second Circuit's invitation, New York State has an overriding interest in deciding the lawfulness of Jimmy Nolan's Law, which indisputably complies with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   I cannot speak for the majority. Whether thought of as \"capacity,\" \"justiciability\" or \"standing,\" I believe the clear result here is that the BPCA may not challenge the constitutionality of Jimmy Nolan's Law. No constitutional protection runs directly to the BPCA entitling it to\n   avoid claim-revival statutes, the BPCA does not seek to vindicate the constitutional rights of others and, even if it did, there is no showing that it would be better situated to vindicate those rights than the third parties would be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Chief Judge DiFIORE and Judges RIVERA, STEIN, FAHEY and GARCIA concur, Judge RIVERA in a concurring opinion; Judge WILSON concurs in a separate concurring opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Following certification of questions by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and acceptance of the questions\n   by this Court pursuant to section 500.27 of this Court's Rules of Practice, and after hearing argument by counsel for the parties and consideration of the briefs and the record submitted, first certified question answered in the negative and second certified question, as reformulated, answered in accordance with the opinion herein.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Although it might be tempting to read\n    <em>\n     Hooker\n    </em>\n    as suggesting that counties have capacity to sue in their proprietary role but not in their governmental role, that reading is unsatisfactory, because counties can be sued in their governmental role, and can sue private citizens while acting in their governmental role.\n    <em>\n     Hooker\n    </em>\n    must be understood in its jurisdictional posture, where this Court, constrained to answer the question posed by the Appellate Division without the ability to reformulate it to remove the word \"capacity,\" \"assumed that by the question submitted it is intended that this court shall determine whether the county has capacity to maintain the\n    <em>\n     particular action\n    </em>\n    stated in the complaint\" (\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2365084\" index=\"571\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/204/1/\">\n     204 N.Y. at 9\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"572\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20N.E.%20403\">\n     97 N.E. 403\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [emphasis added] ).
