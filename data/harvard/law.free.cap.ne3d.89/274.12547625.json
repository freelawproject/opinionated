For the reasons set forth below, this Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 1998, Ms. Nader and Elie Abboud were married and the owners of real property located at 470 Boston Road, in Hinckley, Ohio. They executed a promissory note and home equity line of credit, which were secured by mortgages on the real property. In 1999, they transferred title of the real property to the Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In 2006, Malek Abboud, brother to Elie Abboud and brother-in-law to Ms. Nader, executed an Unconditional and Continuing Guaranty as to the credit line. Ms. Nader and Elie Abboud divorced in 2007. In 2008, Ms. Nader and the Trust executed two Assumption and Modification Agreements, one for the promissory note and one for the credit line. Elie Abboud did not sign either of the Assumption and Modification Agreements. As a guarantor, Malek Abboud consented to the Assumption and Modification Agreement of the credit line by Ms. Nader and the Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In October 2010, Ms. Nader and the Trust defaulted on the promissory note, the credit line, and the Assumption and Modification Agreements for both. The Bank filed a complaint for breach of contract, breach of guaranty, and foreclosure against Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud. They responded with a counterclaim and third-party complaint asserting claims for breach of contract and fraud. Three months later, the Bank filed an amended complaint, adding Elie Abboud as a defendant. Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud answered the amended complaint and reasserted their\n   counterclaim and third-party complaint. In response to the Bank's summary judgment motions on their claims, Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud dismissed their counterclaim and third-party complaint. The Bank then dismissed Elie Abboud. Only the Bank's amended complaint against Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud remained pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court granted the Bank's motion in limine to preclude evidence of the amount due arising prior to and contemporaneous with the signing of the modification agreements. Additionally, the trial court sua sponte struck the jury demands of Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud and denied their motions for leave to refile the counterclaim and motion to join indispensable party. The trial court proceeded to grant summary judgment and enter a decree of foreclosure in favor of the Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud have timely appealed, raising six assignments of error for this Court's review. To facilitate the analysis, this Court will address the assignments of error out of order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 5\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING APPELLEE'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellate courts consider an appeal from summary judgment under a de novo standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

Thus, they argue this omission constitutes a failure of a condition precedent and renders the amended complaint fatally defective. The Bank did not respond to this specific assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Paragraph 21 of the open-ended mortgage securing the promissory note states, in pertinent part \"Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration following Borrower's breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument[.]\" Paragraph 13 of the open-ended mortgage securing the credit line similarly states\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [u]pon Borrower's breach of any provision of this Mortgage or if a default shall occur under the Agreement, Lender, upon notice to Borrower, may * * *, declare all the sums secured by this Mortgage to be immediately due and payable, [and] foreclose this Mortgage by judicial proceeding * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Accordingly, prior to accelerating the balance due on the promissory note and the credit line and filing an action to foreclose the mortgages, the Bank was required to give the borrowers, Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Elie Abboud, notice of their default and opportunity to cure the default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The record reflects, and Ms. Nader and the Trust do not dispute, that she and the Trust were served with notice of default. However, the record is void of any notice issued to Elie Abboud. This, however, does not render the amended complaint fatally defective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The promissory note specifically permits the Bank to \"enforce its rights under this Note against each person individually or against all of us together.\" Similarly, the credit line states \"you and the joint Account holder each promise to pay and are jointly and individually responsible for all amounts due on the joint Account.\" Additionally, the Assumption and Modification Agreements for both the promissory note and the credit line indicate \"[i]n all other respects, all terms and conditions of the Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect[.]\" Accordingly, the Bank is permitted to sue either one or both of the borrowers under the promissory note, the credit line, and the Assumption and Modification Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 16} At the time of the summary judgment motion, Elie Abboud was not a named party. The Bank voluntarily dismissed him five months earlier, thereby electing not to enforce its rights against Elie Abboud. Because the Bank was not pursuing an action for default on the promissory note or the credit line against\n   Elie Abboud, there was no requirement to give him written notice of default. The Bank was only pursuing an action against Ms. Nader and the Trust and did provide written notice of default to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Based upon the review of the record, Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud failed to meet their\n   <em>\n    Dresher\n   </em>\n   burden of establishing the existence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding the condition precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Enforceability of Assumption and Modification Agreements\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud assert three separate arguments as to why the Assumption and Modification Agreements are unenforceable:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   1) the Assumption and Modification Agreements were unilaterally modified;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   2) the Assumption and Modification Agreements are unenforceable pursuant to R.C. 1303.15 ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   3) the Assumption and Modification Agreements are unconscionable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As discussed below, Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud failed to meet their\n   <em>\n    Dresher\n   </em>\n   burden of establishing the existence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding the enforceability of the Assumption and Modification Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1.\n     <em>\n      Unilateral Modification\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 19} \" 'A contract cannot be unilaterally modified.

In this case, the Bank chose to enter into Assumption and Modification Agreements with Ms. Nader and the Trust, and not Elie Abboud. Ms. Nader and the Trust agreed to enter into the Assumption and Modification Agreements. Because the terms of the promissory note and the credit line allowed the Bank to work either jointly or individually with the borrowers, the Bank did not need to include Elie Abboud in order to have mutual consent for a modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.\n     <em>\n      R.C. 1303.15\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud argue that R.C. 1303.15 provides them with a defense to their financial obligations under the Assumption and Modification Agreements. R.C. 1303.15 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Subject to applicable law regarding exclusion of proof of contemporaneous or previous agreements, the obligation of a\n   party to an instrument to pay the instrument may be modified, supplemented, or nullified by a separate agreement of the obligor and a person entitled to enforce the instrument, if the instrument is issued or the obligation is incurred in reliance on the agreement or as part of the same transaction giving rise to the agreement. To the extent an obligation is modified, supplemented, or nullified by an agreement under this section, the agreement is a defense to the obligation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   They claim to have executed the Assumption and Modification Agreements only because of the explicit assurances of Mr. Male, a representative of the Bank, that Elie Abboud would have to approve the Assumption and Modification Agreements and he would still be liable for the debt. Under their theory, Mr. Male's assurances modified the terms of the Assumption and Modification Agreements. And because Mr. Male's assurances were not satisfied, the Assumption and Modification Agreements are unenforceable against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud's reliance on R.C. 1303.15 in this instance is misplaced. The statute precludes the use of parol evidence to establish the facts in such a situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The Ohio Supreme Court explains the parol evidence rule as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   a principle of common law providing that a writing intended by the parties to be a final embodiment of their agreement cannot be modified by evidence of earlier or contemporaneous agreements that might add to, vary, or contradict the writing. The rule operates to prevent a party from introducing extrinsic evidence of negotiations that occurred before or while the agreement was being reduced to its final written form, and it assumes that the formal writing reflects the parties' minds at a point of maximum resolution and, hence, that duties and restrictions that do not appear in the written document * * * were not intended by the parties to survive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (Internal citations and quotations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Bellman v.

She graduated from high school in 1975. She obtained her teaching degree from The College of Wooster in 1979 and her law degree from Cleveland Marshall Law School in 1982. She continued to take courses in education to renew her teaching license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 34} While Ms. Nader never held herself out to the public as an attorney, she performed divorces, prepared wills for people, incorporated a business, and did immigration and workers' compensation work. Since 2008, she has worked for the family business in the human resources department handling health insurance and workers' compensation matters and attending hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 35} While she is an attorney, she did not setup the Trust. However, she testified that the Trust existed for Elie Abboud \"to group all the properties together\" and that her children are the successors to the Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Ms. Nader argues she had no involvement with any of the business transactions or family expenses. She explained that Elie Abboud handled all of the financial matters and she did not ask any questions. Then in 2006 her brother-in-law, Malek Abboud, took over the financial matters and her sons became involved in 2010. She and Elie Abboud divorced in 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Despite these claims, Ms. Nader acknowledges that she signed the promissory note and the credit line in 1998 with Elie Abboud. She understood the promissory note was \"to finish the house\" and the credit line was for the businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Ms. Nader also testified that she was aware that the home was heading toward foreclosure in late 2007. She began questioning Malek Abboud about the financial circumstances surrounding the promissory note in 2007. She also contacted the Bank in late 2007 and early 2008 for\n   documents regarding the promissory note and the credit line and questioned the amounts due on the accounts. The Bank sent Ms. Nader a letter in January 2008 regarding her inquiry as to a loan modification for the promissory note and the credit line. Also, during this time she learned that there was a third lien on the home held by MEMO, a company with which Elie Abboud conducted business. She contacted MEMO to inquire about the lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 39} On June 2, 2008, Ms. Nader and Malek Abboud had a meeting with Mr. Male, a representative of the Bank, to discuss a modification of the promissory note and the credit line. This meeting was approximately five months after she received a letter regarding the Bank's proposed payment terms for a modification. Ms. Nader understood the purpose of the loan modification was to \"allow [her] to get caught up on the mortgages, reduce the payments, and remain in [her] home.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 40} At the meeting, Ms. Nader read the Assumption and Modification Agreements prepared by the Bank. She claims the Bank had paperwork stating Elie Abboud was to be released from the promissory note and the credit line. She told Mr. Male \"he couldn't do that.\" She described her discussion with Mr. Male on this topic as \"a really big disagreement.\" Based on the terms of the divorce decree, she objected to Elie Abboud not being listed on the documents and to any release by the Bank of him from these debts. In fact, she had brought a copy of the divorce decree to the meeting \"to show [Mr. Male] that Elie was to stay on there. And [she] kept telling him no.\" She insisted that Elie Abboud sign the Assumption and Modification Agreements and not be released from the debts. Ms. Nader avers that she and Malek Abboud signed the Assumption and Modification Agreements only after Mr. Male agreed to her terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Contrary to Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud's position, Ms. Nader's lack of knowledge and involvement in the financial transactions of the family and the businesses prior to 2007 does not create a great disparity in bargaining power. The record reflects Ms. Nader had knowledge of the promissory note and the credit line, took action to investigate and challenge the balances of these accounts and a newly discovered lien, took steps to obtain a modification of these notes, and challenged the language and terms of Assumption and Modification Agreements and got the Bank to agree to her demands prior to signing the documents. She came prepared to the meeting and actively engaged in the meeting via discussions, reading documents, and presenting documents. Additionally, five months lapsed from the time she received the letter offering a modification to the time that she signed the modification. Thus, she had time to explore other options to address the impending foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Further, Ms. Nader has been an attorney since 1982. While her legal experiences do not include financial or business transactions, she understood the importance of a foreclosure action and the ramifications of a divorce decree on financial obligations. While Ms. Nader and Malek Abboud were not represented by an attorney during this transaction, she nonetheless applied her legal and negotiating skills to effectuate the modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Based on the totality of the circumstances, Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud failed to carry their burden to show procedural unconscionability.

Under the terms of the Assumption and Modification Agreements, the Trust and Ms. Nader \"assum[ed] and agree[d] to pay said indebtedness\" listed therein. As to Malek Abboud, the guarantor, the Assumption and Modification Agreements stated \"[t]he undersigned * * *, hereby consent[s] to the foregoing loan modification.\" The language regarding the amount of the unpaid balances and the agreement to pay/guaranty the debts is unambiguous and contains the signators' intentions: Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud agreed to pay the unpaid balances stated in the Assumption and Modification Agreements.

He argues a determination as to his obligations, independent of Elie Abboud's obligations, would create a risk of inconsistent obligations as to Malek Abboud pursuant to Civ.R. 19(A)(2)(b). He also argues any liability found against him is subject to subrogation against Elie Abboud and requires joinder under Civ.R. 19(A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 56} The terms of the Unconditional and Continuing Guaranty executed by Malek Abboud in 2006 with respect to the credit line expressly contradict both of his arguments. The Guaranty contains a provision specifying that the Bank may elect to proceed against either Malek Abboud, Elie Abboud, or both of them:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   [The Bank] shall not be obligated to proceed against, or exhaust any other remedies it may have under the Note [credit line] or any of the Loan Documents, or resort to any other security held by [the Bank] prior to enforcing the obligations of [Malek Abboud] hereunder. The obligations of [Malek Abboud] hereunder are independent of the obligations of [Elie Abboud], and a separate action or actions may be brought against [Malek Abboud] whether or not action is brought against [Elie Abboud] and whether or not [Elie Abboud] is joined in any such action or actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   This provision renders Malek Abboud's obligations under the credit line separate and distinct of Elie Abboud's obligations under the credit line. Thus, Elie Abboud's obligations under the credit line do not need to be determined independently before the Bank can obtain judgment against Malek Abboud under the Guaranty. Accordingly, Elie Abboud is not an indispensable party to this action pursuant to Civ.R. 19(A)(2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 57} As to his claim for subrogation, the Guaranty specifically indicates Malek Abboud has waived such rights against Elie Abboud:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   [Malek Abboud] hereby waives and relinquishes any right to subrogation or other right or claim to payment against [Elie Abboud] or [Elie Abboud's] estate arising out of or on account of any sum paid or agreed to be paid by [Malek Abboud] under this Guaranty, whether such right or claim is liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured or unmatured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Based on this provision, Malek Abboud has no rights to subrogation against Elie Abboud. Accordingly, Elie Abboud is not an indispensable party to this action pursuant to Civ.R. 19(A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Further, Malek Abboud's argument is misplaced because he relies upon the wrong financial documents in his request to join Elie Abboud. Malek Abboud states in his brief, \"Elie is a maker of the original\n   <em>\n    promissory note\n   </em>\n   \" and references the \"note\" in the remainder of the argument. (Emphasis added.) However, the Bank's amended complaint sought judgment\n   against Malek Abboud as a guarantor of the credit line and not the promissory note. As the Bank was not seeking judgment against Malek Abboud as to the promissory note, Malek Abboud's request to join Elie Abboud based on that instrument is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Based on the express language of the Unconditional and Continuing Guaranty, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Malek Abboud's motion to join Elie Abboud as an indispensable party. Malek Abboud's fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 3\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN OVERRULING THE MOTION OF [DEFENDANTS]-APPELLANT[S] RUTH S.

Ms. Nader and the Trust, timely filed an answer and counterclaim to the complaint. On September 16,\n   2011, the Bank sought and was granted leave to amend the complaint. Ms. Nader and the Trust timely filed an answer and counterclaim to the Bank's amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 66} The case was pending for 27 months, during which time the parties engaged in extensive discovery disputes related to the counterclaims that escalated to the point of the trial court appointing a special master to handle the disputes. On January 24, 2014, after the resolution of the discovery disputes, the Bank filed a motion for summary judgment against Ms. Nader and the Trust as to their counterclaims. In lieu of filing a response, Ms. Nader and the Trust filed a Civ.R. 56(F) motion seeking additional time to respond because the parties planned on taking depositions at the end of February. The trial court granted them an additional two months, until April 24, 2014, to respond to the Bank's summary judgment motion. On the date of the new response brief deadline, Ms. Nader and the Trust dismissed the counterclaims without prejudice in lieu of filing a response brief. This dismissal rendered the Bank's summary judgment motions moot. From June 2011 to August 2014, Ms. Nader and the Trust were represented by Attorney Gold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 67} Three months after the dismissal of their counterclaims, Ms. Nader and the Trust, retained new counsel, Attorney Potash. During the next eight months, a number of legal issues were addressed. The trial court granted Plaintiff's motion in limine to exclude all \"evidence at trial concerning information and negotiations originating prior to or contemporaneous with the execution of the Modification Agreement[s] regarding different amounts owed on the Promissory Note and the Home Equity Line of Credit than those amounts agreed to in the Modification Agreement[s].\" Additionally, the trial court struck the jury demands of Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud. They moved the trial court to reconsider the decision to strike their jury demands and a hearing was held. That motion was held in abeyance pending the ruling on other motions. Also, the Bank dismissed Elie Abboud from the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b6 68} On April 8, 2015, Attorney Aten appeared in the case as the third attorney for Ms. Nader and the Trust. Attorney Potash was discharged as their counsel on April 14, 2015. Attorney Aten filed a motion for leave to reinstate their counterclaim. The motion, which has been restated verbatim in the appellate brief, moves for leave to essentially refile the counterclaim in the original action because it is a compulsory counterclaim and res judicata would prevent them from asserting the claims in another proceeding. Ms. Nader and the Trust contend the previous counterclaim was dismissed by their first attorney without their knowledge or consent and without notice \"of the effect of the dismissal upon the scope of the evidence she would be permitted to introduce in support of her defense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 69} The trial court held a hearing on the motion on May 22, 2015. Attorney Aten readily admitted during at the hearing that they were seeking to refile the counterclaim in response to the trial court's adverse motion in limine ruling against Ms. Nader and the Trust:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   As to the fact that this is a\n   <em>\n    tactical reassertion\n   </em>\n   of the Counterclaim,\n   <em>\n    of course it is\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   If the claims before the Court don't put pre-2008 events at issue, then the motion in limine was properly granted.

Accordingly, Ms. Nader and the Trust's counterclaim was not \"[o]mitted\" as contemplated by Civ.R. 13(F), but instead filed and voluntarily dismissed pursuant to Civ.R. 41(C). They sought the ability to refile the previously dismissed counterclaim in the original case, which was still pending. While this is not an omitted counterclaim, Civ.R. 13(F), in conjunction with Civ.R. 15(A), provides a framework to consider whether a party should be afforded leave to file an amended answer and to refile a counterclaim in a pending original action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 72} In support their Civ.R. 13(F) motion, Ms. Nader and the Trust argue oversight, inadvertence, or excusable neglect with respect to Attorney Gold dismissing the counterclaim and the \"when justice requires\" provision because the counterclaim is compulsory and res judicata bars them from asserting the claims in another action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 73} The Bank focused on the lengthy pendency and procedural posture of the case in relation to the timing of the motion.

The counterclaim would reintroduce those issues into the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   {\u00b6 75} The trial court recognized the parties had engaged in disputed discovery concerning the counterclaims for 27 months. Ms. Nader and the Trust obtained extra time to respond to the summary judgment motion only to dismiss the counterclaim on the day their response was due. The case had been pending for almost three years when the counterclaim was dismissed and remained pending for another\n   year after the counterclaim was dismissed. And yet Ms. Nader and the Trust did not once argue to the court during that time that the counterclaim was improperly dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   {\u00b6 76} The trial court noted that Ms. Nader and the Trust had been through two prior attorneys during which time it issued adverse rulings against Ms. Nader and the Trust by way of the motion in limine and striking their jury demands. The timing of the motion for leave to reinstate the counterclaim was viewed as a mechanism to circumvent the adverse rulings. The trial court held the prior dismissal of the counterclaim in response to summary judgment, the passage of a year, and then the request to refile the counterclaim as the trial date neared to be prejudicial to the Bank as it would further delay a foreclosure action that had been pending for four years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   {\u00b6 77} While Ohio courts recognize a policy that cases should be decided on the merits, they also adhere to a policy that disputes be resolved in a timely manner. Based on the foregoing, this Court finds no abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying Ms. Nader and the Trust's motion for leave to refile their counterclaim. Their third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN GRANTING THE MOTION OF PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF PENNSYLVANIA TO STRIKE THE JURY DEMAND OF [DEFENDANTS]-APPELLANTS RUTH S.

Based on this Court's resolution of the third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error, this Court declines to address their first assignment of error as it has been rendered moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 6\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ENTERING JUDGMENT AGAINST APPELLANTS AND ISSUING A DECREE OF FORECLOSURE IN FAVOR OF APPELLEE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   {\u00b6 79} Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud stated the sixth assignment of error on page 1 of their brief, but made no arguments as to how the trial court erred when it entered a judgment and decree of foreclosure in favor of the Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   {\u00b6 80} App.R. 12(A)(2) states that \"[t]he court may disregard an assignment of error presented for review if the party raising it * * * fails to argue the assignment separately in the brief, as required under App.R. 16(A).\" \"An appellant bears the burden of formulating an argument on appeal and supporting that argument with citations to the record and to legal authority.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

While Ms. Nader, the Trust, and Malek Abboud listed the second assignment of error on page 1 of their brief, they failed to make any arguments regarding this assignment of error in their brief. Accordingly, the second assignment of error fails to comply with App.R. 16(A)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 82} Further, the second assignment of error is not properly before this Court because it involves a motion in limine. \"Ohio law is clear * * * that a ruling on a motion in limine may not be appealed and that objections to the introduction of testimony or statements of counsel must be made during the trial to preserve evidentiary rulings for appellate review.\"\n   <em>\n    Gable v.
