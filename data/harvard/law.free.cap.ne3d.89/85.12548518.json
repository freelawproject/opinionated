For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Procedural History and Substantive Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On March 4, 2015, Berube filed a complaint against Matthew Richardson, d.b.a. Tazmainian Repair, Inc., alleging violations of Ohio's Consumer Sales Protection Act (\"CSPA\"), breach of contract, breach of warranty, failure to perform in a workmanlike manner, civil action for damages, and negligence. Berube's complaint stems from Berube contracting with Richardson to make repairs to her home. Berube claims that Richardson failed to make the repairs for which he was hired, damaged her home, stalked her daughter, and engaged in certain misconduct while purportedly working on her home. Berube sought compensatory damages, treble damages, attorney fees and costs, and punitive damages. Berube's complaint also included a jury demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Richardson failed to answer the complaint or otherwise appear in the action,\n   and Berube moved for default judgment under Civ.R. 55. In her motion, Berube also requested a jury trial on the issue of damages. The trial court granted Berube's motion for default judgment, yet it denied her request for a jury trial and scheduled a hearing on damages. In denying her request for a jury trial, the trial court determined that Berube \"availed herself of the summary procedure\" of a default judgment under Civ.R. 55 and therefore \"subject[ed] herself to the requirements of [ Civ.R. 55 ], which gives the court discretion to either conduct a hearing on damages or allow Plaintiff to present the issue of damages to a jury for determination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On April 20, 2016, the court conducted a hearing on damages. At the hearing, Berube testified concerning the contract she entered with Richardson and the damages that she incurred. Thereafter, the court issued an order awarding Berube total damages in the amount of $70,376. In its order, the court stated that Berube established sufficient evidence of actual damages in the amount of $15,000. Having found that Berube established a violation of the CSPA, the court determined that she was therefore entitled to $45,000 treble damages. The court also found Berube established sufficient evidence of mental anguish and awarded her $5,000 in non-economic damages under the CSPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Additionally, the court found that an award of punitive damages were warranted, as the defendant's actions were \"egregious.\" However, finding that the defendant did not appear in the litigation, the court determined that there was \"little evidence of what degree of sanction would punish or deter him from similar action in the future.\" The court therefore found that the general aim of deterring the defendant from the actions that caused physical damage to the plaintiff's house and caused the plaintiff's mental anguish was sufficiently addressed by the treble damages awarded under the CSPA, and it awarded the nominal amount of $1 in punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Finally, in considering the plaintiff's request for attorney fees, the court noted that despite the fact that this was a default judgment hearing on damages, Berube and her counsel \"spent considerable time and effort\" in obtaining the proper service on the defendant and in researching the issues and presenting the evidence to the court for determination. Having found that Richardson knowingly committed actions that were in violation of the CSPA, the court awarded Berube $20,375 in attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Berube now appeals the judgment of the trial court, alleging that the court erred in rejecting her demand for a jury trial on damages. In the alternative, Berube claims that the trial court's award of $1 in punitive damages was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Law and Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In this case, we consider a complaining party's right to a jury trial on damages where the plaintiff has obtained a default judgment against a non-appearing defendant and has requested a jury trial. In so doing, we must necessarily reconcile the rights of a party in obtaining judgment under Civ.R. 55, and the discretion of the trial court exercised thereto, and the right of a party to a jury trial as preserved under Civ.R. 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} A default judgment may be entered against a defendant who has failed to answer or otherwise defend against allegations raised in a complaint.\n   <em>\n    Ohio Valley Radiology Assocs., Inc. v.

In holding that the defendant was entitled to a jury trial on damages, regardless of the fact that he did not dispute the issue of liability, the Tenth District found no ambiguity in the rules governing a party's right to a jury trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The Civil Rules are quite explicit that, once a jury demand has been made by any party, it cannot be withdrawn without the consent of all parties, and the trial must be by jury, even in the case of a trial on the issue of damages following the entry of a default judgment as to liability, unless all parties appearing for the trial consent to the withdrawal of the jury demand and trial to the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Here, there is no dispute that Berube made a timely jury demand (through her complaint and reasserted through her motion for default judgment), and that the damage resulting from the alleged negligence of a party, including punitive damages, is a \"triable issue\" under the rules. Additionally, all the parties have not consented to the demand's withdrawal, as Berube's renewed request for a jury trial demonstrates that she did not abandon her demand. As stated above, the rules explicitly mandate that once a jury demand is made by one party, it may not be withdrawn without the consent of all parties, regardless of the fact that default judgment had been entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The trial court, in attempting to balance a litigant's right to a jury trial with its own discretion in conducting default judgment proceedings, concluded that Berube availed herself of the summary proceedings of a default judgment under Civ.R. 55, and therefore, she subjected herself to the court's discretion to hold a hearing on damages. In so doing, the court distinguished prior case law in which the courts held that the trial court must allow a jury trial on damages where the defendant appeared in the action and made a\n   timely and proper jury demand. Here, the trial court concluded that because there was no appearance by the defendant and no contested issues in this matter, there was, essentially, no need for a jury trial. However, although the defendant in this case has not appeared in this action, nor contests liability or damages in any way, this fact does not strip Berube of her distinct right to a jury trial. Defendant's non-appearance should not dictate Berube's properly preserved fundamental constitutional right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 20} We recognize the diligence and thoughtful process followed by the trial court in conducting a fair hearing on damages, and we acknowledge the apparent impracticalities of a jury trial on issues that are not in dispute. We are, however, constrained to reverse the trial court's judgment on damages, because Berube's right under Section 5, Article I of the Ohio Constitution to a trial by jury is inviolate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

Berube's alternative assignment of error is therefore moot. This matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Judgment reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   KATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, A.J., and EILEEN A.
