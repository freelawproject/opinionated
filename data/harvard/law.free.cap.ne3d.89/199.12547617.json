For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The instant case was previously filed by the plaintiffs in Summit County Common Pleas Court,\n   <em>\n    Lytle v. Matthew\n   </em>\n   , Summit C.P. No. CV-12-02-0809. Carol, as Tracy's mother and as administrator of Tracy's estate, brought a wrongful death complaint against defendants, alleging that Tracy's death was the proximate result of the defendants' negligent failure to ensure that the medications prescribed to her did not pose a high risk of a negative drug interaction. Additionally, Carol asserted that Discount Drug Mart, Inc. (\"Discount Drug Mart\") was negligent in failing to follow proper protocols in dispensing Tracy's medication.\n   <em>\n    Lytle v. Mathew\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Summit No. 26932,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-1606\">\n    2014-Ohio-1606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201510178\">\n    2014 WL 1510178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In 2004, Tracy was injured in an automobile accident while in the course and scope of her employment. The injuries required her to receive medical and psychological treatment from various medical professionals. Tracy received temporary total disability benefits from the Bureau of Workers' Compensation (\"BWC\") related to her injuries. Grubb represented Tracy in her claim for BWC benefits. In February 2010, Tracy passed away from a heart attack. She was 37 years old. Prior to her death, Tracy and Grubb were under investigation for Workers' Compensation fraud. It was contended that Tracy was working for Grubb and receiving payments from Grubb while contemporaneously receiving BWC benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. In her January 2010 interview with the BWC Special Investigations Department, Tracy admitted that she worked for and was paid by Grubb and Grubb's law firm from December 2005-December 2007. Tracy stated that Grubb contacted her in regard to working at the law office and that she was reluctant to do so. Grubb informed Tracy that the BWC could not question why she was at her office because Grubb represents her on the claim. Tracy further stated that Grubb coached her on what to say if she was ever approached by the BWC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Defendants sought to depose Grubb and obtain certain documents from her related to Tracy's employment at her law firm. Defendants wanted to explore the possibility that stress from Tracy's involvement in the BWC fraud investigation caused or contributed to her death. Defendants' issued a subpoena directing that Grubb bring with her to the deposition \" '[a]ny and [a]ll records of employment of [Tracy] and any and all cancelled checks, bank ledgers, bank statements, or any other documents that relate to compensation to [Tracy] from Natalie F. Grubb or Grubb &amp; Associates, LPA.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Grubb filed a motion to quash the subpoena and a motion for a protective order. The motion asserted both that the materials sought to be obtained were irrelevant and that Grubb's conversations were protected by attorney-client privilege. Defendants opposed the motion maintaining that the subpoena was reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and that the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege applied. After a hearing and reviewing supplemental exhibits by Discount Drug Mart, the trial court found the material was relevant and that the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege applied. As a result, the court found that the conversations between Grubb and Tracy in furtherance of the crime or fraud were not privileged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. Grubb appealed from this order to the Ninth District Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Lytle\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Summit No. 26932,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-1606\">\n    2014-Ohio-1606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201510178\">\n    2014 WL 1510178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in issuing its ruling prior to giving Grubb the opportunity to respond to Discount Drug Mart's submission of supplemental exhibits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. Following the remand of the Ninth District Court of Appeals, defendants deposed Grubb and filed a joint motion to disqualify Grubb as counsel. The trial court held its ruling on the motion in abeyance pending its hearing with the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs appealed from this order in\n   <em>\n    Lytle v. Mathew\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Summit No. 27587. The appeal was dismissed by the Ninth District Court of Appeals for lack of a final appealable order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On remand, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case, without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In January 2016, plaintiffs filed the instant case against defendants in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court,\n   <em>\n    Lytle v. Mathew\n   </em>\n   , Cuyahoga C.P. No. CV-16-857637. Plaintiffs brought forth the same wrongful death cause of action against defendants, a negligence action against Discount Drug Mart, and an intentional tortious conduct action against all defendants. Plaintiffs allege defendants are responsible for Tracy's death because Tracy's treating physicians over-prescribed medication or failed to prevent potential deadly drug interactions. Plaintiffs further allege that Discount Drug Mart negligently filled the prescriptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In May 2016, defendants filed a joint motion to disqualify Grubb based on the same evidence and arguments in the Summit County Case. Plaintiffs filed a brief in opposition to defendants' motion. The trial court granted defendants' motion to disqualify in June 2016. The trial court found\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [s]ufficient evidence from defendants' joint motion, plaintiffs' brief in opposition, defendants' joint reply, and the exhibits attached thereto, to determine that no exception to the disciplinary rules applies to protect Attorney [Grubb] and her law firm from disqualification as counsel in this matter.

We agree. Grubb's testimony is necessary to defendants' theory that the stress of the criminal BWC fraud investigation was one of the factors that contributed to the cause of Tracy's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Grubb testified during her deposition that she does not know: (1) why the checks were made payable to Tracy; (2) if the checks were executed by Tracy; (3) who signed the checks on behalf of her law firm; or (4) whether Tracy forged Grubb's signature. She also claims that she did not have any conversations with Tracy regarding the BWC investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Defendants correctly maintain that Grubb's testimony is necessary and cannot be obtained elsewhere. Grubb's position as the principal of her law firm and her knowledge of and role in the BWC investigation of Tracy renders her testimony at trial necessary. Grubb is the only person who can explain her signature on the checks made payable to Lytle by\n   Grubb, and any conversations with Lytle regarding the BWC fraud investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Grubb's testimony in the instant case is not protected by the attorney-client privilege. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that the attorney-client privilege does not attach to conversations with clients that relate \" 'to some future unlawful or fraudulent transaction. Advice sought and rendered in this regard is not worthy of protection, and the principles upon which the attorney-client privilege is founded do not dictate otherwise.' \"\n   <em>\n    Squire, Sanders &amp; Dempsey, L.L.P. v.

Here, Tracy signed a written statement to the BWC Fraud Investigators admitting that she worked for Grubb while receiving BWC benefits. Both Tracy's admission to the BWC fraud investigators and Grubb's conviction for complicity to commit workers compensation fraud, demonstrate a factual basis that communications between Grubb and Tracy were in furtherance of a fraud or crime and the communications are not privileged under the crime-fraud exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Plaintiffs also contend that Grubb's disqualification will cause them a substantial hardship.

Here, Grubb did not present any evidence of specialized expertise. Additionally, the case has been refiled from Summit County so new counsel could have an opportunity to be involved early in the course of litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Plaintiffs further contend that neither Grubb nor the other attorney in Grubb's law firm have a \"personal interest\" conflict under Prof.Cond.R. 1.7 because her criminal case is concluded, the conviction has been expunged and the criminal record is sealed and her disciplinary case has been concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Prof.Cond.R. 1.7 provides that a lawyer may be required to stop representing a client if there is a substantial risk that the lawyer's ability to \"consider, recommend, or carry out an appropriate course of action for that client will be materially limited by the lawyer's * * * own personal interests.\" \"Depending on the circumstances, a lawyer's personal interest in testifying truthfully when called to do so under oath could create a conflict of interest with his client.\"\n   <em>\n    Akron v.

There is a substantial risk that Grubb's ability to represent her client would be compromised because of her own personal interests. This conflict of interest is imputed to all lawyers associated in Grubb's entire firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 25} For the foregoing reasons, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion when it disqualified Grubb and her law firm as plaintiffs' counsel. The trial court considered the ample evidence before it and recognized that Grubb's testimony is necessary and a conflict exists. We acknowledge that removing Grubb and her law firm is a drastic measure, but the trial court found it necessary in light of the ample documentation of this highly unusual situation through several court proceedings, both civil and criminal. Accordingly, the trial court's decision was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The sole assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   MELODY J.
