STEWART, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   ON RECONSIDERATION\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 1} A jury awarded plaintiff-appellant Stephanie Stewart, as mother and next friend of her son, plaintiff-child Alijah Jones, a combination of past and future economic damages, and non-economic damages in the amount of $14.5 million on their medical malpractice action against defendants-appellees MetroHealth Medical Center and Steven Weight, M.D. In post-trial proceedings, and over Stewart's objections, the trial court ordered statutory offsets of collateral sources for political subdivisions as required by R.C. 2744.05(B)(1) and damage caps on non-economic damages as required by R.C. 2744.05(C)(1). The court's offsets reduced the total award to $3.451 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In this appeal, Stewart argues that MetroHealth did not prove its political subdivision status as a predicate for asserting its right to statutory offsets. She also argues that because there were no interrogatories submitted to the jury from which it could be determined what amount of the damages award was an amount for lost wages as opposed to loss of services, the court had to speculate on the composition of the award and could not have determined MetroHealth's right to an offset to a reasonable degree of certainty. Stewart also maintains that the court misconstrued the evidence relating to both past and future economic damages and speculated on the jury's intent to award damages only on a life care plan to the exclusion of all other future damages components. Finally, Stewart raises an as-applied constitutional challenge to the enforcement of the collateral source setoffs, as well as constitutional challenges based on due process, equal protection, separation of powers, and the right to a trial by jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} MetroHealth raises a conditional cross-appeal, to be considered only in the event our disposition of Stewart's appeal reverses or modifies the court's order offsetting economic damages or limiting non-economic damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} We conclude that R.C. 2744.05 is constitutional in all respects. We also conclude that the court did not err by conducting a post-trial hearing to determine MetroHealth's right to a statutory offset. We do, however, conclude that the offset\n   ordered by the court was error. We reject in whole MetroHealth's cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I. The Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The jury's verdict and the damages it awarded resulted from a finding that Dr. Weight and MetroHealth failed to adhere to the applicable standard of care when managing Stewart's pregnancy and supervising the birth of her son. Those failures resulted in the child being born at 25 weeks by way of Caesarean section. The child suffers from cerebral palsy, developmental delays, and visual impairment. The medical experts agreed that Stewart's son will need 24-hour attendant care for the remainder of his life. The jury specified the damages award as follows: to the child-$500,000 for past economic damages, $5 million in non-economic damages, and $8 million for future economic damages; to Stewart-$1 million for non-economic damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Before trial concluded, MetroHealth filed a motion asking the court to conduct a post-verdict hearing to determine the amount of any collateral benefits to be offset from a jury award against it as required by R.C. 2744.05(B)(1). In post-trial motions, MetroHealth asked the court to enforce the $250,000 cap on non-economic damages pursuant to R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) and Stewart raised a constitutional challenge to both R.C. 2744.05(B)(1) and 2744.05(C)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} R.C. 2744.05(B)(1) states that if a claimant is entitled to receive or does receive benefits for injury or loss from insurance or other sources, \"the amount of the benefits shall be deducted from any award against a political subdivision recovered by that claimant.\" R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) states that \"damages that arise from the same cause of action, transaction or occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and that do not represent the actual loss of the person who is awarded the damages shall not exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars in favor of any one person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} After conducting a post-trial hearing on MetroHealth's motion, the court issued a written decision granting the motion. Under authority of R.C. 2744.05(C)(1), the court capped the child's $5 million non-economic damages award at $250,000 and likewise capped Stewart's $1 million non-economic damages award at $250,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The court considered two separate offsets for collateral sources as required by R.C. 2744.05(B)(1) : one for the child's $500,000 award for past economic damages; the other for his $8 million award for future economic damages. The court found, over Stewart's objection, that all of the child's past medical bills were included in the award for past economic damages. It reached this conclusion based on uncontradicted testimony from an expert who testified that neither Stewart nor the child had any out-of-pocket expenses because the medical bills had been paid in full by Medicaid and Social Security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The court ordered an offset of future economic damages for all medical expenses that the child would incur after his 20th birthday. It found it undisputed that the child would qualify for Medicare on his 20th birthday because of his father's disability, and that Medicare would pay all future medical expenses from that point in time forward. Looking only at the eight-year period between the child's age at the time of the post-trial hearing (12 years old) and his eligibility for Medicaid at age 20, the court concluded that the child could obtain medical insurance under the Affordable Care Act until he became eligible for Medicare. The court determined that the child's maximum expenses for the eight-year period would be $116,000: a maximum $8,000 per year premium for medical insurance and a yearly, maximum out-of-\n   pocket expense of $6,500. The court concluded that expenses allocated in the life care plan should be offset in their entirety (excepting costs for transportation, home care, and housing) and that the remaining amount should be offset by 80 percent to account for what Medicare would cover. After making these deductions, the court reduced the child's award for future economic damages to $2,951,291.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A. Statutory Offset\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In her first assignment of error, Stewart complains that the court erred by applying the damages cap and offset provisions of R.C. 2744.05 to MetroHealth because no immunity was available to attach to a political subdivision. Stewart argues that sovereign immunity-the concept that the state cannot commit a legal wrong and is immune from civil suit or criminal prosecution-applies only to the state of Ohio and not to political subdivisions. Noting that Section 16, Article I, of the Ohio Constitution states that, \"[s]uits may be brought against the state, in such courts and in such manner, as may be provided by law,\" Stewart maintains that the state waived immunity, but that waiver does not apply to political subdivisions due to R.C. 2743.01(B), which defines \"political subdivisions\" as municipal corporations and bodies politic \"to which the sovereign immunity of the state attaches.\" By Stewart's reckoning, if the state has waived immunity from suit, political subdivisions can have no immunity of their own because their immunity is based on the state's immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Stewart's argument is essentially taken from dicta in the lead opinion in\n   <em>\n    Butler v. Jordan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1287228\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/92/354/\">\n    92 Ohio St.3d 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=750%20N.E.2d%20554\">\n    750 N.E.2d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001).

[Chapter] 2744 unconstitutional despite the plurality's pronouncement in\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26 (collecting cases). Stewart has provided no compelling reason for us to depart from our precedent and that of other appellate districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Stewart next argues that MetroHealth failed to offer evidence at trial that it is a qualifying hospital under R.C. 2744.05. She maintains that not every hospital owned by the government is entitled to political subdivision status-that status attaches only if the county hospital commission is appointed pursuant to R.C. 339.14. According to Stewart, this was a fact that MetroHealth had the burden of establishing at trial and the court erred by accepting evidence from MetroHealth on the issue in a post-trial hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} R.C. 2744.05 applies to actions against \"a political subdivision\" to recover damages for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by an act or omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary function. A \"political subdivision\" is defined as, among other things, \"a county hospital commission appointed under section 339.14 of the Revised Code[.]\" R.C. 2744.01(F). R.C. 339.14(A) allows a board of county commissioners to appoint a hospital commission preparatory to establishing a general hospital or hospital facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The question of whether a political subdivision is immune from civil\n   liability is a question of law.\n   <em>\n    Conley v.

The statutory deduction for collateral benefits and application of damages caps is to be made by the trial court in post-trial proceedings. This conclusion follows from\n   <em>\n    Buchman v. Bd. of Edn.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1740289\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/73/260/\">\n    73 Ohio St.3d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=652%20N.E.2d%20952\">\n    652 N.E.2d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995), where the third paragraph of the syllabus states: \"[p]ursuant to R.C. 2744.05(B), future collateral benefits, to the extent they can be determined with a reasonable degree of certainty, are deductible from the jury's verdict against a political subdivision.\" The court's \"determination\" cannot occur until the jury has rendered a verdict including damages, so it is necessarily conducted post-trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} What is more, although non-binding, the lead opinion in\n   <em>\n    Buchman\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   understood that R.C. 2744.05 contemplated a post-trial proceeding in which evidence was presented \"both at trial and during the post-verdict collateral benefits hearing * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 275,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=652%20N.E.2d%20952\">\n    652 N.E.2d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Buchman\n   </em>\n   did so by noting that R.C. 2744.05(B) does not \"abrogate that aspect of the collateral source rule which provides that the 'receipt of [collateral] benefits is not to be admitted in evidence, or otherwise disclosed to the jury.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 270,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=652%20N.E.2d%20952\">\n    652 N.E.2d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Pryor v.

The text of R.C. 2744.05(B)(1) states that if a claimant receives or is entitled to receive benefits for injuries or loss, those benefits \"shall be disclosed to the court[.]\" Although the statute does not explicitly state who has the duty to disclose a claimant's receipt of benefits, the claimant, as the party in receipt of the benefits that might be subject to offset, would be in the best position to make disclosure to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 20} We also believe that R.C. 2744.05(B)(1) requires a post-trial proceeding because mandatory offset implicates the collateral source rule-the jury's knowledge that a political subdivision might be entitled to a statutory damages deduction could improperly affect its determination of damages. What is more, evidence going to a political subdivision's status at trial would be irrelevant to the underlying action. For these reasons, we hold that R.C. 2744.05(B) sanctions a bifurcated proceeding where the court, not the jury, decides the amount that must be offset from a damage award against a political subdivision for any benefits a claimant has received, or is entitled to receive, for a loss or injury. The nature of this statutory process is such that we reject Stewart's contention that the court erred by hearing \"new\" evidence when ruling on MetroHealth's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict in which it raised for post-trial hearing its entitlement to the R.C. 2744.05(B) offsets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 21} After the jury's verdict, MetroHealth asked the court to grant it judgment notwithstanding the verdict under\n   Civ.R. 50(B). A Civ.R. 50(B) motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict tests the legal adequacy of the evidence,\n   <em>\n    O'Day v. Webb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6712415\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/29/215/\">\n    29 Ohio St.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=280%20N.E.2d%20896\">\n    280 N.E.2d 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972), paragraph two of the syllabus, so it is based solely on the evidence produced at trial. MetroHealth did, in fact, raise substantive arguments in support of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, but in addition to those arguments, it sought to invoke the court's post-trial jurisdiction to commence the proceeding envisioned by R.C. 2744.05(B). It stated its intention to do so prior to trial. We express no opinion on whether using a Civ.R. 50 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is the most appropriate vehicle for seeking a statutory offset, but we acknowledge that the motion invoked the court's post-trial jurisdiction. And given that MetroHealth gave notice prior to trial that it intended to seek an offset of damages and the application of caps on non-economic damages, Stewart cannot complain that she was surprised by MetroHealth's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Regarding Stewart's argument against the court's ruling that MetroHealth was a political subdivision for purposes of R.C. Chapter 2744 immunity, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has recognized that MetroHealth is a political subdivision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Ohio Supreme Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Fed.%20Appx.%20779\">\n    156 Fed.Appx. 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 779 (6th Cir.2005). And other county hospitals have been recognized as political subdivisions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hall v. Mem. Hosp. of Union Cty.\n   </em>\n   , 3d Dist. Union No. 14-06-03,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006-Ohio-4552\">\n    2006-Ohio-4552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202535761\">\n    2006 WL 2535761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12 (noting that parties did not dispute that Memorial Hospital of Union County was a political subdivision). Stewart's argument rests on the technicality that MetroHealth did not prove its political subdivision status at trial, not on any assertion that MetroHealth is not actually a county hospital recognized as a political subdivision. Having concluded that the court can hear additional evidence at a R.C. 2744.05 post-trial hearing, the court did not err by concluding, post-trial, that MetroHealth is a county hospital and a political subdivision for purposes of R.C. 2744.05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Stewart next argues that the court failed to adhere to the strict\n   <em>\n    Buchman\n   </em>\n   standard of a \"reasonable degree of certainty\" when determining the extent to which future collateral benefits were deductible from the jury's verdict. She concedes that the court stated its findings in terms of a reasonable degree of certainty, but claims that it could not possibly have done so within the spirit of the law because the jury's award of future economic damages was not tested by interrogatories that apportioned specific categories of loss like lost wages or lost services. In other words, Stewart argues that in the absence of the jury breaking down how the damages were apportioned, the court could only guess at what amount of the general verdict was made up of damages covered by a collateral source, belying the court's assertion that those amounts subject to offset were proven to a reasonable degree of certainty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 24} When a political subdivision is found liable to pay damages caused by any injury resulting from an act or omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary function, R.C. 2744.05(B)(1) permits the court to offset from those damages future collateral benefits received by the claimant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   If a claimant receives or is entitled to receive benefits for injuries or loss allegedly incurred from a policy or policies of insurance or any other source, the benefits shall be disclosed to the court, and the amount of the benefits shall be deducted from any award against a political subdivision recovered by that claimant. No insurer or other person is entitled to bring an action\n   under a subrogation provision in an insurance or other contract against a political subdivision with respect to those benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"It is the political subdivision's burden to prove the extent to which it is entitled to an offset under R.C. 2744.05(B),\" but \"only to the extent that the loss for which it compensates is actually included in the jury's award.\"\n   <em>\n    Buchman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1740289\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/73/260/\">\n    73 Ohio St.3d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=652%20N.E.2d%20952\">\n    652 N.E.2d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995), at paragraphs four and five of the syllabus. Jury interrogatories are not required to quantify the categories of damages that make up the general verdict, although they are typically the \"most efficient and effective method\" of doing so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 270,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=652%20N.E.2d%20952\">\n    652 N.E.2d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B. Past Economic Loss\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The court completely offset the $500,000 award for past economic damages under R.C. 2744.05(B)(1) because testimony heard at the post-trial hearing showed that Stewart paid nothing out-of-pocket for the child's medical bills. Stewart argues that the court erred by relying on evidence not heard by the jury when deciding that the $500,000 award of past economic damages must be offset in full because they consisted of medical expenses that had been paid. She claims that MetroHealth should not have been allowed to present a registered nurse in the post-trial hearing to testify regarding the amount of the medical bills and that those bills were paid in full by Medicaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 26} We reject Stewart's contention for the reasons previously stated in our discussion of the scope of a R.C. 2744.05 hearing-the court had the ability to hear, post-trial, additional evidence on the question of whether benefits received by the plaintiff should be offset from any award against a political subdivision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In addition, we find no basis for questioning the amount of past economic damages that were subject to offset. During trial, Stewart offered into evidence an itemized statement of medical bills for past care totaling $518,633.75. Stewart testified at trial that her son's total medical bills were \"a little over $500,000\" and in closing argument, her counsel told the jury that past medical bills were \"somewhere around half a million dollars.\" The jury awarded $500,000. Although that amount did not match exactly with the itemized medical bills, the award was consistent with both Stewart's testimony and the amount trial counsel asked the jury to award. Tellingly, Stewart made no argument post-trial that the jury erred by failing to award her past economic damages consistent with her itemized medical bills, nor has she separately raised the issue on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Stewart now argues, however, that the court's decision to offset the entire $500,000 award for past economic damages fails to take into account that some aspect of the award might have included compensation for expenses incurred by Stewart and two relatives for the transportation and care of her son when taking him to out-of-town medical appointments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Stewart offered no evidence to document transportation and care expenses for her son and did not ask the jury to award damages for expenditures she and other family members incurred. The closing argument on the value of past economic damages consisted of this: \"[The child's] past medical bills. [Stewart] told you they're somewhere around half a million dollars.\" The court instructed the jury that it could award damages based on, among things, \"expenditures\" incurred as a result of the child's injury and loss. Based on the evidence presented, the court could be reasonably certain that the $500,000 award encompassed all of the\n   child's past economic damages requested by Stewart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Stewart also argues that MetroHealth waived its right to offsets under R.C. 2744.05(B)(1) by failing to offer evidence of what her son's medical providers accepted in full payment of what they billed. Conceding that \"the amount of paid medical expenses versus the amount billed is irrelevant to the set-off issue before this Court,\" appellant's brief at 16, Stewart nonetheless cites\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Stewart implies that MetroHealth had the obligation to minimize the child's past economic damages at trial, but\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   says nothing about that-it discussed what a jury \"may\" consider in evaluating the reasonable value of medical expenses. In other words, both the amount charged by medical providers and the amount accepted by those providers are admissible into evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at paragraph one of the syllabus. The question of what constitutes the reasonable value of medical care provided is left to the jury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   places the obligation on a defendant to offer evidence of the amount accepted in payment of medical care. In the typical medical malpractice action, the plaintiff will want to introduce evidence of the amount actually charged (usually the higher amount) while the defendant will seek to introduce evidence of the amount accepted by the medical care provider (usually the lower amount). That Stewart is now claiming that MetroHealth had the obligation to offer evidence of the amount accepted in full payment by the child's medical providers underscores her failure to offer that evidence herself at trial. In fact, her current argument is one that could have lowered the past economic damages award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The court correctly determined that the entire $500,000 award for past economic damages consisted solely of medical expenses. Stewart does not deny that those medical expenses were paid in full by other sources. There is no question that those payments were benefits for injuries or loss from \"any other source\" under R.C. 2744.05(B)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buchman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1740289\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/73/260/\">\n    73 Ohio St.3d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=652%20N.E.2d%20952\">\n    652 N.E.2d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995), at paragraph two of the syllabus (\"Social Security and Medicare benefits are the type of collateral source benefits contemplated by R.C. 2744.05(B).\") MetroHealth was entitled to a complete offset of the entire $500,000 award for past economic damages under R.C. 2744.05(B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   C. Future Economic Loss\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 34} At trial, Stewart's attorneys argued that her son's future economic damages consisted of two parts: (1) lost future income, and (2) expenses associated with a life care plan. An economist testified at trial that the amount of the child's lost income depended upon his level of education: if Stewart's son attended college but did not earn a four-year degree, he could have expected to earn between $2.3 million to $2.9 million over his statistical work life expectancy; if he only obtained a high school diploma, he could have expected to earn $1.7 million to $2.1 million over his work life expectancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The experts also proposed a \"life plan\" for the child's future care. The life plan was designed to predict the child's medical needs for the rest of his life specific to his brain injury and allocate the appropriate\n   financial resources to address those needs. The plan considered the child's need for medical surveillance (health maintenance), spasticity management (to relieve tightness in his joints), therapeutic modalities, counseling, case management, transportation, housing, equipment and supplies, and attendant care. These needs were assessed based on alternative scenarios for at-home and facility care. The child's economist found the present value of at-home care to be $4.3 million and facility care to be $8.2 million. The jury awarded $8 million for future economic damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 36} In its ruling on MetroHealth's motion to offset future economic damages, the court held that the $8 million in damages \"correspond to the same categories of future care recommended by Plaintiff's expert, [so] this court will not be left to speculate as to the damages that must be set off.\" On that basis, the court found that the entire $8 million award for future damages was subject to offset under R.C. 2744.05(B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 37} The court's findings are erroneous for two reasons. First, the court could not have concluded to a reasonable degree of certainty that the $8 million award for future economic damages was comprised of only the life care plan. The court failed to consider the possibility that at least some part of the $8 million award consisted of lost future wages. Secondly, the trial court accepted a setoff calculation in the life care plan that was incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Before addressing Stewart's arguments, we first address MetroHealth's assertion that Stewart cannot argue that the $8 million award may have contained a loss of future income component because she limited the scope of her claims for future economic damages \"to what can be fixed or what can be replaced with services or equipment or medication.\" MetroHealth argues that loss of future income is not something that can be \"fixed\" or \"replaced with services, equipment, or medication.\" We reject this assertion. During closing argument, counsel for the child asked the jury to award $8 million for the costs of future care and $2 million in lost income. In no sense did Stewart \"limit\" the request for damages to the cost of future care only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 39} The $8 million award for future economic damages closely corresponded to the dollar amount requested by Stewart under \"the same categories of future care recommended by Plaintiff's expert[,]\" so we understand why the court would conclude that the award consisted solely of damages for the life care plan. But to accept the court's finding that the award consisted entirely of future care forces the conclusion that the jury completely ignored uncontradicted evidence concerning the child's lost future income and decided to award nothing for that loss. While that could have been a possible outcome, it is just as likely that the $8 million award consisted of an amount for the life care plan and lost future income. The two life care plan options presented to the jury valued at-home care at $4.3 million and facility care at $8.2 million. While counsel for Stewart asked the jury to award $8 million for the life care plan, the jury may have assigned a middle value to the life care plan consistent with testimony by one of the child's experts who testified that the child would not necessarily have to enter facility care immediately, but was of the firm opinion that the child would have to enter facility care at some future point in time. That the possibility exists that the jury could have determined the amount of damages in that fashion takes the court's finding out of the realm of what is reasonably certain for purposes of offset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 40} The uncertainty present in apportioning the $8 million award is the\n   result of there being no interrogatories to determine the specific composition of the award for future economic damages. Of course, neither party was required to submit specific interrogatories, but a political subdivision like MetroHealth that makes it known it intends to seek a post-trial offset for collateral benefits chooses to forego offering specific interrogatories at its own peril. MetroHealth, as the party seeking an offset under R.C. 2744.05(B)(1), had the burden of showing its entitlement to offset.\n   <em>\n    Buchman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1740289\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/73/260/\">\n    73 Ohio St.3d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=652%20N.E.2d%20952\">\n    652 N.E.2d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995), at paragraph five of the syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Stewart argues that MetroHealth's failure to offer specific interrogatories in this case means that no offset whatsoever can be made. We implicitly rejected this argument in\n   <em>\n    Jontony v. Colegrove\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-5846\">\n    2012-Ohio-5846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=984%20N.E.2d%20368\">\n    984 N.E.2d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Dist.), where we considered a similar case in which a political subdivision sought an R.C. 2744.05(B)(1) offset of a $250,000 award for combined \"lost wages and loss of services.\" The political subdivision sought offset based on Jontony's receiving or being entitled to receive Social Security disability benefits that would exceed the jury award. Noting that the damages award did not apportion the specific amount allocated to either lost wages or loss of services, we held that the general jury award \"fail[ed] to sufficiently separate lost wages and loss of services to determine what amount the jury apportioned for 'lost wages' and 'loss of services.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50. We agreed, however, that evidence offered at trial allowed the trial court to determine lost wages from lost services given evidence that Jontony's expert testified to a specific dollar amount of lost services suffered by Jontony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53. That evidence permitted the trial court to deduct those lost services from the overall award, with the remaining amount constituting lost wages that could be offset by Social Security disability benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 42}\n   <em>\n    Jontony\n   </em>\n   dispels Stewart's contention that the failure to offer specific interrogatories means that nothing can be offset from the award of future economic damages, although it does support her contention that a failure to submit interrogatories reducing the constituent parts of an economic damages award to specific dollar numbers can be an impediment to offset. We found that Jontony offered proof of \"loss of services\"-a category of loss that was not subject to offset-in the amount of $210,141.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. We thus deducted that amount from the $250,000 award to find that the remainder-$48,849-could be attributed to lost wages and subject to offset.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Left unstated in\n   <em>\n    Jontony\n   </em>\n   was the amount of damages requested for loss of income in that case. This is important because a stated amount could have affected the offset. For example, suppose that in addition to the $210,000 requested for loss of services, Jontony asked for an additional award of $200,000 for loss of income, yet the amount awarded totaled $250,000. In this example, it could not be said with the same degree of reasonable certainty that the award for loss of services made up the bulk of the total damages award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 44} That hypothetical is similar to the fact pattern currently before us. We resolve the dilemma by considering the extraordinary statutory purpose behind R.C. 2744.05(B)(1) in conjunction with the consequences attendant to a political subdivision's failure to inquire into the specific composition of a damages award. R.C. 2744.05(B)(1) is extraordinary because the right to offset cannot be waived-if a claimant receives or is entitled to receive benefits for injuries or loss from any source, \"the benefits shall be disclosed to the court, and the amount of the benefits\n   <em>\n    shall be deducted\n   </em>\n   from any award against a political subdivision recovered by that claimant.\" (Emphasis added.) But the right to offset is contingent on there being an amount for a collateral benefit \"actually included in the jury's award.\"\n   <em>\n    Buchman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1740289\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/73/260/\">\n    73 Ohio St.3d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=652%20N.E.2d%20952\">\n    652 N.E.2d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995), at paragraph four of the syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 45} The award of $8 million for future economic damages could have contained, at a minimum, $1.7 million for loss of future income. That is the lowest amount for loss of income suggested by the child's economist. Stewart argues that the child should be entitled to a finding that the jury could have awarded as much as $2.9 million for loss of future income: that figure representing the highest amount for loss of income in the range set forth by the economist. As we previously noted, at trial, counsel for the child asked the jury to award $8 million for the life care plan and $2 million for lost wages. Counsel also stated to the jury that it could award more or less than the amounts requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 46} The parties agree that the child will not receive any qualifying benefits for loss of future income, so any amount that the jury could have awarded for lost wages is not subject to any setoff. We conclude that the court should have excluded at least $1.7 million in lost future income from its consideration of the amount to be offset pursuant to R.C. 2744.05(B)(1). Stewart's expert offered a range of possible income loss, and $1.7 million was the minimum amount offered into evidence. We come to the decision to exclude this amount from offset for two reasons: first MetroHealth did not contest any of the expert's calculations for lost future income; second, excluding from offset the minimum amount that the jury could have awarded based on the evidence best effectuates the statutory intent behind R.C. 2744.05(B)(1) to preserve fiscal resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Of course the jury could have awarded more than the $1.7 million based on the expert testimony. But it also could have awarded less based on counsel's proviso that the jury could award more or less than the amount requested. Without the benefit of jury interrogatories, neither Stewart nor MetroHealth can be heard to complain that the figure at which we have arrived should be any different. We therefore exclude $1.7 million from offset. The remaining $6.3 million would then consist of compensation for the life care plan and was subject to offset consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 48} The next question we consider is whether the court erred in its offset of the damage award for the life care plan. The court based its decision on the child's present and future access to Social Security/Medicare and Medicaid benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 49} In its post-hearing brief submitted to the court to, among other things, determine the offset of collateral benefits, MetroHealth presented the court with alternative proposals to reduce the award for future damages based on the life care plan options submitted by Stewart's experts. MetroHealth argued that the award for future economic damages should be setoff to $2,623,526; $2,974,217; or $2,951,291 because most of the cost for the child's future care will be paid for by Medicaid or private health insurance, and then by Medicare when he becomes 20 years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Stewart asserted that the size of the damage award in this case would affect her son's eligibility for Social Security or Medicaid and further lamented the uncertainty of social programs like Medicaid and Medicare being available in the future. It is true that Stewart's son's entitlement to future Medicaid benefits is complicated by the damages award-Medicaid is a needs-\n   based program and the multi-million dollar damages award would easily render him ineligible. However, at the hearing to determine setoffs, MetroHealth presented an expert who testified regarding the child's eligibility for health care benefits. In particular, the expert testified with regard to the potential of there being a Special Needs/Medicaid Set-Aside Trust set up to preserve the child's eligibility for Medicaid benefits. This trust would be created through the probate court and used for necessities and services for the child that are not provided by Medicaid. Upon the death of the trust beneficiary, Medicaid would be entitled to seek reimbursement for its services from the trust corpus. MetroHealth argued that establishing the trust for the child's future medical care is \"permissible and advisable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 51} While it is true that Stewart may seek to have the probate court establish this kind of special needs trust to preserve her son's eligibility for Medicaid, such a trust cannot be considered a benefit that her son is \"entitled to receive\" for purposes of R.C. 2744.05(B)(1). If Stewart seeks a special needs/Medicaid trust, the probate court can establish the trust if it determines that doing so is in the child's best interest. However, we find no authority for the proposition that, when determining statutory setoffs of collateral sources, the possibility or availability of a special needs/Medicaid trust, created to preserve Medicaid eligibility, is a benefit that a claimant who recovers damages for injuries caused by a political subdivision is\n   <em>\n    entitled\n   </em>\n   to receive: notably, MetroHealth cites to no such authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 52} The arguments about the continued eligibility for, or availability of, Medicaid are irrelevant however because the court did not fashion its ruling based on the child's continued eligibility for Medicaid. The parties agreed that upon reaching 20 years of age, Stewart's son would qualify for Medicare benefits, regardless of his financial need. R.C. 2744.05(B)(1) provides for offsets not on the basis of the amount of damages awarded, but on the claimant receiving or being entitled to receive benefits for injury or loss from \"any other source.\" For purposes of R.C. 2744.05(B)(1), those benefits exist in isolation from monetary eligibility requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 53} In determining the amount of the award that should be offset, the court chose the proposal submitted by MetroHealth that took into consideration three things: 1) that Stewart's son is indeed likely to become ineligible to continue receiving Medicaid benefits for his medical care until age 18 based on her award; 2) that upon reaching the age of 20, the child's medical expenses will be covered by Medicare; and 3) that medical coverage during any period of ineligibility for Medicaid or Medicare would be covered by the Affordable Care Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Stewart argues that the court erred by offsetting future benefits in this fashion because the continued viability of Medicare and the Affordable Care Act is subject to political whim, so it was not a benefit that could be said to be reasonably certain to exist in the future. While the vagaries of politics sometimes give rise to concerns about the continued existence of social welfare programs, Stewart gives no plausible basis for us to conclude that these programs will cease to exist in the near future.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Her argument attempts to show that the court could not determine, to\n   the requisite degree of reasonable certainty, MetroHealth's entitlement to an offset by casting doubt on the future of these programs. Accepting Stewart's argument at face value would effectively bar all offsets of this nature because of the possibility that government programs might, someday, end. Receiving, or being eligible to receive, such benefits are at the heart of R.C. 2744.05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 55} With the child's eligibility for Medicare benefits established starting when he turns 20, the court found that, in the eight-year period starting with the child's age at the time he received the damage award (12 years) and his eligibility for Medicare at age 20 that, even if the child was not covered by Medicaid during this interim period because the damage award rendered him ineligible, he could obtain health insurance from the federal government. The court determined that the maximum amount of the child's premium for health care would be $8,000 per year, with a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $6,500 per year. Multiplying those expenses over the eight-year period, the court determined that the most the child would spend in the eight-year period for medical expenses would be $116,000 ($8,000 + $6,500 x 8 = $116,000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 56} The court then recognized that some categories of the life care plan-those for transportation, home care, and housing-should be separated from the statutory offset in their entirety because they were categories of expenses that were not encompassed by the benefits the child would receive. And finally, the court determined that because \"Medicare covers 80% of customary and ordinary care,\" it proceeded to offset the remaining categories by 80 percent, thus awarding the remaining 20 percent\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to Stewart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 57} In our initial review of this case, we affirmed the trial court's setoffs and award for future care. Stewart filed an application for reconsideration calling to this court's attention the fact that the trial court erred by determining that Medicare would cover 80 percent of the cost for the category of attendant care at a facility because Medicare does not cover this category of care, and likewise calling to our attention that we made a mistake by affirming the trial court's determination. Upon further review, we agree with Stewart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 58} At the hearing for setoffs, one of Stewart's experts, who specializes in case management services for people with disabilities, testified that attendant care is the biggest component in the life care plan. Indeed, the cost for this category of care is the largest amount for all categories according to the cost allocations submitted by Stewart's economist. The expert testified that attendant care encompasses \"supervision\" and \"long-term care\" of a person. She further testified that, although Medicaid pays 100 percent for this category of care in a facility, Medicare does not cover it at all. This testimony was the only evidence the trial court had to consider for purposes of determining whether the amount allocated for attendant care should be offset. MetroHealth did not rebut this testimony. We therefore find that the trial court erred when it accepted the 80 percent reduction in the amount allocated for attendant care in a facility. The unreduced $6,374,639 allocated for facility attendant\n   care is hereby reinstated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   D. Constitutional Challenges\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 59} In her second assignment of error, Stewart raises a number of constitutional challenges to the application of R.C. 2744.05(B)(1) and (C)(1). She argues that R.C. 2744.05 violates due process; denies equal protection of the law; denies the right to a trial by jury; and that legislatively imposed remittiturs violate the doctrine of separation of powers. These challenges have been resolved in some context contrary to Stewart's position notably, in\n   <em>\n    Oliver v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co. Ltd.

However, when a tortfeasor is a political subdivision, that \"punishment\" is one meted out against all constituents of the political subdivision regardless of individual fault. For this reason, Stewart's argument that the public purse constitutes an \"insurance policy\" does nothing to advance the argument that R.C. 2744.05 violates substantive due process as applied to her. Whether a political subdivision can afford to pay the entire amount of a non-economic damages award says nothing about why a cap on non-economic damages violates due process as applied to her.

She complains that R.C. 2744.05 permits unfair and disparate outcomes where those injured by political subdivision tortfeasors have their non-economic damages capped at $250,000 while those injured by tortfeasors who are not political subdivisions have their non-economic damages capped at $500,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 71} Equal protection of the law is the constitutional guarantee that no person or group will be denied the protection under the law that is enjoyed by similar persons or groups.\n   <em>\n    Colgate v.

In our discussion of the procedure to be followed by the court when addressing an R.C. 2744.05(B)(1) claim for offset, we concluded that the statute requires a post-trial proceeding in which the court examines the benefits for injuries or loss that a plaintiff has received from insurance or any other source. This post-trial proceeding does not involve any alteration of the jury's award-the court merely examines the jury award to determine \"the extent that the loss for which it compensates is actually included in the jury's award.\"\n   <em>\n    Buchman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1740289\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/73/260/\">\n    73 Ohio St.3d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=652%20N.E.2d%20952\">\n    652 N.E.2d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at paragraph four of the syllabus. This offset is applied only to the extent that the court can find with a reasonable degree of certainty that collateral benefits are deductible from the jury's verdict against a political subdivision.

If the legislature does not usurp the role of the trier of fact by imposing damages caps, it cannot usurp the role of the trial judge by imposing damages caps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   E. Summary\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 84} To summarize our holding thus far with respect to the issues raised in the appeal: even though the jury returned general awards for future economic damages, the court could not assume for purposes of determining the statutory offset that the jury intended to disregard substantial and uncontradicted evidence going to the child's loss of future income and award damages for the life care plan only. Because loss of future income could have been a part of future economic damages, the court could not have determined to the requisite degree of certainty that the entire award should be offset. The evidence showed that $1.7 million was the minimum amount of lost wages that could have been awarded, so we add that amount to the award. Further, on reconsideration, we find that the trial court erred in offsetting by 80 percent the $6,374,639 cost for attendant care in a facility. Because this amount and the $1.7 million exceed the amount of the jury award, we hereby reinstate the original $8 million jury award for future damages. This amount, added to the $500,000 capped award for non-economic damages, brings the total award to $8.5 million. On remand, the court shall enter judgment accordingly. Stewart's remaining arguments are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   II. The Cross-Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 85} MetroHealth filed a \"conditional\" cross-appeal, asking us to consider its cross-assignments of error only in the event that we reverse or modify that part of the court's judgment granting its motion for offset of collateral benefits under R.C. 2744.05(B). Because we have modified the court's judgment with respect to future economic damages, we address the cross-assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 86} MetroHealth first complains that the court erred as a matter of law by denying its motion for a new trial. It raises three issues in this cross-assignment of error: that the court erred by determining that an unborn fetus has an independent claim for lack of informed consent; that the court erred by allowing Stewart to withdraw the videotaped cross-examination of MetroHealth's treating neonatologist after the parties agreed to preserve that witness's testimony by videotape; and that the judgment is against the weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 87} The first two issues asserted in this cross-assignment of error are raised under Civ.R. 59(A)(9) and complain that the court erred as a matter of law.

In\n   <em>\n    Diekman\n   </em>\n   , the First District Court of Appeals considered the dismissal of a viable fetus's informed consent claim premised on a doctor's use of forceps during the birthing process. The appellate court affirmed both the dismissal of the informed consent claim and the court's refusal to instruct the jury on informed consent, finding that the plaintiff offered no \"testimony relating to whether the appropriate standard of care required obtaining informed consent from an unborn for the use and application of forceps.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The court went on to note that the plaintiff \"has not provided, and we are not aware of, any statutory or common-law basis for an unborn to bring an informed-consent claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 93} We disagree with MetroHealth's argument that\n   <em>\n    Diekman\n   </em>\n   \"rejected\" a cause of action for an unborn child's claim for lack of informed consent. The primary holding in\n   <em>\n    Diekman\n   </em>\n   was that there was no evidence to support the claim even if it existed. The court of appeals thus bypassed any direct discussion of whether the informed consent claim existed. Its passing comment-that it was unaware of any statutory or common law basis for an unborn child's claim for lack of informed consent-was in the nature of a parenthetical, not a direct holding. That the court was aware of no statute or case decision that specifically acknowledged an unborn child's right to a cause of action for lack of informed consent is not the same as a definitive statement that the cause of action does not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 94} MetroHealth also argues that in\n   <em>\n    Hester v.

It maintains that a physician does not owe an unborn child any duty to inform and the child's claims in this case are nothing more than medical malpractice claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   {\u00b6 107} It seems to us that it is MetroHealth that is conflating causes of action in this case. As in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , there are two givens under Ohio law: unborn, viable children have the legal right to seek redress for injuries caused\n   <em>\n    in utero\n   </em>\n   and there is an independent tort claim based on the lack of informed consent. These\n   givens lead to the question of whether an unborn, viable child can bring an independent claim for lack of informed consent when the child's mother grants consent\n   <em>\n    on behalf of the child\n   </em>\n   based on information provided to her. We answer that question in the affirmative because if the cause of action exists for a child, it must exist both prenatally and postnatally. And if an unborn, viable child has the general right to seek redress for injuries suffered\n   <em>\n    in utero\n   </em>\n   , the cause of action for lack of informed consent must also be available to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   {\u00b6 108} MetroHealth argues that the duty to inform is not divisible between a mother and a child\n   <em>\n    in utero\n   </em>\n   , but fails to explain why there should be a different rule for injuries suffered\n   <em>\n    in utero\n   </em>\n   versus those suffered postnatally. We do not understand MetroHealth to argue that a child has no viable claim for a lack of informed consent occurring after birth. Assuming the injury occurred at an age where the child lacked the legal ability to consent, it would be the child's parent or guardian who gave consent. But at all events, it would be an injury done to the child because the parent or guardian is merely the conduit through which the child's consent flows. Both Stewart and her son have similar, but independent, claims for lack of informed consent. The court did not err by allowing the jury to consider the child's informed consent claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   {\u00b6 109} The complaint alleged that a reasonable person in Stewart's position who received adequate informed consent would not have elected to proceed with a vaginal delivery and that undisclosed risks and dangers attendant to a vaginal delivery proximately caused the child's injuries. The jury answered interrogatories finding that the defendants failed to inform the child of the material risks and dangers associated with his care and delivery, that the risks and dangers that should have been revealed actually occurred and were a direct cause of injury to the child, and that a reasonable person in the child's position would have decided against the proposed care if the material risks and dangers had been disclosed prior to the care. This verdict was consistent with a claim for lack of informed consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   B. Cross-Examination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   {\u00b6 110} Prior to trial, MetroHealth identified as a witness a neonatologist who treated the child after his birth. The neonatologist had been deposed on both direct and cross-examination during discovery. Stewart sought, by motion in limine, to exclude the witness because she anticipated that MetroHealth would attempt to elicit opinion testimony from the neonatologist without filing a report as required by Loc.R. 21.1. The court granted the motion in part to limit the witness to testimony as a treating physician. The neonatologist was unavailable to testify at trial, so the parties played his deposition for the jury. However, at the close of the direct testimony, Stewart asked the court to allow her to withdraw the cross-examination of the witness. The court granted the motion over MetroHealth's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   {\u00b6 111} Although the parties frame their arguments in this cross-assignment of error as whether the neonatologist would be testifying solely as a fact witness or would be giving opinions that were not previously disclosed, we think the actual issue is whether a party has the obligation to cross-examine a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   {\u00b6 112} In criminal cases, defense counsel is not obligated to cross-examine every witness the prosecution calls.\n   <em>\n    State v. Otte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1742823\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/74/555/#p565\">\n    74 Ohio St.3d 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 565,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=660%20N.E.2d%20711\">\n    660 N.E.2d 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). There is no reason why a different rule would apply in a civil case. Had the neonatologist appeared at trial as a witness for MetroHealth, Stewart would\n   have been under no obligation to cross-examine him. That the parties agreed that the neonatologist would testify by videotaped deposition testimony did not change Stewart's ability to decide to not have the witness's cross-examination presented to the jury.

The use of the word \"manifest\" in the standard of review means that the trier-of-fact's decision must be plainly or obviously contrary to all of the evidence.

MetroHealth denied that accusation and attributed the child's birth defects to an infection that he contracted in utero from Stewart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   {\u00b6 117} Stewart had a prior history of delivering a child early-the birth of an older son occurred by emergency Caesarean at 32-weeks gestation. Her pregnancy in this case took a similar course: between March 20 and March 30, 2003, Stewart had three episodes of preterm labor. After admission to MetroHealth, medication successfully stopped her contractions on the first two occasions, leading to her discharge from the hospital. On the third occasion on which she was admitted with premature labor, Stewart had dilated slightly. This dilation, in conjunction with her prior history of early delivery, caused MetroHealth and the doctor to recommend an elective Caesarean delivery. At the time this recommendation was made, the child\n   had just passed 24 weeks of gestation and was considered viable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   {\u00b6 118} Delivery by Caesarean section did not occur immediately because Stewart had vaginal bleeding. She was transferred into MetroHealth's antepartum unit for observation pending cessation of the bleeding. Although the bleeding had not wholly subsided, Weight discharged Stewart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   {\u00b6 119} Ten days later, Stewart returned to MetroHealth complaining of contractions. An exam showed her cervix dilated to four millimeters. A fetal monitor showed that her son had a steady heartbeat, so Weight did not immediately perform a Caesarean section and finished his office hours. In the next four hours following Weight's decision not to perform an immediate delivery by Caesarean section, the child's heartbeat became more and more erratic. Over those four hours, an attending nurse made 15 calls to Weight and to other obstetricians. When Weight returned to Stewart, he suspected that the fetal heartbeat monitor was indicating that the child was becoming asphyxiated. When testing confirmed that suspicion, Weight immediately delivered the child by Caesarean section. The child was not breathing when delivered and required nearly 30 minutes of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   {\u00b6 120} The fetal heartbeat monitor showed that the child's heartbeat had fluctuated greatly in the hours prior to his delivery. Tests conducted following his delivery showed that the child lost almost 40 percent of his circulating blood volume in the four hours before his delivery, the cause being the highly fluctuating heartbeat. The cause of this fluctuation was a brain bleed, the existence of which was confirmed by the presence of a blood clot detected in an ultrasound examination performed shortly after the child's birth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   {\u00b6 121} Upon delivery, the child showed the presence of \"putrid secretions\" in his airways, indicating the presence of an infection. This infection was not present in amniotic fluid examined during an amnioscentisis performed just two weeks prior to the child's birth, but Stewart tested positive for \"group beta strep\" following delivery. MetroHealth's experts testified that the infection reached the child's lungs and prevented him from breathing at birth. They theorized that the child's brain bleeding was the product of CPR required as a result of his clogged airways and that an earlier delivery would not have changed that outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   {\u00b6 122} This was not a case where there was no evidence of any kind to support Stewart's allegation that MetroHealth and Weight were negligent for failing to take immediate steps to deliver the child-both Stewart and MetroHealth offered a number of experts to support their respective theories of how and why the child suffered the brain injury. MetroHealth argues that it offered superior evidence, but that assertion simply underscores the reality that the experts disagreed with their counterparts. The jury heard credible evidence from which it could find that the child's fluctuating heartbeat in the hours before his delivery required Weight to perform an immediate delivery by Caesarean section. For us to agree that MetroHealth's evidence was \"superior\" would be to usurp the jury's function as the trier of fact and substitute our judgment. The court did not abuse its discretion by denying MetroHeatlth's motion for a new trial on grounds that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   D. Installment Payments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   {\u00b6 123} MetroHealth's final argument on cross-appeal is that the court erred when it denied MetroHealth's motion for payment of any judgment of nonactual-loss\n   damages in annual installments as allowed by R.C. 2744.06(B)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   {\u00b6 124} R.C. 2744.06(B)(2) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   Except as specifically provided to the contrary in this division, a court that renders a judgment against a political subdivision as described in division (A) of this section and that is not in favor of the state may authorize the political subdivision, upon the motion of the political subdivision, to pay the judgment or a specified portion of the judgment in annual installments over a period not to exceed ten years, subject to the payment of interest at the rate specified in division (A) of section 1343.03 of the Revised Code. A court shall not authorize the payment in installments under this division of any portion of a judgment or entire judgment that represents the actual loss of the person who is awarded the damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   Additionally, a court shall not authorize the payment in installments under this division of any portion of a judgment or entire judgment that does not represent the actual loss of the person who is awarded the damages unless the court, after balancing the interests of the political subdivision and of the person in whose favor the judgment was rendered, determines that installment payments would be appropriate under the circumstances and would not be unjust to the person in whose favor the judgment was rendered. If a court makes that determination, it shall fix the amount of the installment payments in a manner that achieves for the person in whose favor the judgment was rendered, the same economic result over the period as that person would have received if the judgment or portion of the judgment subject to the installment payments had been paid in a lump sum payment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   {\u00b6 125} Because the statute uses the permissive word \"may\" in describing the court's authority to grant a motion for installment payments, we use an abuse of discretion standard to review MetroHealth's argument.\n   <em>\n    Dorrian v. Scioto Conservancy Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6704203\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/27/102/#p108\">\n    27 Ohio St.2d 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 108,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=271%20N.E.2d%20834\">\n    271 N.E.2d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   {\u00b6 126} MetroHealth did not offer a specific reason why it should be allowed to pay the judgment in installments apart from noting that, as a county hospital, protection of its finances is \"of paramount importance.\" That is a truism that could apply to everyone. Missing from its argument is any assertion as to why, in this particular case, MetroHealth should be allowed to make installment payments. We recognize that MetroHealth is liable to pay a very large judgment. But that judgment is backed by the full faith and credit of Cuyahoga County. MetroHealth makes no claim that it cannot satisfy the judgment in whole if required to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   E. Summary\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   {\u00b6 127} To summarize our holding with respect to the issues raised in the cross-appeal: an unborn, viable child can maintain an independent claim for lack of informed consent; the court did not err by allowing Stewart to forego cross-examination of the witness; the jury's verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence; and the court did not abuse its discretion by denying MetroHealth's motion for payment of any judgment of nonactual-loss damages in annual installments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   {\u00b6 128} Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   MARY EILEEN KILBANE, P.J., and MARY J.
