(\"FOP\"). For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Effective July 1, 2012, the state and FOP entered into a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") allowing, among other things, the parties to submit certain disputes to arbitration. On March 1, 2013, the director of DPS issued a letter to Timothy Gales, an employee of the Ohio Investigative Unit, informing him that his employment had been terminated. Following a workplace investigation into allegations that Gales had sold numerous vehicles that he purchased at auction to members of the public without obtaining a dealer or salvage license from the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles, DPS decided to terminate Gales' employment for violation of workplace rules, violation of Ohio law, and \"actions that brought discredit\" upon DPS. (Feb. 20, 2015 Application &amp; Mot. to Vacate at \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Pursuant to the terms of the CBA, Gales filed a grievance challenging the nature and merits of his March 13, 2013 termination. The parties then submitted the matter of Gales' termination to arbitration. Following a two-day hearing in September 2014, the arbitrator rendered a decision and award dated November 24, 2014 modifying Gales' termination to a one-month suspension without pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On February 20, 2015, the state filed an \"application and motion to vacate arbitration award\" in the trial court, arguing the arbitrator exceeded or so imperfectly executed his authority by disregarding applicable Ohio law. The state further asserted the arbitrator disregarded the plain and unambiguous meaning of the CBA. Along with its motion to vacate, the state filed the arbitrator's award and the CBA. FOP responded on March 20, 2015 in an \"answer and counterclaim\" asserting the trial court should deny the state's motion to vacate and seeking an order (1) confirming the arbitration award, (2) requiring the state to pay Gales any and all back pay and benefits, (3) awarding interest to Gales, and (4) requiring the state to pay all costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Subsequently, on April 17, 2015, the state filed a document captioned \"plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and opposition to defendant's motion to confirm the arbitration award,\" along with documents related to the proceedings before the arbitrator. That same day, the state filed an answer to FOP's counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In response, FOP filed a memorandum contra the state's motion for summary judgment on April 23, 2015 arguing (1) a motion for summary judgment is not an allowable filing under Civ.R. 1 ; (2) the state did not comply with the filing requirements of R.C. Chapter 2711; (3) the state's motion for summary judgment is\n   not a responsive pleading; and (4) the state is attempting to have the trial court retry the merits of the arbitration. The parties agreed to an extension of time, and the state responded with a reply brief on May 14, 2015 in which the state argued that it erroneously captioned its motion as a motion for summary judgment and intended to file a brief in support of its application to vacate the arbitration award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On May 19, 2016, the trial court issued a decision and entry denying the state's motion to vacate the arbitration award and granting FOP's motion to confirm the arbitration award. In reaching its decision, the trial court stated \"[t]he filings in this matter are procedurally puzzling at best.\" (May 19, 2016 Decision &amp; Entry at 3.) The trial court referred to the state's initial filing as a motion to vacate but noted it was docketed as a complaint and stylistically looks like a complaint. In considering the state's assertion that the state intended its motion for summary judgment to operate as a brief in support of its application to vacate, the trial court noted the face of the motion for summary judgment states it is a filing pursuant to Civ.R. 56, which deals exclusively with motions for summary judgment. Additionally, the trial court stated that to the extent the state intended the \"motion for summary judgment\" as an answer brief to FOP's motion to confirm, the filing is untimely pursuant to Loc.R. 21.01 of the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, General Division. Thus, the trial court determined the state's filing captioned \"motion for summary judgment\" was actually a motion for summary judgment and not a memorandum in support of its motion to vacate, making it an improper filing under R.C. Chapter 2711. On those grounds, the trial court stated it would not consider the state's \"motion for summary judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The trial court then turned to the state's motion to vacate and determined the state did not comply with Loc.R. 21.01 because it did not file a brief stating the grounds for its requested relief along with its motion to vacate, finding \"[t]his alone is reason to deny the State's motion.\" (Decision &amp; Entry at 5.) However, the trial court went on to state that even if it were to consider the merits of the state's motion, the state's motion nonetheless fails because the arbitrator did not exceed his authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} As to FOP's motion to confirm, the trial court reiterated that the state did not file its opposition to FOP's motion within 14 days of the date of service as required by Loc.R. 21.01. The trial court then granted FOP's motion to confirm on the grounds that, pursuant to R.C. 2711.09, the state did not show cause to vacate the arbitration award. Additionally, the trial court stated it was awarding both pre- and postjudgment interest on the back pay due to Gales from November 24, 2014 until the date he is reinstated. The state timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The state assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1. The Common Pleas Court erred as a matter of law in finding that the State has not complied with the jurisdictional and/or procedural requirements to vacate the arbitration award.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2. The Common Pleas Court erred as matter of law in confirming the award, failing to vacate the award and in failing to address the substantial grounds upon which the State sought to vacate the arbitration award.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   3. The Common Pleas Court erred as a matter of law when it awarded pre-judgment interest to the Appellee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. First and Second Assignments of Error-Arbitration Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In its first assignment of error, the state argues the trial court erred in determining the state did not comply with the jurisdictional and/or procedural requirements of R.C. Chapter 2711 in order to vacate the arbitration award. The state argues in its second assignment of error that the trial court erred in failing to vacate the arbitration award on the merits. In its decision and entry, the trial court stated it was denying the state's motion to vacate the arbitration award on the grounds that (1) the state did not satisfy the jurisdictional and/or procedural requirements of R.C. Chapter 2711, and (2) even if the state's motion and subsequent filings were proper under R.C. Chapter 2711, the motion nonetheless fails on its merits. Thus, because the state's first two assignments of error address the trial court's alternative bases for denying the state's motion, we address the first two assignments of error jointly. Taken together, the first two assignments of error assert the trial court erred in denying the state's motion to vacate the arbitration award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Generally, an appellate court reviews a trial court's decision denying a motion to vacate an arbitration award under an abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Licking Hts.

Relying on this language, the trial court determined that even though the state timely filed a motion to vacate, it did not file a memorandum in support as required by Loc.R. 21.01. The trial court did not agree with the state that its motion for summary judgment could be construed as a memorandum in support of its motion to vacate. Additionally, the trial court determined that to the extent the state intended its motion for summary judgment to operate as a memorandum in opposition to FOP's motion to confirm, the filing was untimely under the local rules.

However, we need not determine whether the trial court erred in its application of the procedural requirements of R.C.

Thus, even if we were to agree with the state that the trial court erred in its procedural rulings, our next step would be to review the trial court's disposition of the state's motion to vacate on the merits. Accordingly, the question before us is whether the trial court erred in denying the state's motion to vacate on the merits and granting FOP's motion to confirm the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
