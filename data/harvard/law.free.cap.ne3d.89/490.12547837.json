(AAIC). Mr. Carlson previously had obtained a judgment against MVP Delivery and Logistics, Inc. and William Porter (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carlson v.

On appeal, we consider whether Mr. Carlson has sufficiently pleaded that MVP is an \"insured\" under DHL's policies, and whether the policies fall within the purview of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 as policies \"issued or delivered\" in New York. We hold that dismissal of the first cause of action pursuant to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420(a)(2) and (b) was improper as to National Union and AAIC. Whether MVP was an \"insured\" under DHL's policies presents a question of fact to be resolved\n   by the trier of fact. Additionally, the meaning of \"issued or delivered\" is informed by our decision in\n   <em>\n    Preserver Ins. Co. v. Ryba,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20N.Y.3d%20635\">\n    10 N.Y.3d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=862%20N.Y.S.2d%20820\">\n    862 N.Y.S.2d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=893%20N.E.2d%2097\">\n    893 N.E.2d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), and thus, section 3420 encompasses situations where both insureds and risks are located in this state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Claudia Carlson was killed when a truck painted with DHL's logo, owned by MVP and driven by William Porter, an employee of MVP, crossed the double-yellow divider and hit her car head on. Prior to the accident, Mr. Porter had driven the truck home on a scheduled break, when he\n   learned that his son had been in an accident. Mr. Porter drove the truck to the accident site, and while driving the truck to retrieve a tool to repair his son's vehicle, Mr. Porter veered into Mrs. Carlson's car, killing her. A jury awarded her husband, individually and as administrator of her estate, $20 million against MVP, Mr. Porter and DHL. The Appellate Division set aside the verdict against DHL and dismissed the complaint against it, concluding that DHL was not vicariously liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior. The court also found damages to be excessive, and Mr. Carlson stipulated to a reduced judgment of $7.3 million. MVP's insurer paid Mr. Carlson approximately $1.1 million, and Mr. Porter assigned to Mr. Carlson whatever rights Mr. Porter had to any other insurance coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the time of the accident, DHL and MVP were parties to a cartage agreement, pursuant to which MVP used its fleet of trucks and employees to perform DHL's package delivery services in Western New York. DHL had three insurance policies relevant here: (1) a $3 million primary policy issued by National Union, which included \"hired auto\" coverage insuring DHL, its employees, and \"[a]nyone else while using with your permission a covered 'auto' you own, hire or borrow\"; (2) a $2 million excess insurance policy with AAIC, with the exact same coverage as the National Union policy; and (3) a $23 million umbrella policy with National Union, which covered vehicles \"hired by [DHL] or on [DHL's] behalf and used with [DHL's] permission.\" American International Group, Inc. and AIG Domestic Claims, Inc. (collectively, AIG) did not issue any relevant policy to DHL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Carlson commenced this action against National Union, AAIC, AIG, and DHL, alleging five causes of action. The first asserted a claim under Insurance Law \u00a7 3420(a)(2) and (b),\n   against National Union, AAIC and AIG, to satisfy the outstanding judgment. The second, third, and fourth causes of action asserted damages against National Union, AAIC and AIG for misrepresentations, bad faith refusal to settle, and violations of General Business Law \u00a7 349, respectively. The fifth cause of action sought damages against DHL and AIG for conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety. As to the first cause of action, AAIC moved to dismiss on the ground that section 3420 did not permit a claim against it because its policy, initially issued by it to DHL's predecessor, Airborne Inc. (headquartered in Washington), and later assumed by DHL (headquartered in Florida), was not \"issued or delivered\" in New York. Supreme Court denied that motion, and allowed discovery to proceed on the issue of coverage. After limited discovery had occurred, Supreme Court granted the motions and cross motion to the extent of dismissing causes of action 2, 3 and 5 of the complaint, but refused to dismiss the first and fourth causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Appellate Division dismissed Mr. Carlson's General Business Law \u00a7 349 claim as to all remaining defendants (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carlson v. American Intl. Group, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307368\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/130/1479/#p1482\">\n    130 A.D.3d 1479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1482,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307368\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/130/1479/#p1482\">\n    12 N.Y.S.3d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [4th Dept.2015] ). The Appellate Division also dismissed the first cause of action. As to AIG, the Appellate Division concluded that because the two AIG entities established that they are not insurers, no section 3420 claim lay against them (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307368\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/130/1479/#p1482\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307368\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/130/1479/#p1482\">\n    at 1480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307368\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/130/1479/#p1482\">\n    12 N.Y.S.3d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Appellate Division held that Mr. Carlson could not state a claim against National Union because (a) the MVP vehicle was not a \"hired automobile\" and (b) DHL could not grant MVP permission to use it (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307368\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/130/1479/#p1482\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307368\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/130/1479/#p1482\">\n    at 1481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307368\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/130/1479/#p1482\">\n    12 N.Y.S.3d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In a companion appeal, the\n   Appellate Division determined that the AAIC policy was not issued or delivered in New York and dismissed the first cause of action against AAIC (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carlson v.

Defendants offered no contrary expert opinion, and challenged the expert's opinions neither here nor below. Although they remain free to do so at a later stage of the proceedings, at this stage the expert's opinions concerning insurance industry custom and practice as to the comprehensive coverage of hired fleets, even when trucks within a fleet are at times not used for business purposes, are sufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    A.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As to the hired auto issue, dismissal on that ground was erroneous, for two additional reasons. First, defendants and the Appellate Division rely on the contract of insurance, without reference to extrinsic evidence, to conclude that the truck driven by Mr. Porter was not a hired auto, thus entitling them to dismissal. However, as Mr. Carlson argues, and defendants admit, a portion of the insurance contract, the schedule of hire, has not been produced. According to the expert, the schedule of hire would show that DHL's insurance policies cover all of MVP's vehicles. Mr. Carlson also points to evidence concerning the underwriting of the policies, which demonstrates that DHL's policies were priced to cover MVP's trucks\n   as hired autos.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the schedule of hire exists, its\n   production is essential to determination of the full content of the contract; it would be error to dismiss the coverage claim based on only part of a contract, particularly where a highly germane portion is missing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the schedule of hire has been lost or destroyed, it would likewise be error to dismiss the coverage claim, because Mr. Carlson would be entitled to attempt to prove the missing portion by parol evidence (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Belknap v.

Varig Logistica S.A.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130814\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/26/543/#p551\">\n    26 N.Y.3d 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 551,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130814\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/26/543/#p551\">\n    26 N.Y.S.3d 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130814\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/26/543/#p551\">\n    46 N.E.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2015] ; CPLR 3126 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants' argument that the schedule of hire would have been unlikely to list MVP's vehicles individually, and therefore defendants should prevail as a matter of law, is in any event foreclosed by our decision in\n   <em>\n    Jefferson Ins. Co. of N.Y. v. Travelers Indem. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"724978\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/92/363/#p370\">\n    92 N.Y.2d 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 370,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"724978\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/92/363/#p370\">\n    681 N.Y.S.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"724978\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/92/363/#p370\">\n    703 N.E.2d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), in which we held: \"[t]hat the van is not specifically listed [in the schedule of hired and non-owned coverage] is not determinative\" of coverage, because the policy \"listed 'N.Y.' as the State in which such coverage would apply, and also listed a 'Rate per each $100 cost of hire' and a premium amount.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, the insurance policies do not define \"hired auto,\" and neither the Appellate Division nor defendants point to any industry-standard definition. Defendants argue, and we agree, that the degree of control exercised by DHL over MVP's trucks is pivotal to the determination of whether they are hired autos. However, the issue of control is fact-specific. The cartage agreement contains some terms militating against a finding of control; for example, section 3.3 of the cartage agreement gives MVP control over the manner of performance, including the\n   number of vehicles and routing of the vehicles, and section 3.5.2 makes MVP responsible for the maintenance of the vehicles. The cartage agreement also contains terms that militate in favor of finding that DHL exercised substantial control over MVP's trucks. For example, DHL required all MVP trucks used for DHL's business to have DHL's paint scheme and identifying marks; DHL imposed maintenance requirements for the vehicles, and required that any necessary repairs to the vehicles be made and documented in accordance with procedures established by DHL; DHL specified the types of vehicles to be used for different types of deliveries; and DHL required MVP to use DHL's routing software. MVP was prohibited from making deliveries for a DHL competitor; even if MVP wanted to use its trucks to make a delivery for a non-competitor, it had to obtain DHL's permission and remove DHL's marks from the truck; and MVP could not retain any third parties to perform its work without DHL's prior written authorization. Those substantial restrictions\n   on MVP's ownership and ability to use its trucks go well beyond simply controlling DHL's intellectual property and brand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Most significantly for the purpose of this appeal, determining the extent of control is not limited to the face of the contract, but concerns the actual degree of control exercised by DHL over MVP. Mr. Carlson, who obtained some limited discovery, has pointed to evidence supporting the proposition that DHL actually exercised substantial control over MVP's trucks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, MVP's entire fleet was used exclusively for DHL deliveries; DHL prescribed the make and model of the vehicles to be used by MVP; MVP's vehicles were garaged in DHL's facility; DHL had keys to MVP's offices, which were located inside the DHL facility; DHL dispatched MVP drivers and owned the equipment used to do so; DHL sent MVP drivers instructions via text message; DHL provided routing specifications for express shipments and required MVP to follow them; DHL required MVP to collect money on COD (collect on delivery) shipments and remit those monies to DHL; and if a\n   customer had a problem, MVP was required to contact DHL or tell the customer to do so. All MVP employees were required to wear DHL uniforms, DHL audited MVP's safe driving practices, and DHL regularly examined MVP's routes and adjusted them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Contrary to the Appellate Division's holding, the fact that the cartage agreement labels MVP an \"independent contractor\" is not dispositive of the issue of control, but is a factor to be weighed with others.

There, the Appellate Division concluded as a matter of law that \"neither the DHL defendants nor MVP may be held vicariously liable under the theory of respondeat superior\" because Porter was on a personal errand at the time of the accident and that \"his employment did not create the necessity for the travel\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1132,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4137488\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/53/1129/4137488/\">\n    861 N.Y.S.2d 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). However, the doctrine\n   of respondeat superior is not relevant to the issue of permission here. The doctrine of respondeat superior is used to determine when an employer may be held responsible for acts of an employee, not when an insurance company must provide coverage under the terms of its own policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Under the terms of the insurance contract, coverage is not limited to circumstances where DHL is held directly liable or liable by way of the doctrine of respondeat superior. The contract contemplates coverage in circumstances where the driver may not be an employee, or where the driver may not be acting within the scope of employment, so long as the other requirements for coverage are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    III.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   AAIC adopts the Appellate Division's rationale that because AAIC's policy was issued in New Jersey and delivered in Washington and then in Florida, it was neither issued nor delivered in New York, and therefore plaintiff cannot recover from AAIC pursuant to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420. Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Preserver\n   </em>\n   resolves that question, and we now reiterate that section 3420 applies to policies that cover insureds and risks located in the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 allows a limited cause of action on behalf of injured parties directly against insurers. Section 3420 applies to policies and contracts \"issued or delivered in this state\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 [a] ). Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 does not define the term \"issued or delivered in this state,\" but other provisions of the Insurance Law are instructive: \"[T]he proper interpretation of the term 'issued or delivered in this state' refers both to a policy issued for delivery in New York, and a policy issued for delivery outside of New York\" (Ops. Gen. Counsel N.Y. Ins. Dept. No. 09-06-08). In\n   <em>\n    Preserver,\n   </em>\n   we\n   interpreted section 3420(d), which then required insurers to provide written notice when disclaiming coverage under policies \"issued\n   for delivery\" in New York. We held that \"[a] policy is 'issued for delivery' in New York if it covers both insureds and risks located in this state\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20N.Y.3d%20635\">\n    10 N.Y.3d at 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=862%20N.Y.S.2d%20820\">\n    862 N.Y.S.2d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=893%20N.E.2d%2097\">\n    893 N.E.2d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Preserver,\n   </em>\n   \"issued for delivery\" was interpreted to mean where the risk to be insured was located-not where the policy document itself was actually handed over or mailed to the insured. We interpreted section 3420 to provide a benefit-deliberately in derogation of the common law-to New Yorkers whenever a policy covers \"insureds and risks located in this state\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying the\n   <em>\n    Preserver\n   </em>\n   standard to the facts of this case, it is clear that DHL is \"located in\" New York because it has a substantial business presence and creates risks in New York. It is even clearer that DHL purchased liability insurance covering vehicle-related risks arising from vehicles delivering its packages in New York, because its insurance agreements say so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This interpretation of \"issued or delivered\" is consistent with the reasoning behind the legislature's enactment of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420. In 1917, the legislature created this statutory cause of action to remedy the inequity of the common-law rule that an injured person had no cause of action against the insurer of a tortfeasor and to protect the tort victims of New York (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lang v. Hanover Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456484\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/350/#p353\">\n    3 N.Y.3d 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 353-354,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456484\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/350/#p353\">\n    787 N.Y.S.2d 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456484\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/350/#p353\">\n    820 N.E.2d 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2004] ). \"Generally, statutes designed to promote the public good will receive a liberal construction and be expounded in such a mannerthat\n   they may, as far as possible, attain the end in view\" (McKinney's Cons. Laws of N.Y., Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 341, Comment). The overall legislative intent of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 is to protect the tort victims of New York State, and the subsequent amendments to section 3420 were designed to expand the remedy, not to contract it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In 2008, the legislature amended Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 to expand its reach in several respects. The 2008 amendments were made to \"restore fairness to the process and protect individuals who suffer personal injuries and families whose loved ones have died as a result of the tortious conduct of another\" (Letter from John A. DeFrancisco, July 14, 2008, Bill Jacket, L. 2008, ch. 388 at 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Senate Introducer's\n   Mem. in Support, Bill Jacket, L. 2008, ch. 388 at 8, 2008 N.Y. Legis. Ann. at 261-262;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Letter from Helene E. Weinstein, July 16, 2008, Bill Jacket, L. 2008, ch. 388 at 6 [\"(T)his progressive, forward thinking legislation will benefit insureds, injured parties, and the administration of justice\"]; Letter from Robert Brenna Jr., President, New York State Academy of Trial Lawyers, July 11, 2008, Bill Jacket, L. 2008, ch. 388 at 18 [\"This legislation advances the cause of justice and will improve New Yorkers' access to the courts, and their ability to seek relief for injuries and wrongful death\"] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The 2008 amendments also changed the \"issued for delivery\" language in subsection (d) to match the \"issued or delivered\" language elsewhere in the statute. Nothing in the bill jacket or other legislative history mentions that change, so that it appears to have been a stylistic change with no intended import. If anything, \"issued or delivered\" is facially broader than \"issued for delivery.\" Moreover, there is certainly no indication that the legislature's minor amendment to subsection (d) was intended to overturn this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Preserver.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Interpreting \"issued or delivered in this state\" to apply exclusively to policies issued by an insurer located in New York or by an out-of-state insurer who mails a policy to a New York address would undermine the legislative intent of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420. It would require an assumption that the legislature intended to remove coverage benefitting injured New York residents if the policy was mailed from another state, but to increase coverage for foreign victims injured elsewhere so long as the policy was mailed to New York or underwritten by a New York-based insurer-hardly plausible in light of the express purposes of section 3420 and the 2008 amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The dissent suggests that, \"[g]iven the sharp change in the meaning of 'issued or delivered,' and the frequency with which that phrase is used,\" our holding today will \"wreak havoc\" in unspecified ways (dissenting op. at 322, 67 N.Y.S.3d at 123, 89 N.E.3d at 513).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is not the case. Today's interpretation of \"issued or delivered\" to include policies that cover both insureds and risks located in the state is not a \"sharp change\"; that interpretation is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Preserver\n   </em>\n   and the legislative history of section 3420 and the 2008 amendments. The fact that the phrase \"issued or delivered\" exists in other provisions of the Insurance Law does not affect the analysis, for a few reasons. First, although \"issued or delivered\" appears in other parts of the Insurance Law, we have yet to interpret the phrase in any of those other contexts. Thus, decrying our interpretation of \"issued or delivered\" because it might affect the interpretation of those same words in other provisions would apply equally to the adoption of the dissent's view: any interpretation would have that effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, we do not here purport to judge the meaning of the words \"issued or delivered\" in any context other than section 3420. Identical words may be used in different contexts with different meanings and different legislative histories, and we do not foreclose any such interpretations by our decision here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Third, the dissent would restrict section 3420(a) to policies that were either issued in New York or delivered to New York,\n   and would exclude, for example, an insurance policy issued by a national insurer located in Connecticut to a retailer operating in all 50 states, if the policy was delivered to the retailer's headquarters in Arkansas-even if the policy was specifically written to cover risks in New York created by the insured's extensive operations in this state. The same concerns that animate our consideration of section 3420 are also relevant to and consistent with the purpose of other provisions of the Insurance Law, which has as its overriding purpose the protection of New Yorkers and the coverage of injuries occurring in New York (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   Insurance Law \u00a7 1213[a] [declaring the legislature's concern that out-of-state insurers present New York residents \"the often insuperable obstacle of resorting to\n   distant forums for the purpose of asserting legal rights under such policies,\" and therefore providing that any transaction of business or solicitation thereof by a foreign insurer constitutes authorization for the Superintendent of Financial Services to accept process for that insurer] ). The dissent's interpretation of \"issued or delivered\" would allow an insurer to avoid compliance with many of the provisions of the Insurance Law simply by mailing the policy to the insured's secondary location, even though the risks contemplated by the policy existed entirely within New York. It is simply not plausible that the legislature intended the provisions of the Insurance Law to be so easily evaded by companies doing business in New York and purporting to cover risks in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In light of the above, we conclude that the term \"issued or delivered\" does not alter our conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Preserver,\n   </em>\n   and that section 3420(a) encompasses situations where both insureds and risks are located in this state. In so holding, we further conclude that the policies here fall within the purview of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420, and Mr. Carlson may maintain his Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 cause of action against AAIC, subject, of course, to his ability to prove coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    IV.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Mr. Carlson's remaining claims are without merit, and we review them briefly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   General Business Law \u00a7 349 provides that \"[d]eceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business, trade[,] or commerce or the furnishing of any service in [New York] are ... unlawful\" ( General Business Law \u00a7 349[a] ). We have held that \"[s]ection 349 does not grant a private remedy for every improper or illegal business practice, but only for conduct that tends to deceive consumers\" (\n   <em>\n    Schlessinger v.

I would therefore affirm on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In April 2004, MVP Delivery and Logistics, Inc. entered into a cartage agreement with DHL Express (USA) Inc. to provide package delivery services in the Western New York region. The agreement expressly identified MVP as an independent contractor. As such, MVP owned and registered the vehicles in its delivery fleet. MVP also maintained control over its employees and the manner and means of its performance under the cartage agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, MVP obtained a $1 million liability insurance policy to cover the vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On July 7, 2004, an MVP delivery van, driven by employee William Porter, collided head on with another vehicle. The driver of that vehicle died 13 days later as a result of the injuries she sustained in the crash. At the time of the accident, William Porter was running a personal errand on a scheduled break.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In the underlying wrongful death litigation, a jury awarded Michael Carlson, in both his individual capacity and as administrator of his deceased wife's estate, $20 million against William Porter, MVP, and DHL. The Appellate Division reversed the judgment against MVP and DHL, reasoning that MVP and DHL could not be held vicariously liable on a theory of respondeat superior because Porter's employment did not create the need for the travel (\n   <em>\n    Carlson v. Porter,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4137488,4134317\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/53/1129/\">\n    53 A.D.3d 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1132,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4137488\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/53/1129/4137488/\">\n    861 N.Y.S.2d 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [4th Dept.2008] ). In other words, Porter exceeded the scope of his employment by running a personal errand at the time of the accident. MVP was nonetheless still held statutorily liable as owner of the vehicle (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 ). The Appellate Division also set aside the damages award as excessive and plaintiff stipulated to a reduced judgment of $7.3 million. To date, plaintiff\n   has received approximately $1.1 million from MVP's insurance carrier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Seeking to satisfy the deficient judgment, plaintiff, in his individual capacity and as administrator of his wife's estate, commenced this action under Insurance Law \u00a7 3420(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, plaintiff seeks to recover from DHL's insurers on the theory that the MVP vehicle was a \"hired auto\" within the meaning of DHL's insurance policies. As such, MVP would be an \"insured\" under those policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Three DHL insurance policies are relevant here. First, National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, a subsidiary of American International Group, Inc. (AIG), issued DHL's primary insurance policy in the amount of $3 million. This liability policy contained a \"hired auto\" provision defining an insured as anyone \"using with your permission a covered auto you own, hire or borrow.\" Second, National Union issued a $23 million umbrella policy defining an insured as \"[a]ny person ... or organization with respect to any auto owned by you, loaned to you or hired by you on your behalf and used\n   with your permission.\" Under both policies, \"you\" means a named insured, which explicitly includes DHL but not MVP or any other independent contractor. Third, DHL purchased a $2 million excess policy from American Alternative Insurance Company (AAIC), which followed the form of DHL's primary insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   These defendant insurance companies moved to dismiss this action under CPLR 3211(a)(1) and (7). Supreme Court, Niagara County denied the motions insofar as the insurers sought dismissal under Insurance Law \u00a7 3420. The court rejected AAIC's argument that the excess policy had not been \"issued or delivered\" in New York, as required by Insurance Law \u00a7 3420(a), because the accident took place while the named insured was doing business within the state. After limited discovery, the same court concluded that the pleadings were sufficient to allege that the MVP vehicle constituted a \"hired auto\" under the relevant policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On appeal, the Appellate Division reversed and granted the motion to dismiss, concluding that plaintiff could not state a claim against National Union because DHL did not \"hire\" the vehicle in question and could not have given MVP permission to use MVP's own vehicle (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307368\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/130/1479/#p1482\">\n    130 A.D.3d 1479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1481,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307368\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/130/1479/#p1482\">\n    12 N.Y.S.3d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [4th Dept.2015] ). As a result, MVP was not an \"insured\" under the applicable policies. In a companion appeal, the Appellate Division also dismissed the first cause of action against AAIC (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305939\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/130/1477/#p1477\">\n    130 A.D.3d 1477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1477-1478,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305939\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/130/1477/#p1477\">\n    16 N.Y.S.3d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [4th Dept.2015] ). The Court reasoned that the excess policy had not been \"issued or delivered in this state\" as required by Insurance Law \u00a7 3420(a)(2). This Court subsequently granted leave to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The majority holds that whether MVP is an \"insured\" under DHL's insurance policies presents a question of fact to be resolved by a jury. I disagree. The cartage agreement on its face establishes that MVP is an independent contractor responsible for the purchase, operation, and maintenance of its delivery fleet. As such, MVP exercised meaningful control over its vehicles, thereby precluding \"hired auto\" coverage, as a matter of law, under the relevant insurance policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    A.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \"The key inquiry regarding whether an automobile will fall within the hired automobiles provision of [a] policy is whether\n   the insured exercised dominion, control, or the right to direct the use of the vehicle\" (8A Steven Plitt et al., Couch on Insurance \u00a7 118:49 [3d ed.] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, the issue is whether the underlying agreement is for the\n   <em>\n    services\n   </em>\n   of the independent contractor or for the\n   <em>\n    vehicle used\n   </em>\n   in providing those services (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305939\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/130/1477/#p1477\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Dairylea Coop. v.

A business should not be liable for its independent contractor's use of the vehicles if the business cannot control the manner in which those vehicles operate (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chainani v.

That was clearly the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   MVP, not DHL, owned the delivery vehicle at issue. Accordingly, to obtain coverage, plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the MVP vehicle was (1) \"hired\" by DHL and (2) used with DHL's permission at the time of the accident. Here, the 14-page cartage agreement, read in conjunction with the insurance policies, conclusively defeats plaintiff's \"hired auto\" claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   By its very terms, the cartage agreement referred to MVP as an independent contractor. As such, MVP maintained sole control over the manner and means of its performance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \"3.3\n   <em>\n    Manner of Performance\n   </em>\n   . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the manner and means by which Contractor performs the Services shall be\n   <em>\n    at Contractor's sole discretion and control\n   </em>\n   and are Contractor's sole responsibility, including, with respect to (a) the hours and days worked by Contractor Workers, (b) the selection and supervision of Contractor Workers and (c) the number of Contractor Vehicles used by Contractor in providing the Services. Contractor shall have the\n   <em>\n    sole right to determine all aspects of its performance of its obligations\n   </em>\n   under this Agreement, including the staffing, operation, and routing of the Contractor Vehicles in the Service Areas ....\" (Cartage agreement \u00a7 3.3 [emphasis added].)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   This \"manner of performance\" provision clearly establishes the parties' intent that MVP would maintain control over the operation of its vehicles. DHL did not have authority to make decisions affecting the day-to-day operations of MVP's vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The cartage agreement further provides MVP with exclusive control over the purchase and maintenance of its delivery vehicles (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=614%20N.E.2d%20712\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.5.1 [\"\n   <em>\n    Contractor Vehicles\n   </em>\n   . Without limiting the generality of\n   <em>\n    Section 3.3\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Contractor, at its sole cost and expense, shall obtain, furnish, operate, and maintain in good working condition such Contractor Vehicles as may be necessary for Contractor to perform the Services in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) ] ). Moreover, MVP was solely responsible for the licensing, registration, and insurance of its delivery vehicles (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=614%20N.E.2d%20712\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 3.5.2, 12.1 [\"(MVP) shall, at its sole cost and expense, maintain in effect continual insurance coverage\n   .... All such insurance coverages ... shall be primary to, and shall receive\n   <em>\n    no contribution\n   </em>\n   from any other insurance maintained by, on behalf of, or benefitting DHL\" (emphasis added) ] ). Finally, the agreement specified that MVP was responsible for the hiring, training, and firing of all its employees (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=614%20N.E.2d%20712\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.4). Clearly, pursuant to the cartage agreement, MVP maintained direct control over the purchase, operation, and maintenance of its vehicles-and more. MVP, among other things, selected individual drivers, selected delivery routes, loaded and unloaded the vehicles, and furnished the vehicles with gas and other supplies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As the majority notes, the cartage agreement contained strict regulations for, among other things, the vehicles' operating and performance standards, the vehicles' markings, employee uniforms, and employee standards of conduct. DHL also had the right to inspect MVP's records and audit its compliance with the agreement. MVP even used DHL's facilities and housed its vehicles on site. The majority stresses these aspects of the business relationship in holding that there is a cognizable factual dispute here (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   majority op. at 300-301, 67 N.Y.S.3d at 106-08, 89 N.E.3d at 496-98). However, none of these requirements in the cartage agreement-with the limited exception of vehicle performance standards-affect the MVP vehicles in their\n   <em>\n    functional\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    operational\n   </em>\n   capacities. The markings requirement, for instance, simply reflects DHL's control over its own intellectual property and brand, not the vehicle itself. Accordingly, even assuming DHL exercised some \"supervisory powers,\" MVP was still an independent contractor responsible for its own performance (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chicago Ins. Co. v. Farm Bur. Mut. Ins. Co. of Ark., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542408\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/929/372/#p374\">\n    929 F.2d 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 374 [8th Cir.1991] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Absent any indication that DHL specifically hired MVP's vehicles for its own exclusive control, there can be no \"hired auto\" coverage as a matter of law (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    American Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa. v. Denmark Foods,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"56318\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/224/461/#p463\">\n    224 F.2d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 463 [4th Cir.1955] ). I would therefore hold that MVP-an independent contractor solely responsible for the purchase, operation, and maintenance of its vehicles-exercised such exclusive control over the vehicle so as to preclude \"hired auto\" coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   That result is the same one we reached in\n   <em>\n    Dairylea Coop. v.

There, R &amp; H Hauling, an independent contractor, entered into a hauling contract with Dairylea Cooperative, Inc. and an accompanying lease agreement for a tanker truck. Several months later, R &amp; H purchased the tanker with Dairylea retaining a security interest. The truck, which was still titled in Dairylea's name, was subsequently involved in an accident with another vehicle while being driven by an R &amp; H employee. After a jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the underlying personal injury action, Dairylea and R &amp; H's insurers initiated a declaratory judgment action to determine coverage. Much like the insurance policies at issue here, Dairylea's insurance policy defined an insured as \"any other person while using an owned automobile or a hired automobile with the permission of the named insured\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=483%20N.Y.S.2d%201001\">\n    483 N.Y.S.2d 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=473%20N.E.2d%20251\">\n    473 N.E.2d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   We held in\n   <em>\n    Dairylea\n   </em>\n   that the truck did not constitute a \"hired auto\" under Dairylea's insurance policy.

That statute provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   \"[e]very owner of a vehicle used or operated in this state shall be liable and responsible for death or injuries to person or property resulting from negligence in the use or operation of such vehicle, in the business of such owner or otherwise, by any person using or operating the same with the permission, express or implied, of such owner\" ( Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 [1 ] ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   By definition, however, section 388 only applies to an \"owner of a vehicle used or operated in this state\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 128). It is undisputed that MVP-not DHL-owned the van and, pursuant to section 388, MVP is the party that must give permission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The majority also relies on the public policy considerations underlying section 388. In\n   <em>\n    Motor Veh. Acc. Indem. Corp. v. Continental Natl. Am.

Later, in\n   <em>\n    Murdza v.

If anything, these cases undermine the majority's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The constructive permission theory applied in\n   <em>\n    Motor Veh. Acc. Indem. Corp.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Murdza\n   </em>\n   is intended to ensure that a\n   financially responsible defendant, as owner or renter, cannot avoid liability by claiming an insolvent user did not have actual permission (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morris v.

But DHL is not a car rental company leasing numerous cars for profit with restrictive use agreements that limit its exposure to liability. DHL contracted with MVP for its services in a commercial, arms' length agreement-not a rental agreement. DHL required MVP to keep, at a minimum, a $1 million liability insurance policy-well above the minimum automobile liability coverage required in New York State (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 345[b][3] [requiring motorists to carry a minimum amount of liability insurance of $50,000 for death of one person, $100,000 for death of two or more people, and $10,000 for property damage in any one accident] ). The public policy underlying these constructive permission decisions-involving owners placing \"fleets of vehicles\" on the road with the risk that restrictive rental agreements will leave injured plaintiffs without recourse to an insured motorist-is simply not implicated here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The case before us involves a straightforward application of contract interpretation and settled insurance law. Rather than apply those established principles, the majority's approach permits litigants to introduce extrinsic evidence to create ambiguity in contracts, upsetting not only our own precedent but the settled expectations of parties to commercial agreements. I would instead apply our long-standing precedent and affirm the Appellate Division's holding that the vehicle was not a \"hired auto.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    III.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Affirming on these grounds would dispose of the case without consideration of the second issue-the application of\n   Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (a).

In doing so, the majority rewrites the Insurance Law to make \"issued or delivered\" mean \"issued for delivery\" each and every time it appears-and it frequently appears (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Insurance Law \u00a7\u00a7 1101[b] [2][C] ; 1213[a], [d]; 3102[b][1][F]; [3]; [c] [1]; [f][1], [2]; 3221[k] [6] [A], [B]; [l][5][B][i]; [p][3][E][ii]; 3407 [a], [b]; 3446[c]; 3451[a] [1]; 3452[a][1]; 4106, 4207[c]; 4216[c][2]; 4231[d], [g][1][D], [E]; 4306, 4510[c]; 6409[a] ). Given the sharp change in the meaning of \"issued or delivered,\" and the frequency with which that phrase is used, the majority's holding will surely wreak havoc well beyond this case. The majority's assertion that its holding may be confined to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 is belied by our rules of statutory construction, which will not allow us to disregard the plain language of other Insurance Law provisions, identical to that interpreted here, due to variances in context or legislative history, as the plain language of the statute is paramount and we can hardly ascribe differing meanings to like terms found throughout the Insurance Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Moreover, the majority's claim that a literal interpretation of the phrase \"issued or delivered\" would permit insurers to\n   regularly insure risks located in New York while simultaneously avoiding application of the Insurance Law is exaggerated and unavailing. The legislative intent of the provisions at issue was to alter the common-law rule that \" 'an injured person possessed no cause of action against the insurer of the tort feasor' ... because there was no privity of contract between plaintiff and the insurance carrier\" (\n   <em>\n    Lang,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456484\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/350/#p353\">\n    3 N.Y.3d at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456484\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/350/#p353\">\n    787 N.Y.S.2d 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456484\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/350/#p353\">\n    820 N.E.2d 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

This legislative intent is still effected by giving the terms \"issued or delivered\" their plain meaning because New York residents may, contrary to the common-law rule, pursue actions (in accordance with section 3420 ) directly against an insurer who issues or delivers an automobile insurance policy in New York. Significantly, New York residents will still benefit from an insurance policy issued or delivered outside the state-they just may not be able to sue the insurer directly in New York.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the legislature has seen fit to ensure that policies that may not be issued or delivered in the state, but which cover automobiles that present a significant risk to the residents of New York, must comply with specific provisions of the Insurance Law (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   Insurance Law \u00a7\u00a7 3420[e] [governing any insurance policy issued or delivered by an authorized insurer \"upon any such vehicle or aircraft or vessel then principally garaged or principally used in this state\"]; 3411, 3412 [governing insurance policies on vehicles \"registered in this state\"] ). The majority's interpretation ignores these plain language distinctions.\n   While the majority claims that it is \"simply not plausible\" to conclude that the legislature intended to exclude policies issued or delivered outside the state because of the potential burden on New York residents in pursuing insurers in their home states, it is hardly plausible that the legislature intended to require every automobile insurer throughout the country-regardless of where the policy was issued or delivered-to comply with New York insurance statutes on the chance that\n   the insured vehicle may be driven into New York.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that many of the provisions of section 3420 governing policies issued or delivered in the state govern the relationship between the insured and the insurer, it is also hardly plausible that the New York Legislature intended to dictate the relationship between out-of-state insureds and out-of-state insurers. It is questionable whether the legislature would even have the authority to do so (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   8 Steven Plitt et al., Couch on Insurance \u00a7 111:27 [3d ed.] [\"(a) state legislature does not have the power to prescribe the contents of insurance policies that are issued or delivered outside of that respective state's borders\"] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   This unhappy result may be avoided-the vehicle was not a \"hired auto\" and we should leave it at that.

Indeed, the majority opinion raises many questions regarding whether and when an insured and risk would be located in New York. For example, what will occur when an out-of-state resident owns property in New York, or works in New York, or simply vacations regularly in New York, and drives a vehicle into the state? Will the out-of-state insurers of an insurance policy delivered out of state be subject to direct suit in New York under such circumstances? It would appear so under the majority's interpretation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Designated pursuant to N.Y.
