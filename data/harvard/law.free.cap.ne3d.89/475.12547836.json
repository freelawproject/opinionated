The Second Circuit has, by certified question, asked us to determine the applicable standard. We conclude that, consistent with the New York City Council's directive to construe the New York City Human Rights Law liberally, the common-law standard as articulated in\n   <em>\n    Home Ins.

At trial, plaintiff's counsel requested a jury instruction on punitive damages under the NYCHRL. In considering the request, the court applied to the NYCHRL the standard for punitive damages found in title VII, namely, whether plaintiff had submitted evidence that her employer had intentionally discriminated against her with malice or reckless indifference to her protected rights, and denied the instruction. The court stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"[t]here is nothing here that supports punitive damages ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"There is no showing of malice, reckless indifference, that there was an intent to violate the law. They may have violated the law, which is what you are going to try to prove, but there is certainly no evidence of intent.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The jury found defendants liable for pregnancy discrimination and awarded plaintiff $10,500 in compensatory damages and $50,000 in pain and suffering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff appealed, arguing that the district court erred in importing the title VII standard. After noting that the NYCHRL \"does not articulate a standard for a finding of employer or employee liability for punitive damages,\" the Second Circuit acknowledged that the passage of the Local Civil Rights Restoration Act of 2005 (Administrative Code \u00a7 8-130[a] [Restoration Act] ) and subsequent related amendments,\n   calling for a liberal construction of all provisions of the NYCHRL in all circumstances, called into question the Second Circuit's 2001 holding in\n   <em>\n    Farias v. Instructional Sys., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498217\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/91/\">\n    259 F.3d 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir.2001) that title VII's standard for punitive damages applies to the NYCHRL (\n   <em>\n    Chauca v.

The Second Circuit noted that the Restoration Act \"otherwise provides no specific guidance\" regarding how to interpret the NYCHRL where the statute is silent as to the applicable standard (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173695\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/86/#p90\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 87-88 ). Accordingly, the Second Circuit certified the following question: \"What is the standard for finding a defendant liable for punitive damages under the New York City Human Rights Law, N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 8-502 ?\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173695\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/86/#p90\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173695\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/86/#p90\">\n    at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The NYCHRL prohibits an employer from \"refus[ing] to hire\" or \"discharg[ing] from employment\" anyone because of their gender (Administrative Code \u00a7 8-107[1][a][2] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The NYCHRL provides for compensatory and punitive damages and other remedies against employers and employees found directly or vicariously liable for discrimination, a provision the City Council included in the NYCHRL in 1991 (Administrative Code \u00a7 8-502[a] ). Employers exposed to a punitive damages charge can mitigate punitive damages based on vicarious liability where they can prove the existence of certain policies established to deter discrimination (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173695\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/86/#p90\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8-107[13][d] - [e] ). Despite the clear intention to make punitive damages available, there is no provision in the NYCHRL setting a standard for imposing them. In light of this silence in the statute, we must now determine what standard applies for awarding punitive damages under the NYCHRL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    A.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The \"starting point in any case of interpretation must always be the language\n   itself, giving effect to the plain meaning thereof\" (\n   <em>\n    Matter of Shannon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318276\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/345/#p351\">\n    25 N.Y.3d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 351,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318276\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/345/#p351\">\n    12 N.Y.S.3d 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318276\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/345/#p351\">\n    34 N.E.3d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2015] ). It is a well-established principle of statutory construction that words of technical or special meaning are used by the legislature, \"not loosely, but with regard for their established legal significance, and in construing a statute a technical meaning should\n   be given to technical words, unless a contrary meaning is unmistakably intended\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

In our 1990 decision in\n   <em>\n    Home Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   we articulated the punitive damages standard as \"essentially ... conduct having a high degree of moral culpability which manifests a conscious disregard of the rights of others or conduct so reckless as to amount to such disregard\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4417619\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/75/196/#p203\">\n    75 N.Y.2d at 203-204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=551%20N.Y.S.2d%20481\">\n    551 N.Y.S.2d 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=550%20N.E.2d%20930\">\n    550 N.E.2d 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [citations and internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff, relying almost exclusively on the legislative intent of the NYCHRL and the Restoration Act, argues that she should be entitled to a punitive damages charge upon\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   showing of liability. Under plaintiff's approach, any discrimination case that goes to a jury would be accompanied by a punitive damages charge without any guidance as to when to award such damages. In plaintiff's view, punitive damages should be available in any situation where compensatory damages are available; the required showing of entitlement to either form of damages would be identical. The dissent agrees, and argues that the Restoration Act's liberal construction principles mandate a holding that \"a punitive damages charge is automatic on a finding of liability\" (dissenting op. at 338, 67 N.Y.S.3d at 94, 89 N.E.3d at 484).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We reject that approach. Punitive damages differ conceptually from compensatory damages and are intended to address \"gross misbehavior\" or conduct that \"wilfully and wantonly causes hurt ... to another\" (\n   <em>\n    Thoreson v. Penthouse Intl.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4428540\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/80/490/#p497\">\n    80 N.Y.2d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 497,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=591%20N.Y.S.2d%20978\">\n    591 N.Y.S.2d 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=606%20N.E.2d%201369\">\n    606 N.E.2d 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1992] ). Indeed, this Court has noted that \"[n]ot only do [punitive damages] differ in purpose and nature from compensatory damages, but they may only be awarded for exceptional misconduct which transgresses mere negligence\" (\n   <em>\n    Sharapata v. Town of Islip,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4383938\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/56/332/#p335\">\n    56 N.Y.2d 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=452%20N.Y.S.2d%20347\">\n    452 N.Y.S.2d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=437%20N.E.2d%201104\">\n    437 N.E.2d 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1982] ). Punitive damages represent punishment for wrongful conduct that goes beyond mere negligence and are warranted only where aggravating factors demonstrate an additional level of wrongful\n   conduct (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Home Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4417619\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/75/196/#p203\">\n    75 N.Y.2d at 203-204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=551%20N.Y.S.2d%20481\">\n    551 N.Y.S.2d 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=550%20N.E.2d%20930\">\n    550 N.E.2d 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Accordingly, there must be some heightened standard for such an award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff's assertion that the mitigation provisions discussed in section 8-107(13) support the argument that punitive damages are available to any employment discrimination plaintiff, without the need to show a heightened level of culpability, lacks merit. This section provides a way for an employer, when faced with vicarious\n   liability, to mitigate punitive damages, where they are otherwise warranted, if certain factors are established. Moreover, as the Second Circuit noted, that section applies only to employers' vicarious liability once the punitive damages standard has been met and cannot be read to address the standard itself (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chauca,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173695\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/86/#p90\">\n    841 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   91 n. 3 ). Nothing in that provision requires a punitive damages charge whenever liability, vicarious or direct, is demonstrated. Indeed, the dissent's assertion that a punitive damages charge is \"automatic\" is not a \"reasonably possible\" interpretation of the statute (dissenting op. at 343, 67 N.Y.S.3d at 97, 89 N.E.3d at 487).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants contend that the title VII standard for punitive damages, employed by the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Farias,\n   </em>\n   should apply (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498217\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/91/\">\n    259 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   102 ).

The title VII standard requires \"intentional discrimination ... with malice or with reckless indifference to the ... protected rights of an aggrieved individual\" and the Supreme Court has specified that \"[t]he terms 'malice' or 'reckless indifference' pertain to the employer's knowledge that it may be acting in violation of federal law, not its awareness that it is engaging in discrimination\" (\n   <em>\n    Kolstad,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248163\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/526/#p529\">\n    527 U.S. at 529-530, 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248163\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/526/#p529\">\n    119 S.Ct. 2118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   However, in 2005, subsequent to\n   <em>\n    Farias,\n   </em>\n   the City Council passed the Restoration Act, amending the Administrative Code of the City of New York to ensure that \"[t]he provisions of [the NYCHRL] shall be construed liberally ... regardless of whether federal or New York state civil and human rights laws ... have been so construed\" (Administrative Code \u00a7 8-130[a] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Expressing concern that the NYCHRL was being too strictly construed, the amendment established that similarly worded state or federal statutes may be used as interpretive aids only to the extent that the counterpart provisions are viewed \"as a floor below which the City's Human Rights law cannot fall, rather than a ceiling above which the local law cannot rise,\" and only to the extent that those state or federal law decisions may provide guidance as to the \"uniquely broad and remedial purposes\" of the local law (Local Law No. 85 [2005] of City of N.Y. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7).

The Council identified these cases in order to, among other things, \"illustrate best practices when engaging in the required analysis\" and to \"endorse the legal doctrines where they were developed pursuant to liberal construction analyses\" (New York City Council, Committee on Civil Rights, Committee Report of the Governmental Affairs Division at 9 [Mar. 8, 2016] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In contrast to the approach in\n   <em>\n    Kolstad,\n   </em>\n   the standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    Home Ins.\n   </em>\n   requires neither a showing of malice nor awareness of the violation of a protected right, representing the lowest threshold, and the least stringent form, for the state of mind required to impose punitive damages. By implementing a lower degree of culpability and eschewing the knowledge requirement, applying this standard adheres to the City Council's liberal construction mandate while remaining\n   consistent with the language of the statute (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Administrative Code \u00a7 8-502[a] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Moreover, NYCHRL violations, by their very nature, inflict serious harm \"to both the persons directly involved and the social fabric of the city as a whole\" (Rep. of Comm. on Gen.

The standard for punitive damages articulated in\n   <em>\n    Home Ins.,\n   </em>\n   while requiring an appropriate showing of heightened culpability for punitive damages consistent with the language of the provision at issue, is nevertheless properly reflective of the serious and destructive nature of the underlying discriminatory conduct and the goal of deterring \"future reprehensible conduct\" (\n   <em>\n    Ross,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5689844\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/8/478/#p489\">\n    8 N.Y.3d at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5689844\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/8/478/#p489\">\n    836 N.Y.S.2d 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5689844\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/8/478/#p489\">\n    868 N.E.2d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Furthermore, subjecting NYCHRL defendants to punitive damages under this standard encourages nondiscriminatory behavior and the development and application of appropriate employment criteria.

(dissenting).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   I agree with my colleagues' conclusion that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 title VII standard for punitive damages does not govern discrimination cases brought under the New York City Human Rights Law (NYCHRL). We part ways, however, on how the New York City Council chose to supplant it. I do not agree that the Council adopted New York's common-law standard, which is not mentioned anywhere in the NYCHRL or its legislative history. Instead, I agree with Ms. Chauca that the\n   City Council amended the NYCHRL to\n   entitle a plaintiff to a punitive damages charge whenever liability is proved, unless an employer has adopted and fully implemented the antidiscrimination programs, policies, and procedures promulgated by the Commission on Human Rights, as an augmentation to compensatory damages, and would answer the certified question accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the better part of a century, New York City has demonstrated its pioneering commitment to human rights through repeated revisions to its Human Rights Law. The City Council's Committee on Civil Rights recently described the NYCHRL as \"one of the most expansive and comprehensive human rights laws in the nation\" (Report of the Committee on Civil Rights on Local Law 35 of 2016 [2016 Report] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In the 1991 revisions, which effected a complete overhaul of that law, the City Council made clear that the NYCHRL not only served an important humanitarian objective, but also was designed to further nearly every traditional governmental purpose. Those revisions reemphasized the New York City Council's earlier finding that there is \"no greater danger to the health, morals, safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants than the existence of groups prejudiced against one another and antagonistic to each other because of their actual or perceived differences, including those based on ... gender\" (Administrative Code of City of N.Y. \u00a7 8-101 ). The revisions also focused new attention on the scourge of systemic discrimination, which \"poses a substantial threat to, and inflicts significant injury upon, the city that is economic, social and moral in character\" as well as \"distinct from the injury sustained by individuals as an incident of such discrimination\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8-401). The Council found that systemic discrimination, including systemic employment discrimination, causes economic injury to New York that \"severely diminishes its capacity to meet the needs of those persons living and working in, and visiting, the city\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). Moreover, it found that the social and moral consequences \"polarize[ ] the city's communities, demoralize[ ] its inhabitants and create[ ] disrespect for the law,\" thereby frustrating \"the city's efforts to foster mutual respect and tolerance among its inhabitants and to promote a safe and secure environment\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To better combat those ills, the 1991 revisions supplemented the preexisting administrative enforcement mechanism. Under\n   prior law, individuals could secure their own redress and prevent further municipal injuries only by bringing a complaint before the City Commission on Human Rights. Under the revised law, both those individuals and the corporation counsel were given the authority to institute a civil action without recourse to the Commission (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 8-402, 8-502). As relevant here, the NYCHRL now provides that \"any person claiming to be ... aggrieved by an unlawful discriminatory practice ... shall have a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for damages,\n   <em>\n    including punitive damages,\n   </em>\n   and for injunctive relief and such other remedies as may be appropriate\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8-502[a] [emphasis added] ). The hope of then-Mayor Dinkins was that the creation of a private right of action would \"supplement the Commission's enforcement efforts and ease a portion of its caseload burden\" (Remarks by Mayor David N. Dinkins at Public Hearing on Local Laws, June 18, 1991 at 4 [Dinkins Statement] ). The twin barrels of Commission and private enforcement were both designed to \"ensure discrimination plays no role in the public life of the City\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Achieving that goal requires ensuring that \"a person can be compensated for the\n   damages she has suffered\" and that penalties \"exert a strong deterrent effect\" against \"the harm ... bias does to the social fabric of the city\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). In addition to those and other substantive amendments, the 1991 revisions emphasized-without materially amending-the requirement that the NYCHRL must \"be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof\" (former Administrative Code \u00a7 8-130). The accompanying committee report directed our court and others to pay \"[p]articular attention\" to that obligation and found it \"imperative that restrictive interpretations of state or federal ... provisions are not imposed upon city law\" (Report of the Committee on General Welfare on Local Law 39 of 1991 [1991 Report] ). Mayor Dinkins repeated that instruction in his signing statement, which implored the judiciary to reject \"restrictive state and federal rulings\" and to \"take seriously the requirement that this law be liberally and independently construed\" (Dinkins Statement at 2). Only by following those instructions could the courts give proper force to a human rights law that was, in the words of the mayor who signed it, \"the most progressive in the nation\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Despite clear instructions, courts interpreting the NYCHRL failed to construct it liberally and independently, instead importing narrowing constructions of title VII and the Executive\n   Law. In the Local Civil Rights Restoration Act of 2005, the City Council informed the courts that they had construed the law \"too narrowly to ensure protection of the civil rights of all persons\" covered by it (Local Law No. 85 [2005] of City of N.Y. \u00a7 1). It repeated that the law must instead be construed \"independently from similar or identical provisions of New York state or federal statutes\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). It augmented the construction provision of the NYCHRL, section 8-130, to include that instruction and to further distinguish the law for its \"uniquely broad and remedial purposes\" (Administrative Code \u00a7 8-130). Finally, it amended certain other sections to supersede specific cases that had strayed from those purposes. The clear thrust of the Restoration Act is that courts should interpret the NYCHRL in the manner that best furthers its goals of protecting aggrieved individuals and the social fabric of New York City (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Rep. of Comm. on Gen. Welfare, Aug. 17, 2005, 2005 N.Y. City Legis. Ann. at 536 [2005 Report]; Testimony of Craig Gurian, Anti-Discrimination Center of Metro New York, Inc., Regarding Intro 22A [Gurian Testimony] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Those reiterated admonishments proved only partially effective. In 2016, finding that only \"some judicial decisions ha[d] correctly understood and analyzed the requirement of section 8-130,\" the Council patiently fired a third salvo in its fight to protect the NYCHRL from being subverted by the courts (Local Law No. 35 [2016] of City of N.Y. \u00a7 1). The purpose of that year's revisions was \"to provide additional guidance for the development of an independent body of jurisprudence for the New York [C]ity [H]uman [R]ights [L]aw that is maximally protective of civil rights in all circumstances\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). Consistent with that purpose, the Council amended section 8-130 to direct courts toward three decisions that best exemplified the correct approach to interpreting the law:\n   <em>\n    Albunio v.

Those decisions make clear that, as we stated in\n   <em>\n    Albunio,\n   </em>\n   courts must construe the NYCHRL \"broadly in favor of discrimination\n   plaintiffs, to the extent such a construction is reasonably possible\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3746134\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/16/472/#p477\">\n    16 N.Y.3d at 477-478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3746134\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/16/472/#p477\">\n    922 N.Y.S.2d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3746134\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/16/472/#p477\">\n    947 N.E.2d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The majority follows that interpretive guideline partway, and I join the portion of its opinion that considers and rejects\n   <em>\n    Farias\n   </em>\n   and the title VII standard in the context of the New York City Human Rights Law (\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farias v.

However, the plain language of section 8-502 and structural features of Administrative Code, title 8, chapter 1, coupled with the legislative history of the title, compel the holding that the standard for finding a defendant liable for punitive damages under the NYCHRL can be borrowed from neither federal jurisprudence\n   <em>\n    nor\n   </em>\n   our common law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the revised statute provides that a punitive damages charge is automatic on a finding of liability, that those damages must be mitigated if certain factors are established, and can be eliminated entirely by adopting such policies, programs, and procedures as are developed by the Commission on Human Rights.

Facially, then, Ms. Chauca and any similarly aggrieved individual is entitled to an award of punitive damages upon a showing of liability.

Section 8-107(1) imposes liability directly on employers for their own discriminatory conduct. Section 8-107(13)(b) additionally imposes vicarious liability\n   for employment discrimination on employers in three instances: where the offending employee exercised managerial or supervisory responsibility, where the employer knew of the offending employee's discriminatory conduct and either acquiesced in such conduct or failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action, and where the employer should have known of the offending employees' discriminatory conduct and failed to exercise reasonable diligence to prevent it (Administrative Code \u00a7 8-107[13][b] [1]-[3] ).\n   In the first two instances, an employer's demonstration of certain factors detailed in subdivision (13)(d) \"shall be considered in mitigation of the amount of civil penalties to be imposed by the commission ... or in mitigation of civil penalties or punitive damages which may be imposed pursuant to chapter four or five\"; only in the last instance can the demonstration of those factors create an actual shield to liability (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8-107[13][e] ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zakrzewska,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5716831\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/14/469/#p479\">\n    14 N.Y.3d at 479-480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5716831\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/14/469/#p479\">\n    902 N.Y.S.2d 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5716831\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/14/469/#p479\">\n    928 N.E.2d 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In all instances, were an employer to adopt and implement fully the best practices for preventing and detecting discrimination as promulgated by the Commission, the employer would be immune from punitive damages (Administrative Code \u00a7 8-107[13][f] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   That interrelated set of provisions demonstrates the Council contemplated precisely what the plain language of section 8-502 calls for: automatically charging punitive damages to the jury upon a finding of liability (unless the employer proved the immunity provided by section 8-107[13][f] ), regardless of whether an employer or employee engaged in intentional discrimination or discriminated with malice or reckless indifference to the individual's rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Absent an automatic charge, the provisions' assumption that punitive damages are available to be mitigated in any employment discrimination case, but can only be eliminated in a subset of cases, cannot make sense. In addition, using either\n   the federal or the majority's standard for awarding punitive damages would reduce subdivisions (13)(d), (e), and (f) to mere surplusage. No employer who engaged in discrimination with willful or wanton negligence, or recklessly, or displayed a conscious disregard of the rights of others-the test advocated by the majority-could hope to avail itself of those defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The majority, like the Second Circuit, disputes the relevance of these provisions because, \"even if [Ms.] Chauca were correct that the mitigation and avoidance provisions establish the presumption that punitive damages are always available in cases of imputed liability, this would not answer the question of the punitive damages standard for liability based on an employer's own actions\" (\n   <em>\n    Chauca v.

The consequence of their argument, however, is that employers would be automatically subject to punitive damages when they are merely vicariously liable for discrimination pursuant to section 8-107(13), but unlikely to face them when directly liable under section 8-107(1). That is, under the majority's interpretation, if an employer had an outright policy of discrimination, punitive damages would be assessed under the higher common-law standard, but if the employer was only vicariously liable for an employee's discriminatory\n   conduct, punitive damages would automatically attach, subject to possible mitigation. That perverse result cannot have been the City Council's intention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, as reflected in section 8-107(13)(e), the NYCHRL often treats punitive damages under chapter 5 in the same breath as civil penalties under chapter 1. In the latter case, the Commission may \"vindicate the public interest\" by imposing a considerable fine without first proving the discrimination was \"willful, wanton or malicious\" (Administrative Code \u00a7 8-126 [a] ). If punitive damages are to function as the private cause of action analogue to the Commission's civil penalties, they must be awarded, similarly, without a showing of enhanced culpability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, structural features of the NYCHRL militate in favor of interpreting it to require an automatic\n   charge. Taken together with the plain meaning of section 8-502, those features make that interpretation more plausible than the majority's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The interpretation is all the more plausible for accomplishing the purposes of the NYCHRL in a familiar and easily administrable way. The method is familiar because other statutes that, like the NYCHRL, are intended to encourage civil actions by private attorneys general automatically award damages in excess of compensatory damages. For instance, treble damages are automatic under the federal antitrust laws and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, simply on a finding of liability; indeed, intent is not an element of civil violations of the antitrust laws, whereas it is a necessary element of title VII. The method is easily administrable because it forgoes instructing a jury in the niceties of the common-law standard for\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   punitive damages should be awarded, and instead charges them only with calculating an appropriate\n   <em>\n    amount.\n   </em>\n   The New York Pattern Jury Instructions, which already bifurcate the guidance for determining whether punitive damages should be awarded and the guidance for deciding the amount of the award, contain a list of factors relevant to that calculation. It would be a simple matter to charge each jury, rather than only those that satisfy the majority's test, to consider that list, the specific mitigating factors elaborated in section 8-107(13)(d), and the standard language regarding proportionality to the harm, to compensatory damages, and to the defendant's financial condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In refusing to countenance the efficacy of this approach, the majority must mean that it disagrees with the policy judgment made by the City Council-that it believes entitling additional successful plaintiffs to awards that exceed their actual damages is a bad idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Although the preceding interpretation is in derogation of the \"well-established principle of statutory construction that words of technical or special meaning are used by the legislature, 'not\n   loosely, but with\n   regard for their established legal significance,' \" such departures are permitted when \"unmistakably intended\" (majority op. at 330-331, 67 N.Y.S.3d at 88-89, 89 N.E.3d at 478-79, quoting\n   <em>\n    People v.

The 2016 committee report described the most recent revisions as requiring courts to apply the liberal construction provision \"in every case and with respect to every issue\" and to understand that \"legal doctrine might need to be revised to comport with the requirements of \u00a7 8-130\" (2016 Report at 8-9, 13). \"[T]here are no provisions of the law\n   <em>\n    or judge-made doctrines\n   </em>\n   that stand outside the liberal construction requirements\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 [emphasis added] ).

Although the majority employs the version of that standard extant at the time the 1991 revisions introduced punitive damages into the NYCHRL, a better way to protect against the drafters' fear that the law would be \"automatically ratcheted down\" would be to adopt the reading of it supported in part II (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gurian Testimony at 3).\n   That reading is the one that best serves the purpose of the successive revisions to the NYCHRL, which must be construed in the manner most favorable to discrimination plaintiffs (and, thus, to the commonwealth). As we have seen, that purpose is to be \"maximally protective of civil rights in all circumstances\" by \" 'meld[ing] the broadest vision of social justice with the strongest law enforcement deterrent' \" (Local Law 35 \u00a7 1; 2016 Report at 11, quoting\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3936942\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/61/62/\">\n    61 A.D.3d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3916902,3936942\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/872/27/\">\n    872 N.Y.S.2d 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). If, as amici explain, punitive damages are the only effective deterrent because employers carry insurance against compensatory damages and attorney's fees, but cannot obtain it for punitive damages as a matter of New York's public policy, then only by automatically imposing those damages with allowances for mitigating factors and immunity for full compliance with Commission policies can the NYCHRL achieve its \"very specific vision\" of \"no tolerance for discrimination in public life\" (2016 Report at 8;\n   <em>\n    Home Ins.

Rejecting this Court's decision to authorize attorney's fees only in the same narrow circumstances as the federal statute, that act updated the NYCHRL with a bespoke definition of \"prevailing\" that awarded fees to considerably more plaintiffs and thereby encouraged more rigorous enforcement (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Administrative Code \u00a7 8-502[g]; 2005 Report). That update, like all of the substantive 2005 amendments, was meant to \"illustrate\" desirable changes to the law (\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3936942\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/61/62/\">\n    61 A.D.3d at 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3916902,3936942\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/872/27/\">\n    872 N.Y.S.2d 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The expanded construction provision was intended, in the same vein, to \"obviat[e] the need for wholesale textual revision of the myriad specific substantive provisions of the law\" by the legislature and \"accelerate the process by which other doctrines inconsistent with the commands of [the] Restoration Act are abandoned\" (2016 Report at 9, 11; 2005 Report).
