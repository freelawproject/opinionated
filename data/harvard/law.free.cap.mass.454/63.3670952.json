L. c. 149, \u00a7 148 (Wage Act or \u00a7 148), when applied to an employee who is involuntarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>terminated. See <em>Electronic Data Sys. Corp. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>440 Mass. 1020 (2003) <em>(EDS I). </em>Giving deference to the Attorney General\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the Wage Act and in agreement with the Superior Court judge and the division of administrative law appeals (DALA), we conclude that the statute requires such an employee to be paid for unused vacation time remaining at the time of involuntary discharge; and that because the EDS policy does not provide for such payment, it contravenes the Wage Act. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AM7\"><em>Background. </em>The facts are not contested. Francis Tessicini was an employee of EDS or one of its predecessor companies for twenty-one years, from 1984 to 2005. On April 8, 2005, EDS eliminated Tessicini\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"ApX\">EDS\u2019s written vacation pay policy (vacation pay policy, or policy), as updated on July 30, 2004, provides that beyond the first year of employment, the amount of an employee\u2019s paid vacation time is based on the number of full calendar years he or she has worked for EDS or one of its predecessor companies. Under the policy, a person who has been employed for twenty years or more is eligible for five weeks of paid vacation per calendar year, to be used by December 31 of that year or lost.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The policy further provides that \u201cvacation time is not earned and does not accrue. If you leave EDS, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, you will not be paid for unused vacation time (unless otherwise required by state law).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">At the time of his discharge on April 8, Tessicini had used only one day of vacation in calendar year 2005. Pursuant to its vacation pay policy, when EDS discharged Tessicini, it did not pay him for any part of his unused vacation time. On May 5, 2005, Tessicini filed a written complaint with the Attorney General\u2019s fair labor division, alleging that EDS owed him vacation payments under the Wage Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Attorney General issued a citation that, as amended, required payment of $1,799.70 to Tessicini, and assessed a civil penalty of $3,490 for intentional failure to make timely payment of wages. EDS appealed from the citation to DALA, which issued a written decision affirming the citation, but calculating the payment owed to Tessicini.as $1,970.95.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> EDS then sought review of DALA\u2019s order in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Ruling on EDS\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, a judge in the Superior Court denied the motion and affirmed DALA\u2019s decision. EDS appealed, and we granted its application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (c), EDS challenges DALA\u2019s decision affirming the Attorney General\u2019s citation, and the citation itself, as being based on an error of law. We review questions of law in administrative decisions de novo. <em>Belhumeur </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>432 Mass. 458, 463 (2000), cert, denied, 532 U.S. 904 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The Wage Act provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">\u201cEvery person having employees in his service shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>pay weekly or bi-weekly each such employee the wages earned by him to within six days of the termination of the pay period during which the wages were earned if employed for five or six days in a calendar week . . . ; <em>and any employee discharged from such employment shall be paid in full on the day of his discharge </em>.... <em>The word \u2018wages\u2019 shall include any holiday or vacation payments due an employee under an oral or written agreement. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\"><em>\u201cNo person shall by a special contract with an employee or by any other means exempt himself from this section . . </em>.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148. The parties offer differing interpretations of these statutory provisions. EDS argues that because \u201cvacation payments\u201d under the Wage Act\u2019s partial definition of \u201cwages\u201d are only those \u201cdue\u201d under the terms of an oral or written employment agreement, the agreement may restrict or limit an employee\u2019 s right to those payments without violating the Act\u2019s \u201cspecial contracts\u201d clause. Applying that interpretation to this case, EDS claims that under the language of \u00a7 148, no payment is \u201cdue\u201d Tessicini \u201cunder [the] written agreement,\u201d <em>id., </em>where its policy explicitly provides that employees leaving EDS on a voluntary or involuntary basis will not be paid for unused vacation time. The Attorney General, in turn, argues that, once Tes-sicini had accumulated vacation time according to the vacation pay policy, it became \u201cdue\u201d under the definition of \u201cwages,\u201d and therefore constituted \u201cwages earned,\u201d which \u00a7 148 mandates must be paid in full on the day of his discharge; the Attorney General considers the portion of EDS\u2019s vacation pay policy denying payment for unused vacation time to constitute an unenforceable \u201cspecial contract\u201d under the \u201cspecial contracts\u201d clause of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">In <em>EDS I, </em>which concerned an earlier version of the EDS vacation pay policy that was worded slightly differently, the same parties offered the same interpretations of the Wage Act that they present here. <em>EDS I, 440 </em>Mass, at 1020-1021. At that time, EDS\u2019s policy stated, \u201cIf you <em>leave </em>the company, you do not receive vacation pay for unused vacation <em>time\u201d </em>(emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 1020. Construing the policy against EDS as the drafter, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>concluded that the policy reasonably could be read to require forfeiture of unused vacation time only for employees who voluntarily left employment. <em>Id. </em>at 1021. Because the employee in <em>EDS I </em>was involuntarily terminated, we did not reach the interpretive question whether the Wage Act permits an employer not to pay an employee for unused vacation time when he or she is involuntarily terminated. <em>Id. </em>at 1021-1022. Following <em>EDS </em>/, EDS modified the wording of its policy to make clear that employees leaving involuntarily also forfeit unused vacation time. This case, arising under the modified policy, presents the question we earlier left open.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">As EDS and the Attorney General recognize, the critical phrase in \u00a7 148 is the partial definition of \u201cwages\u201d: \u201cThe word \u2018wages\u2019 shall include any holiday or vacation payments due an employee under an oral or written agreement.\u201d Given its express reference to what is \u201cdue\u201d to the employee under an \u201cagreement,\u201d we begin with a review of the vacation pay policy itself. As the Superior Court judge noted, there are contradictions in the policy. While the policy does state, in connection with its provision refusing payment for unused vacation time if an employee leaves or is terminated, that \u201cvacation time is not earned,\u201d the structure of and other language in the policy indicate otherwise. The policy states that employees are eligible for \u201cvacation pay\u201d (emphasis added) based on the number of hours worked each week and, after the first year, ties the number of paid vacation weeks for which an employee is eligible to the number of years the employee \u201cha[s] worked\u201d for EDS. The clear import of these provisions is that paid vacation at EDS is earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Against this background, we turn to the interpretive task at hand, namely, the meaning of \u00a7 148. We do not do so in a vacuum. In 1999, pursuant to the Attorney General\u2019s exclusive authority to enforce G. L. c. 149, the Attorney General issued Advisory 99/1, an advisory regarding the Wage Act\u2019s treatment of employers\u2019 vacation policies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The advisory states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">\u201cEmployers who choose to provide paid vacation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>their employees must treat those payments like any other wages under [the Wage Act]. . . . Like wages, the vacation time promised to an-employee is compensation for services which vests as the employee\u2019s services are rendered. Upon separation from employment, employees must be compensated by their employers for vacation time earned \u2018under an oral or written agreement.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1. In a section titled \u201cNo Forfeiture of Earned Vacation Time,\u201d the advisory states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">\u201cSince [the Wage Act] provides for the timely payment of all wages earned, an employer may not enter into an agreement with an employee under which the employee forfeits earned wages, including vacation payments. Examples of these agreements are vacation policies that condition the payment of vacation time on continuous employment or that require that employees provide notices to quit. Employees who have performed work and leave or are fired, whether for cause or not, are entitled to pay for all the time worked up to the termination of their employment, including any earned, unused vacation time payments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 2. The advisory further provides that an employer may require employees to \u201cuse all of their accumulated vacation time by a certain period of time or lose all or part of it,\u201d but that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">\u201cUnder such policies, the employer must provide adequate prior notice of the policy to employees and must ensure that employees have a reasonable opportunity to use the accumulated vacation time within the time limits established by the employer. Otherwise, a cap on accrual or a \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 policy may result in an illegal forfeiture of earned wages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 3. Finally, the advisory provides that, unless another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>schedule is specified in the agreement, vacation time is earned according to the time period in which the employee actually works:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">\u201cFor example, if an employee is to receive twelve vacation days \u2018in a year,\u2019 and the employee voluntarily or involuntarily terminates his or her employment after ten months ... the employee would be entitled to ten vacation days</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The duty of statutory interpretation is for the courts, to be sure, but \u201c[ijnsofar as the Attorney General\u2019s office is the department charged with enforcing the wage and hour laws, its interpretation of the protections provided thereunder is entitled to substantial deference, at least where it is not inconsistent with the plain language of the statutory provisions.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Winter Place LLC, </em>447 Mass. 363, 367-368 (2006) (discussing Attorney General advisory interpreting G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148A). See <em>Felix A. Marino Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>426 Mass. 458, 460 (1998) (deferring to commissioner in interpreting ambiguous term in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The Wage Act does not require employers to provide their employees with paid vacation. As the advisory reflects, however, the Attorney General interprets the Wage Act to mean that when an employer does provide for paid vacation and an employee is entitled to paid vacation under the terms of an employment agreement, the entitlement is another form of compensation, and becomes \u201cdue\u201d day by day as the employee performs his or her duties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It can be lost by disuse, but if an employee is \u201cdischarged from . . . employment,\u201d the value of the vacation benefit earned up to that date and that would still be available if the employee remained at the job must be \u201cpaid in full on the day of his discharge.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>EDS argues that the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 148 is unreasonable for several reasons. First, EDS asserts that \u201cthe Wage Act is merely the method by which private agreements regarding vacation policies may be enforced,\u201d and therefore that the provision of the Wage Act dealing with vacation payments as \u201cwages\u201d comes into play only where an employer violates its own policy. We do not agree. The Wage Act is intended to protect employees and their right to wages. See <em>Wiedmann </em>v. <em>The Bradford Group, Inc., </em>444 Mass. 698, 703 (2005); <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>435 Mass. 718, 720 (2002) (clear purpose of Wage Act is to prevent unreasonable detention of wages). See also <em>Cumpata </em>v. <em>Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., </em>113 F. Supp. 2d 164, 168 (D. Mass. 2000) (Wage Act \u201cmeant to protect employees from the dictates and whims of shrewd employers\u201d). As its \u201cspecial contracts\u201d clause recognizes, the Wage Act would have little value if employers could exempt themselves simply by drafting contracts that placed compensation outside its bounds \u2014 as EDS attempted to do, when it stated that \u201cvacation time is not earned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">EDS also contends that the legislative history of the Wage Act reveals a clear intent not to require vacation payments on termination unless the particular employment agreement so stipulates. The language in the Wage Act partially defining \u201cwages\u201d and addressing vacation payments was added in 1966. St. 1966, c. 319. EDS points out, correctly, that 1966 House Doc. No. 199, proposing to add to \u00a7 148 the language, \u201c[t]he term \u2018wages\u2019 shall include any holiday or vacation payments due an employee,\u201d was initially rejected, and then was accepted with the modifying language \u201cunder an agreement oral or written\u201d inserted. See 1966 House J. 1211-1212, 1441. Contrary to EDS, we derive no clear guidance from this sparse historical record. The addition of the modifying phrase may well have been considered necessary to clarify that the \u201choliday or vacation payments\u201d amendment to the Wage Act did not create an independent statutory duty to provide paid holiday or vacation time, or that an employer could provide for paid holiday or vacation benefits to its employees in oral as well as written employment agreements. Certainly, this legislative history in itself does not evince a clear intent to allow employers free rein to deny or condition earned \u201cvacation payments\u201d in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>way they choose, so long as they include the language to do so in an employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">EDS further argues that the Attorney General\u2019s position is incompatible with the policy, included within the same advisory, that an employer may require employees to \u201cuse all of their accumulated vacation time by a certain period of time or lose all or part of it.\u201d Advisory 99/1, at 3. In EDS\u2019s view, this position shows that the Attorney General did not consider entitlement to paid vacation time to be the equivalent of earned wages, or else it could not be lost if unused. However, as quoted previously, the advisory permits loss of accrued vacation time only where the employee has a reasonable opportunity to use (and be paid for) that time. <em>Id. </em>The Attorney General has therefore adopted a consistent view that an employee earns, by his or her service, the right to take paid vacation; the employee may lose the right through voluntary nonuse, but if an employer interferes with the employee\u2019s ability to use it, for example by discharging the employee, the employer must pay the value of the earned vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The Attorney General\u2019s interpretation is not the only meaning that could be attached to the phrase \u201cvacation payments due . . . under an [employment] agreement\u201d in \u00a7 148. For example, the term \u201cvacation payments\u201d could refer exclusively to payment for vacation already taken, and not include payment for unused vacation time at termination. However, the Attorney General\u2019s reading of \u00a7 148 is a reasonable one, at least as applied to an employee who, like Tessicini, has earned and is entitled to paid vacation time under the terms of his employment agreement and who is involuntarily \u201cdischarged.\u201d Accordingly, we defer to her interpretation. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Winter Place LLC, </em>447 Mass, at 367-368; <em>Felix A. Marino Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>426 Mass, at 461 (deferring to implementing agency\u2019s definition where statutory term was \u201cambiguous\u201d and \u201cfairly debatable\u201d). We do not reach the question whether the Wage Act requires an employee who leaves a job voluntarily, with earned vacation time unused, to be paid for that earned and unused vacation time.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-7\">We acknowledge the amicus brief of New England Legal Foundation, Associated Industries of Massachusetts, and Retailers Association of Massachusetts in support of EDS; and the amicus briefs of Greater Boston Legal Services and the National Employment Lawyers Association, Massachusetts Chapter, in support of the Attorney General.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b86-8\">In particular, the policy states:</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">\u201cAfter your first calendar year of employment, you are eligible for vacation as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">\u201cIf you have worked for EDS this You can take this many number of full calendar years: days of vacation:</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">1 year to 9 years 10 years to 19 years 20 years and beyond 3 weeks per calendar year 4 weeks per calendar year 5 weeks per calendar year</p>\n<p id=\"b86-15\">\u201cIf you are a salaried employee, any unused vacation expires on December 31 and may not be carried forward, subject to state law exceptions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b87-9\">The fair labor division was then known as the fair labor and business practices division.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b87-10\">The payment to Tessicini was calculated by prorating his five weeks of vacation per year over the fourteen weeks he had worked, and subtracting the day of vacation he actually took, requiring EDS to pay his salary for 5.75 vacation days. EDS does not challenge the figure arrived at by DALA as to that payment. EDS does argue, in a short footnote and without citation, that there is no basis for the civil penalty assessed. The footnote does not rise to the level of appellate argument, and we deem the argument waived. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lydon, </em>413 Mass. 309, 317-318 (1992), citing Mass. R. A.
