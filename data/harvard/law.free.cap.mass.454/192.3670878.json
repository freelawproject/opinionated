The plaintiffs, John A. Feeney and Ded-ham Health and Athletic Complex (Dedham Health), appeal from an order of a judge in the Superior Court compelling arbitration of their claims \u2014 brought as a putative class action \u2014 alleging that Dell improperly collected Massachusetts sales tax on the purchase of optional service contracts sold in connection with the purchase of Dell computers when (according to the plaintiffs) no such tax was due, and that the collection of such tax violated the Massachusetts consumer protection act, G. L. c. 93 A. We conclude that the provision compelling individual arbitration in the plaintiffs\u2019 consumer contracts is not enforceable because it is contrary to the fundamental public policy of the Commonwealth favoring consumer class actions under G. L. c. 93A. We also conclude, however, for reasons we shall explain, that because the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not contain sufficient allegations to make out a claim under G. L. c. 93A, it should be dismissed without prejudice. We reverse the order compelling arbitration and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>We summarize the relevant facts from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision and from undisputed facts in the record. Dell Catalog Sales Limited Partnership (Dell Catalog) and Dell Marketing Limited Partnership (Dell Marketing), wholly owned subsidiaries of Dell Inc. (formerly Dell Computer Corporation), sold computers and related products to consumers and businesses and, in connection with such sales, also sold optional computer hardware service contracts under which Banc-Tec, Inc. (BancTec); QualxServ LLC; or Dell Marketing agreed to provide onsite computer repairs to the purchasers. Feeney and Dedham Health purchased Dell computer hardware from Dell Catalog and Dell Marketing, respectively, and optional service contracts provided by either Dell Marketing or BancTec.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dell Catalog and Dell Marketing collected sales tax on the plaintiffs\u2019 respective optional service contracts, totaling $13.65 from Feeney and $215.55 from Dedham Health.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The \u201cDell Terms and Conditions of Sale\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (terms)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in effect at the time of the plaintiffs\u2019 purchases contain an arbitration clause compelling arbitration of any claim <em>against </em>Dell (but not binding Dell in connection with any claims it may have against a customer) and mandating that any such claims be arbitrated on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>individual basis.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Specifically, the terms provide that claims against Dell \u201carising from or relating to this Agreement\u201d shall be resolved \u201cexclusively and finally\u201d by arbitration, and that the arbitration \u201cwill be limited solely to the dispute or controversy between Customer and Dell.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The effect of these provisions is to prohibit a Dell customer from participating in a class action \u2014 whether by litigation or arbitration \u2014 against Dell.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ACR\">The terms also include a choice-of-law provision that provides: \u201cThis agreement and any sales thereunder shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflicts of laws rules.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>2. <em>Prior proceedings, </em>a. <em>Prearbitration. </em>Feeney commenced a putative class action against Dell Computer Corporation (Dell Computer) in March, 2003,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> alleging that its \u201cdeliberate and systematic practice\u201d of charging and collecting from plaintiffs and other Massachusetts residents monies falsely characterized as a lawful sales tax on the purchase of optional service contracts for computers constituted \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 93A and regulations issued by the Attorney General of Massachusetts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Asserting that they and other Massachusetts customers had suffered damages because Dell Computer caused them to pay monies for a \u201ctax\u201d that had not been imposed by any Massachusetts taxing authority, the plaintiffs sought relief under provisions of the consumer protection act providing for class actions, G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 (2)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and 11.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> On July 3, 2003, Dell Computer moved to stay the proceedings and to compel arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4 (2000). The plaintiffs responded that the prohibition on class actions in the arbitration clause was unconscionable and undermined \u201cthe very purpose of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act.\u201d The motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>compel arbitration should be denied, they argued, because, inter aha, the terms unilaterally preclude class actions. A judge in the Superior Court allowed Dell Computer\u2019s motion to compel arbitration without decision, and the plaintiffs sought interlocutory review pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A single justice of the Appeals Court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 petition.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">b. <em>Arbitration. </em>Unable to appeal from the decision of the single justice, see <em>Ashford </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>421 Mass. 563, 566-567 (1995), Feeney and Dedham Health each filed a claim of arbitration \u201cunder protest\u201d in November, 2004.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Their requests for class certification were denied by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>arbitrator of the National Arbitration Forum (NAF). Relying on the provisions of the Dell terms and on \u201c[cjlear rules of contract interpretation and construction,\u201d the arbitrator concluded that \u201cclass action relief has been waived, by the parties\u201d and was not available in the arbitration despite the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201ccompelling arguments in favor of this relief.\u201d The arbitrator conducted a consolidated hearing on the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 individual claims, ruled in favor of the defendants on the merits,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 respective claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">c. <em>Postarbitration. </em>In February, 2008, the plaintiffs moved in the Superior Court to vacate the arbitration award and to reconsider the orders allowing the defendants\u2019 motion to compel arbitration. The defendants responded by moving to confirm the arbitration award and to dismiss the case. A different judge denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motions, allowed the defendants\u2019 motion,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and dismissed the case with prejudice. The plaintiffs appealed, and we granted their application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">3. <em>Jurisdiction and standard of review. </em>The defendants argue that because the arbitrator declined the plaintiffs\u2019 request to certify a class, that decision may not now be reviewed. We reject the argument. Although the plaintiffs disagree with the arbitrator\u2019s decision declining to certify a class, their challenge here is to the order compelling arbitration in the first instance, and the plaintiffs thus present a \u201cgateway dispute about whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>parties are bound by a given arbitration clause,\u201d an issue for judicial resolution. <em>In re Am. Express Merchants\u2019 Litig., </em>554 F.3d 300, 311 (2d Cir. 2009), quoting <em>Howsam </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>537 U.S. 79, 84 (2002). Where, as here, the plaintiffs challenge the enforceability of a class action prohibition embedded in a binding arbitration clause, they are \u201cplainly\u201d challenging \u201cthe validity of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate,\u201d and a court is the appropriate forum for such a challenge. <em>In re Am. Express Merchants\u2019 Litig., supra. </em>See <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cardegna, </em>546 U.S. 440, 445 (2006), quoting <em>Prima Paint Corp. </em>v. <em>Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg.

See <em>Kristian </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., </em>446 F.3d 25, 31 (1st Cir. 2006) (evaluating District Court\u2019s denial of motion to compel arbitration de novo).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ApQ\">4. <em>Public policy. </em>The plaintiffs argue that the class action prohibition in Dell\u2019s terms \u201ccontravenes Massachusetts public policy.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We agree. It is \u201cuniversally accepted\u201d that public policy sometimes outweighs the interest in freedom of contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>and in such cases the contract will not be enforced. <em>Beacon Hill Civic Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Ristorante Toscano, Inc., </em>422 Mass. 318, 321 (1996), citing <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>382 Mass. 398, 413 (1982); <em>Broussard </em>v. <em>Melong, </em>322 Mass. 560, 561 (1948); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 179 (1981); 6A A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1375 (1962); and 6 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 12:4 (R. Lord 4th ed. 1995). See A.Z. v. <em>B.Z., </em>431 Mass. 150, 160 (2000) (\u201cIt is well established that courts will not enforce contracts that violate pubhc policy\u201d). See also <em>id. </em>at 160 n.24 (noting numerous cases in which this court has \u201cin a variety of contexts\u201d refused to enforce contracts because of conflict with pubhc policy). \u201c \u2018Public policy\u2019 in this context refers to a court\u2019s conviction, grounded in legislation and precedent, that denying enforcement of a contractual term is necessary to protect some aspect of the pubhc welfare.\u201d <em>Beacon Hill Civic Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Ristorante Toscano, Inc., supra, </em>citing <em>Somerset Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co., </em>420 Mass. 422, 431 (1995). See <em>A.Z. </em>v. <em>B.Z., supra </em>at 160-161, citing <em>Capazzoli </em>v. <em>Holzwasser, </em>397 Mass. 158, 160 (1986) (we \u201clook to the expressions of the Legislature and to those of this court\u201d to determine pubhc pohcy).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Here, expressions of three branches of Massachusetts government indicate that the pubhc pohcy of the Commonwealth strongly favors G. L. c. 93A class actions. First, the Legislature has expressly provided for such mechanisms, G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 (2) &amp; 11, and, as we discuss <em>infra, </em>the legislative history of those enactments demonstrates that the Legislature specifically intended to provide for the vindication of small-value claims. We have, in turn, recognized that G. L. c. 93A, and in particular, the class action provision in \u00a7 9 (2), \u201cwas designed to meet a pressing need for an effective private remedy,\u201d <em>Baldassari </em>v. <em>Public Fin. Trust, </em>369 Mass. 33, 40-41 (1975). This court has cautioned that a judge deciding a request for class certification under \u00a7 9 (2) \u201cmust\u201d bear in mind this \u201cpressing need,\u201d and that \u201ctraditional technicalities are not to be read into the statute in such a way as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>to impede the accomplishment of substantial justice.\u201d <em>Aspinall </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Cos., </em>442 Mass. 381, 391-392 (2004), quoting <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Gas Co., </em>394 Mass. 595, 605-606 (1985). This court has also recognized that the requirements for class certification under the statutory class action provision in \u00a7 9 (2) are easier to satisfy than under Mass. R. Civ. P 23, 365 Mass. 767 (1974). See <em>Ciardi </em>v. <em>F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd., </em>436 Mass. 53, 62-63 n.17 (2002) (provisions of rule 23 are \u201cmore burdensome\u201d than those of \u00a7 9 [2]); <em>Baldassari </em>v. <em>Public Fin. Trust, supra </em>at 40 (G. L. c. 93A \u201chas a more mandatory tone. We do not believe that the subsequent adoption of Rule 23 was intended to curtail any remedial rights granted by the statute\u201d). Finally, the Attorney General, on behalf of the Commonwealth, has filed an amicus brief in this case asserting that the Dell class action prohibition \u201cviolates the public policy in favor of class actions\u201d reflected in G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The legislative history of G. L. c. 93A further demonstrates that its class action provisions evidence a strong public policy in favor of the aggregation of small consumer protection claims. When originally enacted in 1967, G. L. c. 93A contained no provision for private remedies; only the Attorney General was empowered to bring enforcement proceedings. <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 688, 697-698 (1975). As a result of the number of complaints lodged with the Attorney General, \u201cit became clear that private remedies were needed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 699. As a result, G. L. c. 93A was amended in 1969, see St. 1969, c. 690, to provide for an \u201ceffective private remedy.\u201d <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., supra </em>at 699-700. Recognizing that \u201ccauses for which advocates cannot be obtained are, in effect, not adjudicadle,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 699, quoting Eovaldi, Justice for Consumers: The Mechanisms of Redress, 66 Nw. U.L. Rev. 281, 286 (1971), the 1969 amendments to G. L. c. 93A included provisions for a minimum recovery, attorney\u2019s fees, treble damages in certain cases, and most relevant to this case, class actions.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., supra </em>at 699-700. In other words, because the need for class actions for c. 93A claims had been \u201cmost persuasively demonstrated,\u201d Rice, New Private Remedies for Consumers: The Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ment of Chapter 93A, 54 Mass. L.Q. 307, 315 (1969),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the purpose of amending the statute was to \u201cprovide an effective private consumer remedy\u201d by overcoming the hurdle of \u201ceconomic limitations to the litigation of an otherwise valid claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307. Permitting consumers to sue as a class cured the defect inherent in the consumer protection statute that no matter how egregiously a consumer might have been wronged, \u201cthe economics of a litigation designed to seek redress precluded an effective attack.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The right to a class action in a consumer protection case is of particular importance where, as here, aggregation of small claims is likely the only realistic option for pursuing a claim. See <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 151, 164 (1985), quoting Rice, <em>supra </em>at 316 (\u201cone of the basic purposes\u201d of G. L. c. 93A was to provide \u201ca device for vindicating claims which, taken individually, are too small to justify legal action but which are of significant size if taken as a group\u201d). See also <em>Amchem Prods., Inc. </em>v. <em>Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617 </em>(1997), quoting <em>Mace </em>v. <em>Van Ru Credit Corp., </em>109 F.3d 338, 344 (7th Cir. 1997) (\u201cThe policy at the very core of the class action mechanism is to overcome the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights. A class action solves this problem by aggregating the relatively paltry potential recoveries into something worth someone\u2019s [usually an attorney\u2019s] labor\u201d). Dell\u2019s class action prohibition undermines this policy and, in so doing, defeats \u201cthe presumption\u201d that arbitration provides \u201ca fair and adequate mechanism for enforcing statutory rights.\u201d <em>Kristian </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., </em>446 F.3d 25, 54 (1st Cir. 2006), quoting <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>170 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 1999). See <em>Kristian </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., supra </em>at 54-55, quoting Gil\u00edes, Opting out of Liability: The Forthcoming, Near-Total Demise of the Modern Class Action, 104 Mich. L. Rev. 373, 407 (2005) (\u201cThe class mechanism ban \u2014 \u2018particularly its implicit ban on spreading across multiple plaintiffs the costs of experts, depositions, neutrals\u2019 fees, and other disbursements\u2019 \u2014 forces the putative class member \u2018to assume financial burdens so prohibitive as to deter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the bringing of claims\u2019 \u201d); <em>Carnegie </em>v. <em>Household Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 656, 661 (7th Cir. 2004) (\u201cThe realistic alternative to a class action is not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits, as only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Dunlap </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>211 W. Va. 549, 562 (2002), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Freidman\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>West Va. ex rel. Dunlap, </em>537 U.S. 1087 (2002) (class action remedies are effective at addressing \u201csmall-dollar/ high volume\u201d illegality; \u201c[i]n many cases, the availability of class action relief is a sine qua non to permit the adequate vindication of consumer rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Permitting Dell to prohibit class actions against it through its contracts with its customers would be counter to our public policy for two additional reasons. First, it undermines the public interest in deterring wrongdoing. See <em>Salvas </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>452 Mass. 337, 371-372 (2008), quoting 2 A. Conte &amp; H.B. Newberg, Class Actions \u00a7 4.36, at 314 (4th ed. 2002) (\u201cClass actions were designed not only to compensate victimized group members, but also to deter violations of the law, especially when small individual claims are involved\u201d); <em>In re Am. Express Merchants\u2019 Litig., </em>554 F.3d 300, 320 (2d Cir. 2009) (allowing enforcement of class action waiver in credit card acceptance agreement would grant corporation \u201cde facto immunity from antitrust liability by removing the plaintiffs\u2019 only reasonably feasible means of recovery\u201d); <em>Dale </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., </em>498 F.3d 1216, 1224 (11th Cir. 2007) (\u201cCorporations should not be permitted to use class action waivers as a means to exculpate themselves from liability for small-value claims\u201d). Second, the loss of an individual consumer\u2019s right to bring a class action negatively affects the rights of those unnamed class members on whose behalf the class action would proceed. In this sense, the right to participate in a class action under G. L. c. 93A is a public \u2014 not merely a private \u2014 right: it protects the rights of consumers as a whole. See <em>Muhammad </em>v. <em>County Bank, </em>189 N.J. 1, 20 (2006) (\u201cwithout the availability of a class-action mechanism, many consumer-fraud victims may never realize that they may have been wronged\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The defendants argue that Feeney and Dedham Health have not made a sufficient showing that the class action mechanism is necessary for them to obtain relief for their statutory rights under G. L. c. 93A. They point out, with some force, that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>is here no attempt to displace a statutory scheme, as was the case in <em>Beacon Hill Civic Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Ristorante Toscano, Inc., </em>422 Mass. 318, 321-323 (1996). The argument is nevertheless unavailing. The claimed damages here are small (Feeney claims damages of $13.65, and Dedham Health claims damages of $215.55), and we need not engage \u201cin an exhaustive analysis\u201d to determine that the costs of bringing such claims are \u201cprohib\u00edtive.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Fis<em>er </em>v. <em>Dell Computer Corp., </em>144 N.M. 464, 469 (2008). It is sufficient that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are of a class of disputes that \u201cpredictably involve small amounts of damages.\u201d <em>Discover Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>36 Cal. 4th 148, 162 (2005). The defendants\u2019 argument that the statutory availability of attorney\u2019s fees, damages, and multiple damages to a prevailing plaintiff under G. L. c. 93A would \u201cenable the plaintiffs to vindicate valid claims without a class action\u201d is unpersuasive; these statutory provisions are not sufficient to ensure that a consumer or business with a small-value claim will be able to find an attorney willing to take the case absent the ability to aggregate claims. See <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>42 Cal. 4th 443, 464 (2007), quoting <em>Discover Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra </em>at 162 (rejecting \u201cunsupported assertions\u201d of some courts that, \u201cin the case of small individual recovery, attorney fees are an adequate substitute\u201d for class actions); <em>Muhammad </em>v. <em>County Bank, supra </em>at 21 (where damages sought by plaintiff and those she seeks to represent are small, \u201cavailability of attorney\u2019s fees is illusory if it is unlikely that counsel would be willing to undertake the representation\u201d). This is the import of the Legislature\u2019s 1969 amendment of G. L. c. 93A to provide for class actions in addition to statutory damages and attorney\u2019s fees. Finally, as the legislative history of G. L. c. 93A makes clear, the availability of the Attorney General\u2019s enforcement authority is also not sufficient to ensure that the goals of the statute are realized.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Kristian </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., supra </em>at 59 (\u201cWhen Congress enacts a statute that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>provides for both private and administrative enforcement actions, Congress envisions a role for both types of enforcement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AxJ\">We decline to enforce a prohibition on class actions in a consumer contract where to do so would in effect sanction a waiver of the right to proceed in a class action under G. L. c. 93A. Allowing companies that do business in Massachusetts, with its strong commitment to consumer protection legislation, to insulate themselves from small value consumer claims creates the potential for countless customers to be without an effective method to vindicate their statutory rights, a result clearly at odds with our public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"AlR\">The defendants\u2019 argument that a class action prohibition is not contrary to \u201cany Massachusetts policy\u201d because such a prohibition is \u201cinherent\u201d in an agreement to arbitrate is misplaced. First, the argument\u2019s premise, that arbitration and class actions are incompatible, is undermined by the reality \u2014 which defendants acknowledge \u2014 that class arbitrations do in fact occur. See <em>In re Am. Express Merchants\u2019Litig., supra </em>at 310 n.7, quoting Clancy, An Uninvited Guest: Class Arbitration and the Federal Arbitration Act\u2019s Legislative History, 63 Bus. Law. 55, 56 (2007) (\u201cIt is apparent that \u2018[c]lass arbitration is a swiftly growing phenomenon\u2019 \u201d); <em>McKee </em>v. <em>AT&amp;T Corp., </em>164 Wash. 2d 372, 395 (2008) (\u201cClass actions are often arbitrated\u201d). Moreover, a majority of the Justices of the United States Supreme Court has, at least implicitly, indorsed class arbitrations as consistent with the FAA. See <em>Shroyer </em>v. <em>New Cingular Wireless Servs., Inc., </em>498 F.3d 976, 992 (9th Cir. 2007), citing <em>Green Tree Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>Bazzle, </em>539 U.S. 444, 454 (2003). Second, the defendants\u2019 claim that \u201c[cjlass proceedings in arbitration are highly problematic\u201d is the sort of \u201csingling out\u201d of arbitration for \u201csuspect status\u201d that the United States Supreme Court has rejected. <em>Doctor\u2019s Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Casarotto, </em>517 U.S. 681, 687 (1996). See <em>Discover Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra </em>at 167, quoting <em>Armendariz </em>v. <em>Foundation Health Psychcare Servs., Inc., </em>24 Cal. 4th 83, 120 (2000) (lower court\u2019s \u201cconclusion regarding the unsuitability of arbitration to class actions reflects . . . \u2018the very mistrust of arbitration that has been repudiated by the United States Supreme Court\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-33\">Our decision is not based on any judgment about the merits of a particular forum for class action adjudication \u2014 arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>or litigation \u2014 but rather on a determination that in the circumstances of a case such as this (small value claims sought under our consumer protection statute, G. L. c. 93A), a clause effectively prohibiting class proceedings in any forum violates the public policy of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">5. <em>Choice of law. </em>Dell\u2019s terms include a provision specifying that Texas law applies to \u201c[t]his agreement and any sales thereunder . . . .\u201d Because Texas law would appear to allow a prohibition on class actions, see <em>AutoNation USA Corp. </em>v. <em>Leroy, </em>105 S.W.3d 190, 199-200 (Tex. Ct. App. 2003), we must decide whether Texas or Massachusetts law applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Where State policies differ, \u201cwe look to our established \u2018functional\u2019 choice of law principles and to the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws,.with which those principles generally are in accord.\u201d <em>Hodas </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>442 Mass. 544, 549 (2004), quoting <em>Bushkin Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>393 Mass. 622, 631-632 (1985). Where parties have specifically expressed an intent as to the governing law, we respect that intent unless the result would be contrary to our public policy. <em>Hodas </em>v. <em>Morin, supra </em>at 549-550, quoting <em>Steranko </em>v. <em>Inforex, Inc., </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 253, 260 (1977). See <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Mailboxes Etc. U.S.A., Inc., </em>419 Mass. 572, 575 (1995) (applying law of State designated in contract \u201cin the absence of any substantial Massachusetts public policy reason to the contrary\u201d). Applying the \u201ctwo-tiered analysis\u201d of the Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws \u00a7 187 (1971), <em>Hodas </em>v. <em>Morin, supra </em>at 550, we inquire first whether the State chosen by the parties has a \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d to the transaction and, second, whether \u201c \u2018application of the law of the chosen state [here, Texas] would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state [here, Massachusetts] which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state\u2019 and is the State whose law would apply ... \u2018in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The plaintiffs do not contest that the chosen State, Texas, has a \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d to the transaction.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Nor does either party contest that, as the forum State, Massachusetts law would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>apply were the choice of law provision in the terms deemed ineffective. Our inquiry is therefore limited to whether the application of Texas law would lead to a result contrary to a \u201cfundamental policy\u201d of Massachusetts and, if so, whether Massachusetts has a \u201cmaterially greater interest\u201d than Texas.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Atq\">We have no trouble concluding that the strong public policy in favor of class actions for small value claims under G. L. c. 93A is a \u201cfundamental policy\u201d contemplated by \u00a7 187 of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws. See <em>Fiser </em>v. <em>Dell Computer Corp., </em>144 N.M. 464, 468 (2008) (fundamental New Mexico policy to ensure that consumers have \u201can opportunity to redress their harm\u201d); <em>McKee </em>v. <em>AT&amp;T Corp., supra </em>at 386 (\u201cWashington\u2019s strong Consumer Protection Act policy favoring class adjudication of small-dollar claims is a \u2018fundamental policy\u2019 \u201d). See also Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 187 comment g (\u201cThe forum will- apply its own legal principles in determining whether a given policy is a fundamental one within the meaning of the present rule and whether the other state has a materially greater interest\u201d; \u201ca fundamental policy may be embodied in a statute . . . which is designed to protect a person against the oppressive use of superior bargaining power\u201d). We likewise have little trouble concluding that the interest embodied in this policy \u2014 the protection of large classes of consumers and the deterring of corporate wrongdoing \u2014 is materially greater than Texas\u2019s interest, which the defendants identify as \u201cminimizing its companies\u2019 legal expense.\u201d See <em>Canal Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>406 Mass. 369, 378 (1990) (\u201cwe ordinarily would not effectuate a <em>consumer\u2019s </em>waiver of rights under c. 93A,\u201d [emphasis in original]); <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>382 Mass. 398, 413 (1981) (\u201ccourts have long refused to give effect to purported waivers of statutory rights where enforcement of the particular waiver would do violence to the public policy underlying the legislative enactment\u201d). See also <em>Homa </em>v. <em>American Express Co., </em>558 F.3d 225, 232-233 (3d Cir. 2009) (concluding that Supreme Court of New Jersey would apply New Jersey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>law to class-arbitration waiver in \u201csmall-sum\u201d case despite choice-of-law provision favoring Utah; although Utah statute expressly allowing class action waivers in consumer credit agreements indicated that Utah had \u201ca strong policy in favor of the enforcement of the waivers,\u201d New Jersey has \u201ca materially greater interest than Utah in the enforceability of a class-arbitration waiver that could operate to preclude a New Jersey consumer from relief under the [New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act]\u201d); Brazil <em>vs. </em>Dell Inc., No. C-07-01700 RMW (N.D. Cal., Aug. 3, 2007) (declining to enforce Texas choice-of-law provision in Dell consumer agreement; California\u2019s interest in protecting its citizens from \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d agreements that incorporate one-sided protections outweighed Texas\u2019s interest in \u201cprotecting its resident business\u2019s expectations of consistent legal standards\u201d); <em>McKee </em>v. <em>AT&amp;T Corp., supra </em>(\u201cWashington\u2019s interest in protecting large classes of its consumers materially outweighs New York\u2019s limited interest\u201d). Because Texas law likely would result in the enforcement of the class action prohibition, leaving Massachusetts consumers and businesses with small claims without an effective remedy, enforcing the choice-of-law provision would lead to a result contrary to our fundamental policy. For this reason, Massachusetts law applies, and Dell\u2019s class action prohibition is unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">6. <em>Federal preemption. </em>The defendants argue that, even if Massachusetts rather than Texas law applies, the FAA preempts any defense based on State public policy.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> We disagree. The FAA, which was designed to \u201cplace arbitration agreements \u2018upon the same footing as other contracts,\u2019 \u201d <em>Scherk </em>v. <em>Alberto-Culver Co., </em>417 U.S. 506, 511 (1974), quoting H.R. Rep. No. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 1, 2 (1924), provides that arbitration agreements are \u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds that exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Arbitration agreements are therefore meant to be \u201cas enforceable as other contracts, <em>but not more so\u201d </em>(emphasis in original). <em>Opals on Ice Lingerie </em>v. <em>Body Lines, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>Inc., </em>320 F.3d 362, 369 (2d Cir. 2003), quoting <em>Prima Paint Corp. </em>v. <em>Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 404 n.12 (1967). For this reason, a court may apply generally applicable State law contract defenses to determine the validity of an arbitration agreement, <em>St. Fleur </em>v. <em>WPI Cable Sys./Mutron, </em>450 Mass. 345, 350 (2008), and may invalidate an arbitration agreement on such grounds without contravening the FAA. <em>Doctor\u2019s Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Casarotto, </em>517 U.S. 681, 687 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Because the tenet that a contract may be invalidated on grounds that it violates public policy is a principle of State contract law that \u201carose to govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally,\u201d see <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>482 U.S. 483, 492-493 n.9 (1987), our conclusion that the class action prohibition is unenforceable on those grounds is not preempted by the FAA. See <em>Shroyer </em>v. <em>New Cingular Wireless Servs., Inc., </em>498 F.3d 976, 990 (9th Cir. 2007), quoting <em>Kinkel </em>v. <em>Cingular Wireless LLC, </em>223 Ill. 2d 1, 19 (2006) (FAA \u201cdoes not require state courts, when applying state law to a question of the enforceability of a particular contract, to necessarily reach an outcome that encourages individual arbitration\u201d); <em>Kinkel </em>v. <em>Cingular Wireless LLC, supra </em>at 20 (\u201cthe FAA neither expressly nor impliedly preempts a state court from holding that an arbitration clause or a specific provision within an arbitration clause is unenforceable; it merely frames the issue by requiring that a state court examine the disputed provision in the same manner that it would examine any contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">While the defendants are correct that the FAA prohibits courts from \u201csingling out arbitration provisions for suspect status,\u201d quoting <em>Doctor\u2019s Assocs., Inc. </em>v. Casarotto, <em>supra </em>at 687, our conclusion does not selectively target arbitration. The problem inherent in Dell\u2019s terms is not that they compel arbitration but that, by mandating individual arbitration, they compel a procedure for resolving claims that effectively eviscerates the c. 93A right to participate in a class action. See <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 151, 164 (1985). Simply put, a prohibition on class actions \u201chas nothing to do with a valid agreement to arbitrate.\u201d <em>McKee </em>v. <em>AT&amp;T Corp., supra </em>at 395. E is the effective ban on class actions \u2014 not the mandating of arbitration \u2014 that is repugnant to the public policy of the Commonwealth. Our decision is not, as the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ants argue, \u201ctantamount to a policy against arbitration,\u201d but rather the logical corollary of our fundamental public policy in favor of preserving the ability of consumers and businesses to vindicate their rights under G. L. c. 93A. See <em>Lowden </em>v. <em>T-Mobile USA, Inc., </em>512 F.3d 1213, 1221 (9th Cir. 2008) (FAA does not preempt Washington State law from rendering unconscionable arbitration provision containing class action prohibition because State law principles \u201capply equally to a contract that permits only individual, not aggregate, litigation in court\u201d); <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>42 Cal. 4th 443, 465 (2007) (\u201cThe principle that in the case of certain unwaivable statutory rights, class action waivers are forbidden when class actions would be the most effective practical means of vindicating those rights is an arbitration-neutral rule: it applies to class waivers in arbitration and nonarbi-tration provisions alike\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-18\">7. <em>Severability. </em>The contracts at issue here do not contain a severability or savings clause. We agree with the Supreme Court of New Mexico, which held that a similar class action waiver was not severable because the class action bar was \u201cpart of the arbitration provision\u201d and \u201ccentral to the mechanism for resolving the dispute between the parties.\u201d <em>Fiser </em>v. <em>Dell Computer Corp., </em>144 N.M. 464, 471 (2008). Cf. <em>Kristian </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., </em>446 F.3d 25, 62 (1st Cir. 2006) (concluding that class arbitration bar was severable where arbitration agreement contained savings clause, but noting that courts typically prefer \u201cdeclaring an arbitration agreement unenforceable rather than using severance as a remedy when fundamental elements of the arbitration regime are at issue,\u201d and that severing class arbitration bar would be \u201cdifficult to justify\u201d absent savings clause).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The defendants argue, correctly, that the absence of a severability or savings clause does not, by itself, necessarily mean that the class waiver is \u201cinsever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>able.\u201d Our decision in this regard does not rest solely on the absence of such a clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">8. <em>Failure to state a claim. </em>The defendants argue that, even if arbitration should not have been compelled, the complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. Mass. R. Civ. R 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). Specifically, they claim that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that Dell erroneously collected sales tax attributable to the purchase of computer service contracts falls outside \u201cthe conduct of trade or commerce\u201d as those terms are used in G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 <em>(a). </em>The defendants did not move for dismissal on this basis in the trial court. However, as the prevailing party, they are \u201centitled to argue on appeal that the judge was right for the wrong reason, even relying on a principle of law not argued below.\u201d <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>413 Mass. 730, 734-735 (1992). Moreover, we may consider any ground apparent on the record that supports the result reached in the trial court. <em>Gabbidon </em>v. <em>King, </em>414 Mass. 685, 686 (1993), citing <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., supra; St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>411 Mass. 615, 619 n.9 (1992); <em>North Shore Corp. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Topsfield, </em>322 Mass. 413, 416 (1948); and <em>Rosenfeld </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Chilmark, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 621, 626 n.10 (1989). Here, the result reached by the judge in the Superior Court was a dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit. Looking, as we must, to the allegations of the complaint, we may determine whether the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim. See, e.g., <em>Eigerman </em>v. <em>Putnam Invs., Inc., </em>450 Mass. 281, 285 n.6 (2007) (\u201cThe only facts appropriate for consideration in deciding a motion to dismiss are, as has been noted, those drawn from factual allegations contained within the complaint or within attached exhibits\u201d). Cf. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., supra </em>at 735 (we \u201ccannot\u201d accept \u201cnew\u201d argument on appeal that \u201cdepends on facts not established in the record\u201d). If the allegations are insufficient, the complaint fails and must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The defendants argue that the plaintiffs fail to state a claim for two reasons. First, the defendants assert that G. L. c. 93A does not apply \u201cby its terms.\u201d Second, they urge us to hold that the application of G. L. c. 93A \u201cwould improperly displace the tax code.\u201d We agree with the defendants on the first point, and we therefore need not reach the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>General Laws c. 93A prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 <em>(a). </em>\u201cTrade or commerce\u201d refers to transactions in a \u201cbusiness context,\u201d <em>Lantner </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>374 Mass. 606, 611 (1978), which, in turn, is \u201cdetermined by the facts of each case,\u201d on consideration of \u201cthe nature of the transaction, the character of the parties and their activities, and whether the transaction was motivated by business or personal reasons.\u201d <em>Poznik </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Med. Professional Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>417 Mass. 48, 52 (1994), quoting <em>All Seasons Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Health &amp; Hosps. of Boston, </em>416 Mass. 269, 271 (1993). Where a party\u2019s actions are motivated by \u201clegislative mandate, not business or personal reasons,\u201d this court has \u201crepeatedly held that c. 93A does not apply.\u201d <em>Lafayette Place Assocs. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>427 Mass. 509, 535 (1998), quoting <em>Peabody N.E., Inc. </em>v. <em>Marshfield, </em>426 Mass. 436, 439-440 (1998). See <em>Poznik </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Med. Professional Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>supra; <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>412 Mass. 774, <em>777 </em>(1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Although the plaintiffs claim that no tax was due on the optional service contracts under any State statute, they do not allege \u2014 nor do they argue here \u2014 that Dell did not remit the tax it collected to the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> For this reason, their argument that Dell\u2019s \u201cfor-profit sales of computer hardware and optional service contracts\u201d were \u201cby definition\u201d in a business context misses the mark. There is no dispute that Dell\u2019s sales to the plaintiffs occurred in a business context. But the issue here is more textured: the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is based not on the transactions as a whole, but on a particular component of the transactions, the allegedly improper collection of sales tax in connection with the sales of the computer service contracts. See G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 5 (\u201camount of [sales] tax collected by the vendor from the purchaser shall be stated and charged separately from the sales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>price and shown separately on any record thereof\u201d). Even if, as the plaintiffs allege, Dell was not properly charging and collecting the taxes because optional service contracts are not subject to such tax,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> that Dell remitted the proceeds from the tax collected to the Commonwealth \u2014 rather than retaining them for its own enrichment \u2014 compels a conclusion on the record here that Dell\u2019s collection of such tax was not motivated by \u201cbusiness or personal reasons\u201d but was pursuant to legislative mandate.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> See <em>Household Retail Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>448 Mass. 226, 230 (2007) (vendors who, \u201con behalf of the Commonwealth, compute, collect, and file sales tax returns, and remit full sales tax for each customer transaction\u201d serve as \u201ctrustees for the Commonwealth\u2019s retail sales taxes\u201d); <em>Poznik </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Med. Professional Ins. Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 53 (\u201cChapter 93A imposes liability on persons seeking to profit from unfair practices\u201d). Considering, as we must, only the allegations of the complaint, the plaintiffs have not alleged facts sufficient to make out a claim under G. L. c. 93A. See <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 633 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">It is the case that the plaintiffs have variously implied (without alleging any such facts) that, notwithstanding the defendants\u2019 remittance of taxes to the Commonwealth, profit might be the motive behind the defendants\u2019 collection of the tax on the sale of its optional service contracts. In their \u201cstatement of facts\u201d in their initial brief to this court, the plaintiffs suggest that the defendants collected tax in connection with the sales of service contracts as part of an attempt to transfer the tax burden on repair <em>parts </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Dell hardware from the repairer, whether Dell or BancTec, to the customer. If true,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> such an allegation could conceivably state a claim under G. L. c. 93A, to the extent that it demonstrated a profit-seeking motive for the collection of the tax. Where, as here, the plaintiffs made no such allegation in their complaint, dismissal is warranted.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In these circumstances, however, \u201cwe think it appropriate to give the plaintiffs the opportunity to file an amended complaint.\u201d <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., supra </em>at 635. Accordingly, on remand, the complaint is to be dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">9. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the arbitration clause is unenforceable but that plaintiffs failed to state a claim under G. L. c. 93A. The decision of the judge in the Superior Court compelling arbitration is reversed.

Because we conclude that the prohibition is unenforceable as against public policy, we need not address these arguments. The plaintiffs have not argued that their G.

However, the reasoning of those courts have often overlapped and incorporated public policy rationales. See, e.g., <em>Kristian </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., </em>446 F.3d 25, 60 &amp; n.22 (1st Cir. 2006) (declining to enforce class action bar under Federal arbitration law; similar decisions based on State law unconscionability grounds \u201ccontain reasoning that mirrors our own\u201d; both analyses emphasize \u201cfrustration of the right to pursue claims granted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>statute\u201d); <em>Ting </em>v. <em>AT&amp;T, </em>319 F.3d 1126, 1130, 1152 (9th Cir. 2003) (affirming conclusion that provision banning class actions was unconscionable, noting that District Court had concluded that provision was unconscionable and against California public policy); <em>Fiser </em>v. <em>Dell Computer Corp., </em>144 N.M. 464, 469 (2008) (Dell\u2019s class action prohibition substantively unconscionable because it violates New Mexico public policy).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Three years later, the Legislature enacted G.

While the plaintiffs may not have specifically used the \u201cmaterially greater interest\u201d language, that point is subsumed with their argument that \u201cthe fundamental public policy favoring class actions for Chapter 93A claims in Massachusetts would prevail over Texas law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to maritime transactions and to transactions involving interstate commerce. See 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 &amp; 2.

Where the possibility for class arbitration is thus apparently foreclosed, severing the ban on class actions but leaving the arbitration clause intact would appear to lead to the same result, elimination of the statutory right to proceed on a class basis, which we have determined is contrary to our public policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b234-6\">General Laws c. 64H, \u00a7 2, imposes a sales tax and provides that such tax \u201cshall be paid by the vendor to the commissioner [of revenue],\u201d while G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 3 <em>(a), </em>in turn provides that \u201creimbursement for the tax hereby imposed shall be paid by the purchaser to the vendor, and each vendor in the commonwealth shall add to the sales price and shall collect from the purchaser the full amount of the tax imposed by this chapter.\u201d See G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 23 (prohibiting vendors from advertising that they will assume or absorb sales tax).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is a two-step analysis: (1) that only tangible personal property and telecommunications services are subject to sales or use tax in the Commonwealth, citing G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 2, and G. L. c. 641, \u00a7 2; and (2) that the optional service contracts sold by Dell are neither tangible property nor telecommunication services and therefore not subject to a sales or use tax. For their part, the defendants maintain that their collection of sales tax on optional service contracts was in line with guidance Dell had received from the Department of Revenue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Of course, if a retailer deceptively collects a charge that the retailer terms a \u201csales tax\u201d and keeps the proceeds of the \u201ctax\u201d for the retailer\u2019s own enrichment rather than remit them to the Commonwealth, a different result would obtain. In such a circumstance, the collection of the \u201ctax\u201d would be motivated by business reasons, not by a legislative mandate, and would constitute a \u201cdeceptive practice\u201d under G. L. c. 93A. There is no such allegation here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The defendants vigorously challenge any such implication, maintaining that their decisions regarding the taxability of service contracts had \u201cnothing to do with any potential use tax liability on repair parts.\u201d The arbitrator ruled in favor of the defendants on this issue, stating, \u201cI find no credible evidence to suggest that Dell and BancTec conspired to avoid the payment of use tax on parts by charging consumers, including [the plaintiffs], sales tax on optional service contracts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The second amended complaint characterizes as \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d the collection of a \u201cpurported \u2018tax\u2019 on the purchase of optional extended warranty service contracts,\u201d but contains no allegation concerning any conspiracy on Dell\u2019s part to shift the burden of taxes for repair <em>parts </em>to the customers. In their reply brief responding to the defendants\u2019 argument that G. L. c. 93A does not apply to the collection of sales tax, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is brief; they dismiss the defendants\u2019 argument on this point as a \u201cMacGuffin,\u201d and claim merely that defendants charged more \u201c \u2018tax\u2019 than is lawfully due.\u201d The reply brief makes no mention of the profit-seeking scheme suggested by the plaintiffs in the fact section of their initial brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
