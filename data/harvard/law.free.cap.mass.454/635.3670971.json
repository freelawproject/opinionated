L. c. 59, \u00a7 39 (\u00a7 39), of the \u201cmachinery, poles, wires and underground conduits, wires and pipes\u201d (\u00a7 39 property) of the taxpayer telephone companies for fiscal year (FY) 2004, FY 2005, and FY 2006. In deciding those challenges, we must resolve several issues, including (1) whether the Appellate Tax Board (board) correctly upheld the commissioner\u2019s valuations for FY 2005 and FY 2006; (2) whether the board applied the wrong standard of review in modifying the commissioner\u2019s valuations for FY 2004; (3) whether a municipality must appeal from the commissioner\u2019s valuations in order to be entitled to relief under \u00a7 39; (4) whether one of the taxpayers qualifies fo'r the corporate utility exemption under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Sixteenth, thus relieving it from the taxation of certain of its \u201cmachinery\u201d; and (5) whether January 1, 2004, or July 1, 2004, is the proper date for determining the ownership status of property for purposes of the corporate utility exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">We conclude that the board properly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s valuations for FY 2005 and FY 2006, and erred in reducing the commissioner\u2019s valuations for FY 2004. We also agree with the board that a municipality must file a petition appealing from the commissioner\u2019s valuation in order to secure relief in the form of an increase in that valuation; MCI Metro Access Transmission Services, LLC (MCImetro), does not qualify for the corporate utility exemption; and the proper date for ascertaining the ownership status of \u00a7 39 property is the first day of January preceding the fiscal year for which the tax will be assessed based on the commissioner\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">1. <em>The parties. </em>MCI WorldCom Network Services, Inc. (MWNS), and MCImetro (collectively, MCI taxpayers) provide \u201cland-line\u201d voice, broadband data transfer, and Internet services in the Commonwealth using fiber optic cables, conduits, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>electric machinery. MWNS is a long-distance telephone provider incorporated in Delaware.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> MCImetro is a competitive local exchange company providing local telephone service. It was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 1998 and was taxed as a division of MWNS until 2004, when it elected to be taxed as a separate corporation for Federal tax purposes. Under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization of WorldCom, Inc. (owner of MCI taxpayers), the assets of MCImetro (including the \u00a7 39 property) were transferred to Brooks Fiber Communications of Massachusetts, Inc. (Brooks).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The MCI taxpayers claim that this transfer occurred prior to July 1, 2004. The board of assessors for the city of Boston (Boston assessors) and the board of assessors for the city of Newton (Newton assessors) are charged with assessing taxes on \u00a7 39 property that the commissioner has valued.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">2. <em>Background. </em>Each year, the commissioner is required to conduct and certify centralized valuations of the \u00a7 39 property of all telephone and telegraph companies according to a particular schedule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39. First, telephone companies must file a return with the commissioner by March 1 listing all of the \u00a7 39 property that the company held on January 1 of the same year. <em>Id. </em>For the years in question, the commissioner required telephone company taxpayers to file forms denoted \u201cState Tax Form 5941\u201d to assist with the valuation of that property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By May 15, the commissioner must conduct a centralized valuation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>\u00a7 39 property and certify that valuation to the property owners and the local boards of assessors where the property is located. <em>Id. </em>The assessors then use those valuations to assess taxes on the property owners for the fiscal year beginning July 1. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 29, 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">MWNS and MCImetro filed Form 5941 for FY 2004 and FY 2005. Additionally, MWNS filed Form 5941 for FY 2006. The inventory of both companies was based on financial accounting books that had been prepared for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For FY 2004 and FY 2005,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the commissioner conducted valuations of \u00a7 39 property owned by both MWNS and MCImetro. For FY 2006, the commissioner valued only the \u00a7 39 property of MWNS because MCImetro had transferred all its \u00a7 39 property to Brooks prior to the date of the FY 2006 valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The two preferred methods for conducting valuations of property are the \u201cmarket study method,\u201d which compares the property at issue to similar, recently sold property, and the \u201cincome capitalization method,\u201d which calculates the present value of the income that property will produce. See <em>Blakeley </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>391 Mass. 473, 477 (1984); <em>Correia </em>v. <em>New Bedford Redevelopment Auth., </em>375 Mass. 360, 362 (1978) <em>(Correia). </em>However, those methods may be unavailing \u201cwhere the special character of the property makes it substantially impossible to arrive at value on the basis of capitalized net earnings or on the basis of comparable sales.\u201d <em>Blakeley </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, supra, </em>citing <em>Correia, supra </em>at 362-364. In such circumstances, the commissioner may use a third method: \u201cdepreciated reproduction cost\u201d (DRC), defined as \u201c[t]he current cost of reproducing a property less depreciation from deterioration and functional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>and economic obsolescence.\u201d <em>Correia, supra </em>at 362.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That is the method elected by the commissioner for the fiscal years at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The commissioner hired consultant George E. Sansoucy to assist in the appraisal of the \u00a7 39 property using the DRC method.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Sansoucy first determined the theoretical cost of newly reproducing the \u00a7 39 property.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Next, he discounted that amount by the value of the property\u2019s physical depreciation, which he calculated using straight-line depreciation based on the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Communication Commission\u2019s service life tables for twenty-three different categories of property.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, he imposed a further discount by concluding that MWNS was entitled to an economic obsolescence deduction of twenty-five per cent in FY 2005 and FY 2006, and that MCImetro was entitled to that same deduction for FY 2005. For reasons explained further below, Sansoucy did not recommend, and the commissioner did not apply, a separate obsolescence deduction for FY 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The MCI taxpayers appealed from those valuations to the board, arguing that the property\u2019s actual value was \u201csubstantially lower . . . than the valuation certified by the commissioner of revenue.\u201d G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39. The Boston assessors and the Newton assessors also appealed to the board, arguing that the value of the MCI taxpayers\u2019 property in their cities was \u201csubstantially <em>higher </em>. . . than the valuation certified by the commissioner of revenue\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The appeals were consolidated into a single action on August 4, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">In the consolidated appeal before the board, the parties submitted statements of agreed facts with exhibits, called lay and expert witnesses, introduced expert valuation reports, and filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>posttrial briefs and reply briefs. For the purposes of this appeal, the central witnesses were Jerome Weinert (witness for MCI taxpayers, qualified as an expert in the areas of depreciation, functional obsolescence, and valuing telephone companies); Mark Rodriguez and Mark Pomykacz (witnesses for the Boston assessors and Newton assessors, qualified as experts in appraisal); and Sansoucy (witness for the commissioner, qualified as an expert in utility and telephone company personal property valuation and engineering).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In a detailed decision, the board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s valuations for FY 2005 and FY 2006; however, for FY 2004, the board required the commissioner to apply the same twenty-five per cent economic obsolescence deduction that the commissioner had applied in the later years. The board rejected other arguments made by both the taxpayers and the local assessors, as described below. MWNS filed an appeal and an application for direct appellate review, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>In an appeal to the board of a valuation made under \u00a7 39, the appellant has the burden \u201cof proving that the value of the machinery, poles, wires and underground conduits, wires and pipes is substantially higher or substantially lower, as the case may be, than the valuation certified by the commissioner of revenue.\u201d G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39. \u201cOur review of a board decision is limited to questions of law.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Mobile of Mass. Corp., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>451 Mass. 280, 283 (2008) <em>(Bell Atl.), </em>citing <em>Towle </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>397 Mass. 599, 601 (1986). \u201cWe will not disturb the board\u2019s findings so long as they are supported by substantial evidence and a correct application of the law.\u201d <em>Bell Atl., supra, </em>citing <em>Koch </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>416 Mass. 540, 555 (1993). Although the interpretation of statutes is a question of law that we resolve, the board\u2019s interpretation of tax statutes \u201cmay be given weight by this court\u201d because it is an agency charged with the administration of tax law. <em>Bell Atl., supra, </em>quoting <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>McGraw-Hill, Inc., </em>383 Mass. 397, 401 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">a. <em>Economic obsolescence deduction. </em>In their appeal to this court, the appellants do not contest the commissioner\u2019s estimates of the new reproduction costs or the discount for physical depreciation of their \u00a7 39 property; rather, they contend that the commissioner applied an incorrect \u201ceconomic obsolescence\u201d deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>In the proceedings before the board, Sansoucy testified that he attempted to determine a proper economic obsolescence deduction in light of claims by some telephone companies that technological advances had rendered some property, like fiber optic cables, less valuable. Using a sample property spreadsheet that estimated economic obsolescence depreciations of five per cent to seventy per cent (depending on age of property),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and using information gleaned from discussions with industry representatives, Sansoucy determined that a proper weighted obsolescence deduction for all telephone companies was twenty-five per cent. As noted, that twenty-five per cent economic obsolescence deduction was then applied to the MCI taxpayers\u2019 property in 2005 and 2006.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The economic obsolescence deduction was not applied in the same manner to the MCI taxpayers\u2019 property in 2004, principally because Sansoucy had not yet been retained to assist the commissioner in changing the appraisal system prior to the 2004 version of Form 5941 being issued. As issued, that version of the form did not require companies to list their \u00a7 39 property according to the twenty-three FCC categories later adopted at Sansoucy\u2019s recommendation for 2005 and 2006. Therefore, Sansoucy\u2019s preferred economic obsolescence valuation methodology (using weighted calculations according to the property types reported by each taxpayer) could not be employed on the 2004 data. Instead, Sansoucy recommended aggregating all of the taxpayers\u2019 FY 2004 property categories and applying averaged cost trends and averaged depreciation percentages. This, Sansoucy testified, resulted in a conservative (low-end) estimate of the property\u2019s fair cash value, because the aggregation of property categories and averaging of depreciation percentages resulted in shorter average lives for most of the property and thus greater depreciation. The net effect of the greater deprecia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>tion, Sansoucy opined, approximated the twenty-five per cent of additional economic obsolescence taken in FY 2005 and FY 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The MCI taxpayers\u2019 expert, Weinert, testified that the commissioner should have applied an obsolescence deduction of about sixty-five per cent for all three years. Unlike Sansoucy, he relied on data showing the returns on capital in ninety-eight different industries. He then compared the returns in seventy-two of those industries<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> with the returns in the communications and interexchange-broadband carrier industries, which Weinert claimed was representative of the taxpayers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He calculated that in the seventy-two industries, the weighted average of returns on capital for 2001 through 2006 was twelve per cent. The interexchange-broadband segments, on the other hand, returned only 4.5 per cent on capital. He compared these two returns and concluded that the interexchange-broadband segment was under-performing the rest of United States industry by sixty-three per cent.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> He then conducted a second calculation. Based on a paper he had written, Weinert determined that all United States industries returned 13.5 per cent on capital for the period in question.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Comparing the 4.5 per cent return to the 13.5 per cent return (which he apparently rounded down to thirteen per cent), he determined that the interexchange-broadband sector was under-performing by sixty-five per cent. He therefore opined that sixty-five per cent was the proper economic obsolescence deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Pomykacz, the obsolescence expert for the Boston assessors and Newton assessors, testified that the obsolescence deduction should have been twenty per cent. He arrived at that number by using a \u201ccomplex analysis\u201d of over-all land-line obsolescence, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>\u201cfiber optic utilization analysis,\u201d and a \u201csimple analysis\u201d based on equipment production capacity. In the first analysis, he noted that land-line telephone companies had recently seen profit declines of thirty-five per cent (2003), forty-seven per cent (2004), and fifty-three per cent (2005); however, he considered only one-half of those amounts (eighteen per cent, twenty-four per cent, and twenty-six per cent) in potential obsolescence deductions because he predicted that the industry would soon stabilize. In the \u201cutilization\u201d analysis, he forecast a short-term stabilized fiber optic utilization rate (fifteen per cent) and a long-term stabilized rate (thirty-five per cent); by subtracting the former forecast from the latter, he determined that fiber optic cable is currently being underutilized by twenty per cent.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Finally, in the \u201csimple\u201d analysis, he considered communications equipment production capacity. He testified that production should run at eighty per cent capacity; although it was currently running at only forty-five per cent to fifty-five per cent of capacity, he predicted that it should stabilize at sixty per cent of capacity. Subtracting his sixty per cent forecast from eighty per cent, he again arrived at twenty per cent as the proper economic obsolescence deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The board first concluded that the commissioner\u2019s \u201ctrended reproduction cost new less depreciation methodology\u201d was a valid approach to valuing telephone company \u00a7 39 property. The board reasoned that the commissioner\u2019s methodology was objective, transparent, and consistent. These conclusions are not challenged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The board then addressed the economic obsolescence deduction. \u201cRecognizing the inherent difficulty in quantifying economic obsolescence\u201d (see note 7, <em>supra), </em>it concluded that the \u201cpercentages offered by [the MCI taxpayers\u2019] and the [Boston and Newton assessors\u2019] valuation experts were lacking.\u201d Weinert\u2019s methodology, for example, \u201cdouble counted\u201d several factors, at one point citing economic weakness in both the \u201creplacement cost\u201d and \u201ceconomic obsolescence\u201d calculations. He also relied heavily on evidence that the national telecommunications industry had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>suffered a downturn; however, he failed to demonstrate that a similar downturn had affected this particular \u00a7 39 property, or even Massachusetts as a whole. Nor did he prove, the board found, that the interexchange-broadband sector was representative of the MCI taxpayers. Finally, the board noted that Weinert\u2019s methodology would imply that fiber optic cable had an effective economic life of only 2.1 to 3.3 years, reflecting a plainly \u201cexcessive\u201d deduction for depreciation and obsolescence. For those reasons, the board found that Weinert\u2019s sixty-five per cent economic obsolescence suggestion was \u201cnot credible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The board also rejected the valuations of Pomykacz and Rodriguez, noting that their starting point for the property to be valued was not the property identified in the Forms 5941, resulting in both double counting and the failure to count properties located in the relevant municipalities. The board deemed Pomy-kacz\u2019s methodology \u201chighly subjective,\u201d pointing out his fifty per cent reduction in recent lost profits and his \u201cassumed, but essentially unsupported, future rate of 35 %\u201d fiber utilization rate. It also found that Pomykacz\u2019s \u201csimple\u201d analysis understated the economic obsolescence of land-line companies by including the manufacturers of wireless telecommunications property.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Finally, the board properly rejected suggestions by the MCI taxpayers\u2019 witnesses that any valuation should begin with a lower, bankruptcy-mandated cost restatement known as \u201cfresh start accounting.\u201d Specifically, the MCI taxpayers proposed valuing certain property assets at about $5 million, while the original cost for the property was more than $42 million. \u201cFresh start accounting\u201d is necessary for bankruptcy purposes, because \u201cthe overriding goal of the Bankruptcy Code [is] to provide a \u2018fresh start\u2019 for the debtor.\u201d <em>Reynolds Bros. </em>v. <em>Texaco, Inc., </em>420 Mass. 115, 123 (1995). Ad valorem DRC valuations, on the other hand, attempt accurately to predict the cost of reproducing unique property today, <em>Correia, supra </em>at 362, which is the relevant consideration for \u00a7 39 valuation purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Based on the evidence, including its findings that the experts for the MCI taxpayers, Boston assessors, and Newton assessors were not credible, the board concluded that the commissioner\u2019s valuation was not substantially higher or substantially lower than the property\u2019s actual value. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39. As a result, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>it allowed the commissioner\u2019s valuations for FY 2005 and FY 2006 to stand. These conclusions are supported by substantial evidence, and the board correctly applied the relevant law to its factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">With respect to the commissioner\u2019s 2004 valuations, the board \u201cobserve[d]\u201d (without citing evidence offered by appellants) that they \u201care not consistent with those for [FY] 2005 and [FY] 2006, unless an additional deduction of 25% for economic obsolescence is applied.\u201d The board then asserted that \u201c[i]t also appears to the Board that the telecommunications market was afflicted by similar economic and other external factors in all of the fiscal years at issue.\u201d Therefore, the board concluded that the commissioner\u2019s certified valuation was \u201csubstantially higher than its fair cash value,\u201d and substituted its own valuations for that year, including the additional twenty-five per cent reduction. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The appellant has the burden of proving that the value of the property is substantially higher or substantially lower than the valuation certified by the commissioner. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39. If the appellant fails to meet that burden, the board is not empowered to substitute its own valuation of the \u00a7 39 property. Cf. <em>Assessors of Sandwich </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>393 Mass. 580, 586 (1984) (\u201cOnly if the taxpayer has met that burden does the board undertake an independent valuation of the property\u201d). Here, the board did not credit any testimony or evidence introduced by the MCI taxpayers showing that the FY 2004 valuation was \u201csubstantially higher or substantially lower\u201d than the property\u2019s actual value; to the contrary, the board specifically discredited the MCI taxpayers\u2019 expert witnesses on the issue of economic obsolescence. Nor did the board accept any of the appellants\u2019 arguments that the obsolescence deduction should apply to FY 2004, or find that they had met their burden on that point. In the absence of such a finding, the board erred in proceeding to revise the 2004 valuation unilaterally by substituting its own judgment for that of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">b. <em>Municipal appeals. </em>The Boston assessors did not file a petition appealing from the \u00a7 39 valuations for FY 2004 and FY 2006. They argue, however, that the board can increase valuations of \u00a7 39 property even though they have not appealed, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>long as the taxpayer has filed a petition of appeal (seeking a lower valuation).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">The argument is meritless under the plain meaning of the language of \u00a7 39:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\"><em>\u201cEvery owner and board of assessors </em>to whom any such valuation shall have been so certified <em>may . </em>. . <em>appeal </em>to the appellate tax board from such valuation. <em>. . . In every such appeal, the appellant shall have the burden </em>of proving that the value of the [property] is substantially higher or substantially lower, as the case may be, than the valuation certified by the commissioner of revenue.\u201d (Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39. The board correctly held that for the years 2004 and 2006, the Boston assessors were not \u201cappellants\u201d; therefore, \u201c\u00a7 39 provides no mechanism for the [b]oard to find a value substantially higher than that certified by the [commissioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">In support of their position, the Boston assessors rest their argument on one sentence in a 1933 act: \u201cNotwithstanding anything contained in this act, the board in considering any appeal brought before it may make such decision as equity may require and may reduce or increase the amount of the assessment appealed from.\u201d St. 1933, c. 321, \u00a7 9. That sentence has never been cited by a Massachusetts appellate case, nor has it been codified in the General Laws, G. L. c. 58A (board\u2019s enabling act). Indeed, the \u201cact\u201d to which the language refers makes no reference to the commissioner\u2019s valuation of telephone company property, or \u00a7 39 appeals from those valuations. St. 1933, c. 321 (\u201cAn Act temporarily increasing the membership of the board of tax appeals and relative to the procedure before said board\u201d). Even if that sentence retains any force, it is subordinated to the contrary, plain language of \u00a7 39, which was rewritten in 1955 to require that the \u201cappellant\u201d bear the burden of proving the commissioner\u2019s valuation to be too high or too low. See St. 1955, c. 344, \u00a7 31. \u201c[W]hen the provisions of two statutes are in conflict, \u2018the more specific provision, particularly where it has been enacted subsequent to a more general rule, applies over the general rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Harris, 443 Mass. 714, 739 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>(2005) (Marshall, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), quoting <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. (No. 1), </em>425 Mass. 210, 215 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">c. <em>Corporate utility exemption. </em>The MCI taxpayers argue that MCImetro should have been granted the corporate utility exemption under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Sixteenth (1) <em>(d). </em>That clause \u201cprovides that a company classified as a corporate telephone utility is exempt from tax on all property other than real estate, poles, underground conduits, wires and pipes, and machinery used in manufacturing,\u201d <em>RCN-BecoCom, LLC </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>443 Mass. 198, 200 (2005); it is settled law that limited liability companies are not eligible for the corporate utility exemption. <em>Id. </em>at 207 (\u201cBy [clause Sixteenth\u2019s] plain language, it applies to corporations, not limited liability companies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The exemption applies to telephone utility corporations only if they are subject to taxation under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 52A. Section 52A applies to all \u201cutility corporation[s] doing business within the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 52A.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> For the years in question, \u201cutility corporation\u201d was defined to include, inter alia, \u201cevery <em>incorporated </em>telephone and telegraph company subject to chapter one hundred sixty-six\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 52A (1) <em>(a) </em>(in), as amended through St. 2004, c. 466, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Because MCImetro was not incorporated, it was not subject to taxation under \u00a7 52A; therefore, it was not eligible for the corporate utility exemption under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Sixteenth (1) <em>(d). </em>See <em>RCN-BecoCom, LLC </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra. </em>Nonetheless, for FY 2004 and FY 2005, MCImetro argues that it should be exempt under any of several theories: (1) it should benefit from the incorporation status of its parent, MWNS; (2) it filed or was included in Forms P.S.l filed by MWNS so that it was treated like a corporation for Massachusetts tax purposes; and (3) for the period after MCImetro made an election to be taxed as a separate corporation for Federal tax purposes, it became a \u201cforeign corporation\u201d under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (2), as amended through St. 2003, c. 4, \u00a7 13. It also contends that with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>FY 2005, it transferred the subject property to Brooks (a utility corporation) prior to July 1, 2004, and that July 1 should be the relevant date for G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, corporate utilities exemption purposes. We reject each of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">\u201cThe burden is on the taxpayer to demonstrate entitlement to an exemption claimed.\u201d <em>Macy\u2019s East, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>441 Mass. 797, 804 (2004), quoting <em>South Boston Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>418 Mass. 695, 698 (1994). \u201cExemption from taxation is to be strictly construed and must be made to appear clearly before it can be allowed.\u201d <em>New Habitat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tax Collector of Cambridge, </em>451 Mass. 729, 731 (2008), quoting <em>Springfield Young Men\u2019s Christian Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Assessors of Springfield, </em>284 Mass. 1, 5 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">During the period when MCImetro was treated as a division of MWNS, it could not benefit from the incorporated status of its parent. Even though MCImetro was disregarded for corporate <em>income </em>tax purposes, it was always treated separately for personal property ad valorem taxation. For personal property taxation, exemption status turns on ownership. See G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Sixteenth (property exempt from taxation only if \u201cowned by [qualifying] bank or corporation\u201d); <em>Born </em>v. <em>Assessors of Cambridge, </em>427 Mass. 790, 795 (1998) (for property tax exemptions, \u201cthe form of legal ownership is related to whether one qualifies for the exemption\u201d); <em>Minkin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>425 Mass. 174, 181 (1997) (property owner\u2019s chosen form of organization creates tax consequences that must be accepted). MCImetro does not dispute that it is seeking an exemption for property that it, and not MWNS, owned. The same conclusion results from the filing of Forms P.S.l; even if MCImetro was included on those forms for Massachusetts income taxation purposes, it does not alter the fact that it was a limited liability company, not an incorporated utility, for the purposes of clause Sixteenth.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Even when MCImetro elected to be taxed as a separate corporation for Federal tax purposes, its status for the purposes of the corporate utility exemption did not change. MCImetro argues that at this point it became a foreign corporation under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (2), as then amended, which, unlike clause Sixteenth, includes limited liability companies. That section, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>specifically does not apply to \u00a7 52A. G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (\u201cWhen used in [\u00a7 30 (2)] and in sections 31 to 52, inclusive, the following terms shall have the following meanings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Finally, MCImetro argues that it transferred its \u00a7 39 property to Brooks prior to July 1, 2004, and that the commissioner should use that date for evaluating the property\u2019s ownership status for the purposes of the corporate utility exemption for FY 2005. We disagree. The language of the statute provides that \u201cthe date of determination as to age, ownership or other qualifying factors required by any clause shall be July first of each year <em>unless another meaning is clearly apparent from the </em>context\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Sixteenth (1) <em>(d). </em>For telephone utility corporations, another meaning is \u201cclearly apparent\u201d: the relevant statute requires the commissioner to calculate \u201cthe valuation [of \u00a7 39 property] as of January first,\u201d and to complete and certify those values \u201c[o]n or before May fifteenth in each year . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39. \u201cWhere the language of a statute is plain, it must be interpreted in accordance with the usual and natural meaning of the words.\u201d <em>Household Retail Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>448 Mass. 226, 229 (2007), quoting <em>Gurley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 595, 598 (1973). The board reached the same conclusion, and its interpretation of tax statutes \u201cmay be given weight by this court.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Mobile of Mass. Corp., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>451 Mass. 280, 283 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Additionally, \u201c[c]ourts must ascertain the intent of a statute from all its parts and from the subject matter to which it relates, and must interpret the statute so as to render the legislation effective, consonant with sound reason and common sense.\u201d <em>Seide-man </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>452 Mass. 472, 477 (2008), citing <em>Champigny </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>422 Mass. 249, 251 (1996). Those considerations support the use of January 1 for \u00a7 39 valuation purposes. Section 39 requires the commissioner to certify valuations by May 15; it would make little sense to require this complex valuation and certification process to end on that date, only to have that work undone (and redone) if the \u00a7 39 property were transferred to an entity that qualified for the corporate utility exemption before July 1. MCI argues that the board (not the commissioner) could \u201corder revised values via the Section 39 process\u201d if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>necessary. In essence, MCI would have each taxpayer file an appeal every time the property\u2019s ownership status changed hands between January 1 and July 1 of each year. This would create an entirely inefficient process, and would place an unnecessary burden on the board.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>For these reasons, we affirm the commissioner\u2019s valuations for FY 2005 and FY 2006. However, because the MCI taxpayers did not meet their statutory burden of proof, the board erred in requiring the commissioner to apply the twenty-five per cent economic obsolescence deduction to FY 2004. We reverse that order and remand that matter for the commissioner\u2019s valuation for that year to be reinstated. We also affirm the board\u2019s conclusion that municipalities must file a petition appealing the commissioner\u2019s \u00a7 39 valuation before the board may consider raising that valuation, and its conclusion that MCImetro was not entitled to the corporate utility exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-5\">MCI WorldCom Network Services, LLC (MWNS), was incorporated in Delaware in 1973 as MCI Telecommunications Network; its name later changed to MCI WorldCom Network Services, Inc., then to MCI Network Services, Inc.
