L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 E and I. Late in the evening on January 9, 2006, two perpetrators shot Jamal Vaughn to death and absconded. The police investigation immediately focused on the defendant, Deryck Long. On January 10, 2006, Long was arrested in connection with several outstanding warrants and arraigned for Vaughn\u2019s murder the following day. On January 12, 2006, investigators determined that more than one shooter had shot Vaughn.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">While incarcerated, Long placed several outgoing telephone calls, all of which were recorded pursuant to jail policy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> including several to his girl friend, Tayna Newsome. On one occasion, Newsome orchestrated a three-way call among Long, herself, and Courtney Forde, Long\u2019s friend. Steven Reilly, the assistant deputy superintendent of investigations at the jail, provided State Trooper John Moran with recordings of Long\u2019s outgoing telephone calls. Based on those telephone calls, described in greater detail <em>infra, </em>Trooper Moran inferred that Long intended to use the telephones in the visitation booths at the jail to urge his visitors to conceal evidence relating to Vaughn\u2019s murder and prevent his indictment by intimidating and possibly murdering an eyewitness to the murder. He also inferred that Long would disclose or discuss the identity of the second shooter. The visitation booth telephones were not recorded by the jail, nor does there appear to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>any warning to prisoners and visitors that conversations over those telephones would be recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Trooper Moran sought, and a Superior Court judge authorized, a wiretap for the telephone in a specific visitation booth in the maximum security area of the jail. Neither the warrant application nor Trooper Moran\u2019s affidavit in support thereof contained copies of any of the outgoing telephone conversations referred to in Trooper Moran\u2019s affidavit. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 F 3. Long subsequently made incriminating statements using the visitation booth telephone subject to the wiretap.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">After being indicted for Vaughn\u2019s murder, Long moved to suppress the wiretap evidence and the fruits thereof, arguing, among other things, that the facts alleged in Trooper Moran\u2019s affidavit did not establish that wiretapping the visitation booth telephone would lead to evidence of a designated offense in connection with organized crime, see G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 7, 99 E 2<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; and that the affidavit did not show that normal investigative procedures had been tried and failed or reasonably appeared to be unlikely to succeed if tried, see G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 E 3. After reviewing the recorded, outgoing telephone conversations, Long filed a supplemental motion to suppress, contending that Trooper Moran made false, material omissions deliberately or with reckless disregard for the truth, and requested a hearing pursuant to <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The defendant Paul Brown, who later was indicted as the second shooter, also filed a motion to suppress and a supplemental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>motion to suppress the wiretap evidence, asserting the same arguments raised by Long\u2019s motions. He also requested a <em>Franks </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">A Superior Court judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motions for a <em>Franks </em>hearing. After a hearing at which Long\u2019s outgoing telephone conversations \u2014 relied on by Trooper Moran in his affidavit \u2014 were admitted in evidence, the judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She found that Trooper Moran intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth omitted important contextual details in his affidavit when he described Long\u2019s outgoing telephone conversations, from which he inferred Long was engaged in a nefarious, organized plot to intimidate or murder an eyewitness to Vaughn\u2019s murder. Taking the omitted facts into account, she ruled, inter alia, that the police failed to exhaust normal investigative procedures and, in any event, that there was not probable cause to believe that a \u201cdesignated offense,\u201d see note 3, <em>supra, </em>had been, was being, or would be committed as the crimes and conspiracy alleged by Trooper Moran lacked a nexus to \u201corganized crime.\u201d See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>384 Mass. 271, 277 (1981), cert, denied, 454 U.S. 1147 (1982). A single justice of this court allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s application for leave to file an interlocutory appeal, see Mass. R. Crim. R 15 (a) (1), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996), and transmitted the case to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The Commonwealth contends that the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress the wiretap evidence should not have been allowed because (1) the police had pursued normal investigative procedures to no avail and other normal investigative procedures were unlikely to be successful; (2) the judge\u2019s consideration of Long\u2019s outgoing telephone conversations in their entirety exceeded the four comers of Trooper Moran\u2019s affidavit; and (3) Trooper Moran\u2019s affidavit established a nexus to \u201corganized crime,\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>defined by G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A. We disagree with the Commonwealth as to the latter two contentions, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We recite the facts contained in Trooper Moran\u2019s affidavit, as well as any reasonable inferences therefrom. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Day, </em>440 Mass. 296, 297-298 (2003). As discussed <em>infra, </em>we find no error in the motion judge\u2019s consideration of Long\u2019s recorded telephone conversations in their entirety, and we therefore summarize her findings of fact not contained in Trooper Moran\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">On January, 9, 2006, Vaughn was with Lyndia Lewis, Taneisha James-Pagan, and Cory Gibbons at James-Pagan\u2019s apartment in Quincy. Shortly before midnight, Vaughn went to his motor vehicle to retrieve a pack of cigarettes and was shot multiple times. When Lewis heard gunfire, she rushed outside and saw Long, whom she knew through her roommate, Janet Ojo, running from where Vaughn had been shot. Vaughn was rushed to Quincy Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. Crime scene investigators recovered several shell casings and a palm print on the hood of a car parked in the area where the shell casings were found. At this point, the police did not know that there was a second shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The following day Trooper Moran interviewed Ojo. Ojo and Lewis resided in an apartment in the South Quincy area of Quincy (apartment). Ojo told Trooper Moran that she had received a telephone call from James-Pagan the night of the murder informing her that there had been an incident at the apartment that evening in which Vaughn and Long became engaged in a physical fight and that Vaughn had prevailed over Long. When Trooper Moran and another investigator discussed Ojo\u2019s account with James-Pagan, James-Pagan confirmed that she had witnessed the altercation between Long and Vaughn at the apartment, and had heard Long yell to another individual, \u201cC,\u201d for help.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">On the same day, Trooper Moran learned through a criminal background check that Long had a lengthy criminal record that included outstanding arrest warrants for intimidation of a wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>ness, assault and battery, and distribution of a class D substance. Long was arrested on those outstanding warrants that afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">On January 11, 2006, Long was arraigned in the Quincy Division of the District Court Department on a charge of murder. By this time it also had been determined that the palm print recovered from the murder scene did not match Long\u2019s palm print.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">During another interview on January 11, Ojo told Trooper Moran that Long\u2019s nephew, Richard Long (Richard), and another individual known as \u201cCasino\u201d were the only friends of Long\u2019s whom she knew. Subsequent interviews of James-Pagan\u2019s neighbors revealed that Casino had telephoned two women who lived in the same building as James-Pagan late and unexpectedly on the evening of the murder. One of the women gave Casino\u2019s Nextel \u201cdirect connect\u201d cellular number to the State troopers who interviewed her.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nextel Communications identified Courtney Forde as the subscriber for the direct connect number provided to the State troopers. The records for Forde\u2019s direct connect number indicated that a cellular telephone tower in South Quincy, where the apartment was located, was used for a direct connect transmission at 9:44 p.m. on January 9, 2006, which was around the time that Long and Vaughn fought, and that at 11:58 p.m., about the time of Vaughn\u2019s murder, a cellular telephone tower located approximately one-half mile from the murder scene was utilized for a direct connect transmission.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">On January 12, a State trooper with the ballistics section informed Trooper Moran that the bullets retrieved from Vaughn\u2019s body came from two different firearms. A surveillance recording from a store located directly behind James-Pagan\u2019s building, acquired on the same day, had captured the shooting and showed two distinct muzzle flashes coming from separate locations within the same general area.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The following day, Trooper Moran went to the jail and spoke with Reilly. Reilly played recordings of Long\u2019s outgoing telephone conversations with his girl friend, Newsome, for Trooper Moran. In one conversation, Long told Newsome that regarding \u201cthe visitor thing ... I would love to see you as soon as pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>sible ... I need to politic with you outside this airway.\u201d In another conversation, Long told Newsome he \u201cneeds for [Richard] or [Newsome] ... if you don\u2019t mind to see me within a certain time because if I get indicted it\u2019s a wrap . . . you know what I\u2019m saying . . . but you know if . . . one of you all at least can come see me ... I mean . . . I\u2019ll be able to save that indictment.\u201d During one of these conversations, Newsome and Long acknowledged that they knew that Lewis claimed she saw Long running from the murder scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">On January 17, Trooper Moran returned to the jail to listen to another recording of a telephone call between Long and New-some. Long had telephoned Newsome, who then telephoned Forde. In this three-way conversation, Forde told Long that he was \u201claying low\u201d and that he had people submit requests to visit Long at the jail.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Long told Forde to \u201cfall back . . . way back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">A criminal background check of Forde indicated that he had a significant criminal history, including a conviction of possession of a firearm, and four open cases for \u201cdrug violations and threatening.\u201d Given Long\u2019s association with Forde, Forde\u2019s conviction of possession of a firearm, and the proximity of the direct connect transmissions from Forde\u2019s telephone to two women residing in the same building where the murder took place, Trooper Moran concluded that there was probable cause to believe that Forde was the second shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Based on his twelve years of training and experience, and the facts that Long had a conviction of intimidation of a witness, knew the identity of the eyewitness, and wanted to speak with his associates without the conversation being recorded before being indicted so he could prevent his indictment, Trooper Moran opined that Long planned to use the visitation booth telephones at the jail to mastermind a plan to prevent Lewis from testifying against him, possibly even instructing visitors to murder Lewis. Trooper Moran also stated that there was probable cause to believe that information concerning Vaughn\u2019s murder, such as the identity of the second shooter and the location of the firearms used, would be communicated by Long over the visitation booth telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>After reviewing, in their entirety, the outgoing telephone conversations mentioned in Trooper Moran\u2019s affidavit, the motion judge found that Trooper Moran failed to mention that during one conversation with Richard, whom Trooper Moran had implicated in Long\u2019s plans concerning Lewis, neither Richard nor Long made any statement tending to support Trooper Moran\u2019s belief that Richard was part of a plot to intimidate or murder Lewis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She also found that Trooper Moran had completely omitted any reference to Long\u2019s conversation with his friend Gillian Gibbs, whom Trooper Moran had implicated in Long\u2019s conspiracy to prevent his indictment, and that that conversation provided no indication of any plot to harm Lewis or conceal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The judge also found that Trooper Moran omitted important contextual information in his description of Long\u2019s discussion of Lewis with Newsome. She noted that Long discussed Lewis only after Newsome pressed him for an assurance that he would not be indicted for Vaughn\u2019s murder, and that Long described Lewis as having no credibility and being a prostitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Additionally, the judge found that during the three-way telephone conversation with Long, Newsome, and Forde, Forde told Long that Richard had \u201ctried to joke\u201d with Forde about the murder but Forde declined to respond. Long then said, \u201cRight, right, right, like I say just look out on that level for me man, just fall back, way back.\u201d The judge noted that Long\u2019s advice to Forde not to discuss the murder with anyone was not criminal in itself.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Trooper Moran testified that from all of Long\u2019s outgoing telephone calls he selected the statements he considered most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>relevant to establishing probable cause, and that even though he did not attach to the warrant application the compact discs containing all of Long\u2019s outgoing telephone conversations, he would have had \u201cno problem with doing that\u201d and would have obtained any information requested by the judge from whom authorization had been sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 99 E, provides that a warrant to conduct electronic surveillance may issue only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">\u201c1.

L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 F 2 a. General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 99 F 3, set out in its entirety in the margin,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> further provides, in pertinent part: \u201cIf the applicant\u2019s information and belief is derived from tangible evidence or recorded oral evidence, a copy or detailed description thereof should be annexed to or included in the application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">If probable cause is found to be wanting or the police fail to abide by any of the provisions set forth in G.

L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 P.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">a. <em>General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 99 F 3. </em>The Commonwealth, analyzing the motion judge\u2019s consideration of those portions of Long\u2019s recorded telephone conversations not attached to or described in detail in Trooper Moran\u2019s affidavit under the rubric of <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154 (1978), asserts that Trooper Moran\u2019s omissions were not deliberately false or made with reckless disregard for the truth. In making this argument, the Commonwealth assumes that <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, supra, </em>governs a motion to suppress wiretap evidence based on an affiant\u2019s omissions concerning recorded oral evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>In <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, supra </em>at 155-156, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cwhere the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] requires that a hearing be held at the defendant\u2019s request.\u201d Intentionally or recklessly omitted material may also form the basis for mounting a challenge under <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>407 Mass. 647, 658-659 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corriveau, </em>396 Mass. 319, 333-335 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 773, 778 (2008); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 168, 170, 172-173 (1991); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rumney, </em>867 F.2d 714, 720 (1st Cir.), cert, denied, 491 U.S. 908 (1989). The defendant\u2019s initial burden is not a light one. See <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, supra </em>at 171; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>402 Mass. 209, 215 (1988) (defendant\u2019s affidavit offering account different from account in officer\u2019s affidavit not substantial preliminary showing); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Douzanis, </em>384 Mass. 434, 437-438 (1981) (substantial preliminary showing required; factual errors in affidavit concerning information furnished by informant generally insufficient to require <em>Franks </em>hearing). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewin, </em>405 Mass. 566, 585 (1989).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">If a hearing is ordered, the defendant must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the false statement or misimpression created by an omission was made either intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth. <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, supra </em>at 156. When a defendant successfully establishes that a false statement or omission was intentionally or recklessly made, the judge proceeds to consider whether the false misstatement or misim-pression was necessary to a probable cause finding. See <em>id.; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valdez, </em>402 Mass. 65, 70-72 (1988). In the case of an affirmative misstatement, the judge examines whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>the affidavit, purged of false material, establishes probable cause. See <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valdez, supra </em>at 71; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Assad, </em>393 Mass. 418, 422 (1984). In contrast, where an omission forms the basis for a <em>Franks </em>challenge, the judge considers whether the affidavit, supplemented by the omitted information, furnishes probable cause. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, supra </em>at 777-779; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, supra </em>at 173-174; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rumney, supra </em>at 720. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corriveau, supra. </em>In either case, if probable cause is found to be lacking, the warrant is voided, and the evidence and fruits thereof may be suppressed. <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">We previously have not considered whether the <em>Franks </em>case controls where a defendant seeks suppression of wiretap evidence based on the use of truncated excerpts of oral recordings to establish probable cause and complete copies of that evidence have not been attached to the wiretap warrant application in accordance with G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 F 3 a. For the reasons that follow, we hold that where copies or sufficiently detailed descriptions of tangible or recorded oral evidence have not been included in an application for a wiretap warrant, see G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 F 3, the motion judge ordinarily need not be concerned with the <em>Franks </em>requirements, but shall, pursuant to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 E and 99 F, conduct a de novo review of the affidavit and omitted evidence to determine whether there was probable cause to authorize a wiretap.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 99, was \u201cdesigned to ensure that unjustified and overly broad intrusions on rights of privacy are avoided.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>367 Mass. 224, 231 (1975). Its preamble cautions that \u201cthe uncontrolled development and unrestricted use of modern electronic surveillance devices pose grave dangers to the privacy of all citizens of the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A. For this reason, \u201c[t]he use of such devices by law enforcement officials must be conducted <em>under strict judicial supervision and should be limited to the investigation of organized </em>crime\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>In addition to limiting the circumstances in which a wiretap may be sought to organized crime, the statute requires a showing that \u201cnormal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear unlikely to succeed if tried.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 E 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Construing G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, as whole, the statutory admonition that \u201ca copy or detailed description [of tangible evidence or recorded oral evidence] should be annexed to or included in the application\u201d evinces a strong legislative preference to provide that evidence to the judge from whom a warrant is sought to ensure that the limited circumstances in which a wiretap warrant may be sought are present. Although this provision is couched in precatory language, we think it entitles defendants to review any tangible evidence or recorded oral evidence that directly or indirectly bears on probable cause when those materials have not been attached to the warrant application. A defendant need not establish that the failure to include copies or detailed descriptions of that evidence was intentional or reckless. In these specific circumstances and in a departure from our jurisprudence limiting review of probable cause to issue a search warrant to the four comers of an affidavit, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Day, </em>440 Mass. 296, 297 (2003), we conclude that a motion judge should make a de novo probable cause determination based on the affidavit accompanying an application for a wiretap warrant <em>and </em>any omitted tangible or recorded oral evidence, regardless of whether the failure to include that evidence in the warrant application was intentional or reckless.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Here, Trooper Moran\u2019s belief that Long intended to use the visitation booth telephone to facilitate a conspiracy to cover up his involvement in Vaughn\u2019s murder was derived, at least in part, from Long\u2019s outgoing telephone calls urging others to visit him and encouraging them to ask others to visit him. To the extent Trooper Moran\u2019s suspicions derived from Long\u2019s pleas to Forde, Gibbs, Newsome, and Richard to visit him in jail, recordings of telephone conversations with those individuals should have been attached to the warrant application so the judge from whom a warrant was sought could determine whether legitimate reasons, such as the need for canteen money or the desire to see familiar faces, primarily motivated Long\u2019s request for visitors. Because Trooper Moran did not attach copies of Long\u2019s outgoing telephone conversations with persons Trooper Moran believed to be involved in the conspiracy to hide evidence concerning Vaughn\u2019s murder, the judge did not err in making additional findings based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>those recordings and using those findings to make a probable cause determination.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">b. <em>Probable cause and nexus to organized crime. </em>This case comes to us in a somewhat unique procedural posture in that the motion judge, after properly conducting a de novo review of the application for a wiretap warrant and the omitted telephone conversations, determined that there was not probable cause to believe that a \u201cdesignated offense has been, is being, or is about to be committed.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 E 2. Determining our standard of review is further complicated by the fact that the motion judge made credibility findings concerning Trooper Moran\u2019s testimony at the <em>Franks </em>hearing. See note 9, <em>supra. </em>Because those credibility findings are not essential to the motion judge\u2019s probable cause determination, we review the motion judge\u2019s probable cause determination de novo. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>482 F.3d 1047, 1051 (9th Cir. 2007), cert, denied, 128 S. Ct. 877 (2008), and cases cited (no deference owed to issuing judge where affidavit in support of search warrant has been partially redacted); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rabon, </em>930 A.2d 268, 276 (Me. 2007) (de novo review where magistrate did not have opportunity to make probable cause determination following redaction of affidavit); 2 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 4.4 (c), at 551 (4th ed. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">A wiretap warrant may only issue \u201c[ujpon a showing . . . that there is probable cause to believe that a designated offense has been, is being, or is about to be committed . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 E 2. A designated offense includes \u201cthe following offenses in connection with organized crime as defined in the preamble: . . . intimidation of a witness . . . , murder, . . . being an accessory to any of the foregoing offenses and conspiracy or attempt or solicitation to commit any of the foregoing offenses.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 7. \u201cOrganized crime,\u201d as incorporated in the definition of \u201cdesignated offense,\u201d means \u201ca continuing con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>spiracy among highly organized and disciplined groups to engage in supplying illegal goods and services.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>384 Mass. 271, 277 (1981). Requiring a nexus with organized crime, which is not a prerequisite under the cognate Federal statute, <em>id. </em>at 277 n.6, operates as a limitation on the circumstances in which a wiretap may be sought. <em>Id. </em>at 279-281. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, </em>406 Mass. 135, 141 (1989). In determining whether the requisite connection to organized crime exists, we consider whether the materials supporting an application for a wiretap warrant demonstrate an objectively reasonable suspicion grounded in \u201carticulable facts from which a reasonable person could conclude that interception would lead to evidence of a designated offense\u201d in connection with organized crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 281. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amour, </em>428 Mass. 725, 737 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, supra </em>at 141-142.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The definition of organized crime as \u201ca <em>continuing </em>conspiracy among highly organized and disciplined groups <em>to engage in supplying illegal goods and services\u201d </em>(emphasis added), conceives of organized crime as a continuing criminal operation usually, but not necessarily, for pecuniary ends. That is, organized crime must be demonstrated by some evidence of an ongoing illegal business operation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 277 n.6 (noting that statutory definitions of organized crime in other jurisdictions focus on elements of organization, discipline, and provision of illegal goods and services).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Consequently, our cases distinguish between criminal activity that is not organized crime, and \u201ccrimes requiring the high degree of discipline and organization of organized crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amour, supra. </em>Inquiry into whether the facts recited in an application for a warrant to conduct electronic surveillance amount to reasonable suspicion that organized crime may be afoot has heretofore focused on the extent to which the organization and discipline particular to organized crime may reasonably be inferred. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amour, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number><em>supra </em>at 142; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 281; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Abdul-Kareem, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 78, 80 (2002). While \u201cthe class of people subject to wiretaps includes more than \u2018full-time professional criminals,\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D Amour, supra </em>at 736, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 278 n.6, coordination of efforts among cohorts standing alone is insufficient. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D Amour, supra </em>at 737. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarabek, </em>384 Mass. 293, 296 (1981) (scheme between two municipal officials to extort kickback from single contractor did not constitute organized crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">For a conspiracy to commit an offense enumerated in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 7, to rise to the level of organized crime, there must, at the very least, be an organized plan from which one reasonably may infer the existence of an ongoing criminal operation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D Amour, supra </em>at 736-737; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, supra </em>at 142 (ransom note referred to more than one kidnapper and indicated awareness that victim\u2019s parents had contacted police, and nature of kidnapping \u201clen[t] itself to inferences of discipline and organization\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra </em>at 281 (requisite discipline and organization reasonably could be inferred given confidentiality and inaccessibility of sergeant\u2019s promotional examination); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Abdul-Kareem, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Here, Trooper Moran\u2019s affidavit, together with the judge\u2019s findings, does not establish a reasonable suspicion that the authorization of a wiretap would lead to evidence of a designated offense committed in the course of a continuing enterprise to supply illegal goods and services. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, supra. </em>Neither the affidavit nor the omitted outgoing telephone conversations provided any basis for inferring that Long\u2019s involvement in Vaughn\u2019s murder or the conspiracy to conceal evidence of his participation in the murder was related to a continuing criminal enterprise to \u201csupply[] illegal goods and services.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A. There was no indication that Vaughn\u2019s murder was motivated by some pecuniary interest or that Long intended to compensate the persons implicated by Trooper Moran for their involvement in Vaughn\u2019s murder or its investigation. On the contrary, the application for a wiretap warrant suggests that retaliation or revenge motivated Vaughn\u2019s murder, and that Long wanted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>to engage his friends and family to help him cover up evidence of his involvement in Vaughn\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Furthermore, putting to one side the pecuniary motivation typically underlying organized crime, even if one infers that Long\u2019s requests for visits from Newsome, Forde, Gibbs, and Richard were to solicit help in covering up his involvement in Vaughn\u2019s murder, including discouraging or preventing Lewis from testifying, such a conspiracy falls short of a plan from which it reasonably could be inferred that they collectively participated in an ongoing, multi-transactional criminal enterprise. The other hallmarks of organized crime \u2014 discipline, organization, and a continuing nature \u2014 were utterly lacking. Based on the affidavit and omitted recordings of Long\u2019s outgoing telephone conversations, it can only reasonably be inferred that Vaughn\u2019s brutal murder was an isolated event and that Long intended to enlist his friends to help him conceal evidence linking him to it. The entire alleged conspiracy revolved around a single, albeit heinous, crime motivated by revenge. At most, those conspiratorial efforts amounted to coordination among cohorts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This was insufficient to establish a nexus to organized crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amour, supra </em>at 737.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, there was no probable cause to believe that a designated offense had been, was being, or was about to be committed. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 E 2. The motion judge properly suppressed the wiretap evidence and evidence resulting therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the order allowing the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b565-11\">At the beginning of each telephone call, the caller and party to whom the telephone call was placed were advised that the telephone calls were being monitored.

Recordings of outgoing telephone conversations that were before the motion judge but not transcribed have not been included in the record on appeal. With one exception, see note 8, infra, the Commonwealth does not contend that the motion judge\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous.

In his affidavit, Trooper Moran implicated Forde and other acquaintances of Long in a conspiracy to murder Lewis. However, the judge found that his concern for Lewis\u2019s well-being was belied by the fact that the police had failed to arrest Forde, who was suspected of both having committed Vaughn\u2019s murder and being involved in the conspiracy to conceal evidence concerning the murder. In addition, Trooper Moran conceded that he had no direct knowledge of any special efforts to protect Lewis, but knew that she was \u201coffered something\u201d in terms of protection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\"> \u201cAllegations of fact in the application may be based either upon the personal knowledge of the applicant or upon information and belief.
