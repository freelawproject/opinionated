Rule 1:03, as appearing in 382 Mass. 700 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">\u201c1. Where an insured protected by standard CGL[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] policy language incurs covered costs as a result of ongoing environmental contamination occurring over more than one year and the insurer provided coverage for less than the full period of years in which contamination occurred, should the direct liability of the sued insurer be pro rated in some manner among all insurers \u2018on the risk,\u2019 limiting the direct liability of the sued insurer to its share but leaving the insured free to seek the balance from other such insurers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\">\u201c2. If some form of pro rata liability is called for in such circumstances, what allocation method or formula should be used?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-13\">\u201c3. If a single insurer in such circumstances is subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>liability under more than one policy and each policy has a separate deductible or self-insured retention, should the insured be able to collect covered losses from a single policy subject only to that policy\u2019s deductible or self-insured retention, or should liability be reduced by the sum of the applicable self-insured retentions, effectively allocating total liability across the policies of that insurer in effect during the contamination period?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Century Indem. Co., </em>529 F.3d 8, 24 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">We answer the certified questions as follows with respect to the policies at issue. As to the first certified question, we respond that liability should be prorated. As to the second certified question, we respond by adopting the time-on-the-risk method of prorating liability in the absence of evidence more closely approximating the actual distribution of property damage. Our answers to the first two certified questions obviate the need to answer the third certified question.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\"><em>Facts. </em>We summarize the background facts and procedural history set forth in the opinion accompanying the certification order, <em>id. </em>at 10-23, supplemented by additional undisputed facts from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">1. <em>Background. </em>Boston Gas Company (Boston Gas) is the largest provider of natural gas in the New England area. Before natural gas became New England\u2019s primary energy source, Boston Gas produced gas fuel at facilities called manufactured gas plants (MGPs). The MGPs created gas by heating coal in large ovens, generating gas that was then purified and piped out for use. This process produced a variety of byproducts, including ash, drip oil, tar, and coke. Many of these byproducts are nonbiodegradable and some are deemed carcinogenic. These byproducts now contaminate the ground and water around many former MGP sites. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Contamination has been discovered at twenty-nine former Boston Gas MGPs. This case concerns only one of those sites, located in Everett.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Boston Gas operated the Everett MGP from 1908 until about 1969. The Everett MGP produced manufactured gas and processed coke oven gas purchased from a nearby coke plant. In 1995, a routine investigation uncovered contamination at the Everett site. The primary contaminant in this case was tar, which is the main liquid byproduct of manufactured gas production.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the site had been sold to a new owner (DOMAC, LLC) in 1970, Boston Gas was strictly liable under Massachusetts law for all costs associated with the investigation and cleanup of the contamination caused by the Everett MGP\u2019s operations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">2. <em>The Century policies. </em>Boston Gas purchased CGL insurance policies from several different insurers during its operation of the Everett MGP. During the period from December 1, 1951, through December 1, 1969, three different first-layer excess CGL policies were issued by Century Indemnity Company (Century) to Boston Gas which provided coverage for, among other things, operations at the Everett MGP.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The policies were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>occurrence based, meaning that (subject to any self-insured retention,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> policy limits, and other terms and conditions) Century would indemnify Boston Gas for its \u201cultimate net loss\u201d for liabilities stemming from, among other things, property damage caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d The definitions of \u201cultimate net loss\u201d and \u201coccurrence\u201d varied slightly among the policies. Other terms of the policies varied as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">a. <em>1951-1960. </em>The first Century policy, XPL-3392, was in effect during the years from 1951 to 1960. This policy was lost, but a jury hearing the case in the Federal District Court found that the policy had a $1 million policy limit in 1951 and from 1955-1960, and a limit of $500,000 from 1952 to 1954. The jury did not determine the amount of the lost policy\u2019s self-insured retention. The jury did not determine the other terms of this policy, nor are they apparent from the record, but the parties do not dispute that they were occurrence-based policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">b. <em>1960-1966. </em>The second Century policy, XPL-5607, was in effect during the years 1960 to 1966. This policy had a per occurrence limit of $1 million and a self-insured retention of $100,000. In the insuring agreement, Century agreed: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">\u201c[T]o indemnify [Boston Gas] for <em>ultimate net loss </em>in excess of the retained limit . . . which [Boston Gas] may sustain by reason of the liability imposed upon [it] by law, or assumed by [it] under contract or agreement . . . [f]or damages because of injury to or destruction of property, including the loss of use thereof, caused by an occurrence as defined herein\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The policy defined \u201coccurrence\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">\u201c[E]ither an accident happening during the policy period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>or a <em>continuous or repeated exposure to conditions </em>which unexpectedly and unintentionally <em>causes injury to or destruction of property during the policy period. </em>All damages arising out of such exposure to substantially the same general conditions shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The policy defined \u201cultimate net loss\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">\u201c[T]he <em>sum actually paid in cash in the settlement or satisfaction of losses for which [Boston Gas] is liable, </em>either by adjudication or compromise with the written consent of [Century], after making proper deductions for all recoveries and salvages collectible, and for other insurance that is in excess of the retained Emit, but shall exclude all salaries of employees and office expenses of [Boston Gas] incurred in investigation, adjustment and litigation\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">In a section of the insuring agreement entitled, \u201cPolicy Period, Territory,\u201d the policy stated that it \u201capplie[d] only to occurrences which happen during the policy period within the United States of America, its territories or possessions, or Canada.\u201d Finally, the policy contained the following \u201c[o]ther insurance\u201d clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">\u201cIf other collectible insurance with any other insurer is available to [Boston Gas] covering a loss also covered hereunder (except insurance purchased to apply in excess of the Emit of liability hereunder), the insurance hereunder shall be in excess of, and not contribute with, such other insurance. If collectible insurance under any other policy of [Century] is available to [Boston Gas], covering a loss also covered hereunder (other than underlying insurance of which the insurance afforded by this policy is in excess), [Century\u2019s] Emit of liability shall in no event exceed the greater or greatest Emit of liability applicable to such loss under this or any other such policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">c. <em>1966-1969. </em>The third Century policy, XCP-3547, was in effect during the years 1966 to 1969. This policy had a per occurrence Emit of $17 million and a self-insured retention of $100,000. The insuring agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-10\">\u201c[Century] will indemnify [Boston Gas] for ultimate net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>loss in excess of the retained limit hereinafter stated which [Boston Gas] shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of . . . property damage ... to which this policy applies, caused by an occurrence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The policy defined \u201c[occurrence,\u201d with respect to property damage, as \u201can accident, including injurious exposure to conditions, which results, during the policy period, in property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of [Boston Gas].\u201d \u201cProperty damage\u201d was defined as \u201cinjury to or destruction of tangible property.\u201d The policy defined \u201cultimate net loss\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">\u201c[T]he sum actually paid or payable in cash in the settlement or satisfaction of losses for which [Boston Gas] is liable either by adjudication or compromise with the written consent of [Century], after making proper deduction for all recoveries and salvages collectible, but excludes all loss expenses and legal expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees, court costs and interest on any judgment or award) and all salaries of employees and office expenses of [Boston Gas], [Century] or any underlying insurer so incurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">In a section entitled, \u201cPolicy Period, Territory,\u201d the policy stated that it \u201capplie[d] to personal injury, property damage or advertising offense which occurs anywhere during the policy period.\u201d Additionally, in the section setting forth the policy limits and Boston Gas\u2019s self-insured retention, the policy stated: \u201cFor the purpose of determining the limit of [Century\u2019s] liability, all damages arising out of continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.\u201d Finally, the policy contained two \u201c[o]ther insurance\u201d clauses. The first, entitled \u201cOther Insurance with [Century],\u201d provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">\u201cIf collectible insurance under any other policy of [Century] is available to [Boston Gas], covering a loss also covered hereunder, [Century\u2019s] total liability shall in no event exceed the greater or greatest limit of liability applicable to such loss under this or any other such policy provided, however, this does not apply to insurance with [Century] which is written as underlying insurance or which is written as excess insurance over the limit provided in this policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The second, entitled, \u201cOther Insurance Not with [Century],\u201d provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">\u201cIf collectible insurance with any other insurer is available to [Boston Gas] covering a loss also covered hereunder the insurance hereunder shall be in excess of, and not contribute with such other insurance, provided, however, this does not apply to insurance which is written as excess insurance over the limit provided in this policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">3. <em>Procedural history. </em>On August 4, 1995, after it had investigated and begun to clean the Everett site, Boston Gas wrote to Century, placing it on notice that Boston Gas might seek indemnification for the costs associated with its investigation and cleanup of the contaminated soils and groundwater at and near the Everett site. Century \u201creserved its rights,\u201d and on October 22, 2002, Boston Gas filed a diversity action against Century in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Boston Gas sought a declaratory judgment as to Century\u2019s obligations under the insurance policies and damages for Century\u2019s breach of the policies. Century asserted a counterclaim and brought third-party claims against other Boston Gas insurers. A three-week jury trial between Boston Gas and Century ensued, which focused on the Everett site.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">In the Federal District Court proceeding, Boston Gas argued that to recover under the insurance policies, it had to prove only that an occurrence had caused some off-site property damage during the policy periods.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Boston Gas claimed that various \u201cleaks and spills\u201d of tars and oils caused \u201ccontinuous contamination\u201d of the Everett site (an \u201coccurrence\u201d), which led to off-site property damage. Such off-site property damage, according to Boston Gas, required Century to indemnify Boston Gas for all of its liabilities (its \u201cultimate net loss,\u201d in the language of the policies) connected to the occurrence. Century countered by arguing that various exclusions in the policies precluded or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>limited indemnification. The jury ultimately found Century liable, and awarded Boston Gas $ 6,227,327.90 in damages for the costs it incurred in the investigation and cleanup of the environmental contamination at the Everett site.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The issue that remained was whether and how those damages were to be allocated among the various insurers whose policies had been triggered by the environmental contamination at the Everett site. Boston Gas argued that under Massachusetts law Century was liable to Boston Gas for the entire damages award, and would then be entitled to seek contribution from Boston Gas\u2019s other insurers. See <em>Rubenstein </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 842, 852 (1998), <em>S.C., </em>429 Mass. 355 (1999) (applying joint and several allocation method). See also <em>Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 646, 648, 654-661 (2003) (applying joint and several allocation method under Illinois law). Century argued that the damages should be prorated among all of the insurers who provided coverage for the risk over the life of the Everett site, and sought certification of the allocation question to this court. See <em>A.W. Chesterton Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>445 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Mass. 502, 506 &amp; n.3 (2005) (noting that Appeals Court adopted \u201call sums\u201d over \u201cpro rata\u201d approach in two cases, but reserving issue for future decision because neither party challenged \u201call sums\u201d approach). The Federal District Court judge denied Century\u2019s request for certification, concluding that <em>\u201cRubenstein </em>[v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 842 (1998), <em>S.C., 429 </em>Mass. 355 (1999),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] and its progeny . . . compel me to adopt the \u2018all sums,\u2019 joint-and-several' allocation method.\u201d The judge also reasoned that certification was not appropriate because Century\u2019s ability to \u201ceffectively allocate liability among all triggered insurers via a contribution claim\u201d meant that the allocation issue was not outcome-determinative. See S.J.C. Rule 1:03 (providing for certification of \u201cquestions of law of this State which may be determinative of the cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The judge then entered separate and final judgment as to the Everett site under Fed. R. Civ. R 54 (b). Applying the joint and several allocation method, the judge ruled that Boston Gas was entitled to select from which Century policy it would seek indemnification. Boston Gas chose the XCP-3547 policy, which had a per occurrence limit of $17 million and a per occurrence self-insured retention of $100,000. Accordingly, the judge awarded Boston Gas $6,127,327.90, which was the difference between the amount that the jury awarded to Boston Gas and the self-insured retention under the XCP-3547 policy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The judge also issued a declaratory judgment obligating Century to pay all future costs associated with the investigation and environmental cleanup of the Everett site. Century appealed from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (First Circuit), Century challenged the Federal District Court judge\u2019s application of the joint and several allocation method. <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Century Indem. Co., </em>529 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 2008). After noting that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court \u201chas not yet resolved [the] allocation question,\u201d the First Circuit surveyed the merits of both \u201cpro rata allocation\u201d and \u201cjoint and several allocation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13-15. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>also noted the split of authority among other States, concluding that a \u201cgrowing plurality\u201d of States apply pro rata allocation, while \u201ca significant number\u201d of other States apply joint and several allocation. <em>Id. </em>at 13-14 &amp; nn. 6-7. See notes 26 and 29, <em>infra. </em>The First Circuit then certified the three questions set forth above because it \u201cfound no controlling [Supreme Judicial Court] precedent on the allocation question and the issue is determinative of the scope of Boston Gas\u2019[s] claim.\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Century Indent. Co., supra </em>at 15. We turn now to the certified questions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Pro rata versus joint and several </em>allocation,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The first certified question requires us to decide how to allocate liability for long-term environmental contamination where a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>policyholder sues one of its CGL insurers that provided coverage for the risk (was \u201con the risk\u201d) for only a portion of the time during which the contamination took place. This allocation issue commonly arises in the context of insurance disputes involving so-called \u201clong-tail claims\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> for injuries caused by environmental damage and toxic exposure. See 15 G. Couch, Insurance \u00a7 220:25, at 220-26 (3d ed. 2005). These long-tail claims cause problems for courts because \u201c[environmental damage and toxic exposure cases often involve injuries that occur over a number of years, known as \u2018progressive injuries.\u2019 \u201d Comment, Allocating Progressive Injury Liability Among Successive Insurance Policies, 64 U. Chi. L. Rev. 257, 257 (1997). In the ordinary case of a nonprogressive injury (e.g., motor vehicle accident or one identified tar spill), the policy in place at the time the covered damage or injury took place would cover all consequential damages, even those taking place after the policy period. 2 A.D. Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes \u00a7 11:4, at 11-111 (5th ed. 2007).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Progressive injuries like the environmental contamination in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>case are different.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Progressive injuries of this type are \u201cindivisible injuries attributable to ongoing events without a single clear \u2018cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Century Indem. Co., </em>529 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 2008). \u201cProgressive injuries frequently occur over time periods in which a hable party had insurance coverage under several different insurance policies, often provided by a number of insurance companies.\u201d Comment, <em>supra. </em>As the First Circuit recognized, \u201c[t]he language of traditional [CGL] policies drafted before such law suits became common<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u2014 does not neatly map onto these types of injuries.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Century Indem,. Co., supra, </em>citing Hickman, Allocation of Environmental Cleanup Liability Between Successive Insurers, 17 N. Ky. L. Rev. 291, 292 (1990). Thus, courts struggle with the two analytically distinct concepts of (1) the trigger of coverage and (2) the scope of coverage under triggered CGL policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\u201c \u2018Trigger of coverage\u2019 is a term of art whereby the court describes what must occur during the policy period for potential coverage to commence under the specific terms of an insurance policy.\u201d <em>A.W. Chesterton Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>445 Mass. 502, 518 (2005), quoting <em>Rubenstein </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 842, 850 n.6 (1998). \u201c[Cjourts have adopted four trigger of coverage approaches: (1) manifestation; (2) injury-in-fact or actual damage; (3) exposure; and (4) continuous.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> 23 E.M. Holmes, Appleman on Insurance \u00a7 145.3[B][1], at 13-14 (2d ed. 2003). We rejected the manifestation trigger theory in an environmental contamination case involving CGL language very similar to the language in the Century policies here, see <em>Trustees of Tufts Univ. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>415 Mass. 844, 853-855 (1993), and have not yet had occasion to adopt one of the other trigger theories in the context of environmental contamination. We do not address the trigger issue in this case, however, because it is outside the ambit of the certified questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Instead, we focus our analysis on the scope of coverage that the triggered CGL policies must provide in a case such as this.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Courts in other jurisdictions have struggled to define the scope of coverage where successive CGL policies are triggered by long-tail claims for injuries which take place over many years and are caused by environmental damage or toxic exposure. In most of these cases, \u201cit is both scientifically and administratively impossible to allocate to each policy the liability for injuries occurring only within its policy period.\u201d Comment, Allocating Progressive Injury Liability Among Successive Insurance Policies, 64 U. Chi. L. Rev. 257, 257-258 (1997). See 15 G. Couch, Insurance \u00a7 220:25, at 220-26 (3d ed. 2005) (with respect to \u201cenvironmental damage and toxic exposure cases ... it is virtually impossible to allocate to each policy the liability for injuries occurring only within its policy period\u201d). \u201cWhen it is impossible to determine the proportion of damage that occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>within each period, the law must allocate damages among the policies.\u201d Comment, <em>supra </em>at 258. Thus, \u201cthe courts are left with the nettlesome problem of how to allocate damages among the policies.\u201d 15 G. Couch, Insurance, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Two principal approaches to the allocation issue have developed, leading to disagreement among State courts.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The first approach, generally preferred by policyholders, is often referred to as the \u201cjoint and several\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> allocation method.

Courts applying pro rata allocation typically \u201cfocus[] on the definitions of \u2018occurrence,\u2019 \u2018bodily injury\u2019 and \u2018property damage,\u2019 when read in conjunction with the \u2018Insuring Agreement,\u2019 to require the allocation of loss to a particular policy be proportionate to the damage suffered during that policy\u2019s term.\u201d 23 E.M. Holmes, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 145.4[A][2][b], at 25. Pro rata allocation \u201cassigns a dual purpose to the phrase \u2018during the policy period\u2019 in the CGL policy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>definition of \u2018occurrence.\u2019 The phrase serves both as a trigger of coverage and as a limitation on the promised \u2018all sums\u2019 coverage.\u201d Bratspies, Splitting the Baby: Apportioning Environmental Liability Among Triggered Insurance Policies, 1999 BYU L. Rev. 1215, 1234. Courts adopting this method allocate a portion of the total loss to each triggered policy using a variety of different formulas. See 23 E.M. Holmes, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 145.4[A][2][b]-[d], at 24-32. See also S.M. Seaman &amp; J.R. Schulze, Allocation of Losses in Complex Insurance Coverage Claims \u00a7 4.3[b], at 4-17 to 4-21 (2d ed. 2008) (describing nine pro rata allocation formulas). The pro rata \u201capproach emphasizes that part of a long-tail injury will occur outside any particular policy period. Rather than requiring any one policy to cover the entire long-tail loss, [pro rata] allocation instead attempts to produce equity across time.\u201d Bratspies, <em>supra </em>at 1232. \u201cOne important feature of a pro rata allocation is that courts adopting this type of allocation generally require the policyholder to participate in the allocation ... for those periods of no insurance, self-insurance, or insufficient insurance.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> S.M.

In <em>Rubenstein </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 842, 843 (1998), a policyholder sued its insurers seeking indemnification and defense for liability stemming from an underground fuel oil leak and resulting soil contamination in Newton. The trial judge ruled that one of the insurers was obligated to indemnify the policyholder for the full amount the policyholder paid to settle a lawsuit brought against it for the soil contamination. <em>Id. </em>at 845. Although the insurer\u2019s indemnity obligation was reduced by the amount the policyholder had received from other insurers that had settled, the judge did not allocate damages on a pro rata basis. <em>Id. </em>With little express analysis, the Appeals Court upheld the judge\u2019s failure to allocate damages on a pro rata basis. <em>Id. </em>at 852. The court relied primarily on the \u201call sums\u201d policy language and the continuous nature of the contamination in reaching its conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 852-853.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In <em>Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 646, 648, 654-661 (2003), the Appeals Court again applied joint and several liability in the context of environmental contamination, but this time as a matter of Illinois law. The court relied primarily on the policy language, which provided no \u201cbasis for limiting indemnification to only those damages occurring during the policy period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658. Notably, the policy contained a provision, entitled \u201cPrior Insurance and Non Cumulation of Liability,\u201d that addressed property damage occurring before and after the policy period.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 656. The court reasoned that this provision would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201csuperfluous had the drafter intended that damages would be allocated among insurers based on their respective time on the risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After reviewing several decisions from Illinois appellate courts, the Appeals Court rejected the pro rata approach in favor of joint and several allocation.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 656-661.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">We have not yet considered the allocation question.

The First Circuit\u2019s certified questions now present us with an opportunity to consider the merits of pro rata versus joint and several allocation. Century and some amici urge us to apply the pro rata method of allocation. Boston Gas and some amici, on the other hand, advocate for joint and several allocation. In deciding which approach to adopt, we must look first to the policy language.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law. <em>Allmerica Fin.

Finally, \u201c[a]ny ambiguities in the language of an insurance contract are interpreted against the insurer who used them and in favor of the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Allmerica Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Century argues that the plain and unambiguous policy language of the XCP-3547 policy (the policy from which Boston Gas chose to recover in the Federal District Court), mandates application of the pro rata allocation method. Century reasons that the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d establishes that the policy is triggered when Boston Gas demonstrates that \u201can accident\u201d or \u201cinjurious exposure to conditions\u201d resulted in property damage \u201cduring the policy period.\u201d Once the policy is triggered, Century argues (and subject to the policy\u2019s conditions and exclusions), the insuring agreement provides that Century will indemnify Boston Gas only for the \u201cultimate net loss\u201d that Boston Gas is \u201clegally obligated to pay [as damages] <em>\u2018because of .. . \u2018property </em>damage\u2019 <em>... \u2018to which this policy </em>applies\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original). Century then looks to the \u201cPolicy Period, Territory\u201d provision as supplying a definition of the phrase \u201cto which this policy applies.\u201d That provision states that \u201c[t]his policy applies to . . . <em>property damage . . . </em>which occurs anywhere <em>during the policy period\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Century concludes that the policy provides coverage only for Boston Gas\u2019s liability resulting from property damage occurring during the policy period. Thus, a pro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>rata allocation method is required by the policy language where, as here, the amount of contamination occurring during any one policy period cannot be accurately determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Boston Gas argues that the plain and unambiguous language in the Century policies compels the adoption of the joint and several allocation method. It agrees with Century that the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d establishes what must happen for one of the polices to be triggered, that is, property damage happening during the policy period. However, it contends that once the policy is triggered, the \u201cultimate net loss\u201d provision in the insuring agreement defines the scope of Century\u2019s obligation to indemnify Boston Gas. The Century policies define \u201cultimate net loss\u201d as \u201cthe sum actually paid\u201d by Boston Gas to settle or satisfy \u201closses\u201d for which Boston Gas is \u201cliable.\u201d Consequently, once a Century policy is triggered by property damage occurring during the policy period, Century must pay \u201cthe sum actually paid\u201d by Boston Gas for its liability and not some prorated amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Boston Gas points to other provisions in the policies that it claims show that losses covered by a policy may result from damage that takes place outside the policy period. In describing the per occurrence policy limits, the policies treat \u201call damages arising out of continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions ... as arising out of one occurrence,\u201d to cap Century\u2019s liability for continuing damage at the per occurrence limit. In addition, the XCP-3547 policy contains a provision entitled \u201cOther Insurance with [Century]\u201d that provides that if another Century policy \u201cis available\u201d to Boston Gas \u201ccovering a loss also covered hereunder, [Century\u2019s] total liability shall in no event exceed the greater or greatest limit of liability applicable to such loss under this or any other such policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Boston Gas argues further that Century\u2019s reliance on the \u201cPolicy Period, Territory\u201d provision as a limitation on the scope of coverage is misplaced. It maintains that the language that Century quotes is not a \u201cdefinition\u201d of the term \u201cto which this policy applies,\u201d but rather a portion of an unrelated provision that establishes the period and geographic scope in which the triggering event must take place. In other words, the \u201cPolicy Period, Territory\u201d provision relates only to the trigger of coverage and not to the scope of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Finally, Boston Gas points out that while the policies do not contain pro rata provisions for indemnification, the XCP-3547 policy does include a pro rata provision for defense costs.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It contends that Century could have inserted a proration provision for indemnification, but it chose not to.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac5\">We agree with Century that a pro rata allocation of losses is consistent with, if not compelled by, the most reasonable construction of the policies at issue here. In the XCP-3547 policy, Century promised to indemnify Boston Gas for the \u201cultimate net loss\u201d that it became \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages because of. . . <em>property damage ... to which this policy applies, </em>caused by an occurrence\u201d (emphasis added). The \u201cPolicy Period, Territory\u201d provision then explains that <em>\u201c[tjhis policy applies to . . . property damage . . . </em>which occurs anywhere <em>during the policy </em>period\u201d (emphasis added). In the XPL-5607 policy, Century promised to indemnify Boston Gas for the \u201cultimate net loss\u201d that it \u201cmay sustain by reason of the liability imposed upon [it] by law, or assumed by [it] under contract or agreement. . . [f]or damages because of injury to or destruction of property, including the loss of use thereof, caused by an occurrence as defined herein.\u201d The \u201cPolicy Period, Territory\u201d provision in that policy provides that \u201c[t]his policy applies only to <em>occurrences </em>which happen <em>during the policy period\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The policy defines an \u201coccurrence,\u201d with respect to property damage, as \u201ca continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which unexpectedly and unintentionally causes <em>injury to or destruction of property during the policy period\u201d </em>(emphasis added). In other words, that policy applies only to injury to or destruction of property taking place during the policy period. This conclusion is further supported by a clause in the XPL-5607 policy\u2019s provisions limiting Century\u2019s liability, which states that there is no limit to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>number of occurrences for which Boston Gas can make claims, \u201cprovided such occurrences happen <em>during the policy </em>period\u201d (emphasis added). The most reasonable reading of these provisions is that the Century policies provided coverage for that portion of Boston Gas\u2019s liability attributable to the quantum of property damage occurring during a given policy period. Our reading of this policy language is consistent with that of other courts that have construed CGL policies with similar provisions limiting the applicability of a policy to property damage that occurs during the policy period.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Moreover, this limitation of coverage to liability resulting from property damage during the policy period derives from the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d in the Century policies. In the XCP-3547 policy, an \u201coccurrence,\u201d with respect to property damage, is \u201can accident, including injurious exposure to conditions, which results, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>during the policy period, </em>in property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of [Boston Gas]\u201d (emphasis added). In the XPL-5607 policy, an \u201coccurrence,\u201d with respect to property damage, is \u201can accident happening <em>during the policy period </em>or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which unexpectedly and unintentionally causes injury to or destruction of property <em>during the policy </em>period\u201d (emphasis added). We read the phrase \u201cduring the policy period\u201d in the definitions of \u201coccurrence\u201d as limiting the promised \u201cultimate net loss\u201d coverage. See <em>EnergyNorth Natural Gas, Inc. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, </em>156 N.H. 333, 340 (2007), citing Bratspies, Splitting the Baby: Apportioning Environmental Liability Among Triggered Insurance Policies, 1999 BYU L. Rev. 1215, 1234 (\u201cTo courts adopting [pro rata allocation], the phrase \u2018during the policy period\u2019 in the policy\u2019s definition of \u2018occurrence\u2019 limits the promised \u2018all sums\u2019 coverage\u201d). This limitation makes sense: property damage during the policy period triggers the Century policies, which then respond by providing coverage for liability attributable to the amount of property damage occurring during the policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"AVm\">We reject Boston Gas\u2019s interpretation of the Century policies for several reasons. First, like other policyholders focusing on the phrase \u201call sums,\u201d Boston Gas ignores a fundamental principle of insurance contract interpretation by placing undue emphasis on the phrase \u201cultimate net loss.\u201d See <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>401 Mass. 492, 497 (1988), quoting <em>Woog-master </em>v. <em>Liverpool &amp;. London &amp; Globe Ins. Co., </em>312 Mass. 479, 481 (1942) (\u201cinsurance policies should be construed as a whole \u2018without according undue emphasis to any particular part over another\u2019 \u201d). See also <em>Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>98 N.Y.2d 208, 222, 224 (2002) (policyholder\u2019s \u201csingular focus on \u2018all sums\u2019 \u201d would read out policy\u2019s limitation of coverage to liability caused by occurrences happening during policy period). Boston Gas\u2019s reading of the policies overlooks the limitation that the phrase \u201cduring the policy period\u201d places on the scope of coverage. See <em>id. </em>at 224 (\u201cjoint and several allocation is not consistent with the language of the policies providing indemnification for [\u2018ultimate net loss\u2019] . . . that resulted from an accident or occurrence \u2018during the policy period\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AlN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Second, the other provisions that Boston Gas points to do not support its position that losses covered by a Century policy may result from damage that takes place outside the policy period. For example, in the clause setting forth Century\u2019s limits of liability, the XCP-3547 policy provides that \u201call damages arising out of continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.\u201d The XPL-5607 policy contains an almost identical provision in its definition of \u201coccurrence.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Nothing in the provisions necessarily implies, however, that they refer to \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions\u201d outside the policy period. It is equally plausible to read those provisions as applying to \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions\u201d during the policy period. Moreover, these provisions govern only the number of occurrences for purposes of determining the limit of Century\u2019s liability; they do not expand coverage for damages occurring outside the policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"AGz\">Similarly, the policies\u2019 \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses do not reflect an intention to cover losses from damage outside the policy period. Rather, the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses simply reflect a recognition of the many situations in which concurrent, not successive, coverage would exist for the same loss.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> For example, we resolved a conflict between \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>401 Mass. 492, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>492-493 (1988), where one insurer issued an umbrella liability policy to the lessor of a vehicle involved in a motor vehicle accident and another insurer issued a liability policy to the lessee. The \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses were implicated in that case because the policies were concurrent and thus, in the absence of other insurance, each policy would have provided coverage for the losses from the accident. <em>Id. </em>at 493. Similarly, \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses like the ones in the Century policies might come into play where two concurrent policies, one issued to a parent company and one to a subsidiary, both insure the subsidiary. This is not a successive coverage situation, but simply one in which two concurrent policies insure the same loss. Nothing about the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses necessarily means that the policies were intended to cover losses occurring long before or after the policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"AkW\">Significantly, the XCP-3547 and XPL-5607 policies do not contain clauses that expressly provide for continuing coverage beyond the policy period. See, e.g., <em>Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 646, 656 (2003); <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Those Certain Underwriters at Lloyds, </em>650 F. Supp. 1553, 1559 (W.D. Pa. 1987); <em>Hercules, Inc. </em>v. <em>AIU Ins. Co., </em>784 A.2d 481, 493-494 (Del. 2001). For example, the policy in <em>Chicago Bridge </em>provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbG\">\u201c[I]n the event that personal injury or property damage arising out of an occurrence covered hereunder is continuing at the time of termination of this policy [the insurer] will continue to protect the [policyholder] for liability in respect of such personal injury or property damage without payment of additional premium.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amh-dedup-0\"><em>Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, supra. </em>Courts have recognized that such a provision is inconsistent with pro rata allocation because it expressly provides for coverage outside the policy period. See, e.g., <em>id.; Hercules, Inc. </em>v. <em>AIU Ins. Co., </em>supra; <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Those Certain Underwriters at Lloyds, supra </em>at 1559-1560.</p>\n<p id=\"Ava\">Further, we doubt that an objectively reasonable insured reading the relevant policy language would expect coverage for li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ability from property damage occurring outside the policy period. Read as a whole, neither Century policy expressly makes or implies a promise to pay one hundred per cent of Boston Gas\u2019s liability for multi-year pollution damage occurring decades before or after the policy period. No reasonable policyholder could have expected that a single one-year policy would cover all losses caused by toxic industrial wastes released into the environment over the course of several decades. Any reasonable insured purchasing a series of occurrence-based policies would have understood that each policy covered it only for property damage occurring during the policy year.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alo\">\u201c[T]here is no logic to support the notion that one single insurance policy among 20 or 30 years worth of policies could be expected to be held liable for the entire time period. Nor is it reasonable to expect that a single-year policy would be liable, for example, if the insured carried no insurance at all for the other years covered by the occurrence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4i\"><em>Public Serv. Co. of Colo. </em>v. <em>Wallis &amp; Cos., </em>986 P.2d 924, 940 (Colo. 1999). See <em>Security Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>264 Conn. 688, 710 (2003) (\u201cNeither the insurers nor the insured could reasonably have expected that the insurers would be liable for losses occurring in periods outside of their respective policy coverage periods\u201d). Accordingly, the Century policies are not ambiguous because they admit of only one reasonable interpretation. See <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>407 Mass. 689, 700 (1990) (\u201cIf there are two rational interpretations of policy language, the insured is entitled to the benefit of the one that is more favorable to it\u201d). In the absence of ambiguity, we decline to construe the policies in favor of the insured.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A3q\">We are not persuaded by either <em>Rubenstein </em>v. <em>Royal Ins.

App. Ct. 842 (1998), or <em>Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 646 (2003), to adopt the joint and several allocation method. As the First Circuit noted, Rubenstein\u2019s treatment of the allocation issue was indeed cursory and focused solely on the policy\u2019s \u201call sums\u201d language to the exclusion of any other policy language. See <em>Rubenstein </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., supra </em>at 852-853. As for <em>Chicago Bridge, </em>it was decided under Illinois law. <em>Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, supra </em>at 648. To the extent that the analysis of the policy language in <em>Chicago Bridge </em>was not unique to Illinois law, two key differences in the language cause us to reach a different result here. First, unlike the Century policies, the policy in <em>Chicago Bridge </em>contained a \u201cnoncumulation clause\u201d that expressly provided for coverage, in certain circumstances, for property damage continuing after the policy period ended. <em>Id. </em>at 656. See note 30, <em>supra. </em>Second, unlike the Century policies here, the policy in <em>Chicago Bridge </em>apparently did not contain a \u201cPolicy Period, Territory\u201d provision limiting the applicability of the policy to property damage happening during the policy period. Given these differences, we do not read <em>Chicago Bridge </em>as foreclosing the possibility that the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d might have some bearing on the scope of coverage under a CGL policy. Therefore, we are not persuaded by <em>Rubenstein </em>or <em>Chicago Bridge </em>to apply joint and several allocation in the circumstance of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae6\">Finally, adopting pro rata allocation is not only consistent with the policy language at issue here, but it also serves important public policy objectives. As the Supreme Court of New Hampshire recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azz-dedup-1\">\u201c[T]he joint and several allocation method is improvident. It \u2018does not solve the Allocation problem; it merely postpones it.\u2019 . . .

In this way, despite its advocates\u2019 claims to the contrary, the joint and several method does not decrease litigation costs, does not give courts guidance as to how to allocate liability, and requires insurers to \u2018factor the costs of uncertain liability into their premiums.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ato-dedup-0\"><em>EnergyNorth Natural Gas, Inc. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, </em>156 N.H. 333, 345 (2007), quoting Comment, Allocating Progressive Injury Liability Among Successive Insurance Policies, 64 U.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recognized similar benefits of pro rata allocation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbW\">\u201c[Wjhere the policies triggered are provided by multiple insurers, [pro rata] allocation avoids saddling one insurer with the full loss, the burden of bringing a subsequent contribution action, and the risk that recovery in such an action will prove to be impossible because, for instance, the insurer of other triggered policies is unable to pay. . . . Allocation results in the insured bearing the risk of any of its insurers\u2019 inability to pay, instead. There is logic in having the risk of such defalcation fall on the insured, which purchased the defaulting insurer\u2019s policy, rather than on another insurer which was a stranger to the selection process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArG\">\u201cAllocation also forces an insured to absorb the losses for periods when it self-insured and can prevent it from ben-efitting from coverage for injuries that took place when it was paying no premiums. . . .

This in turn would \u201creduce the available assets to manage the risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In sum, the pro rata allocation method promotes judicial efficiency, engenders stability and predictability in the insurance market, provides incentive for responsible commercial behavior, and produces an equitable result.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXq\">Having concluded that a pro rata allocation of losses is appropriate in the circumstances of this case, we now consider how that allocation should proceed under Massachusetts law.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>2. <em>Pro rata allocation method. </em>The second certified question requires us to determine the appropriate method or formula for allocating damages on a pro rata basis. Determining the proper method for prorating losses raises a myriad of issues, which have caused courts to adopt several different pro rata allocation methods in cases involving long-tail claims. See S.M. Seaman &amp; J.R. Schulze, Allocation of Losses in Complex Insurance Coverage Claims \u00a7 4.3[b], at 4-17 \u2014 4-21 (2d ed. 2008). The ideal method is a \u201cfact-based\u201d allocation, under which courts would \u201cdetermine precisely what injury or damage took place during each contract period or uninsured period and allocate the loss accordingly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4.3[b][l], at 18. \u201cAlthough such an allocation is the most consistent with the contract language, the inability to make such determinations or the litigation costs associated with such an exact allocation has caused courts to use various proxies for deriving fair apportionment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See, e.g., <em>Northern States Power Co. </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co., </em>523 N.W.2d 657, 662-665 (Minn. 1994) (adopting flexible time-on-the-risk approach).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We discuss here the \u201ctwo primary means of apportioning liability on a pro rata basis\u201d where a fact-based allocation is not feasible. <em>EnergyNorth Natural Gas, Inc. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, </em>156 N.H. 333, 340 (2007). Perhaps the most common method of apportionment is what has come to be known as pro rata allocation by \u201ctime on the risk.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> See S.M. Seaman &amp; J.R. Schulze, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4.3 [b] [3], at 4-19. Under this allocation method, \u201ceach triggered policy bears a share of the total damages [up to its policy limit] proportionate to the number of years it was on the risk [the numerator], relative to the total number of years of triggered coverage [the denominator].\u201d 23 E.M. Holmes, Appleman on Insurance \u00a7 145.4[A][2][b], at 24 (2d ed. 2003). \u201cApportioning costs among all triggered years is compatible with having determined that some injury or damage resulted in all of those years. Consistent with the contract language, an insurer pays its percentage of loss attributed to its policy period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29. \u201c[T]he time-on-the-risk method offers several policy advantages, including spreading the risk to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>maximum number of carriers, easily identifying each insurer\u2019s liability through a relatively simple calculation, and reducing the necessity for subsequent indemnification actions between and among the insurers.\u201d <em>Towns </em>v. <em>Northern Sec. Ins. Co., </em>964 A.2d 1150, 1166 (Vt. 2008). However, \u201c[cjritics of pro-ration by years note that it fails to consider the limits of each policy because a policy with very low limits of liability may be liable for the same amount as a policy with much greater limits, despite the likely disparity in the premium paid by the insured to the carrier(s).\u201d 23 E.M. Holmes, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 145.4[A][2][b], at 25 n.109.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The other principal method of apportionment involves prorating losses by years and limits. The Supreme Court of New Jersey adopted this method in <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Ins. Co., </em>138 N.J. 437, 474-477 (1994), and it was subsequently adopted by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, which explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">\u201cUnder pro-ration by years and limits, loss is allocated among policies \u2018based on both the number of years a policy is on the risk as well as that policy\u2019s limits of liability. The basis of an individual insurer\u2019s liability is the aggregate coverage it underwrote during the period in which the loss occurred.\u2019 . . . Under this approach, \u2018an insurer\u2019s proportionate share is established by dividing its aggregate policy limits for all the years it was on the risk for the single, continuing occurrence by the aggregate policy limits of all the available policies and then multiplying that percentage by the amount of indemnity costs.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-7\"><em>EnergyNorth Natural Gas, Inc. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, </em>156 N.H. 333, 341 (2007), quoting 23 E.M.

Rep. 43, 60 (2002). The rationale for allocating in this manner is \u201cthat insurers who provided more coverage, that is, higher limits or lower deductibles, assumed more of the risk of liability than insurers who provided less coverage.\u201d Comment, Allocating Progressive Injury Liability Among Successive Insurance Policies, 64 U. Chi. L. Rev. 257, 274-275 (1997). \u201cA major criticism of pro-ration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>by years and limits is that insurers with higher limits may be liable for a disproportionate share of damages based solely on their limits.\u201d 23 E.M. Holmes, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 145.4[A][2][c], at 30 n.133.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Century asks us to adopt the time-on-the-risk method in the absence of evidence more closely approximating the actual distribution of property damage. It argues, however, that we should leave room for lower courts to adopt different practical approaches to proration when the facts permit a more accurate estimation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>how much property damage took place in each period. In its brief, Boston Gas did not take a position as to which method of pro rata allocation would be most appropriate, but it did suggest at oral argument that some limits should be placed on pro rata allocation, such as, that there should be no allocation for uninsured years or where insurance could not be purchased. Some of the policyholder amici also suggest that it would be inappropriate to allocate to the policyholder for periods when coverage was unavailable. Century, on the other hand, argues against allocating only across periods during which insurance was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">We are persuaded that the time-on-the-risk method of allocating losses is appropriate where the evidence will not permit a more accurate allocation of losses during each policy period. \u201c[I]ts inherent simplicity promotes predictability, reduces incentives to litigate, and ultimately reduces premium rates.\u201d Comment, <em>supra </em>at 281. The <em>Owens-Illinois </em>method of prorating by years and limits \u201cdisproportionately assign[s] liability to generous policies, disproportionately increasing their price, thus making them more difficult to purchase.\u201d Comment, <em>supra </em>at 276. Moreover, \u201c[progressive injuries by definition do not. . . magically gravitate toward periods with more coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283. Although either method would require us to indulge in a \u201cprobable fiction,\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Century Indem. Co., </em>529 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir. 2008), we conclude that the more reasonable fiction to adopt is that the progressive injuries took place evenly across all policy periods. Proration by time on the risk reflects this \u201cprobable fiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See 1 A.D. Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes \u00a7 6:47, 6-418 \u2014 6-419 (5th ed. 2007) (\u201cthe most equitable [method of proration] is allocating based upon the relative periods of time each insurer was on the risk, and the courts have, in general, so recognized\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">As indicated above, most courts engaging in pro rata allocation require the policyholder to participate in the allocation to some extent. See S.M. Seaman &amp; J.R. Schulze, Allocation of Losses in Complex Insurance Coverage Claims \u00a7 4.3 [c], at 4-21 \u2014 4-28 (2d ed. 2008). \u201c[Wjhere the policyholder is self-insured for any period of time on the risk, many courts have concluded that it is equally fair and reasonable to hold the policyholder responsible for that portion of the total defense and indemnity costs over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>which he or she chose to assume the risk.\u201d <em>Towns </em>v. <em>Northern Sec. Ins. Co., </em>964 A.2d 1150, 1167 (Vt. 2008), and cases cited. That is, for triggered periods \u201cin which there is either no coverage, insufficient coverage, or coverage that was issued with an applicable exclusion, these courts require the policyholder to bear the financial burden for those periods of no insurance, self-insurance, or insufficient insurance.\u201d S.M. Seaman &amp; J.R. Schulze, <em>supra </em>at 4-21, and cases cited. Some courts have limited the policyholder\u2019s obligation to participate in the allocation to periods during which insurance was commercially \u201cavailable.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> These courts have generally held that losses should not be allocated to a policyholder for periods during which the \u201cpolicyholder was unable to obtain coverage in the market place for a particular risk and with respect to losses resulting from activities or products placed into commerce before such time as coverage became \u2018unavailable\u2019 due to pollution and asbestos exclusions.\u201d S.M. Seaman &amp; J.R. Schulze, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4.3[c][l], at 4-27. We decline to adopt such an unavailability exception because to do so would contravene the limitation of coverage in the Century policies to liability attributable to property damage during the policy periods. As Century argues in its brief, the unavailability exception \u201ceffectively provides insurance where insurers made the calculated decision not to assume risk and not to accept premiums. In effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>because the policyholder could not buy insurance, it is treated as though it did by passing those uninsurable losses to insured periods.\u201d This would not be equitable to insurers if the insured purchased coverage for only a few years where there was protracted damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Finally, we conclude that Boston Gas must satisfy only a prorated amount of its per occurrence self-insured retention for each triggered policy period, to be prorated on the same basis as Century\u2019s liability. Thus, if the pollution in this case had occurred over the course of a decade, then one-tenth of the total cleanup cost would be apportioned to each policy year and Boston Gas would be responsible for one-tenth of its applicable self-insured retention for each year. We reach this conclusion because it produces an equitable result in the face of policy language that \u201cis at best ambiguous as to what happens when the insurer is held liable for only part of a continuous occurrence.\u201d <em>Lafarge Corp. </em>v. <em>Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., </em>61 F.3d 389, 401 (5th Cir. 1995) (upholding District Court\u2019s apportionment of deductible on same basis as insurer\u2019s liability for defense costs). See <em>Allmerica Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>449 Mass. 621, 628 (2007) (\u201cAny ambiguities in the language of an insurance contract are interpreted against the insurer who used them and in favor of the insured\u201d). Therefore, unless the policy language unambiguously provides otherwise, the policyholder\u2019s self-insured retention should be prorated on the same basis as the insurer\u2019s liability in the case of continuous environmental contamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In sum, where it is not feasible to make a fact-based allocation of losses attributable to each policy period, losses should be allocated using the time-on-the-risk method we have described. To prorate using that method:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">\u201c[T]he total amount of damages should be divided by the total number of years to yield the amount of damage that is fairly attributable to each year. For example, if an insured\u2019s liability for a decade of pollution is one million dollars, then one tenth of the total liability, or $100,000, is fairly attributable to each policy-year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\"><em>Public Serv. Co. of Colo. </em>v. <em>Wallis &amp; Cos., </em>986 P.2d 924, 941 (Colo. 1999). The policyholder is responsible for any periods that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>it went without insurance. Finally, unless the policy language unambiguously provides otherwise, the policyholder is liable for only a prorated portion of its per occurrence self-insured retention for each triggered policy period, to be prorated on the same basis as the insurer\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Ultimately, the pro rata allocation method that we espouse here addresses a problem of proof. We do not foreclose the possibility that in some cases the facts may permit a more accurate estimation of how much property damage took place in each period. If the evidence permits an accurate estimation of the quantum of property damage in each policy period then proration by time on the risk may be inappropriate. Given the factual complexities of cases of this sort, we defer to trial judges in the first instance to determine whether losses can be allocated based on the amount of property damage that in fact occurred during each policy period, or must instead be allocated on the basis of each insurer\u2019s time on the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Our answers to the first two certified questions obviate the need to answer the third certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The Reporter of Decisions is to furnish attested copies of this opinion to the clerk of this court.

Boston Gas reads this question as asking the jury what Boston Gas\u2019s liability was as a result of property damage that happened from 1951 to 1969. Thus, Boston Gas understands the $6,227,327.90 figure to represent the jury\u2019s finding that Boston Gas incurred over $6.2 million in liability for property damage that happened solely from 1951 to 1969.

Boston Gas has argued before us that it need only prove that some damage occurred during a Century policy period in order to trigger Century\u2019s obligation to indemnify Boston Gas for all losses caused by property damage, even if some of the property damage took place outside the policy period. It thus appears that the jury verdict encompasses Boston Gas\u2019s liability for property damage at the Everett site over a much longer period than just 1951 to 1969.
