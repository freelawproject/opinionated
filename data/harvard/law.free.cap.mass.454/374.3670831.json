(Wendy\u2019s). The original special permit and variance provided that there be only one entrance-exit (hereinafter entrance) to the Wendy\u2019s site, and that a green strip be built along another boundary where Wendy\u2019s had proposed a second entrance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>After a jury-waived trial, the trial judge ordered the board to permit Wendy\u2019s to build a second entrance. The board appealed, claiming that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction to review its decision because Wendy\u2019s did not appeal from the single entrance limitation when initially imposed, that its denial of Wendy\u2019s request to modify the condition was in any event a proper exercise of its authority, and that the judge should not have ordered the board to issue a modified special permit and variance permitting a second entrance and removing the green strip. We transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">For the reasons described below, we conclude that the Superior Court had jurisdiction to review the board\u2019s actions. We also agree with the judge that the board did not provide adequate reasons or factual support for its decisions denying relief to Wendy\u2019s and that a remand to the board would only delay an inevitable result. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts found by the judge, supplemented by undisputed facts of record.\u00ae In 1992, in anticipation of constructing a restaurant on property at the intersection of Boston Road and Pollard Street in the town of Billerica (town), Wendy\u2019s petitioned the board for a special permit<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>variance<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to allow the construction of a restaurant with a \u201cdrive-through window.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On March 4, 1992, the board granted both, provided that there be only one entrance to the Wendy\u2019s site from Boston Road, and that there be no access from Pollard Street and the proposed second access converted to a green strip.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In 1993, Wendy\u2019s purchased the site, on which it built its restaurant in conformity with the special permit and variance. Meanwhile, the Massachusetts Highway Department, in conjunction with the town department of public works, began planning a roadway improvement project with the goal of widening Boston Road from two to four lanes, including the portion in front of Wendy\u2019s, and in 1993 the Commonwealth and the town began conducting informational meetings regarding the redesign and reconstruction of the road. To accommodate the expansion project, the town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>board of selectmen (selectmen) voted to acquire certain land from Wendy\u2019s and the abutting property on which a Christy\u2019s Market was located,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and in September, 1995, an order of taking was executed by the selectmen, see G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">At trial the judge found that the roadway expansion had \u201csignificantly\u201d changed the traffic patterns in and around Wendy\u2019s. Before the expansion, vehicles entered the Wendy\u2019s site from the southbound, far side of Boston Road, crossing one lane of oncoming traffic. Vehicles leaving Wendy\u2019s could turn left (into the far lane) or right (into the near lane) onto Boston Road. After the road expansion, vehicles entering Wendy\u2019s from the southbound side of the road were required to cross two lanes of oncoming traffic. New signs prohibited vehicles leaving Wendy\u2019s from turning left onto Boston Road, requiring southbound vehicles leaving Wendy\u2019s to drive in the opposite direction on Boston Road until they are able to make a \u201cU turn\u201d at a cross street or other appropriate location.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">As a result of the new traffic configuration,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in October, 1997, five years after Wendy\u2019s had obtained its special permit and variance, Wendy\u2019s petitioned the board to \u201cmodify\u201d the 1992 special permit and variance to permit it to create curb cuts in the green strip and to construct a second entrance onto Pollard Street.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Wendy\u2019s requests for modification were considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>by the board in December, 1997. At the time the dispute between the town and Wendy\u2019s concerning the value of Wendy\u2019s land taken by eminent domain was ongoing. See note 10, <em>supra. </em>Wendy\u2019s submitted letters from the town director and town counsel, and from the Massachusetts Highway Department director approving a Pollard Street entrance, and Wendy\u2019s attorney brought to the board\u2019s attention a traffic survey evidencing that there would be no adverse traffic impact on Pollard Street. Wendy\u2019s submitted a revised plan showing the proposed entrance onto Pollard Street, and informed the board that the plan had been approved by \u201cthe town and the state.\u201d The minutes of the board meeting reflect that two residents of Pollard Street addressed the board, voicing concerns that the traffic flow would be adversely affected by an entrance on to Pollard Street. The board summarily denied Wendy\u2019s request.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Wendy\u2019s sought judicial review of the board\u2019s denial. In December, 1997, it filed a complaint in the Superior Court alleging that the board\u2019s refusal to modify its 1992 decisions was, among other things, \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201clegally untenable.\u201d See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Wendy\u2019s also sought declaratory relief pursuant to G. L. c. 231A that the board be ordered to grant Wendy\u2019s requests. Some fifteen months later, the parties sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>to resolve both the eminent domain land value dispute, see note 10, <em>supra, </em>and Wendy\u2019s judicial review of the board\u2019s zoning decision, and jointly requested that the Superior Court remand the case to the board for further consideration, which it did. By this time, the expansion of Boston Road had been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In May, 1999, after reconsideration of the matter, the board again denied Wendy\u2019s request for modification on substantially the same grounds as its 1997 decision. See note 13, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Wendy\u2019s again sought judicial review of the board\u2019s decision. It commenced a second action in the Superior Court alleging, inter aha, that the board\u2019s 1999 decision was \u201carbitrary, [was] based on legally untenable grounds, [was] insufficient in law,\u201d and was \u201cin contravention of the evidence presented and accepted by the Board.\u201d Wendy\u2019s again sought declaratory relief pursuant to G. L. c. 231 A, and requested that the 1997 and 1999 decisions of the board be annulled and the board ordered to modify the special permit and variance to allow an entrance onto Pollard Street. The two cases were consolidated by a Superior Court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">After a jury-waived trial during which one witness testified for Wendy\u2019s,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the minutes of the December 3, 1997, board meeting were admitted in evidence, and the judge took a view of the site, the judge concluded that the 1997 and 1999 decisions of the board denying Wendy\u2019s requests were \u201cbased on general conclusions without reliance on any facts in the record\u201d and therefore invalid.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Citing <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Chatham, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>52 Mass. App. Ct. 349, 356 (2001), she correctly acknowledged that \u201ceven when a zoning board cites no particularized reasons or any specific evidence for its denial decision, its action will be upheld ... if a rational basis for the denial exists which is supported in the record.\u201d She concluded, however, that \u201c[e]ven in applying that deferential standard, this Court can find nothing in the record to support the Board\u2019s reasoning for its decision to deny Wendy\u2019s special permit and variance request.\u201d She ordered the board\u2019s 1997 and 1999 decisions annulled insofar as they denied Wendy\u2019s a second entrance onto Pollard Street. She also ordered the board \u201cto issue the special permit for construction of the access and egress driveway onto Pollard Street and a variance for green strip and green space requirements at the site.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">2. <em>Regulatory framework. </em>Before turning to the merits, we briefly describe the regulatory framework governing this appeal. The Zoning Act, G. L. c. 40A (act), sets out, in relevant part, procedures by which a special permit or variance may be obtained, and by which an \u201caggrieved\u201d party may take an appeal from a zoning decision to the applicable permit granting authority. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 8. The act requires that a board create \u201ca detailed record of its proceedings\u201d and set forth \u201cclearly\u201d the \u201creason for its decision and of its official actions.\u201d G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15. The act permits modification, G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 14,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and reconsideration, G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 16,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> of prior decisions. General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 17, in turn, provides that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved\u201d by a decision of a board of appeals may seek judicial review in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Review of a board\u2019s decision in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, involves a \u201cpeculiar\u201d combination of de novo and deferential analyses. <em>Pendergast </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>331 Mass. 555, 558 (1954).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Although fact finding in the Superior Court is de novo, a judge must review with deference legal conclusions within the authority of the board.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Mellendick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Edgartown, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 852, 857 (2007), quoting <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>DiVirgilio, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 24, 29 (2002) (\u201creasonable construction that a zoning board of appeals gives to the by-laws it is charged with implementing is entitled to deference\u201d). Among the purposes of the act is to achieve \u201cgreater implementation of the powers granted to municipalities,\u201d including \u201crestricting, prohibiting, permitting or regulating\u201d the uses of land. St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 2A. These powers are not to be \u201cnarrowly\u201d construed. <em>Col-lura </em>v. <em>Arlington, </em>367 Mass. 881, 885 (1975), citing <em>Decoulos </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>360 Mass. 428, 429 (1971). Deference is also owed to a local zoning board because of its special knowledge of \u201cthe history and purpose of its town\u2019s zoning by-law.\u201d <em>Duteau </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Webster, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 664, 669 (1999). Accordingly, a judge must give \u201csubstantial deference\u201d to a board\u2019s interpretation of its zoning bylaws and ordinances. <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>400 Mass. 444,453 (1987). While a judge is to give \u201cno evidentiary weight\u201d to the board\u2019s factual findings, the decision of a board \u201ccannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>be disturbed unless it is based on a legally untenable ground\u201d or is based on an \u201cunreasonable, whimsical, capricious or arbitrary\u201d exercise of its judgment in applying land use regulation to the facts as found by the judge. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., </em>429 Mass. 478, 487 (1999), quoting <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Duxbury, </em>356 Mass. 635, 639 (1970); <em>Zaltman </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Stoneham, </em>357 Mass. 482, 485 (1970). Although the judge determines the facts, it is \u201cthe board\u2019s evaluation of the seriousness of the problem, not the judge\u2019s, which is controlling.\u201d <em>Subaru of New England, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Canton, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 483, 488 (1979), quoting <em>Copley </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Canton, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 821, 821 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Because judicial review of a board\u2019s decision \u201cinvolves a highly deferential bow to local control over community planning,\u201d <em>Britton </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 68, 73 (2003), the power under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, to order a modification of a decision of the board is also constrained: \u201cModifications and changes should be analyzed and approved by the Board, which is better equipped than a court to consider such matters.\u201d <em>Board of Appeals of Dedham </em>v. <em>Corporation Tifereth Israel, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 876, 876 (1979). However, G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, specifically authorizes a court to \u201cmake such other decree as justice and equity may require.\u201d See note 21, <em>supra. </em>In this regard we have approved affirmative relief from the denial by the board where remand to a board would be futile,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>where it is clear that remand would postpone an inevitable result.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">On appellate review, the judge\u2019s findings of fact will not be set aside unless they are \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d or there is \u201cno evidence to support them.\u201d <em>DiGiovanni </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 343 (1985). With respect to conclusions regarding interpretations of a zoning ordinance and their application to the facts, an appellate court remains \u201chighly deferential\u201d to a board\u2019s denial decision \u201ceven if the facts found by the court would support its issuance.\u201d <em>Britton </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, supra </em>at 74. However, a board\u2019s \u201cdiscretionary power of denial\u201d is not limitless: it will be upheld \u201cup to those rarely encountered points where no rational view of the facts the court has found supports the board\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We now turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">3. <em>Jurisdiction pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a717. </em>Only a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by a decision of a permitting authority has standing to appeal from the decision to the Superior Court. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17; <em>Sweenie </em>v. <em>A.L. Prime Energy Consultants, </em>451 Mass. 539, 543 (2008). The board argues that, when the board imposed the single entrance condition in 1992, the \u201cdesign\u201d of the Boston Road expansion was \u201cin progress\u201d and Wendy\u2019s was \u201caggrieved\u201d by the imposition of a single entrance condition in light of the anticipated 1992 plans for the road expansion. As a consequence, the board claims, Wendy\u2019s is \u201cestopped\u201d from appealing from the condition five years later, and the Superior Court was without jurisdiction to review the board\u2019s 1997 and 1999 denial of Wendy\u2019s modification requests.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17 (appeal must be filed within twenty days of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>date decision is filed with town clerk); <em>Cappuccio </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Spencer, </em>398 Mass. 304, 311 (1986) (court is \u201cwithout jurisdiction to entertain the appeal\u201d not filed within twenty days).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">We are not persuaded for two reasons. First, as the judge found, plans for the actual roadway expansion were far from finalized when the board issued its decision in 1992, and traffic patterns in and around Wendy\u2019s changed \u201csignificantly\u201d after 1992 as a result of the roadway expansion project and eminent domain taking.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Had Wendy\u2019s appealed from the board\u2019s decision in 1992, Wendy\u2019s likely would not have been an \u201caggrieved party\u201d because any claimed injury from the inchoate roadway project would have been speculative.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Ginther </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 319, 323 (1998) (\u201cInjuries that are speculative, remote, and indirect are insufficient to confer standing\u201d). The judge\u2019s findings of aggrieved status are \u201centitled to deference.\u201d <em>Tsagronis </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wareham, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 55, 58-59 (1992), <em>S.C., </em>415 Mass. 329 (1993); <em>Paulding </em>v. <em>Bruins, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 707, 709 (1984). See M. Bobrowski, Massachusetts Land Use and Planning Law \u00a7 11.03[A], at 342 (2d ed. 2002) (\u201ca finding, after trial, of standing for plaintiffs is best left undisturbed\u201d; where the \u201cjudge\u2019s findings are supported in the record, the usual standards of appellate review demand deference\u201d). We see no reason to disturb her findings regarding Wendy\u2019s standing to pursue its appeals from the board\u2019s 1997 and 1999 decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Second, contrary to the board\u2019s argument, a board\u2019s denial of an application for modification of its decision in light of changed circumstances is reviewable in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>the board\u2019s assertion that the judge\u2019s review of its actions on Wendy\u2019s 1997 and 1999 requests for modification is \u201ctantamount to an appeal\u201d of the 1992 special permit and variance, and that the judge \u201ccarved out an exception to the \u2018exclusive remedy\u2019 of [G. L.] c. 40A, \u00a7 17,\u201d that is \u201cwithout any basis or support in statutory or decisional law.\u201d A board \u201cmay be asked by a successful petitioner to modify a condition\u201d imposed in a special permit or variance decision in light of changed conditions. M. Bobrowski, Massachusetts Land Use and Planning Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 10.07[D], at 314. See also G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 14 (board may \u201cmodify any order or decision\u201d in connection with \u201capplications for special permits\u201d and \u201cpetitions for variances\u201d). And there are multiple cases in which a court has reviewed a modification decision similar to the 1997 and 1999 decisions of the board at issue here. See, e.g., <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Wayland, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 314, 323 &amp; n.21 (2005) (reviewing \u201cdecision of the planning board to deny the application to amend\u201d special permit pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17); <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Hadley, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 710 (1981) (reviewing grant of modification of existing variance).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">4. <em>Validity of the board\u2019s decision. </em>We now consider whether the judge properly annulled the board\u2019s decision denying the requested modifications. General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 15, states that a board \u201cshall\u201d make \u201ca detailed record of its proceedings\u201d setting forth \u201cclearly the reason for its decision and of its official actions.\u201d The judge held that the 1997 and 1999 decisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the board are essentially conclusions with no facts to support them.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We agree with the judge that this is insufficient to constitute \u201csubstantial facts which rightly can move an impartial mind, acting judicially, to the definite conclusion reached.\u201d <em>Shoppers\u2019 World, Inc. </em>v. <em>Beacon Terrace Realty, Inc., </em>353 Mass. 63, 67 (1967), quoting <em>Prusik </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>262 Mass. 451, 457-458 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">As the judge also noted, the board\u2019s decisions, set out in full in notes 13 and 15, <em>supra, </em>do not qualify as \u201creasons\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15: they contain no explanation or permissible inference as to why a second access from Wendy\u2019s on Pollard Street would not be in the best interests of the town or neighborhood,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> what the detriment to the public good might be, how the modification would undermine the purpose of the zoning bylaws (none of which is specified), or why the degree of traffic problems resulting from a second access is too great a departure from baseline traffic levels. General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 15 (\u00a7 18 of earlier version of G. L. c. 40A), is \u201cnot satisfied by a mere repetition of the statutory words.\u201d <em>Shoppers\u2019 World, Inc. </em>v. <em>Beacon Terrace Realty, Inc., supra. </em>When a decision contains conclusions that do nothing more than repeat regulatory phrases, and are unsupported by any facts in the record, we are constrained to conclude that the decision is \u201cunreasonable, whimsical, capricious or arbitrary,\u201d and therefore invalid. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., </em>429 Mass. 478, 486 (1999), quoting <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Duxbury, </em>356 Mass. 635, 639 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The board does not dispute the judge\u2019s findings, but asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>that, despite the weight of the evidence, it properly denied Wendy\u2019s requests for modification, pointing (on appeal) to the views of two Pollard Street residents that \u201ctraffic would likely increase\u201d as a result of the second exit. These comments were noted in the minutes of the 1997 board meeting, but are not referenced in the board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The argument fails. We are not obliged to search for facts in the record to support a rationale that the board did not itself provide. On review, the judge\u2019s role is to determine \u201cwhether the reasons given\u201d by the board \u201chad a substantial basis in fact, or were, on the contrary, mere pretexts for arbitrary action or veils for reasons not related to the purposes of the zoning law.\u201d <em>Vazza Props., Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council of Woburn, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 308, 312 (1973). \u201cReasons given\u201d are a condition precedent to this inquiry; where no such reasons are given, as here, a reviewing court cannot be satisfied that a board\u2019s actions are not arbitrary, a pretext, or otherwise impermissible.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The \u201creasons\u201d stated by the board in this case fall far short of the standard required by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">5. <em>Relief. </em>The board argues that it was error for the judge to order the board to issue a special permit and variance permitting Wendy\u2019s to construct a second entrance to its property. We disagree. In the ordinary course, a reviewing judge is reluctant to order a board to implement particular relief, such as to issue a modified special permit and variance. See Massachusetts Zoning Manual \u00a7 11.4.1 (Mass. Cont. Legal Educ. 4th ed. 2007) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>(\u201cAn appellant aggrieved by the denial of a special permit or variance should not expect the trial court to order the local board to issue the zoning relief sought\u201d). But an order of particular relief may be appropriate where remand is futile or would postpone an inevitable result. See notes 22 and 23, <em>supra. </em>We conclude that remand to the board is not warranted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">As described above, the \u201creasons\u201d for the board\u2019s 1997 and 1999 decisions denying Wendy\u2019s requests to modify its special permit and variance are inadequate as a matter of law. For the first time on appeal, the board now suggests that increased traffic on Pollard Street was the \u201creason\u201d for its decisions denying Wendy\u2019s request for modification. Its belated claim finds no support in \u2014 and is contraindicated by \u2014 the record. Wendy\u2019s points out, and the record establishes, that the board granted the owner of an <em>abutting </em>property, Christy\u2019s Market, \u201cnot one but two means of access\u201d onto Pollard Street after the board had denied Wendy\u2019s own request.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> See <em>Colangelo </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lexington, </em>407 Mass. 242, 246 (1990) (upholding judge\u2019s order to board to issue exemption to zoning bylaw because board approved, \u201cimmediately before and after denying the plaintiffs\u2019 request, projects which added significantly more traffic\u201d). Here, the judge made specific reference to the abut-ter\u2019s \u201crequests for a special permit and variance [that] were approved by the [b]oard.\u201d See B.C. Levey, Massachusetts Zoning and Land Use Law \u00a7 7-22, at 195, 196 (1996) (\u201cthe general deference afforded actions of a local [special permit granting authority] may yield to a court\u2019s sense of fairness\u201d when it appears that special permit granting authority has applied \u201cdramatically different standards to similarly situated applicants\u201d). Moreover, the board denied Wendy\u2019s requests in 1997 and 1999 without reference to any traffic impact studies or other reliable information concerning any traffic impact, notwithstanding that the board had before it an empirical traffic survey, which concluded that the proposed second access to Wendy\u2019s \u201cwill have minimal impacts on traffic surrounding the site.\u201d At trial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>judge found that the town \u201cdid not submit evidence of current traffic patterns on Pollard Street or suggest that the proposed entrance from Wendy\u2019s would substantially affect those traffic patterns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Wendy\u2019s claims that a remand to the board \u201cfor anything other than administrative or ministerial purposes would be a waste of resources and prolong this matter\u201d because on remand \u201cthe salient facts found by the Court would not change.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> On remand, a board may not ignore or disagree with the specific findings of a reviewing court after a judge has fulfilled her statutory duty to \u201cdetermine the facts,\u201d G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. A board may, of course, make \u201csuch additional findings as it may wish to make\u201d or any \u201cadditional findings suggested by the court\u2019s decision.\u201d Massachusetts Zoning Manual, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 11.6. Here, there is no basis on which the board can make contrary findings regarding the traffic on Pollard Street. As the judge recognized, the director of the town department of public works supported a second entrance from Wendy\u2019s onto Pollard Street, the director of the Massachusetts Highway Department approved of a second entrance, and the town traffic safety officer assessed Wendy\u2019s proposed plan indicating the Pollard Street access, and did not suggest any changes to the plan. At trial, Wendy\u2019s established that a second entrance on to Pollard Street would have a minimal, if any, impact on traffic. The board had the opportunity, but failed to present <em>any </em>contrary evidence. In light of this record, a further remand to the board for a third consideration of Wendy\u2019s requests for modification is not warranted because it would delay an inevitable result.
