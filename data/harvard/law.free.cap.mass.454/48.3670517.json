The defendant appealed. Represented by new counsel, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial alleging constitutionally ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The trial judge denied the motion without a hearing. The defendant appealed. On appeal he argues that the trial judge erred in asking prospective jurors a question concerning domestic violence; in admitting in evidence his unrecorded statement to police and an abuse protection order; and in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty. He also argues that the judge erred in denying his motion for a new trial. Because we conclude that none of the defendant\u2019s claims of error require a reversal of his conviction, and discern no reason to exercise our power pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\"><em>Facts. </em>We present the essential facts the jury were warranted in finding, reserving certain details for our discussion of the issues raised. The defendant and the victim had two children, Joseph, Jr. (Joey), and Sarah, who were twelve and ten years old, respectively, at the time of the murder. Visitation with his children was a source of tension between the defendant and the victim. A neighbor and a friend of the victim testified about the hostility the defendant exhibited toward the victim. From the time the couple separated in 1998, the defendant periodically made remarks about his wife, at times in front of the children, calling her \u201cfucking cunt,\u201d \u201cfucking bitch,\u201d \u201clesbian,\u201d and \u201cdike.\u201d He threatened that he would \u201cget her\u201d and would take the children. He said she \u201cwould be sorry\u201d and he would \u201cshoot her.\u201d The neighbor testified that tension was so high that eight or nine times he supervised the visitation when the defendant came to pick up the children. A \u201ccouple of times\u201d he walked the defendant out to his vehicle to calm him down in front of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">On the morning of February 16, 2004, the defendant went to pick his children up at the victim\u2019s house in Halifax. He parked his 1993 Ford Explorer Sport (SUV) in the driveway. The SUV was in good working order. Sarah went outside, and as she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>placing certain items inside the SUV, the defendant asked her where the rest of her things were, as she and her brother were going to be spending the night with him. Sarah went inside to tell the victim. Joey then went outside, placed some items in the SUV, and went back inside the house to say goodbye to the family\u2019s dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The two children were inside the house while the victim went outside to talk to the defendant to tell him that an overnight stay was not part of their agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The couple argued. The conversation ended when the victim said that the defendant should not have the children at all because he was being irrational, and she walked away toward the house. The defendant \u201clost it\u201d and put his SUV in gear, stepped on the gas pedal, and hit her. He then backed up over her. The victim\u2019s slacks had tire marks on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The children had heard tires screeching and ran outside. Sarah saw the defendant\u2019s SUV on top of the victim, as the vehicle backed up slowly. Joey testified that, although the victim was lying on the ground, the defendant was \u201cjust standing there.\u201d The defendant told Joey to go inside and dial 911. The defendant, who was a registered nurse, knew that the victim\u2019s injuries were severe, yet did nothing to help the victim while Joey was inside making the telephone call. When Joey came back outside, the defendant gave him a \u201cCPR mask\u201d that Joey placed on the victim\u2019s mouth and blew into until help arrived. The defendant did not assist Joey.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The town\u2019s fire chief was the first person to respond to the scene. He testified that there was no one at the house watching to signal him, and he drove past the house at first. When he drove into the driveway, the fire chief saw the two children, who were crying and extremely upset, with the victim. Joey was trying to \u201cperform rescue\u201d on her. The defendant was standing off to the side, leaning against his vehicle. When asked by the fire chief what had happened, the defendant made clear that he did not hit the victim, but that he \u201cran her over.\u201d Tire marks on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>asphalt driveway indicated that the SUV had accelerated toward the victim, and there were scuff marks, where dirt, or some other substance, had been rubbed off and transferred to the bumper and hood of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The victim was still alive when she was taken from the scene, but was pronounced dead the next day. The cause of death was blunt trauma to the head, intracranial bleeding, and extremity and skull fractures, including a fractured pelvis. She also had a tear in her bladder.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In a statement he gave to State troopers the day of the incident, the defendant was asked why he did not help the victim. He replied that he could not do it; he could not touch her. He said that the victim hurt him \u201clike the Nazis hurt the Jews\u201d and that he would not walk across the street for her. He stated that the victim was a sociopath who was controlling and manipulative. He claimed that she antagonized him and was always degrading him and toying with people, and that he had kept in control of himself for fourteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The defense was that this was an accident and that there was no proof that the defendant\u2019s vehicle actually struck the victim. The defendant called no witnesses, but trial counsel elicited, through cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, that the defendant also told the police that, although he was very angry at his wife, he was trying to leave but the wheels of his SUV were turned to the right (i.e., toward the victim) when he accelerated; that the Commonwealth\u2019s accident reconstruction expert could not say where the point of impact, if any, was between the victim and the SUV; and that all abrasions on the victim were superficial and there were no broken bones, even though if an SUV ran over an individual\u2019s extremities, there would be some injuries to them. He emphasized these points in closing argument. He also attacked the credibility and memory of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, stating that several of them, including police officials, were liars or were biased against the defendant. He stated that all evidence against the defendant was from \u201cquestionable sources,\u201d and that the scuff marks on the SUV were not visible on any photographs. He also contended that many people have contentious divorces and it was not proof of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\"><em>Voir dire of jurors. </em>During the voir dire of potential jurors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>the judge asked, over defense objection, \u201cHave you or any member of your immediate family or close personal friend ever been involved in an incident of domestic violence that would cause you to question your ability to be fair and impartial?\u201d The defendant argues that \u201cpotential jurors were thereby tainted with prejudice\u201d because the question created the impression that the trial was about domestic violence rather than \u201can automobile accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The judge must examine jurors fully regarding possible bias or prejudice where \u201cit appears that there is a substantial risk that jurors may be influenced by factors extraneous to the evidence presented to them.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>440 Mass. 536, 548 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 1022, 1023 (1984). The scope of a voir dire is in the sound discretion of the trial judge and will be upheld absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>443 Mass. 770, 776 (2005), <em>S.C., </em>450 Mass. 215 (2007), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>440 Mass. 731, 736 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Here, although the defense theory was that the victim\u2019s death was an accident, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence supported an allegation that the victim\u2019s death was an incident of domestic violence. Except for his unsupported assertions of juror taint and prejudice, the defendant has not shown how excluding jurors who may have been sensitive to the issue of domestic violence was an abuse of discretion, especially where the question reasonably could be seen as benefiting the defendant. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\"><em>Defendant\u2019s statement. </em>At trial, two State troopers testified to the defendant\u2019s statement to them on the day of the murder, where he admitted that he was angry, and that he put his SUV in gear, stepped on the gas pedal, ran over the victim, and then backed over her. The defendant\u2019s statement to police was not recorded. The defendant argues that this court should rule that it was unconstitutional to admit his unrecorded statement as evidence at trial. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423, 441-442 (2004), this court fully discussed, and rejected, an argument that recording of interrogations should be constitutionally required. Instead we mandated a jury instruction, if requested by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>defendant, \u201cadvising that the State\u2019s highest court has expressed a preference that such interrogations be recorded. . . and cautioning the jury that [with any unrecorded interrogation] before them, they should weigh evidence of the defendant\u2019s alleged statement with great caution and care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447-448. That instruction was given in full to the jury here at the time the first trooper testified, and the jury were reminded of all instructions concerning the defendant\u2019s statements when the second trooper took the stand immediately following the first trooper. The judge repeated the instruction in her final charge to the jury. We decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to revisit our <em>DiGiambattista </em>decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\"><em>Abuse prevention order. </em>At trial, over objection, the judge allowed the Commonwealth to introduce in evidence an abuse prevention order that the victim had obtained against the defendant some five years before the murder. The judge gave a limiting instruction, informing the jury that the order was being admitted for purposes of the nature and context of the relationship between the defendant and the victim, and the defendant\u2019s intent and motive. She also told the jury that they could not use it as proof of the murder or of the defendant\u2019s bad character. The judge repeated this instruction in her final charge to the jury. The defendant argues, in cursory fashion, that, because the order was stale, its admission was a violation of his right to fair trial and due process under the Federal and State Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Evidence that a victim has obtained an abuse prevention order against a defendant is admissible to demonstrate the existence of a hostile relationship, as the relationship may be relevant to the defendant\u2019s motive to kill. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sarourt Nom, </em>426 Mass. 152, 160 (1997), and cases cited. The admission of such evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, but such evidence should not be admitted if it relates to events that are too remote in time from the killing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gil, 393 Mass. 204, 216 (1984). See, e.g., <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>130 Mass. 472, 475 (1881) (evidence offered of animosity between defendant and wife occurring three years before wife\u2019s murder too remote to be probative). \u201cHowever, evidence of a continuing animosity between a defendant and a victim spouse, existing closer in time to the victim\u2019s death, may render the earlier evidence relevant on the issue of the defendant\u2019s motive to kill.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gil, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>432 Mass. 124, 126, 128 (2000) (evidence of abuse years before killing not too remote, where there was evidence of hostility toward victim during months before murder).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">Here the jury had the defendant\u2019s own statement that for fourteen years his relationship with the victim was acrimonious and it continued until the day of the murder, when he \u201clost it.\u201d However, we need not decide whether it was error to admit the abuse prevention order because, even if it were, we conclude that the error would have no, or only slight, effect on the jury where the order was cumulative of other evidence of hostility, including the testimony of the neighbor and the victim\u2019s friend, as well as the defendant\u2019s statement to the St\u00e1te troopers. There was no prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994) (preserved nonconstitutional errors reviewed under nonprejudicial error standard); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardone, </em>406 Mass. 123, 129 (1989) (no likelihood of miscarriage of justice where evidence of domestic abuse cumulative of other properly admitted evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-29\"><em>Denial of motion for a required finding. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred in denying his oral motion for a required finding of not guilty. He claims that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of murder in the first degree on the theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-34\">We review the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty to determine \u201cwhether the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth could have \u2018satisfied a rational trier of fact\u2019 of each element of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conkey, </em>443 Mass. 60, 72 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). Where the evidence is largely circumstantial, it is not essential that the inferences drawn should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>be the only necessary inferences. It is enough that the inferences \u201cbe reasonable and possible.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conkey, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lodge, </em>431 Mass. 461, 465 (2000). If conflicting inferences are possible from the evidence, \u201cit is for the jury to determine where the truth lies.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilborne, </em>382 Mass. 241, 245 (1981), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amazeen, </em>375 Mass. 73, 81 (1978). To show that a murder was committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty, the Commonwealth must prove that the evidence satisfies one of the factors set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass. 216, 227 (1983).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>445 Mass. 195, 202 (2005) (jury need only find \u201cone or more\u201d of the <em>Cunneen </em>factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Here there was ample evidence to find that one or more of the <em>Cunneen </em>factors was present (e.g., indifference to victim\u2019s suffering; instrument employed by defendant). The defendant was angry at the victim, put his SUV in gear, and stepped on the gas pedal with enough force to screech the tires and leave acceleration marks. He struck the victim with the vehicle and then backed over her. After he had struck the victim, she was still alive, but helpless. Even though he was a registered nurse, the defendant stood by, not offering any aid. Instead, he placed responsibility for calling 911 for emergency services and for keeping the mortally injured victim alive until help arrived, on his son, a twelve year old boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\"><em>Motion for a new trial. </em>In his motion for a new trial the defendant argued that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel, alleging that trial counsel did not consult adequately with him, properly prepare him to testify, explain all the implications of his decision not to testify at trial, or fully cross-examine the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, including the two State troopers who interviewed him on the day of the murder. The defendant also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>claimed that his waiver of his right to testify was not knowing and intelligent. In support of his contentions, the defendant submitted a 217-paragraph affidavit. The defendant also filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing. Trial counsel did not supply an affidavit addressing the defendant\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">The judge, who also was the trial judge, denied the motion without a hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She found that the defendant\u2019s affidavit was self-serving and that it was speculative that an affidavit from trial counsel would be helpful to the defendant\u2019s motion. Relying on her knowledge of trial counsel\u2019s efforts, the judge did not credit the defendant\u2019s claim that trial counsel did not \u201cconsult with, advise, and prepare the defendant thoroughly before and during trial relative to all issues, including [the defendant\u2019s] right to testify.\u201d She noted that the right to testify is rarely exercised in cases such as this \u201cwhere the defendant would be so susceptible to impeachment on account of his animus towards the victim.\u201d Relying on her knowledge of what occurred at trial, she concluded that trial counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the State troopers was \u201cmore than adequate and appropriate.\u201d The judge did not credit the defendant\u2019s \u201cbald assertion\u201d that the troopers \u201cengaged in abusive interrogation techniques.\u201d She also concluded that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to testify was valid, stating that it was made after a colloquy the judge engaged in with the defendant and after his adequate consultation with trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-29\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the judge\u2019s conclusion regarding the ineffective assistance \u00f3f counsel issues he raised was error and that the judge should have granted his motion for an evidentiary hearing. He claims that, but for the ineffective assistance of counsel, \u201ca radically different picture\u201d of the events \u201cwould likely have emerged.\u201d There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-35\">\u201cThe decision to grant a motion for a new trial rests soundly within the judge\u2019s discretion and \u2018will not be reversed unless it is manifestly unjust or . . . the trial was infected with prejudicial constitutional error.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>429 Mass. 763, 770 (1999). Moreover, we give \u2018special deference to the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>sions of a judge who was, as here, the trial judge.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>442 Mass. 485, 499 (2004).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Espada, </em>450 Mass. 687, 697 (2008). Where the judge was the trial judge, she may apply knowledge of the conduct of the trial in making a decision about the motion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>370 Mass. 746, 752-753 (1976), and cases cited. \u201cWhere the denial of a motion for a new trial \u2018is considered ... in conjunction with a defendant\u2019s direct appeal from a conviction of murder in the first degree,\u2019 we must determine whether, under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, there was a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>449 Mass. 343, 353 (2007), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>432 Mass. 704, 710 n.14 (2000). In considering a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, \u201cwe need not focus on the adequacy of trial counsel\u2019s performance . . . [but] shall consider whether there was error in the course of the trial . . . and, if there was, whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992). Tactical decisions by an attorney are error only if they were \u201cmanifestly unreasonable when made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>433 Mass. 185, 190 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coonan, </em>428 Mass. 823, 827 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">We begin by addressing the defendant\u2019s claim that his trial counsel should have submitted an affidavit concerning the defendant\u2019s allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. The defendant notes that, in deciding the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the judge mentioned the absence of an affidavit from trial counsel. According to an affidavit filed by appellate counsel to accompany the defendant\u2019s motion, appellate counsel sent a proposed affidavit to trial counsel and asked him to sign or to correct anything misleading or inaccurate. Appellate counsel avers that he received a single sentence reply from trial counsel that stated, \u201cI am sorry but I cannot help you by signing the affidavit because the contents of the affidavit are inaccurate.\u201d Trial counsel did not answer appellate counsel\u2019s follow-up request that the inaccuracies be identified.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The defendant argues that this court should create a rule that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>an attorney has a duty to provide an affidavit to accompany a defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. He bases his request on the constitutional right to effective representation; Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.3, 426 Mass. 1313 (1998); and the fiduciary duty of an attorney to his client under Massachusetts common law. We decline to create such a rule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, we agree with the judge that even if there were a duty to provide an affidavit, it is pure speculation that the affidavit would have been helpful. Given trial counsel\u2019s response that stated, without qualification, that the \u201ccontents\u201d of the proposed affidavit were not accurate, his refusal to be more specific (and thus contradict the defendant) reasonably can be seen as fulfilling a duty to the defendant, and in any event, there was no such ineffective assistance of counsel that would require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In his motion for a new trial, the defendant presented a long list of quarrels he had with the breadth and scope of the cross-examination, claiming that, because trial counsel failed adequately to consult with him, he failed effectively to cross-examine Commonwealth witnesses, including the two State troopers who testified to the statement the defendant made to them on the day of the murder. Concerning the troopers, he stated that they were misleading or lying about what he said to them and that they used abusive tactics during his interview. The judge did not abuse her discretion in discrediting the defendant\u2019s \u201cbald assertion\u201d that the troopers \u201cengaged in abusive interrogation techniques\u201d or that they were lying. She also properly relied on her knowledge of the cross-examination to conclude that trial counsel\u2019s performance was \u201cmore than adequate and appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Here, the record shows that trial counsel elicited from one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>trooper that she did not record the defendant\u2019s statement and that she was relying on her memory. Counsel implied that the trooper\u2019s memory was selective and faulty because, on direct examination, she had to consult her notes from the interview five times, and because she selectively quoted the defendant in her notes. He also asked her whether the defendant told her that he was just trying to leave when the victim was struck, which the trooper denied. On recross-examination, the trooper admitted that the defendant said that he never \u201crighted\u201d the wheels of his vehicle. Counsel emphasized the lack of a recording of the defendant\u2019s statement. In his cross-examination of the other trooper, trial counsel stressed that that trooper was present for only about five minutes of the defendant\u2019s interview and that he never took any notes. Trial counsel emphasized these points in his closing argument. See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Concerning the defendant\u2019s claim that his trial counsel did not elicit a number of \u201cfacts\u201d from other Commonwealth witnesses, our review of the record shows that, during his cross-examination, trial counsel, in essence, touched on all the issues the defendant raises, albeit in different form than the defendant would have liked. These include whether the victim\u2019s death was an accident, whether Sarah\u2019s memory that the SUV was on her mother was accurate, whether the SUV actually backed over the victim, whether the defendant flagged down the emergency vehicles, and the reasons the defendant stood back while emergency personnel tended to her.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As the judge noted, \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>guaranty of the right to counsel is not an assurance to defendants of brilliant representation or one free of mistakes.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arriaga, </em>438 Mass. 556, 582-583 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>364 Mass. 1, 13-14 (1973). The ability of trial counsel to elicit this information on cross-examination also belies the defendant\u2019s contention that trial counsel did not know the defendant\u2019s side of the story and that the trial judge could not possibly be able to decide whether trial counsel\u2019s consultation with the defendant was adequate. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Concerning the defendant\u2019s claims in his affidavit that counsel did not adequately consult with the defendant, properly prepare him to testify, or explain all the implications of his decision not to testify, the judge\u2019s decision to discredit these assertions as self-serving was proper. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rebello, </em>450 Mass. 118, 130 (2007). Moreover, she properly relied on her observations at trial to reject the defendant\u2019s contention that trial counsel did not prepare him thoroughly before and during trial relative to all issues, including his right to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">In his affidavit, the defendant admits that, both before and during trial, his counsel \u201cemphatically told me his view of the risks I faced if I testified . . . that I was incapable of focusing on anything other than my troubled relationship with [my former wife] ... he was afraid I would disparage [her] in front of the jury and blame her for my problems . . . and if I vilified [her] the jury would quickly return a guilty verdict.\u201d The defendant has not shown how this advice is manifestly unreasonable, and trial counsel\u2019s ability to form this opinion undermines the defendant\u2019s contention that he did not make an adequate effort to prepare the defendant to testify. The defendant does not argue that there is no basis for trial counsel\u2019s advice. Indeed, part of the defendant\u2019s affidavit speaks to his belief that the victim had antagonized him from the time they divorced up to the day of the murder. The defendant argues, instead, that he remained unaware that the consequence of not testifying was that the jury would not hear his side of the story. We also note that the judge, the defendant, and trial counsel were aware that, if the defendant testified to anything that would suggest that it would be unfair to exclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>evidence of the victim\u2019s state of mind (such as that he engaged in self-defense or that he had a good relationship with the victim), the Commonwealth would be allowed to call a rebuttal witness who would testify that the victim told her that she was afraid of the defendant. It was not manifestly unreasonable for the attorney to have believed that, if the defendant was incapable of focusing on anything but his relationship with the victim, the risk that he might open the door to such rebuttal was real. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac6\">Concerning the defendant\u2019s contention that his trial counsel failed to explain all the implications of not testifying and that his decision not to testify was not knowing and voluntary, the record supports the judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to testify was knowing and intelligent. During the colloquy, the defendant stated that he was not under the influence of medications or mental illness or defect that could affect his decision. He affirmed that his decision not to testify was made after adequate consultation with his counsel and was his own decision. She also noted that the defendant expressed confidence in his attorney. Indeed, the record shows that the judge called a brief recess so that the defendant could confer again with his attorney about his decision and that, afterward, the defendant stated that he accepted trial counsel\u2019s advice not to testify, that trial counsel was acting \u201c[mjost certainly\u201d in his best interests, and that counsel \u201chas presented the trial and the case, my life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Alq\">Given our conclusion that the judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, we conclude that she was warranted in not granting his motion for an evidentiary hearing on the motion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britto, </em>433 Mass. 596, 608 (2001) (judge properly decided motion for new trial without evi-dentiary hearing where record supports that no substantial issues existed).</p>\n<p id=\"AQe\"><em>Review pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>The defendant asks us to order a new trial pursuant to our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. He argues that the prejudice that resulted from his constitutionally deficient attorney creates an \u201coverwhelming likelihood\u201d that there was a miscarriage of justice. We have discussed and rejected the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>counsel. We also have reviewed the entire record and discern no reason to exercise our power to reduce the verdict or order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-8\">At trial, the defendant\u2019s niece testified that on the day before the murder, the defendant telephoned her and, in essence, asked her to invite the children to a sleepover at the defendant\u2019s house and told her that if she did, she also could stay with him. The defendant told the niece to make it look like the sleepover was her idea. The niece was not able to talk to the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\">We note that trial counsel emphasized the lack of a recording in his cross-examination of the two troopers and in his closing argument, where he identified the potential problems with an unrecorded statement, including that one trooper\u2019s recollection was folded into the second trooper\u2019s report and thus he had no independent memory of what the defendant said. Counsel stated that, for all the jury knew, the defendant could have said he did not intend to kill the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\">These factors include (1) indifference to and taking pleasure in the victim\u2019s suffering; (2) consciousness and degree of suffering of the victim; (3) extent of physical injuries to the victim; (4) the number of blows delivered by the defendant to the victim; (5) the manner and degree of force with which the blows were delivered; (6) the instrument or weapon employed by the defendant; and (7) the disproportion between the means needed to cause death and those employed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass. 216, 227 (1983) <em>(Cunneen </em>factors).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b78-40\">The record does not reflect the judge\u2019s denial of the motion for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Appellate counsel avers that, in that follow-up, he stated, in pertinent part: \u201cYou can either change the affidavit which I wrote for you so as to make it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>in your view, completely accurate, or you can write your own affidavit addressing each of the points I presented in the affidavit which I initially prepared for your signature.

R. Prof. C. 1.16 (e) (1) and (2), 426 Mass. 1369 (1998), and include providing the former client\u2019s \u201cpapers, documents and other materials\u201d as well as copies of pleadings and other papers filed with the court or served on another party. Comment 9 states, in pertinent part: \u201cEven if the lawyer has been unfairly discharged by the client, a lawyer must take all reasonable steps to mitigate the consequences to the client.\u201d Given our conclusion on the facts in this case, we need not address whether in some circumstances this rule may create a duty to cooperate with new counsel by providing an affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b81-6\">There are three other facts from the defendant\u2019s affidavit that he contends should have been brought out by trial counsel: that the victim angered him on the day of the murder; that at first he was too shocked to help the victim; and that he placed the CPR mask on the victim and instructed his son, who had learned CPR in the Boy Scouts, on the proper use. It is not clear how the jury being made aware that the victim angered the defendant, which in any event was brought out by the defendant\u2019s statement to police, would assist his defense, as it had the equally likely potential to focus more attention on the antagonistic relationship he had with the victim. Moreover, there is no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice concerning the other two issues because, even if these statements are not merely self serving and trial counsel should have made these points, the jury were warranted in finding him guilty based on extreme atrocity or cruelty based solely on the instrument he employed to murder the victim, an SUV that weighed, according to the defendant, some two tons. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>445 Mass. 195, 202 (2005) (jury need find only one of the <em>Cunneen </em>factors).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
