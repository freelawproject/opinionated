Following a sales and use tax audit of Town Fair Tire Centers, Inc. (Town Fair), concluding, among other things, that certain automobile tires had been sold at Town Fair\u2019s New Hampshire stores to Massachusetts residents and inferentially were installed on vehicles registered in Massachusetts, the Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) assessed use tax and related penalties against Town Fair for failing to collect use taxes on those tire sales. See G. L. c. 641, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Town Fair appealed to the Appellate Tax Board (board), which ruled in favor of the commissioner, finding that the automobile tires at issue were intended for use in the Commonwealth. Town Fair appealed from the board\u2019s decision, see G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, and we transferred the case here on our own motion. Because we conclude that the applicable Massachusetts statutes do not permit the Commonwealth to assess use taxes against a vendor in circumstances such as these, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts found by the board, except where noted. Town Fair is a Connecticut corporation whose principal business is the retail sale and installation of automobile tires. During the \u201cperiod at issue\u201d in this matter, October 1, 2000, to April 30, 2003, Town Fair operated sixty stores in New England, including eighteen stores in Massachusetts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and three stores in New Hampshire.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Town Fair collected and remitted Massachusetts sales tax on tire sales at its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Massachusetts stores, as well as sales tax on tire sales at its stores located in those other States that impose a sales tax.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It did not collect Massachusetts use tax in connection with the sale of tires at its stores outside Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In 2003, an auditor with the Department of Revenue (department) commenced a sales and use tax audit of Town Fair for the period at issue. By agreement with Town Fair, the auditor utilized a \u201cblock sampling\u201d method, selecting a single month, September, 2002, for review. The auditor\u2019s examination of records from, inter alia, Town Fair\u2019s three New Hampshire stores for that month identified 313 invoices in which the invoice listed a Massachusetts address beneath the name of the purchaser.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Many \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the invoices listed a Massachusetts telephone number,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and certain purchasers who paid by check provided a Massachusetts driver\u2019s license.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The invoices included the vehicle make and model, but there was <em>no </em>information regarding the State of registration, license plate number, or inspection sticker information of the vehicles. There is no evidence that any of the tires sold in the 313 transactions under review were actually stored or used in Massachusetts, the board made no such finding, and the commissioner does not argue otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Based on the 313 invoices listing a Massachusetts address, the auditor identified the sale in each case as having been made to a Massachusetts resident, and \u201c[concluding\u201d (in the board\u2019s words) that those purchasers <em>\u201cwould </em>use the tires installed on their vehicles in the Commonwealth\u201d (emphasis added), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>auditor determined that Town Fair should have collected and remitted Massachusetts use tax for the 313 sales.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The commissioner subsequently assessed Town Fair approximately $108,947 of uncollected use taxes based on those sales.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Town Fair applied for an abatement, which the commissioner denied. Town Fair then appealed to the board, see G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 7, and G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 39, which affirmed the commissioner. The board found, \u201c[biased upon the Massachusetts addresses, telephone numbers and driver\u2019s license information contained in the record,\u201d that the tires sold by Town Fair in the pertinent transactions \u201cwere installed on vehicles owned or operated by Massachusetts residents.\u201d Based on the same evidence, and \u201cthe absence of evidence to the contrary,\u201d the board \u201cinferred\u201d that the vehicles \u201calso bore Massachusetts registration plates (\u2018license plates\u2019) and certificates of inspection.\u201d From this, the board \u201cfound\u201d that the sales at issue \u201cwere sales of tangible personal property <em>to be </em>stored, used or consumed in Massachusetts\u201d (emphasis added), and held that the commissioner \u201cproperly assessed\u201d Town Fair for use tax in connection with those sales. We now turn to the merits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>The decision of the board interpreting a statute \u201cwill not be reversed or modified if it is based on a correct application of the law and if it is based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Kennametal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>426 Mass. 39, 43 (1997), cert, denied, 523 U.S. 1059 (1998). \u201cWe review questions of statutory interpretation de novo . . . giving \u2018substantial deference to a reasonable interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>of a statute by the administrative agency charged with its administration enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>450 Mass. 311, 319 (2008), quoting <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>447 Mass. 478, 481 (2006). See <em>Luchini </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>436 Mass. 403, 405 (2002). \u201cprinciples of deference\u201d are not, however, \u201cprinciples of abdication,\u201d <em>Nuclear Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Mgt. Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 211 (1995), and an incorrect interpretation of a statute by an administrative agency is entitled to no deference. <em>Kszepka\u2019s Case, </em>408 Mass. 843, 847 (1990), and cases cited. The duty of statutory interpretation rests ultimately with the courts. See <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., supra, </em>citing <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 343-344 (1964). In our judgment the board has interpreted the statutes at issue in a manner that cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">b. <em>Statutory framework. </em>The use tax and the sales tax \u201care complementary components of our tax system, created to \u2018reach all transactions, except those expressly exempted, in which tangible personal property is sold inside or outside the Commonwealth for storage, use, or other consumption within the Commonwealth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>J.C. Penney Co., </em>431 Mass. 684, 687 (2000), quoting <em>M &amp; T Charters, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>404 Mass. 137, 140 (1989). The use tax is governed by the provisions in G. L. c. 641. Section 2 of that chapter imposed an excise tax, at the rate of five per cent of the sales price,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cupon the storage, use or other consumption <em>in the </em>commonwealth\u201d of tangible personal property that is \u201cpurchased . . . <em>for storage, use or other consumption within the </em>commonwealth\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Liability to pay the use tax generally falls on the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>chaser who uses the property subject to the tax. G. L. c. 641, \u00a7 3. Purchasers may, however, offset against such liability any tax paid on that property to a vendor under the laws of another State. G. L. c. 641, \u00a7 7 <em>(c).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">At issue here is the application of G. L. c. 641, \u00a7 4, which concerns a vendor\u2019s obligation to collect use tax where such a tax is imposed under G. L. c. 641, \u00a7 2. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>Vendors \u201cengaged in business in the commonwealth\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> who sell tangible personal property or services \u201cfor storage, use or other consumption in the commonwealth\u201d are required to collect the tax from the purchaser and give the purchaser a receipt, unless the \u201cstorage, use, or other consumption\u201d is not \u201ctaxable\u201d at the time of sale, in which case vendors are required to collect the tax when storage, use, or other consumption \u201cbecomes taxable.\u201d G. L. c. 641, \u00a7 4. Where a vendor is required to collect use tax and fails to do so, the tax is \u201cowed by the vendor to the commonwealth.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">c. <em>Application of G. L. c. 641. </em>In upholding the commissioner, the board noted Town Fair\u2019s \u201cnumerous arguments as to why the transactions at issue did not come within the scope of the statute,\u201d but concluded that \u201cthose arguments were based on a misinterpretation of the relevant law.\u201d Town Fair counters that a vendor\u2019s liability for use tax under G. L. c. 641, \u00a7 4, \u201cdoes not arise in connection with an out-of-State sale merely by virtue of the purchaser\u2019s <em>intending </em>to store, use or consume merchandise in Massachusetts,\u201d as the board held (emphasis added). Rather, a vendor is liable for use tax under G. L. c. 641, \u00a7 4, only if the tires \u201cwere actually stored, used or consumed in Massachusetts.\u201d We agree. It is axiomatic that a use tax must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>be paid by a purchaser (or collected by a vendor) only if a tax is due. See G. L. c. 641, \u00a7 2 (defining when use tax is imposed). Thus, G. L. c. 641, \u00a7 4, imposes no obligation on a vendor to collect use tax unless and until the \u201cstorage, use or consumption of tangible personal property\u201d occurs in Massachusetts, either at the time of sale or at some later point. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>J.C. Penney Co., supra </em>at 684, 687 (obligation on vendor to collect use tax arises when exercise of right or power incident to ownership of tangible personal property, such as control, occurs in Massachusetts). See also LR 82-104 (Oct. 21, 1982), 1 Official MassTax Guide PWS-673 (West 2007) (\u201ca vendor\u2019s use tax liability arises when the property sold by him is <em>first </em>stored, used, or otherwise consumed in Massachusetts [ordinarily when the property is delivered in Massachusetts]\u201d [emphasis added]); Advanced Sales and Use Tax in Massachusetts 16 (Lorman Educ. Servs. 2005) (\u201cthe acts constituting the exercise of a right or power over property <em>must </em>occur in Massachusetts\u201d [emphasis added]). There is no evidence that the tires sold by Town Fair were actually stored, used, or consumed in Massachusetts,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the board did not make such a finding. Because the statute is unambiguous, we \u201cfollow the ordinary meaning of the words.\u201d <em>Kszepka\u2019s Case, </em>408 Mass. 843, 846 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The board acknowledged that there was no evidence of actual use of the tires within the Commonwealth. In order to bring the tire sales within the scope of the use tax statutes, the board first \u201cfound\u201d that the sales were to Massachusetts residents because of the Massachusetts residence and telephone information listed on the invoices. It then viewed the evidence \u201cagainst the backdrop of motor vehicle registration and operation requirements of the Commonwealth,\u201d and \u201cinferred\u201d that the tires were installed on vehicles that \u201cbore Massachusetts license plates and inspection stickers.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> From this the board reasoned that evidence of actual use or storage in Massachusetts is not required because, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>board\u2019s words, \u201cthe liability for the [use] tax arises at the time of the purchase <em>if the purchaser\u2019s intent </em>is to use the property in the Commonwealth\u201d and \u201cthe use tax is properly imposed if the purchaser <em>intended to use </em>the tires in the Commonwealth at the time of purchase\u201d (emphasis added). The board\u2019s conclusion is untenable. It is not supported by the language of the statute. Use in the Commonwealth is a necessary prerequisite. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>J.C. Penney Co., supra </em>at 688 (statute requires that actual use, storage, or consumption \u201cmust occur in Massachusetts in order for a taxable \u2018use\u2019 to occur\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">For her part, the commissioner acknowledges that \u201cintent\u201d to use the goods in Massachusetts is not sufficient to trigger the use tax.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In her view, \u201ccompelling circumstantial evidence\u201d that the tires were sold to Massachusetts residents and installed on vehicles registered in Massachusetts leads, in her words, \u201cto the presumption\u201d that the tires \u201cindeed were used in Massachusetts.\u201d Her argument fails. The Legislature has specified with particularity the circumstances in which \u201cfor use in the Commonwealth\u201d permissibly may be presumed. See G. L. c. 641, \u00a7 8 <em>(a) </em>(presumption that sale is \u201cfor storage, use or other consumption\u201d in Massachusetts arises where tangible personal property is sold \u201cfor delivery in the commonwealth\u201d); G. L. c. 641, \u00a7 8 (/) (presumption that personal property shipped or brought into Commonwealth within six months of purchase is purchased \u201cfor storage, use or other consumption in the commonwealth\u201d). There is no Massachusetts statutory presumption of use in the Commonwealth where personal property is sold to a Massachusetts resident outside the Commonwealth, even where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>goods purchased out of State may be affixed to property registered in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We will not recognize a presumption that the Legislature has not established. See <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>245 U.S. 151, 153 (1917) (\u201cIn the interpretation of statutes levying taxes it is the established rule not... to enlarge their operations so as to embrace matters not specifically pointed out\u201d); 3A NJ. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 66:3, at 35-36 (rev. 6th ed. 2003) (revenue legislation should not be construed \u201cto add what is not found in the statute\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The absence of a statutory presumption that a vendor\u2019s knowledge that a purchaser is a resident of Massachusetts will permit a finding that the goods purchased out of State were purchased \u201cfor\u201d use in Massachusetts and actually used in the Commonwealth is particularly significant because Legislatures in other States have enacted just. such a presumption.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Legislature may, of course, enact such a presumption, but in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>absence of any such statutory authorization, it is error to rely on a presumption that tires sold to a Massachusetts resident outside the Commonwealth were actually used in the Commonwealth. And the principles of interpretation of tax statutes preclude us from \u201cengrafting such language on the statute as written.\u201d See <em>Morton Bldgs., Inc. </em>v <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 441, 446 (1997).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">\n<em>Decision of the Appellate Tax Board reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-6\">General Laws c. 641, \u00a7 4, which we refer to as the use tax, provides in pertinent part: \u201cEvery vendor engaged in business in the commonwealth and making sales of tangible personal property or services for storage, use or other consumption in the commonwealth not exempted under this chapter, shall at the time of making the sales, or, if the storage, use or other consumption of the tangible personal property or services is not then taxable hereunder, at the time the storage, use or other consumption becomes taxable, collect the tax from the purchaser and give the purchaser a receipt therefor in the manner and form prescribed by the commissioner.

The board concluded that the \u201cpresence\u201d in Massachusetts of the property (an airplane) within six months of purchase was, without more, not sufficient to impose tax liability where the evidence \u201cindicate[d] that the plane was not purchased for storage, use or consumption in Massachusetts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58, 59. Thus, the <em>Macton </em>case holds that where a statutory presumption is validly invoked by the commissioner, rebuttal evidence by the purchaser (or vendor) may overcome the presumption of use tax liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\">See, e.g., Cal.

App. 2d 728 (1969), in support of its conclusion that knowledge by Town Fair that the purchasers were Massachusetts residents was sufficient to find that the tires were purchased \u201cfor use\u201d in Massachusetts. In the <em>Montgomery Ward </em>case, the court was doing nothing more than applying the California statutory presumption. See note 21, <em>supra. </em>It cited Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code \u00a7 6247, noting that \u201c[t]he <em>code </em>authorizes the action of the board in . . . assessing the tax on those sales\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 740. Where a cognate statutory provision does not exist in Massachusetts, the board should not have relied on the reasoning of the California court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\">In light of our conclusion, we need not address Town Fair\u2019s arguments that the board\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 641, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 4, violates the due process clause and commerce clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
