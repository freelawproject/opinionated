The jury were instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>on both principal and joint venture liability and returned a general verdict. The defendant appeals from his conviction on a variety of grounds, which we discuss <em>infra. </em>We reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction because a witness was permitted to answer questions without being sworn and because the same witness was allowed to answer \u201cNo comment\u201d to leading questions that contained highly prejudicial information. We address other claims of error concerning issues that may arise at a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We briefly describe the thrust of the Commonwealth\u2019s case based on the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom, leaving the details of the evidence to later discussion of specific issues. Frances Garriere, the wife of Edmond Garriere, Jr.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was stabbed to death in the bathroom of her home on Head of the Bay Road in the Buzzards Bay section of Bourne at approximately 5:30 p.m. on January 3, 1980, by the defendant, who was part of a joint venture murder for hire. The other participants in the venture were the victim\u2019s husband and Richard Grebauski.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Grebauski was present at or near the murder scene. He was friends with both the husband and the defendant, and the defendant did work for Grebauski.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">A next-door neighbor of the victim heard cars \u201cdrive up\u201d at about 6:05 or 6:10 p.m. on the evening of the murder. He heard two doors slam and \u201cpossibly the trunk being shut.\u201d The victim\u2019s body was found at about 8 p.m. on January 3, lying on the floor, her head against the bathtub, clutching human hair in her left hand. She had four stab wounds and a small bruise on her neck consistent with pressure from a hand or someone holding her neck. She died from multiple stab wounds to her chest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">According to Stephen Tracy, the defendant\u2019s employer in 1980, the defendant said that Grebauski might have a job for him \u201cto do\u201d someone\u2019s wife. Tracy stated in addition that there was a period in 1980 when the defendant was \u201cnot around.\u201d When Tracy asked the defendant where he had been, the defendant said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>that \u201che had some things to do and he did them.\u201d The defendant had been missing \u201cin the time frame\u201d of the murder. At that same point, Tracy recalled that the defendant \u201chad outfitted an apartment with some furniture. He just recently got married.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Two to three months before the murder, while the victim and her husband were in the process of being divorced, the victim\u2019s husband offered a \u201ccouple of thousand dollars\u201d to some friends to murder his wife. The friends were Charles Berryman, Russell Breault, possibly David Phinney. The friends did not take the offer seriously.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Richard Grebauski was David Mello\u2019s drug dealer and the two men committed \u201ca lot of crimes . . . [sjelling drugs, stealing, auto theft.\u201d On January 3, 1980, Mello called Grebauski for drugs, which Grebauski brought. The two men drove to Head of the Bay Road in Buzzards Bay. At about 6 p.m., Grebauski got out of the car there, left Mello with his drugs, and said he would be right back. Grebauski returned about one-half hour later and sped off. Mello noticed nothing unusual about Grebauski\u2019s appearance and saw no blood on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Timothy Blanchette, the defendant\u2019s son, said he first met his father in 1998 when he was eighteen years old. The two men would meet occasionally, and one night when they were drinking, the defendant said that he got $10,000 for \u201csome lady that he had killed down the Cape . . . Buzzards Bay.\u201d He said that \u201cit was the easiest $10,000 he ever made, and he continued to laugh about it.\u201d The defendant said that the killing took place in the bathroom: \u201cHe said she got out of the tub and he stabbed her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Questioning of Robert Hoeg. </em>We reverse the conviction because the Commonwealth was permitted to question a witness, Robert Hoeg, who refused to take an oath, and because the Commonwealth was allowed to ask him leading questions to which he responded, \u201cNo comment.\u201d The leading questions essentially permitted the Commonwealth to place its entire case before the jury in the form of an impermissible interrogation without competent testimony by a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Robert Hoeg, a coworker and friend of the defendant, gave a statement to the police and testified before the grand jury. In both his statement and grand jury testimony, Hoeg essentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>set forth the entire scenario of the murder as recounted to him by the defendant. At the time of trial, Hoeg was serving a sentence of life without parole for a conviction of murder in the first degree. (That conviction was unrelated to the present case.) When Hoeg was brought to court, the Commonwealth informed the judge out of the presence of the jury that Hoeg would claim the privilege against self-incrimination. An appointed lawyer determined that Hoeg had no such privilege, and at side bar, the judge so informed Hoeg.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In the presence of the jury, the clerk recited an oath, but Hoeg did not respond. The judge asked Hoeg whether he intended to answer questions, and Hoeg said no. With the jury not present, the judge ordered Hoeg to testify, but he refused. The judge stated that, because Hoeg was serving a life sentence, it would be futile to hold him in contempt. He declared Hoeg a hostile witness and permitted the Commonwealth to question him, but said that the Commonwealth could not put him on the stand simply to impeach him or use his silence as inconsistent testimony for purposes of introducing his grand jury testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McAfee, </em>430 Mass. 483, 489-492 (1999) (party may not call witness who he knows beforehand will not offer relevant testimony solely for purpose of impeaching witness). The judge ruled also that Hoeg\u2019s failure to take an oath \u201cwould only affect his credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The jury were brought in; Hoeg took the stand but again refused to be sworn. The prosecutor asked Hoeg if he killed the victim, and he responded that he did not. In response to other questions, Hoeg denied knowing the victim, her husband, or their son. Hoeg answered another question by stating that he \u201c[njever\u201d lived in Buzzards Bay. He stated also that he knew the defendant and that he lived in the penal institution at Shirley.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The prosecutor then asked Hoeg approximately twenty questions in respect to a statement that Hoeg had given a State trooper concerning the murder and regarding Hoeg\u2019s grand jury testimony. To each question, Hoeg responded, \u201cNo comment.\u201d These leading questions put forth the Commonwealth\u2019s entire theory of how the murder was committed. For example, the prosecutor asked if Hoeg had told the grand jury that the defendant told Hoeg that Grebauski had a friend who wanted his wife \u201ctaken care of\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>because they were going through an ugly divorce and that Gre-bauski offered the defendant $5,000 \u201cto take care of\u201d the friend\u2019s wife. Other examples of the prosecutor\u2019s questions to Hoeg were whether Hoeg had stated to the grand jury that the defendant had told him that his brother drove him to the Cape; that \u201che entered the woman\u2019s home . . . through a slider or sliding glass door in the back of the home . . . [; that] the woman was in the shower; [that] he attacked her in the shower and stabbed her; . . . [that] he could hear the woman\u2019s heart pumping the blood out of her[, o]ut of the wounds . . . [; and that] she was fighting him off and grabbing and clawing at him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Defense counsel objected to the questions to no avail. The judge overruled the objections on the ground that, because Hoeg had answered some questions, the Commonwealth could continue to question him in an effort to impeach him. The judge stated he would not have permitted any questioning if Hoeg had not answered any inquiries. At the end of Hoeg\u2019s testimony, the judge instructed the jury that \u201c[questions from lawyers, no matter how damaging, are not evidence.\u201d In his final instructions, the judge repeated that \u201cquestions themselves are not evidence. The answers are evidence. And so, the mere fact that a question was asked in and of itself is not evidence in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Hoeg should not have been permitted to answer questions for two reasons. First, he refused to take an oath or affirm the truthfulness of his testimony in any other manner. Although a witness may affirm in ways other than by taking an oath, see G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 17-19; <em>Adoption of Fran, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 455, 467 (2002) (adult witness may affirm duty to testify truthfully), a witness must swear or affirm, or the witness may not testify. When Hoeg refused to take an oath, the judge was faced with a difficult situation, but the solution he chose was an impermissible one. The judge should have ordered Hoeg to take the oath by swearing or affirming, and held him in contempt for failing to do so. Even if the threat of a contempt finding, or a contempt finding itself, may not have brought about compliance, the judge was not permitted to waive the requirement of an oath.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Second, the entire procedure denied the defendant due process. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>The leading questions put by the prosecutor<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> were effectively transformed into evidence, and the ambiguous \u201cno comment\u201d responses cannot reasonably be construed as denials of the propositions contained in the questions. The Commonwealth effectively communicated to the jury its version of the events without competent evidence, at least from Hoeg, that the events described in the prosecutor\u2019s questions had in fact occurred. Nor did the judge\u2019s instruction that questions are not evidence remedy the problem. The problem arose both with the questions themselves and with the ambiguity of the \u201cno comment\u201d responses, and the jury were not instructed to ignore the responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The situation is similar to that in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 111, 115-117 (1992). In the <em>Benoit </em>case, the prosecutor called a witness to whom the defendant (the witness\u2019s brother) had allegedly confessed. The prosecutor was aware that the witness would deny that the confession had been made and so informed the judge. After the witness answered four preliminary questions about his relationship with the defendant, all questions were devoted to the alleged conversation in which the defendant related the details of the crime. As expected, the witness denied any such conversation. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\u201cThe fact that the prosecutor in this case disclosed the [denial of the conversation] to the judge beforehand . . . establishes the absence of bad faith, but does not save the day, for the error is evident and the harm to the defendant was too great. . . . [Wjhether [the witness] was believed or not, his testimony came to nothing. That was because there was no purpose to [the witness\u2019s] testimony other than to place before the jury the questions the prosecutor put to him to provide the foundation for the admission of his alleged prior inconsistent statements. Thus, by one means or another, the prosecution provided the jury with . . . opportunities to hear that which it was otherwise unable to bring before the jury, the defendant\u2019s alleged confession.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 116-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>In addition, the defendant was effectively denied his right to cross-examine the witness. In <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 416-419 (1965), the defendant\u2019s accomplice had been tried and convicted, and was called as a prosecution witness while his appeal was pending. The accomplice invoked his privilege against self-incrimination and refused to answer questions. Nevertheless, the prosecutor was permitted to read to the jury a confession by the accomplice. The United States Supreme Court reversed the conviction, holding that the defendant\u2019s \u201cinability to cross-examine the accomplice as to the alleged confession plainly denied him the right of cross-examination . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419. So too, in this case, Hoeg\u2019s refusal to testify denied the defendant the right to cross-examine him after the prosecutor\u2019s use of leading questions put the damaging facts before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In certain limited circumstances, we have held that a witness\u2019s prior grand jury testimony is admissible as substantive evidence. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 72-75 (1984), we concluded that prior inconsistent grand jury statements are admissible as probative evidence if specific conditions are met. There must be an opportunity for effective cross-examination of the witness at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 73. If the witness has no memory of the events to which the statement relates, this requirement of opportunity for meaningful cross-examination is not met. <em>Id. </em>In addition, the statement must clearly be \u201cthat of the witness, rather than the interrogator,\u201d i.e., the statement must not be coerced and must be more than a \u201cmere confirmation or denial of an allegation by the interrogator,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 74-75. Finally, there must be other evidence tending to prove the issue, i.e., corroboration. <em>Id. </em>In the present case, Hoeg\u2019s \u201cno comments\u201d denied any opportunity for meaningful cross-examination. For that reason alone, his grand jury testimony did not qualify under the <em>Daye </em>limitation. Nor was it established that Hoeg\u2019s answers at the grand jury were his own words rather than those of the interrogator.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">There was timely objection to the questions put to Hoeg, and permitting the Commonwealth to pursue this course was certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>not harmless. The questions went to the heart of the case. They were not cumulative; there was no other evidence concerning how the murder occurred. Thus, we cannot be sure \u201cthat the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.... [We] cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983). Because the Commonwealth may choose to retry the defendant, we consider other issues raised by the defendant\u2019s claims of error that may arise at a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">b. <em>Joint venture statements. </em>The defendant contends that several hearsay statements were admitted improperly as statements made during a joint venture.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201c[O]ut-of-court statements by joint criminal participants are admissible against the others if the statements are made both during the pendency of the cooperative effort and in furtherance of its goal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>434 Mass. 670, 675 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>418 Mass. 207, 218 (1994). For a joint venturer\u2019s statement to be admissible, the Commonwealth must establish the existence of the joint criminal venture by a preponderance of the evidence, independent of the out-of-court statements, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. 241, 246 (2000), that is, the existence of the joint venture must be established by evidence other than the statements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allison, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Here, there was sufficient evidence independent of the out-of-court statements to establish a joint venture among Garriere (the victim\u2019s husband), Grebauski, and the defendant. Two to three months before the murder, the victim\u2019s husband offered money to his friends to kill his wife. She lived in Buzzards Bay and was killed in her bathroom in January, 1980. Years later, in 1998, the defendant admitted to his son that he had been paid $10,000 to kill a woman in Buzzards Bay and that he killed her in her bathroom. \u201cAround\u201d the time of the murder, the defendant told his employer, Tracy, that Grebauski might have a job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>for him \u201cto do\u201d someone\u2019s wife. Grebauski was a friend of the victim\u2019s husband and of the defendant, and the defendant occasionally did work for Grebauski. This evidence permitted a finding that the defendant was involved in a joint venture to kill Carriere\u2019s wife, with Grebauski acting as the middleman between Garriere and the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra </em>at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Once there is evidence that permits a finding that a joint venture existed, and the jury so find, statements of any of the joint venturers made during the course of the venture and in furtherance of it may be considered against the defendant; there is no hearsay problem because the statement of each joint venturer is equivalent to a statement by the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>370 Mass. 703, 708 (1976). The statement must of course be relevant to an issue in the case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cyr, </em>425 Mass. 89, 93-94 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pleasant, </em>366 Mass. 100, 102-103 (1974). With this background, we consider each of the statements that the defendant claims was improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The defendant maintains that Carriere\u2019s solicitation of his friends to murder his wife was not admissible because the statements were made two to three months before the murder and before the joint venture was formed. The fact that the statement was made prior to the formation of the joint venture does not render it inadmissible. The statement was probative of Carriere\u2019s intent to kill his wife and by inference his later action on that intent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra </em>at 247-248 (joint venturer\u2019s statement that he had \u201ccontract of a husband on a wife,\u201d made fifteen months before joint venture formed, relevant to later joint venture). Nor was the statement hearsay in any event. \u201c[Hjearsay is an extrajudicial statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keizer, </em>377 Mass. 264, 269 n.4 (1979). Carriere\u2019s statement to his friends was not offered to prove any fact contained in that statement, but only to prove that Garriere was seeking to hire someone to kill his wife. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, ante </em>215, 220 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The defendant claims that David Phinney\u2019s statement to Berry-man that he (Phinney) could not return to Massachusetts from Florida because he was Carriere\u2019s \u201calibi\u201d should not have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>admitted. On the day of the murder, Berryman telephoned Car-riere\u2019s Florida home to speak to Phinney. Berryman wanted Phinney to return to Massachusetts because the two men were supposed to start a siding job. Phinney said he could not come back \u201cbecause he was his [Carriere\u2019s] alibi.\u201d We agree that the statement was improperly admitted. There was no other evidence that Phinney was a participant in the joint venture, and so the statement, although relevant, was inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The defendant argues that statements by Carriere in December, 1979, and January, 1980, to his daughter, Linda McCraney, were not admissible because they were not made during the pendency of the joint venture or in furtherance of it. In December, 1979, and January, 1980, McCraney saw her father in Florida with her younger sister, Ginger, who was thirteen years old. Ginger was living with her mother, but stayed with Carriere in Florida through Christmas and beyond the time she was to return to school on Monday, January 3, 1980. When McCraney questioned her father concerning why he did not return to Massachusetts to take Ginger back to school, her father responded by swearing at her and telling her it was none of \u201c[her] God damned business.\u201d Her father referred to her mother as a \u201cwhore\u201d and said she wanted to divorce him so \u201cshe can get. . . the house on Buzzards Bay.\u201d According to McCraney, her father believed that the State would pay him a lot of money because of a road that was being built in the area of the family home and said, \u201cI offered your mother $10,000 to just go away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The statements by Carriere to his daughter in Florida concerning not returning his other daughter to Massachusetts in time for school were properly admitted. It was Carriere\u2019s plan to remain in Florida in order to establish an alibi, and his statements to his daughter, which communicated that he would be in Florida at the time of the murder, were made in furtherance of that venture. They were made at just about the time that the victim was killed when the joint venture was ongoing, and they were relevant to establish Carriere\u2019s state of mind, i.e., that he was planning to bring about the death of his wife. Carriere\u2019s remarks to his daughter about the victim\u2019s desire for a divorce were also admissible, because even though the witness did not identify a specific date when these statements were made, the thrust of the evidence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>that they were made in the December-January period. Even if they were made at an earlier time, they were nevertheless admissible to help establish the motive for the joint venture. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Sometime \u201ca while after the murder\u201d (but less than a year after it), Grebauski and Mello drove by a house at or near Head of the Bay Road, and Grebauski said, while pointing to a house, \u201cI offed that bitch.\u201d The defendant claims that Grebauski\u2019s statement to Mello that he \u201coffed that bitch\u201d was hearsay because it was not made during the course of the joint venture or in furtherance of it. If a joint venture has ended, the actions or statements of one joint venturer cannot be admitted against another. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>403 Mass. 441, 452 (1988). But when there are efforts to conceal the crime, the venture continues. <em>Commonwealth v. Angiulo, </em>415 Mass. 502,519 (1993). The inquiry focuses not on whether the crime has been completed, but on whether a joint venture was continuing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Braley, </em>449 Mass. 316, 322 (2007). The implication of Mello\u2019s testimony was that this statement was made shortly after the murder. Absent clear indication that the venture had ended, it is reasonable to infer that concealment of the venture was ongoing. However, Grebauski\u2019s statement to Mello was not an effort to conceal the crime; indeed, it was just the opposite. It revealed the crime to someone who was not a member of the joint venture. Nor was there evidence that the statement related to the purpose of the joint venture. Thus, the statement was not made in furtherance of the joint venture and should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Another statement by Mello, to the effect that Grebauski said that he (Grebauski) \u201cgot pulled into the police station for this lumber thing\u201d the day after the murder and was questioned about a murder, did not further the venture in any way, and was not properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">c. <em>Opening statement. </em>The defendant objects to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, in which he predicted that the defendant\u2019s son, Blanchette, would testify that the defendant told him that he killed a woman on the Cape, and \u201c[i]t was the first time he had killed somebody.\u201d Such testimony was not elicited from Blanchette or any other witness. At a retrial, if the prosecutor anticipates such testimony, it is for the trial judge to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>in context whether the probative value of this ordinarily admissible statement is outweighed by its prejudicial impact. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewin (No. 2), 407 </em>Mass. 629, 631 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">d. <em>Other evidence of bad acts. </em>The defendant argues that the testimony of his son, Blanchette, that the defendant attacked him and a friend about a debt improperly portrayed the defendant as a violent, assaultive person, and was inadmissible as evidence of a prior uncharged crime or other irrelevant violent behavior. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMarco, 444 </em>Mass. 678, 681-683 (2005). The assault occurred when Blanchette and a friend had a dispute over money with the defendant. As a result of the fight, Blanchette was convicted of assaulting his father with a baseball bat. Blanchette told the police about his father\u2019s admission to the murder only after he had been charged with this offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the circumstances of the present case, where defense counsel in his opening statement referred to the attack on Blan-chette as part of the defense theory in order to discredit Blanchette by showing a motive to lie (stemming from this attack by the defendant), Blanchette\u2019s testimony on the subject was not improper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haraldstad, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 565, 571-572 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">e. <em>Closing argument. </em>The defendant challenges five remarks in the closing argument. First, the defendant contends that, despite the fact there was no evidence of strangulation, the prosecutor suggested that the victim had been stabbed while she was being strangled. The medical examiner had testified that there was no strangling, but that the marks on the victim\u2019s neck indicated that \u201c[a]t some point, there was something solid there pressing on it,\u201d and that the marks were consistent not with strangulation, but with \u201csomebody holding the neck.\u201d A former criminal investigator from the Barnstable County sheriff\u2019s department testified that the marks on the victim\u2019s neck \u201cwould be consistent with pressure from a hand or something.\u201d Given that evidence, the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of a strangulation was an unfortunate choice of words and should be omitted at any retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The defendant suggests that the prosecutor misstated evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u201cput[ting] words into the mouth of a witness . . . [and] altering] the meaning of the witness\u2019s testimony,\u201d when, in referring to Tracy\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s statement that \u201c[s]ome guy wanted [him] to do his wife,\u201d the prosecutor asked, \u201cIs there any question in your mind what \u2018to do\u2019 his wife meant?\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Auclair, </em>444 Mass. 348, 359 (2005). There was nothing improper. Based on the evidence that the defendant admitted killing the victim, the prosecutor did no more than suggest a reasonable inference that \u201cto do\u201d meant \u201cto kill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The defendant asserts that the prosecutor impermissibly asked the jury to speculate about the meaning of a statement attributed to the victim\u2019s boy friend, Rodney Burrill. Burrill was the person who discovered the body, and immediately thereafter, he stated to the police, \u201cI knew she would be killed.\u201d The defendant maintains that there was no evidence indicating how Burrill obtained this knowledge and that the prosecutor improperly suggested that Burrill had learned the information because Garriere had been asking people to kill his wife. The defendant did not object at trial to the admission of this statement. Because the statement was in evidence, the prosecutor could refer to it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 238 (1989). The question remains whether it was a reasonable inference from the evidence that Burrill was aware that Garriere was soliciting people to kill his wife. It was obvious from the evidence that Garriere had broached his plan to several people. Had there been evidence that Burrill was in contact with any of those people, the inference could have been warranted. On the state of the record, however, the inference was impermissible. If the issue recurs at retrial, the propriety of such an argument will depend on the state of the evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The defendant contends that the prosecutor improperly shifted to the defendant the burden of proving his innocence by stating, \u201cThere may be no trace evidence that places [the defendant] there . . . but there is nothing that excludes him from being there; that proves he wasn\u2019t there . . . .\u201d See <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 524 (1975). Of course, the defendant need not offer any evidence. However, the challenged statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>came at the end of a portion of the closing that reviewed the evidence, including the defendant\u2019s confession to his son. The prosecutor then mentioned the testing that had been performed on various items and the reasons why the Commonwealth was unable to conduct other tests. He concluded with the above-challenged statement. The entire line of argument was made in response to the defendant\u2019s closing, which emphasized that no evidence at the murder scene linked the defendant to the crime. In context, the argument was permissible. The prosecutor said in effect that there was powerful evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt; that the Commonwealth performed forensic testing despite that; and that testing, while not inculpating the defendant, did not exonerate him. While the argument was close to the line, the prosecutor essentially argued that the steps the Commonwealth had taken neither placed the defendant at the scene nor established that he was not there. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viriyahiran-paiboon, </em>412 Mass. 224, 231 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Finally, the defendant maintains that the prosecutor unfairly characterized him as \u201can unfeeling man\u201d by stating that \u201che hadn\u2019t even acknowledged [his son Timothy Blanchette] from birth.\u201d Although the statement was supported by the evidence, it was an improper attempt to cast the defendant in a bad light. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>439 Mass. 558, 562-565 (2003). There was no connection between the evidence that the defendant had no relationship with his son for eighteen years and his killing of the victim in this case. There was plainly no basis for an inference that the defendant\u2019s lack of feeling for his son made it more likely that he killed the victim. The statement\u2019s only purpose was to persuade the jury impermissibly that the defendant\u2019s bad character indicated that he was more likely to have committed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">f. <em>Judge\u2019s instructions. </em>The judge properly set out the law on joint venture, and there is no contention otherwise. He then instructed as to joint venture statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">\u201cIf you find sufficient evidence to support a fair inference that a joint venture existed, you can consider evidence of the acts and statements of each of the participants against the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">\u201cYou may do so, however, only with respect to actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>or statements occurring when the joint venture existed or made when the joint venturers were acting to conceal the crime and that are <em>relevant to the joint venture </em>of which you found the defendant an actor or actors or declarant or declarants were members\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The defendant objects that the instruction did not contain language that the statements of coventurers could be considered only if made \u201cin furtherance of\u201d the joint venture in question. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silanskas, </em>433 Mass. 678, 693 (2001). The defendant is correct. The judge\u2019s reformulation of the usual instruction did not explain adequately that the purpose of the statement must be to further, i.e., assist the accomplishment of, the joint venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">We refer to Edmond Garriere, Jr., as Garriere or the victim\u2019s husband, and to Frances Garriere as the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Richard Grebauski was also indicted for murder in the first degree, but died in an accident prior to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Despite extensive testing, no physical or trace evidence of any evidentiary value was found at the scene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\">We recognize, as did the judge, that a finding of contempt and the accompanying sanction are unlikely to have impact on an inmate already serving a sentence of life without parole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b554-8\">The judge should not have permitted the prosecutor to put leading questions.
