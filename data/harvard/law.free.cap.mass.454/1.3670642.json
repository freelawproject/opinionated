L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, and three counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. On appeal, Avalos claims that the trial judge erroneously restricted defense counsel\u2019s cross-examinations of Commonwealth witnesses, preventing Avalos from exposing then-bias, prejudice, and motives to lie. We transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">1. <em>Background. </em>The victim in this case is Natasha,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the step-granddaughter of Avalos. The criminal investigation preceding the defendant\u2019s indictment originated after Natasha\u2019s mother, Diane, discovered and read a \u201cdiary\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> belonging to Natasha. Natasha received the diary, and wrote in it, when she was in the eighth grade. Diane found the diary in 2004, when Natasha was in the ninth grade, while unpacking from a move they made.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">In the diary, Natasha answered several questions posed by the book; after one question, \u201cHave you ever been sexually abused?\u201d she wrote, \u201cYes.\u201d On other pages, Natasha had written \u201cunflattering\u201d descriptions of Diane.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Natasha also wrote that she would \u201cflirt\u201d with boys; that she wanted a boy friend; that she \u201ccuddled\u201d with a boy; that she \u201cneed[ed] to forgive [her]self for keeping so many secrets, and lying\u201d; that she had forged her mother\u2019s name, causing Diane to beat her; and that she could tell her grandmother \u201ceverything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-10\">After discovering the diary, Diane confronted Natasha, angered primarily by what Natasha had written about her rather than by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>what she had written about being sexually abused. Natasha appeared nervous and upset, and later became ill. The two went to the Chelsea police station where Natasha filed a report of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">Before trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion in limine to exclude the contents of the diary. At the hearing on the motion, defense counsel stated that he intended to use the diary in his defense of the case. In particular, he intended to ask Natasha whether she had ever \u201ccharacterized herself or thought of herself as a flirt,\u201d and, if she answered, \u201cNo,\u201d to introduce a portion of the diary in which she described herself as \u201cflirtatious.\u201d He also stated that he intended to introduce statements in the diary showing Natasha\u2019s \u201cwanting to have a boyfriend\u201d in support of his theory that some of the abuse that she blamed on Avalos had actually occurred, consensually, with a boy friend. He further intended to introduce the portion of the diary describing Diane as, in his words, \u201ca big pain in the ass.\u201d Finally, he argued that Natasha\u2019s writings in the diary were \u201cdirectly relevant to her credibility and her lifestyle,\u201d especially the writings describing herself as a flirt, as a liar, and as someone who wished she had a boy friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">The judge ruled that in opening statements, the attorneys could mention only the question and answer from the diary regarding sexual abuse. She reasoned that \u201cwhether [Natasha] thinks of herself as a flirt or as a liar or what she wants with respect to her boyfriend and her position with respect to her mother that it\u2019s in the diary is not germane to any issue before the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge reserved ruling on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine beyond the opening statements, asking each attorney to \u201capproach the sidebar before he seeks to offer any of that during trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">The Commonwealth\u2019s first witness was Natasha, who was sixteen at the time of trial. She testified that Avalos sexually molested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>her over the course of several years, beginning when she was six or seven years old, and ending when she was about twelve. She testified that on different dates, Avalos indecently touched her, and made her engage in specific sexual acts with him. Natasha also testified that her first oral report of the abuse occurred in a conversation with a classmate, when Natasha was in the ninth grade.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The report occurred at the high school she was attending before Natasha and Diane moved, and before Diane discovered the diary.</p>\n<p id=\"AAO\">On cross-examination, defense counsel spent much of his time highlighting inconsistencies in Natasha\u2019s account. He asked how she could remember so many details from events that occurred years earlier, why she did not \u201ccall out\u201d for her grandmother when Avalos touched her at his house, and why she chose, in the ninth grade, to tell the classmate about incidents that occurred much earlier. He also elicited testimony from Natasha that her mother was angry with her after reading the diary, and that at the time Natasha was writing in the diary, she did not consider herself to be a completely truthful person.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Defense counsel also asked if the diary contained a question about people Natasha felt she could \u201ctell anything at all to.\u201d The judge sustained an objection by the Commonwealth, ruling that defense counsel could ask about the content of the diary only if Natasha testified in a manner that was inconsistent with those writings. Defense counsel proceeded accordingly, and Natasha testified that she felt she could tell her grandmother \u201canything,\u201d but had not told her grandmother about the sexual abuse. The judge later sustained objections when defense counsel asked whether Natasha had trouble with lying during that period; whether she had ever forged her mother\u2019s signature; and whether her mother had ever struck her.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">The Commonwealth then called Diane to the stand. She explained that she met Avalos when she was about thirteen, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>that Avalos later married her mother, Lucilla. She also testified that Avalos was alone with Natasha on several occasions over many years. Finally, she described finding Natasha\u2019s diary, reading it, becoming upset and angry, and taking Natasha to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Diane about a period around 2001 when Avalos moved to Florida for a few months, and Lucilla later joined him. He asked whether Avalos moved without Lucilla because \u201c[tjhey weren\u2019t getting along.\u201d Diane testified that to her knowledge, that was not the reason, and that she was \u201cunder the impression that he was going to buy a house and they were going to move in there.\u201d On further questioning about the marriage between Lucilla and Avalos during that period, Diane testified that it was doing both fine and not fine \u201c[o]n occasion.\u201d She also denied that Avalos chose to move to Florida because Diane prevented his daughter from a prior marriage from visiting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The judge sustained objections to a series of questions posed to Diane about statements written by Natasha in her diary: whether Natasha had described herself as a liar; whether Natasha had described Diane as \u201crude and crude\u201d; and what Diane read that caused her to be angry.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">On the third day of trial, Avalos took the stand. He denied touching Natasha inappropriately in any way. He also testified that at one time, a boy friend of Diane lived with Diane and Natasha. Avalos then testified that he eventually moved to Florida to \u201cput an end to\u201d problems he was having with Diane. The problems arose, he said, when Diane attempted to prevent his daughter from staying with him for a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">Defense counsel asked if Avalos was also having marital difficulties with Lucilla at the time, and the Commonwealth objected on relevance grounds. At sidebar, defense counsel argued that he wished to show that Lucilla believed Avalos was seeing another woman, that Lucilla may have told Natasha the same, and that Natasha may have then become biased against Avalos. The judge sustained the objection, saying, \u201cYou need something that\u2019s a little bit more concrete and not totally speculative.\u201d Defense counsel did not pursue this line of inquiry further, but later elicited testimony from Avalos that Diane had told him (in 2001) that, \u201cI was going to be sorry I left her mother in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>In closing, defense counsel argued that Natasha and Diane were not credible witnesses, noting that they cried during direct testimony but not during cross-examination. He attacked details of Natasha\u2019s testimony; for example, he argued that it would make little sense for Avalos to commit a sexual assault while his wife (Lucilla) was somewhere in the house. He also gave his broader theory of the case, arguing that when Diane angrily confronted Natasha about the contents of the diary, Natasha blamed Avalos for a sexual assault to appease Diane.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Avalos argues that the judge impermissibly restricted his ability to cross-examine Commonwealth witnesses to demonstrate bias, prejudice, and a motive to lie. He contends that at several junctures, the judge prevented him from exploring Avalos\u2019s marital problems with Diane\u2019s mother, Lucilla; Natasha\u2019s and Diane\u2019s knowledge of these marital problems; Natasha\u2019s relationship with Diane; the details of the confrontation between Diane and Natasha about the diary; Diane\u2019s relationships with men; Natasha\u2019s truthfulness; and Natasha\u2019s \u201cdreams . . . of having a relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">If he had been allowed to explore those avenues, Avalos argues, he would have been able to prove his theory of the case: that when Diane angrily confronted Natasha about the diary, Natasha blamed Avalos for a sexual assault to diffuse Diane\u2019s anger. Blaming Avalos would have effectively shifted Diane\u2019s attention, he contends, because Diane was angry at Avalos for causing problems in his marriage to Lucilla (Diane\u2019s mother).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Avalos also argues that he could have undermined Natasha\u2019s credibility by introducing portions of the diary where Natasha called herself a \u201cliar,\u201d and might even have shown that the entire assault was the figment of Natasha\u2019s imagination, rooted in a desire to have a boy friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">\u201cCross-examination of a prosecution witness to show the witness\u2019s bias or prejudice is a matter of right under the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>434 Mass. 670, 681 (2001). \u201cIf \u2018on the facts, there is a possibility of bias, even a remote one, the judge has no discretion to bar <em>all </em>inquiry into the subject\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tam Bui, </em>419 Mass. 392, 400, cert, denied, 516 U.S. 961 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Nonetheless, \u201c [determining whether the evidence demonstrates bias . . . falls within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, </em>414 Mass. 146, 153 (1993). We also have held that \u201c[a] judge does have discretion to limit cross-examination concerning possible bias when further questioning would be redundant,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allison, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tam Bui, supra </em>at 400; where there has been such \u201cextensive inquiry\u201d that the bias issue \u201chas been sufficiently aired,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, supra </em>at 154, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>377 Mass. 1, 8 (1979); where questioning involves a \u201ccollateral matter,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sperrazza, </em>379 Mass. 166,169 (1979); where the offered evidence is \u201ctoo speculative,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tam Bui, supra </em>at 402; or where the evidence is being offered only to show the bad character of the witness, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichel, </em>403 Mass. 103, 106 (1988). \u201cThe burden of showing an abuse of that discretion, an abuse that must be shown on the trial record, rests on the party claiming it, in this case [Avalos].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>358 Mass. 506, 513 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the judge did not impermissibly restrict Avalos\u2019s ability to cross-examine witnesses and present his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">a. <em>Evidence of relationships between Natasha, Diane, Avalos, and Lucilla. </em>First, Avalos argues that he was improperly prevented from demonstrating that Avalos and Lucilla experienced marital difficulties before Diane confronted Natasha about the diary. He complains specifically only about a question he was not permitted to answer during his own direct examination, that is, whether he was having any marital difficulties with Lucilla. As noted earlier, when the Commonwealth objected on relevance grounds, defense counsel responded with an explanation the judge found \u201ctotally speculative.\u201d This mling was not error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tam Bui, supra </em>at 400-401 (bias theory too tenuous to be one he was entitled to pursue on record presented). Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>a review of Avalos\u2019s testimony in its entirety demonstrates that the presence of marital difficulties between Avalos and Lucilla was sufficiently presented to the jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Second, Avalos argues that he was prevented from cross-examining Natasha and Diane to establish that they knew about the marital problems between Avalos and Lucilla. There was no abuse of discretion because the issue was \u201csufficiently aired.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, supra. </em>Defense counsel was permitted to ask Natasha four questions on this subject; she denied any knowledge of the reasons for the separation between Avalos and Lucilla. The judge sustained only two objections, preventing defense counsel from asking, \u201c[S]he [Lucilla] was pretty mad at your grandfather for leaving her, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d and \u201cDid she ever discuss with you any feelings that she had about the fact that your grandfather had left her?\u201d Natasha had already denied knowledge of their marital problems in nearly identical questions; further questioning on the subject was therefore unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Similarly, defense counsel was permitted to ask Diane several times about the marital problems between Avalos and Lucilla. Diane testified that she did not believe Avalos moved to Florida in response to marital problems, and that their marriage was doing fine and not fine \u201c[o]n occasion.\u201d The judge sustained objections to only two questions: \u201cWell how many more occasions was it doing fine or not fine?\u201d and \u201cWhat percentage of the time was the marriage okay, and what percentage wasn\u2019t it?\u201d There was no abuse of discretion in curtailing the questioning on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Third, Avalos argues that he was prevented from probing the relationship between Natasha and Diane. The trial record reflects otherwise. Defense counsel was able to explore the relationship sufficiently. As Avalos concedes, Natasha testified that her relationship with Diane \u201cwasn\u2019t perfect.\u201d She also agreed that she sometimes \u201cthought [Diane] was rude and crude and negative,\u201d and conceded that sometimes she \u201cwanted to be free as a bird, and not have [Diane] around [her].\u201d Defense counsel was also permitted to ask Diane whether, in the diary, Natasha called Diane \u201crude,\u201d \u201c[c]rude,\u201d and \u201c[h]ateful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">The judge properly prevented defense counsel from asking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Natasha whether she had ever been physically abused by her mother; as the Commonwealth argued, that line of inquiry would create \u201cits own trial as to whether the girl had been physically abused by the mother,\u201d and could \u201cbring[] out the bad character of the mother.\u201d The judge did not abuse her discretion in \u201cexcluding] marginally relevant . . . evidence [to] prevent the undue exploration of collateral issues.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Adjutant, 443 Mass. 649, 663 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Finally, Avalos argues that the judge erred in preventing defense counsel from establishing that boy friends of Diane might have had the opportunity to commit the crimes. He is incorrect. At the hearing on the motion in limine, the judge never excluded evidence of Diane\u2019s boy friends. During trial, the judge repeatedly allowed testimony that a boy friend of Diane lived with her and Natasha. Objections were sustained only when Avalos testified that Diane and Natasha later lived \u201c[w]ith another boyfriend,\u201d and when defense counsel asked, \u201cWas that the same person who had been living with [Diane] previously or a different person?\u201d This was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">b. <em>Evidence of confrontation over diary. </em>Next, Avalos argues that he was prevented from \u201cestablishing] the complete context of the diary confrontation.\u201d He suggests that he should have been permitted to probe \u201cDiane\u2019s state of mind . . . regarding precisely what she had read in the diary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">We disagree. Defense counsel was permitted to elicit testimony from Natasha that Diane was upset at the time of the confrontation; that she was not \u201cact[ing] like herself\u201d; that she looked \u201csad and stressed out\u201d; and that she did not greet Natasha as she normally would. Natasha agreed with defense counsel\u2019s suggestion that she was \u201cnot [in] a very good position with [Diane],\u201d because Diane had read all the things in her diary. He also asked if Natasha was afraid Diane would hit her; she answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Natasha vomited, she testified, because she was nervous and scared. Additionally, defense counsel was permitted to establish that Diane was initially more concerned with the diary descriptions of her than the sexual abuse allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">In sum, Avalos had ample opportunity to cross-examine Natasha and Diane for the purpose of laying the groundwork for his argument that Diane was angry, and that Natasha named Ava-los to diffuse that anger. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, </em>414 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Mass. 146, 153 (1993). Defense counsel was prevented from asking only whether Diane ever struck Natasha and which other diary writings had angered Diane. Each of these questions would have created a trial-within-a-trial on collateral issues. Excluding those lines of inquiry was not an abuse of the judge\u2019s discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sperrazza, </em>379 Mass. 166, 169 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">c. <em>Evidence impeaching Natasha\u2019s credibility. </em>Avalos also argues that the judge should have allowed defense counsel to show that Natasha \u201cwas an admitted \u2018liar,\u2019 \u201d that she had forged Diane\u2019s signature, and that she lied in telling Diane that the diary descriptions of Diane (as crude, rude, and hateful) were not true. The judge\u2019s decision to foreclose these questions, Avalos argues, prevented him from impeaching Natasha\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Avalos proposed a general attack on Natasha\u2019s credibility, which he would have supported with her diary statement that she \u201cneed[ed] to forgive herself. . . [for] lying.\u201d The judge properly excluded this evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The mere fact that Natasha admitted in her diary that at some time in her life she lied is hardly probative of her veracity on the witness stand. \u201c[B]ecause the proffered evidence had little, if any, legitimate value, and invited misuse by the jury, the judge clearly did not abuse [her] discretion in excluding it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichel, </em>403 Mass. 103,106 (1988). Further, the judge allowed Avalos an entirely sufficient cross-examination on whether Natasha lied when she told Diane that the diary descriptions of Diane were not true. After Natasha testified that the statements in the diary were not true, defense counsel asked, \u201c[W]ell if it wasn\u2019t true, you\u2019d be lying about it wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Natasha answered, \u201cNo,\u201d and later explained, \u201cBecause by then I felt like that, but I don\u2019t anymore.\u201d The only question that the judge prohibited was a potentially unfair, compound one: \u201c[D]id you lie in your journal when you wrote these things or did you he to your mother when you said they weren\u2019t true?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The judge also properly excluded the question about forgery, which also arose from an admission in the diary. Unless there is a criminal conviction, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, evidence of \u201cparticular bad acts of untruthfulness\u201d is inadmissible for impeachment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>purposes. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olsen, </em>452 Mass. 284, 293 (2008), citing <em>F.W. Stock &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Dellapenna, </em>217 Mass. 503, 506-507 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">d. <em>Evidence that Natasha had dreams of having a boy friend. </em>Avalos argues that he should have been allowed to pursue a defense that the assault was a figment of Natasha\u2019s imagination, prodded by her \u201cdreams (set forth in her diary) of having a relationship and by her exposure to her mother\u2019s open sexual relationships.\u201d There is no merit to this argument. The judge excluded this evidence only for the purposes of the opening statements, but said that she would revisit the issue at trial if the parties wished. Defense counsel, however, never returned to the issue by seeking to question Natasha or Diane on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Avalos was granted adequate license to cross-examine Commonwealth witnesses as to their bias and to present evidence supporting his defense. The judge\u2019s rulings were well within her discretion and did not infringe on Avalos\u2019s rights under the Sixth Amendment and art. 12. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b24-11\">A pseudonym, pursuant to G.
