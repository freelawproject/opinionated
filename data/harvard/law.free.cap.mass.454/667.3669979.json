See Rohner, Leasing Consumer Goods: The Spotlight Shifts to the Uniform Consumer Leases Act, 35 Conn. L. Rev. 647, 649 (2003). A judge of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, considering a \u201cconsumer lease agreement\u201d for computer equipment, concluded that \u201c[n]o authorities convincingly \u2018show how the highest court in the state would decide\u2019 \u201d which of two statutory schemes regulate that type of arrangement, and certified the following question to this court pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 1:03, as appearing in 382 Mass. 700 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-10\">\u201cIs a contract in the form of Exhibit A, entered into within the [Commonwealth] of Massachusetts, subject to the terms of the Massachusetts Consumer Lease Act, [G. L. c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 90] et seq., or the Massachusetts Retail Installment Sales Act, [G. L. c. 255D]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">On the scant facts in the record before us, we cannot answer the question definitively.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cf. S.J.C. Rule 1:03, \u00a7 3 (2) (requiring \u201cstatement of all facts relevant to the questions certified and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>showing fully the nature of the controversy in which the questions arose\u201d). Nonetheless, the bare legal issue concerns a significant point of Massachusetts law on which we will offer what guidance is possible on this record. See <em>Knapp Shoes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sylvania Shoe Mfg. Corp., </em>418 Mass. 737, 738 n.l (1994) (where certified question raised significant issue, court would assume evidentiary record supported judge\u2019s pertinent factual findings and legal conclusions). Cf. <em>Canal Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>406 Mass. 369, 372 (1990), quoting <em>Schlieter </em>v. <em>Carlos, </em>108 N.M. 507, 509 (1989) (if \u201cquestions certified to us ... are not accompanied by sufficient nonhypothetical, evidentiary facts to allow us to adequately determine\u201d answers, court might decline to answer). <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The certified question concerns a specific contractual form. On these facts, we can and do conclude that the Massachusetts Retail Instalment Sales Act (RISA), G. L. c. 255D,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> does not apply to it. Further, if we assume defendants Rent-A-Center, Inc.; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Rent-A-Center East, Inc.; and RentWay, Inc. (collectively, \u201cRent-A-Center,\u201d \u201cRAC,\u201d or defendants),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> regularly are engaged in the business of leasing personal property, G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 90,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the computer equipment was intended \u201cprimarily for personal, family, or household purposes,\u201d <em>id., </em>factual questions that are not resolved on the record before us, we conclude that the agreement would be subject to the Consumer Lease Act (CLA), G. L. c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 90-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">1. <em>Discussion. </em>The parties stipulated to the following facts: \u201cOn or about May 13, 2006, Jaaziel Costa entered into an agreement with Rent-A-Center ... at its Worcester, Massachusetts store,\u201d it was \u201cdrafted by RAC,\u201d and it \u201cconcerned a used Dell laptop computer.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The agreement, entitled a \u201cConsumer Lease Agreement,\u201d specifies a weekly \u201crental term,\u201d with a total payment of $39.49, consisting of a \u201crental payment\u201d of $34.99, an \u201coptional liability damage waiver\u201d of $2.62, and tax of $1.88.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It provides that, at the end of the rental term (here weekly), Costa may either (1) continue to rent the property by making another rental payment; or (2) terminate the lease by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>returning \u201cthe rental property and pay[ing] all rental payments and other charges due through the date of return.\u201d The agreement further states that RAC is \u201cresponsible for maintaining or servicing the property while it is being leased,\u201d and that it \u201cretain[s] title to the property at all times and will pay any taxes which might be levied on the property.\u201d Under the agreement, Costa is \u201cnot obligated to renew this lease and may terminate it at any time without penalty and with no further obligation. To do so, you must return the rental property and pay all rental payments and other charges due through the date of return.\u201d The agreement further specifies that Costa may \u201cchoose to acquire ownership\u201d by \u201crent[ing] the property for the [specified] number of weeks\u201d shown in the contract. According to the agreement, \u201cYou do not own the property,\u201d and \u201c[y]ou will not own the property until you have made the total payment necessary to acquire ownership.\u201d In addition, Costa has the \u201cright to exercise an early purchase option. If you wish to purchase the rental property you may do so at any time by the payment of 55% of the remaining Total of Payments calculated at that time.\u201d Finally, the agreement specifies that Costa may not \u201csell, mortgage, pawn, pledge, encumber, hock or dispose of\u201d the property, and that the agreement has been pledged to the lessor\u2019s bank as collateral security.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">To determine whether the Legislature intended either RISA or CLA to apply to Costa\u2019s agreement, we consider both statutes in turn, mindful of the established canon of statutory construction that \u201cgeneral statutory language must yield to that which is more specific.\u201d <em>TBI, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N. Andover, </em>431 Mass. 9, 18 (2000), quoting <em>Risk Mgt. Found. of Harvard Med. Insts., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>407 Mass. 498, 505 (1990).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">a. <em>Retail Instalment Sales Act. </em>Enacted in 1966, RISA regulates retail instalment sales contracts. See Wilkins, The New Massachusetts Retail Installment Sales Act, 51 Mass. L. Q. 205, 207 (1966). The plaintiffs in this case contend that \u201crent-to-own\u201d agreements, like the agreement executed by Costa, effectively are retail instalment agreements subject to RISA that have been mischaracterized by the defendants as leases. The agreement before us, however, does not satisfy the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>definition. RISA initially defined a \u201c[r]etail installment sale agreement\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">\u201c[A]n agreement, other than a revolving credit agreement or an agreement reflecting a sale made pursuant thereto, entered into in this commonwealth, involving a <em>finance charge </em>and providing for the <em>sale of goods </em>or the rendering of services or both <em>for a specified amount </em>which the buyer undertakes to pay in more than one payment subsequent to the making of the agreement. A retail installment sale agreement shall not include an agreement which provides (a) for the payment of the time sale price in not more than three monthly installments and <em>(b) </em>a finance charge not in excess of one dollar and (c) no collateral security for the seller.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">St. 1966, c. 284, \u00a7 1. Under that original definition, a bona fide lease terminable at the option of the consumer, such as Costa\u2019s agreement, would not qualify as an \u201cinstallment sale agreement.\u201d Among other things, no calculable \u201cfinance charge\u201d is involved. A \u201cfinance charge\u201d was defined as an amount exceeding the \u201ccash sale price\u201d of the goods and any insurance or \u201cofficial fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See McCormack, Consumer Protection, 1968 Ann. Survey Mass. L. 129, 132 (RISA likely inapplicable to \u201cbona fide\u201d leases because such leases do not involve finance charges). The Legislature amended the statute in 1971, amplifying the definition of \u201cretail installment sale agreement\u201d to include agreements nominally in the form of a bailment or lease:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">\u201c[A]n agreement, other than a revolving credit agreement or an agreement reflecting a sale made pursuant thereto, signed by the buyer in this commonwealth, involving a finance charge and providing for the sale of goods or the rendering of services or both for a specified amount which the buyer undertakes to pay in more than one payment subsequent to the making of the agreement, or not involving a finance charge and providing for the sale of goods or the rendering of services or both for a specific amount which the buyer undertakes to pay in five or more installments subsequent to the making of the agreement. <em>\u2018Retail installment sale agreement\u2019 shall also include any contract in the form of a bailment or lease if the bailee or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>lessee contracts to pay as compensation for use a sum substantially equivalent to or in excess of the value of the goods involved and it is agreed that the bailee or lessee will become, or for no other or for a nominal consideration has the option to become the owner of the goods upon full compliance with his obligations under the contract. </em>A retail installment sales agreement shall not include an agreement which provides <em>(a) </em>for the payment of the deferred payment price in not more than three monthly installments and <em>(b) </em>a finance charge not in excess of one dollar and (c) no collateral security for the seller.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">St. 1971, c. 341, \u00a7 1. Although the statute has since been amended, the language concerning contracts in the form of a lease or bailment has remained substantively unchanged. See G. L. c. 255D, \u00a7 1. The statute thus recognizes that leases may be characterized as instalment sales only if specific requirements are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Under EISA\u2019s definition, Costa\u2019s rent-to-own agreement is not an \u201cinstallment sale agreement.\u201d Not only does Costa\u2019s agreement not <em>require </em>(as opposed to permit) him to pay a \u201csum substantially equivalent to or in excess of the value of the goods involved,\u201d G. L. c. 255D, \u00a7 1, but it does not permit him, \u201cupon full compliance with his obligations under the contract\u201d for the original term, to become the owner for a \u201cnominal consideration.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the agreement does not obligate Costa to pay \u201ca specified amount which the buyer undertakes to pay in more than one payment.\u201d G. L. c. 255D, \u00a7 1. Costa is obliged to make no payment other than the first weekly payment, and there is no \u201ccontract^ to pay\u201d a sum substantially equivalent to the value of the item. <em>Id. </em>In essence, Costa\u2019s contract is a one-week rental contract with multiple options to renew. See <em>Crumley </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>298 Ark. 112, 115 (1989) (in considering whether rent-to-own contract is disguised conditional sale, analysis focuses first on whether there is \u201cobligation to pay the equivalent of the purchase price\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>In this case, the absence of any obligation on the part of Costa to pay a sum substantially equivalent to the value of the leased computer is decisive. In <em>Crumley </em>v. <em>Berry, supra, </em>for example, the Supreme Court of Arkansas considered whether, under the Arkansas retail instalment sale act, a \u201crent-to-own\u201d contract was a bona fide lease, or a disguised sale. In concluding that the transaction was a lease, the court noted that the lease was \u201c[wjithout any requirement to pay throughout the contract\u201d and that the lessee had the \u201ccorresponding right to terminate the contract at any time.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 117. Other jurisdictions, construing similar legislation and similar rent-to-own leases, are in accord. See, e.g., <em>Givens </em>v. <em>Rent-A-Center, Inc., </em>720 F. Supp. 160 (S.D. Ala. 1988); <em>Hawkes Television, Inc. </em>v. <em>Maine Bur. of Consumer Credit Protection, </em>462 A.2d 1167 (Me. 1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Action TV Rentals, Inc., </em>297 Md. 531, 533 (Ct. App. 1983) (rent-to-own contract did not satisfy Maryland\u2019s RISA statute because lessee did not make \u201cenforceable promise\u201d to pay an amount at least substantially equivalent to value of goods); <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Rent-A-Center, Inc., </em>843 A.2d 393 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">It may be that if a consumer exercises his or her right to renew a consumer lease multiple times, the lease payments eventually will exceed the value of the item. But application of a regulatory framework does not depend on the economics of hindsight. We look, instead, to the nature of the contract at the time it was formed, focusing on the parties\u2019 contractual rights and obligations at that point. See 4 JJ. White &amp; R.S. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 30-3, at 19 (5th ed. 2002) (\u201cEven though certain events or facts that determine the economic consequences of the deal have occurred or exist only at the conclusion of the lease, the agreement is either a lease or a security agreement from the beginning\u201d). In short, because Costa\u2019s contract did not require payments totaling an amount substantially equivalent to the value of the leased item, the mere possibility of a nominal purchase option if he undertook multiple renewals of the lease term did not make the transaction an instalment sale within the meaning of RISA. See H.J. Alperin &amp; R.F. Chase, Consumer Law \u00a7 8.22, at 28-29 (2d ed. 2001) (\u201cIt is clear that contracts in the form of a bailment or lease are not credit sales if the consumer has the right to terminate the arrangement at any time without penalty. This excludes [from RISA] rental-purchase or \u2018rent to own\u2019 agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>ments, under which the consumer ostensibly rents personal property for a minimum one-week or one-month period but has the option of acquiring title to the property by continuing the rental for a specified number of successive periods\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">This construction of RISA is consistent with similar language contained in its Federal counterpart, the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601 et seq (2006). The Truth-in-Lending Act defines a \u201ccredit sale\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\u201c[A]ny contract in the form of a bailment or lease if the bailee or lessee contracts to pay as compensation for use a sum substantially equivalent to or in excess of the aggregate value of the property and services involved and it is agreed that the bailee or lessee will become, or for no other or a nominal consideration has the option to become, the owner of the property upon full compliance with his obligations under the contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1602(g). Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.2(a)(16) (2009), further explains that a credit sale includes certain leases, but not those \u201cterminable without penalty at any time by the consumer.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because Costa\u2019s rent-to-own agreement permitted him to terminate it at any time without penalty, it was not a \u201ccredit sale\u201d within the meaning of the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, and it similarly does not involve an \u201cextension of credit\u201d under RISA. See G. L. c. 255D, \u00a7 1 (defining \u201c[fjinance charge\u201d as \u201cthe cost of credit determined in accordance with the provisions of\u201d G. L. c. 140D); 209 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 32.02(1) (2002) (defining \u201c[c]redit sale\u201d to exclude a lease \u201cterminable without penalty at any time by the consumer\u201d); HJ. Alperin &amp; R.F. Chase, Consumer Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 13.10. In similar regard, in a 1996 letter ruling, the Massachusetts division of banks stated that for a lease to be considered a retail instalment sale agreement, it must <em>\u201crequire </em>payments substantially equivalent to or in excess of the value of the goods.\u201d LR 96-034 (Mar. 28, 1996) (entities entering into retail instalment sales agreements with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>consumers exempt from licensing requirements of G. L. c. 255D). Under the agreement at issue, Costa was obliged to pay a \u201cweekly\u201d rental in advance of the rental term, but he neither incurred a debt nor possessed a right to defer payment. RISA simply is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Whether an agreement involves an extension of credit also is a significant factor in determining whether a retail instalment sale contract constitutes a secured transaction. Where the lessor retains title to the goods, and not a bare security interest to secure performance of a credit obligation, and the lessee may terminate the agreement at will, the retail instalment sales act is inapplicable. See 209 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 32.02 (defining \u201c[c]redit\u201d and \u201c[sjecurity interest\u201d). As two commentators have noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">\u201cA \u2018lease\u2019 terminable at the will of the lessee cannot be a security agreement. That is true even if the apparent lease term continues for the entire economic life or if there is a purchase option for nominal consideration at the end of the term. A prime example of this is the \u2018rent-to-own\u2019 agreement where a retailer leases a television or microwave to a consumer. The lease term is usually short \u2014 two weeks or one month \u25a0\u2014 and the lease is renewed automatically unless the consumer returns the goods. The consumer may purchase the goods either by continuing payments for a certain period (such as 52 weeks) or by paying fair market value (usually computed on a sliding scale, such as 60% of all remaining payments). ... A sale and security agreement cannot be found when the consumer has no obligation to pay the purchase price.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">4 J.J. White &amp; R.S. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 30-3, at 33-34. Federal bankruptcy courts repeatedly have rejected attempts to classify rent-to-own contracts either as secured transactions or instalment sales, concluding that such transactions do not create security interests under the Uniform Commercial Code. See, e.g., <em>In re Parker, </em>363 B.R. 769 (Bankr. D.S.C. 2006); <em>In re Johnson, </em>203 B.R. 498 (Bankr. S.D. Ga. 1996). In sum, a transaction structured as a lease, terminable at the will of the lessee without penalty, is not equivalent to an instalment sale contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">b. <em>Consumer Lease Act. </em>Having concluded that RISA does not apply to Costa\u2019s rent-to-own agreement, we next consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>whether CLA does. That statute defines a \u201c[c]onsumer lease\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">\u201c[A] contract in the form of a lease or bailment for the use of personal property by a natural person for a period of time of four months or less, and for a total contractual obligation not exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, whether or not the lessee has the option to purchase or otherwise become the owner of the property at the expiration of the lease, except that such term shall not include any of the following: ... (5) a lease or agreement which constitutes a retail installment transaction as defined in section one of chapter two hundred and fifty-five D; . . . (7) any lease or rental of an item of personal property that is leased or rented for fewer than seven consecutive days, including all renewals and extensions of the lease or rental agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 90. When the CLA legislation was introduced in 1986, few States had enacted legislation having specific application to the rent-to-own industry. See Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 10-1-680 (2009); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 445.951 (West 2002); S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 37-2-701 (West 2002); Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. \u00a7 35.71(f) (since repealed). The language of the Massachusetts legislation clearly followed the model of the Federal Consumer Leasing Act of 1976, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1667-1667f (2006) (concerning personal property leases of more than four months). For example, it uses the phrase \u201cconsumer lease\u201d contained in the Federal statute, rather than \u201crental-purchase,\u201d \u201clease-purchase,\u201d or \u201crent-to-own,\u201d terms that appear in later statutory enactments. See, e.g., Alaska Stat. \u00a7 45.35.010 (Lexis-Nexis 2008) (lease-purchases); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 44.6801 (West 2003 &amp; Supp. 2008) (rental-purchase); Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 42-240 (2009) (rent-to-own). See also note 15, <em>infra. </em>The CLA defines \u201c[cjonsumer lease\u201d to apply to leases \u201cfor a period of time of four months or less,\u201d precisely the period left unregulated by the Federal CLA. Compare G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 90, with 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1667 (applying consumer leases \u201cfor a period of time exceeding four months\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">It is possible that each of the elements of a \u201cconsumer lease,\u201d as that term is defined in the CLA, is present in the Costa contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>although the undisputed facts do not permit a definitive determination. The computer equipment may be \u201cpersonal property\u201d; the stated rental period is one week; and the contractual obligation does not exceed $25,000. On the record before us, however, we cannot determine whether the computer equipment was rented \u201cprimarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Assuming those requirements are satisfied, we conclude that the \u201cweekly\u201d rental term of Costa\u2019s contract brings it within the regulatory scope of the CLA. The CLA requires that a lease term be for a period of four months or less. While a consumer may choose to renew an agreement for successive terms aggregating more than four months, that eventual choice does not preclude application of the CLA. The language of the statute indicates that the Legislature required consideration of such renewals and extension only in determining whether the statute applies to very short-term contracts \u2014 those for fewer than seven days \u2022\u2014 but not to the determination whether the maximum four-month period is exceeded.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Compare G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 90 (7) (CLA applies to leases or rentals of seven days or more \u201cincluding all renewals and extensions of the lease or rental agreement\u201d), with G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 90 (providing generally that CLA covers leases of four months or more, without mention of renewals or extensions). See H.J. Alperin &amp; R.F. Chase, Consumer Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 13:10, at 256 n.8. The regulations promulgated by the Attorney General, 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.11 (1993) (lease and rent-to-own transactions), support this construction. Those regulations characterize rent-to-own transactions as leases \u201cfor any minimum period of less than four months\u201d as subject to the CLA, and consider them differently from instalment sales. See <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 772 (1980) (\u201cwe hold that the Legislature has, by G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 [c], delegated to the Attorney General the power to promulgate rules and regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>defining with specificity acts and practices which violate G. L. 93A, \u00a7 2 [a]\u201d; \u201c[t]hese rules and regulations have the same force of law as those of any \u2018agency\u2019 as defined in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 [2]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The Federal Reserve Board (board) has analyzed the definition of \u201cconsumer lease\u201d in the cognate Federal CLA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1667(1), and its conclusions concerning calculation of a lease term are consistent with ours. The Federal statute begins where the Massachusetts statute ends: it applies only to consumer leases having a term of more than four months, see 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.2(e)(1) (2009) (Regulation M), while the Massachusetts statute applies to those with a term of four months or less.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The board\u2019s official staff commentary to Regulation M states that a three-month lease, extended on a month-to-month basis, is not covered by the Federal CLA, because the Federal act applies only to leases with a term of \u201cmore than four months\u201d (emphasis added). 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.2 Supp. I comment 2(e)-2 (2009). The commentary concludes that the federally required four-month minimum term is ascertained by looking at the initial term, without regard to successive renewals. <em>Id. </em>See HJ. Alperin &amp; R.F. Chase, Consumer Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 13.10 (\u201cFederal requirement that the lease be for more than four months means that the initial term of the lease must be more than four months\u201d). In other words, the Federal CLA does not apply to week-to-week, or month-to-month, agreements, even though such consumers have the right (but not the obligation) to extend such agreements to four months or more. See <em>In re Hanley, </em>135 B.R. 311 (Bankr. C.D. Ill. 1990); <em>Lemay </em>v. <em>Stroman\u2019s, Inc., </em>510 F. Supp. 921 (E.D.

Two of those three States, Wisconsin and New Jersey, have construed their retail instalment sales statutes to apply to rent-to-own transactions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because the Massachusetts CLA ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>plies directly to such transactions, and mindful that \u201cgeneral statutory language must yield to that which is more specific,\u201d <em>Risk Mgt. Found, of the Harvard Med. Insts., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>407 Mass. 498, 505 (1990), we conclude that the reasoning of the Wisconsin and New Jersey courts lend little assistance in interpreting our different statutory scheme, and only briefly address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The Wisconsin Consumer Act, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 421.301(9) (West 2005 &amp; Supp. 2008), contains a definition of \u201c[cjredit sale\u201d broader than the Massachusetts definition, because it considers the amounts a consumer actually \u201cpays,\u201d rather than what he or she is obligated to pay. Wisconsin defines a \u201c[cjredit sale\u201d to include any \u201clease . . . if . . . the lessee <em>pays </em>or agrees to pay as compensation for use a sum substantially equivalent to or in excess of the aggregate value of the goods.\u201d Applying this definition, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin held that, by \u201cexpanding]\u201d the definition of \u201ccredit sale,\u201d the Legislature intended the statute to apply to \u201ctwo situations: where there is obligation and where the customer has made payments equal to the item\u2019s value.\u201d <em>Burney </em>v. <em>Thorn Americas, Inc., supra. </em>The Wisconsin statute, unlike the Massachusetts CLA, defines \u201c[cjredit sale\u201d to include transactions in which the consumer <em>\u201chas made </em>payments\u201d equal to the item\u2019s value, regardless whether the agreement imposed any obligation to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 767-769. The Massachusetts definition of \u201cretail installment sale\u201d has no comparable definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">New Jersey, like Wisconsin, has no specific rent-to-own statute. The Supreme Court of New Jersey concluded, however, that rent-to-own transactions, while \u201cnot a perfect fit with the words\u201d of the New Jersey Retail Installment Sales Act, are nonetheless subject to its requirements. <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Rent-A-Center, Inc., </em>186 N.J. 188, 208 (2006). The New Jersey statute defines \u201cretail installment contract\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">\u201cThis term includes a security agreement, chattel mortgage, conditional sales contract, or other <em>similar instru-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number><em>merit </em>in any contract for the bailment or leasing of goods by which the bailee or lessee agrees to pay as compensation a sum substantially equivalent to or in excess of the value of the goods, and by which it is agreed that the bailee or lessee is bound to become, or has the option of becoming, the owner of such goods upon full compliance with the terms of such retail installment contract\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">N.J. Stat. Ann. 17:16C-l(b) (West 2000). The court concluded that, \u201c[b]y including conditional sales, chattel mortgages, security interests, leases, and similar instruments within EISA\u2019s protective ambit, the Legislature signaled that it intended to sweep into the Act as many cognate agreements as possible, even those that did not strictly fall within a denominated category.\u201d <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Rent-A-Center, Inc., supra </em>at 209. The Supreme Court of New Jersey made it clear that the <em>Perez </em>decision changed the law in New Jersey, making that decision prospective in application, except for the remand proceedings. <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Rent-A-Center, Inc., </em>188 N.J. 215 (2006). The Massachusetts RISA statute does not include the words \u201cor other similar instrument,\u201d and moreover, the Massachusetts CLA facially applies to such instruments. We decline to read into the RISA statute words or policy considerations that are not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">2. <em>Conclusion. </em>The certified question concerns a specific rent-to-own agreement, executed by Jaaziel Costa. For the reasons stated, we answer the certified question by responding that a rent-to-own contract in the form of \u201cExhibit A\u201d to the order of certification, entered into within the Commonwealth, is not subject to the Retail Instalment Sales Act, G.

Although this means that a majority of rental agreements are terminated before purchase, the study also found that agreements ending with the customer in possession of merchandise had eight times the duration time of those that ended in the return of merchandise, and that the median percentage of the total contract time that elapsed before an early purchase occurred was eighty-one per cent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 20. The interest rate paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>by this not insignificant number of customers who ultimately purchase the rented merchandise is extremely high. For example, one of the named plaintiffs in this putative class action, Jaaziel Costa, falls near the median of total contract time that elapsed before purchase that was found by the University of Massachusetts study. Costa exercised an early purchase option after approximately sixty-four weeks of an eighty-two week contract (i.e., approximately seventy-eight per cent of his contract time). He ended up paying slightly less than one hundred per cent interest for a computer that was used when he first rented it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">I am aware, as the defendants argue, that many rent-to-own customers use this type of agreement because they cannot get credit elsewhere. However, because of the way the agreements are structured, it is clear that those consumers who ultimately purchase the merchandise fall outside the CLA\u2019s statutory protection and can be subject to terms that the United States Department of Defense, as part of a 2006 report to Congress, called \u201cpredatory lending practices.\u201d See Report on Predatory Lending Practices Directed at Members of the Armed Forces and Their Dependents 19-20 (Aug. 9, 2006). I am hopeful that the Legislature will consider whether, as a matter of public policy, a balance might be struck between allowing businesses that provide these rent-to-own services to make a profit and offering protection to those customers who end up purchasing rented merchandise at extremely high interest rates.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-5\">I rely on the study most favorable to the defendants, but other studies cited present a very different picture of the rent-to-own consumer. According to a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) study published in 2000, rent-to-own customers are more likely to be African-American, younger, and less educated, have lower incomes, have children in their households, and live in the South and in nonsuburban areas. Executive Summary, Survey of Rent-to-Own Customers, Federal Trade Commission Bureau of Economics Staff Report. The FTC study found that seventy per cent of rent-to-own merchandise was ultimately purchased by the customer. In addition, a study commissioned by one of the amici, the National Consumer Law Center, found that only one of the sixty-nine Rent-A-Center stores in Massachusetts is located in a census tract where less than five per cent of the population falls below one hundred per cent of the Federal Poverty Level (as determined by the 2000 census), suggesting a targeting of poorer rather than wealthier areas of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The University of Massachusetts researchers posit that the methodology of the FTC study (i.e., interviews) was flawed. Their study instead analyzed transactional data made available from the Association of Progressive Rental Organizations. Whatever its alleged flaws, the United States Department of Defense relied, in part, on the FTC study, when it reported to Congress.

The price he paid as an early purchaser was $2,718.34. The purchase price of an item that is listed in a rent-to-own agreement \u201cmost often is unrelated to fair market value. Consequently, the \u2018total cost to own\u2019 may be double the \u2018cash price\u2019 of the goods but effectively four times the true market value of the goods acquired.\u201d Drysdale, The Two-Tiered Consumer Financial Services Marketplace: The Fringe Banking System and Its Challenge to Current Thinking About the Role of Usury Laws in Today\u2019s Society, 51 S.C.
