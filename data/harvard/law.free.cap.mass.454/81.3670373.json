Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leggett, </em>162 F.3d 237, 249-251 (3d Cir. 1998), cert, denied, 528 U.S. 868 (1999) (defendant forfeited right to counsel at <em>sentencing </em>hearing by physically attacking counsel). If so, we consider whether the trial judge properly invoked the doctrine of forfeiture in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">During the course of pretrial proceedings on charges of assaulting a correction officer, the defendant filed several pro se motions to discharge his first, and at all times his only, court-appointed trial counsel, and for appointment of new counsel. In one such motion the defendant disclosed both in his motion and in his affidavit in support of his motion that he had sent a letter to counsel threatening serious harm to him and to his family if counsel did not immediately withdraw from the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a brief video conference hearing, during which the judge asked the defendant to confirm that he had sent such a letter, the judge ruled that the defendant, by his \u201cegregious misconduct\u201d in making the threats, had \u201cforfeited his right to proceed to trial\u201d with any \u201ccourt-appointed attorney.\u201d She ordered the defendant to represent himself at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Trial commenced some weeks later, and a jury convicted the defendant of assault and battery on a correction officer and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 38B. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A. Immediately following his convictions, the defendant was tried on indictments charging him with being a habitual criminal, G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 25, before the same jury. The defendant again requested that counsel be appointed to represent him, and the judge again denied his request. The defendant was found guilty on two charges of being a habitual criminal and sentenced to two concurrent terms of ten years in a State prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The defendant appealed to the Appeals Court, which rejected his claim that he was denied his constitutional right to counsel at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Means, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 788 (2008).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We recognize that threats of violence made by a defendant against his attorney or the attorney\u2019s family may constitute \u201cextremely serious misconduct\u201d that may justify a finding that an indigent defendant has forfeited his right to court-appointed counsel. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goldberg, 61 </em>F.3d 1092, 1102 (3d Cir. 1995). In light of the fundamental constitutional rights at stake, before a judge finds that a defendant has forfeited his right to counsel and imposes the extreme sanction of denying an indigent defendant the assistance of counsel at trial or otherwise, she must first conduct a hearing at which the defendant has a full and fair opportunity to offer evidence as to the totality of the circumstances that may bear on the question whether the sanction of forfeiture is both warranted and appropriate. Because the hearing conducted in this case fell short of that standard, we are constrained to reverse the judgments on the habitual criminal charges, reverse the judgments on the assault charges, and remand the case to the Superior Court for a new trial on the charges of assault and battery on a correction officer and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>Because details of the proceedings are important to our conclusions, we describe them with specificity. On March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>15, 2002, a grand jury returned indictments against the defendant charging him with assault and battery on a correction officer, G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 38B; assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A <em>(b)\\ </em>vandalism with a noxious or filthy substance, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 103; and being a habitual criminal, G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 25. On March 27, 2002, the defendant was arraigned, and counsel was appointed to defend him. Trial was scheduled for July 21, 2003, and was then rescheduled several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Beginning in April, 2004, and several times thereafter, the defendant attempted to inform the court by motion of his dissatisfaction with his appointed counsel. In his first such motion, filed in April, 2004, the defendant made various claims concerning alleged shortcomings of his counsel, including that appointed counsel had failed to file certain motions, had visited the defendant only twice \u201cfor the past 25 months,\u201d and had failed to return the defendant\u2019s telephone calls. The defendant claimed that \u201ca complete \u2018breakdown\u2019 of communication\u201d with appointed counsel had occurred. On May 4, 2004, appointed counsel moved to withdraw, citing an insurmountable breakdown in communications with his client. After a hearing, the judge allowed appointed counsel to withdraw, but denied the defendant\u2019s request for new counsel. Instead, she appointed the attorney as standby counsel, and ordered the defendant to represent himself at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Over the following months, the defendant filed three pro se motions to remove his appointed standby counsel and for the appointment of new trial counsel, without action by the judge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>In February, 2005, standby counsel moved to continue the trial, which had been scheduled for February 22, 2005. The judge held a hearing during which it appears (according to the Superior Court docket) that standby counsel was reinstated as trial counsel, and the judge allowed the motion to continue the trial until April 27, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Any rapprochement between the defendant and his counsel was short lived. In March, 2005, the defendant filed a further pro se motion for the \u201cimmediate withdrawal\u201d of his counsel and for the appointment of new counsel to represent him at his trial. In an affidavit attached to this motion, the defendant disclosed that he had sent a blood-smeared letter dated March 6, 2005, to appointed counsel threatening to harm him and his family if counsel did not withdraw from the case. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>The defendant\u2019s affidavit also stated -that, if the judge did not allow his motion, then at the \u201cvery first chance,\u201d the defendant \u201cwill physically assault, spit, kick, head-butt, etc.\u201d appointed counsel. To emphasize his point, the defendant added that he was \u201cnot playing around; this isn\u2019t any joke, I\u2019m very serious! I have major mental health deficiencies, and present very serious anger management issues, due to lack of treatment.\u201d The defendant concluded his affidavit by noting that he was \u201cnot prepared\u201d for his April 27 trial date, and did not have any documents with which to present his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">A hearing on the defendant\u2019s March, 2005, motion seeking appointment of new counsel (with accompanying affidavit) was held in August, 2005, by video conference. The judge read for the record the several paragraphs from the defendant\u2019s affidavit concerning his threats to counsel. Appointed counsel, who was participating in the conference, advised the defendant not to \u201cadopt\u201d the affidavit as something he had written. However, after several pointed questions from the judge directed to the defendant in the face of such advice of counsel, the defendant told the judge that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d did write the threatening letter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>adding that he \u201cdid it out of anger\u201d and \u201cI just said that to get him off my case because he\u2019s not doing nothing on my case. In reality, I\u2019m not going to do nothing to him.\u201d Appointed counsel then requested that the judge allow the defendant\u2019s motion because his \u201cability to represent [the defendant] in an effective way has been compromised.\u201d The judge agreed to do so, but declined to appoint successor counsel, finding that the defendant had \u201clost [his] right to court appointed counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In a later filed memorandum, the judge explained that \u201cthe defendant here engaged in egregious misconduct by threatening [appointed counsel] and his family with serious bodily harm and even death. As such, he has forfeited his right to proceed to trial with [appointed counsel] or any other court-appointed attorney . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-16\">Before trial, the defendant filed a written motion for reconsideration of the judge\u2019s forfeiture ruling. In a supporting affidavit, he represented that he had been diagnosed by prison mental health clinicians as having \u201cIntermittent Explosive Anger Disorder\u201d as well as \u201c \u2018Bipola[r]\u2019 disorder, and other mental health ailments\u201d; that his threatening letter to counsel was written \u201cout of anger\u201d and \u201cafter being so frustrated,\u201d and that the defendant had no intention of carrying out any threats. He stated at least fifteen times that he was not capable of defending himself, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>not know the law, and did not have an attorney appointed to represent him. His motion for a reconsideration was denied without a hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Immediately prior to the trial, the judge received a letter from the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS) in which it noted that the defendant had not been evaluated \u201con the question of his competency, despite his claim that he suffers from \u2018major mental health deficiencies . . . due to a lack of treatment,\u2019 \u201d and that counsel was available to represent the defendant for this \u201climited purpose\u201d and for a reconsideration of the motion denying the defendant trial counsel. The letter closed with the request that trial be continued until \u201cnew counsel can present these two [mjotions to the court.\u201d The judge took no action on the letter before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"ABa\">Trial commenced in September, 2005. On the first day, the judge informed the parties that the clerk\u2019s office had received a telephone call that day from a CPCS attorney stating that he was available to represent the defendant for the purposes set out in the CPCS letter. The judge declined to allow the substitute representation, and reiterated her ruling that the defendant had \u201cforfeited by that wrongdoing his right to counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Before the venire was brought in, the defendant apologized to the judge for the threatening letter and stated that \u201cit was a stunt that I pulled just to get him off the case. I would never do such a thing . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ASj\">The defendant represented himself at trial. The jury returned verdicts of guilty of assault and battery on a guard or correction officer, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and not guilty of vandalizing with a noxious or filthy substance. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>defendant was immediately arraigned on the habitual criminal charges, which were tried before the same jury. Before opening statements, the defendant stated: \u201cI\u2019m requesting you to appoint me counsel, to represent me in this [trial]. I don\u2019t want to go forward.\u201d The judge denied the request, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d The defendant did not make an opening statement or present any witnesses. The jury found the defendant guilty on two counts of being a habitual criminal, and he was sentenced to two concurrent terms of ten years, to begin on and after the expiration of his current sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The defendant presses two arguments on appeal. First, he claims that the doctrine of forfeiture may not be applied to deprive him of his constitutional right to assistance of counsel at trial. Second, he asserts that, even if forfeiture is recognized, his conduct was not sufficiently egregious to warrant its application to him.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Factual findings related to the loss of the right to counsel, such as voluntary waiver, are entitled to substantial deference, but we review claims of violations of the right to counsel de novo, making an \u201cindependent determination of the correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principle to the facts found.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Currie, 388 Mass. 776, 784 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">a. <em>The right to counsel. </em>\u201cAn accused\u2019s right to be represented by counsel is a fundamental component of our criminal justice system.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 653 (1984). See <em>Lavallee </em>v. <em>Justices in the Hampden Superior Court, </em>442 Mass. 228, 234 (2004) (\u201cThere is no question that the right to counsel is a fundamental constitutional right . . .\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because the right to the assistance of counsel is essential to individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>liberty and security, and to a fair trial, its erroneous denial can never be treated as harmless error. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23 &amp; n.8 (1967). Yet, the right to assistance of counsel in criminal matters, albeit fundamental, is not absolute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Babb, </em>416 Mass. 732, 735 (1994); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>67 F.3d 1092, 1102 (3d Cir. 1995). Criminal defendants may voluntarily, and in certain circumstances involuntarily, proceed without a lawyer. Among the means by which criminal defendants may forgo their right to assistance of counsel are waiver, waiver by conduct, and forfeiture, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goldberg, 67 </em>F.3d 1092, 1099 (3d Cir. 1995), each of which we now examine.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">b. <em>Limits on the right to assistance of counsel in criminal matters, </em>i. <em>Voluntary waiver of counsel. </em>Just as criminal defendants have a constitutional right to be represented by counsel, individuals in criminal and civil matters have a constitutional right to represent themselves. See <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 821, 834 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>425 Mass. 718, 720-721 (1997). A criminal defendant may therefore elect to waive counsel by affirmative request. To be effective, the waiver \u201cmust be voluntary\u201d and must involve \u201can informed and intentional relinquishment of a known right.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>448 Mass. 548, 554 (2007), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>442 Mass. 554, 571 (2004). The judge must ensure by careful inquiry on the record that the waiver is \u201cmade with \u2018a sense of the magnitude of the undertaking and the \u2018disadvantages of self-representation\u2019. . . : an awareness that there are technical rules governing the conduct of a trial, and that presenting a defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>is not a simple matter of telling one\u2019s story .... In addition, the accused should have a general appreciation of the seriousness of the charge and of the penalties he may be exposed to before deciding to take a chance on his own skill.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>394 Mass. 209, 216-217 (1985), quoting <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>545 F.2d 273, 279 (1st Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Waiver of counsel may not be presumed from a silent record. See <em>Camley </em>v. <em>Cochran, </em>369 U.S. 506, 516 (1962); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>389 Mass. 359, 368, cert, denied, 464 U.S. 941 (1983) (defendant cannot waive \u201chis right to counsel by his silence,\u201d as this \u201cmight be constitutionally offensive\u201d). See also S.J.C. Rule 3:10(3), as appearing in 416 Mass. 1306 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">ii. <em>Waiver of counsel by conduct (abandonment). </em>We have recognized the doctrine of waiver of counsel by conduct, occasionally termed abandonment of counsel. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Babb, supra; </em>K.B. Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 19.7 (3d ed. 2007) (\u201cAbandonment of right to counsel \u2014 By conduct\u201d). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Woodard, </em>291 F.3d 95, 106 (1st Cir. 2002) (it is \u201cwell-established\u201d that it is within discretion of judge \u201cto force a defendant to <em>choose </em>between proceeding to trial with an unwanted attorney and representing herself\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>706 F.2d 538, 540 (5th Cir. 1983) (\u201cpersistent, unreasonable demand for dismissal of counsel and appointment of new counsel ... is the functional equivalent of a knowing and voluntary waiver of counsel\u201d). In the context of indigent defendants, waiver by conduct generally occurs when a defendant competent to waive counsel moves to remove his attorney without good cause, the motion is denied, and the judge warns the defendant that he will lose his right to an attorney if he engages in dilatory or abusive conduct towards his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>attorney. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goldberg, supra </em>at 1100. If the defendant then engages in the very misconduct he was warned not to commit, the misconduct may be treated \u201cas an implied request to proceed pro se and, thus, as a waiver of the right to counsel,\u201d because the defendant had been warned of the consequences of such misconduct. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Babb, supra </em>at 734 (abandonment where \u201cintelligent and articulate\u201d defendant sought removal of counsel without good cause, was warned by the judge of the difficulties of self-representation, thereafter physically assaulted his attorney, and judge found that defendant was attempting \u201cto forestall his trial and disrupt the prosecution by forcing a last minute change of his court-appointed counsel\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The acts leading to waiver by conduct need not be violent, but they must be highly disruptive of orderly or safe court proceedings. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, supra </em>at 366-368 (motion for new counsel employed \u201cas a way of delaying trial\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pamplona, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 240-242 (2003) (defendant, after being warned of the difficulties of self-representation, \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d insisted that \u201cappointed counsel not represent him under any circumstances\u201d). The key to waiver by conduct is misconduct occurring <em>after an express warning has been given </em>to the defendant about the defendant\u2019s behavior and the consequences of proceeding without counsel. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goldberg, supra </em>at 1100-1102 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>(waiver by conduct <em>\u201crequires that a defendant be warned </em>about the consequences of his conduct, including the risks of proceeding pro se,\u201d together with finding that defendant has engaged in misconduct [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">iii. <em>Forfeiture. </em>Forfeiture of the constitutional right to counsel results in the defendant\u2019s being required to represent himself even though he may wish to be represented by counsel and even though he has not been warned of the dangers of proceeding on his own. See <em>id. </em>at 1100 (\u201cUnlike waiver, which requires a knowing and intentional relinquishment of a known right, forfeiture results in the loss of a right regardless of the defendant\u2019s knowledge thereof, and irrespective of whether the defendant intended to relinquish the right\u201d). Forfeiture is an extreme sanction in response to extreme conduct that imperils the integrity or safety of court proceedings. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leg-gett, </em>162 F.3d 237 (3d Cir. 1998) (criminal defendant who physically assaulted counsel held to forfeit right to counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-20\">We have previously emphasized the \u201cpower of the judiciary to control its own proceedings, the conduct of participants, the actions of officers of the court and the environment of the court,\u201d which is a power \u201cabsolutely necessary for a court to function effectively and do its job of administering justice. \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>418 Mass. 760, 764 (1994), quoting <em>Chief Admin. Justice of the Trial Court </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>404 Mass. 53, 57 (1989).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201c[T]rial judges confronted with disruptive, contumacious, stubbornly defiant defendants must be given sufficient discretion to meet the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 343 (1970). Forfeiture is a method of court room management in extraordinary circumstances. The sanction of forfeiture recognizes that a defendant may engage in misconduct that is so serious that it may justify the loss of his right to counsel even if he was not warned that his misconduct may have that consequence. Mindful that violence by defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>can and does occur in the court room, and taking into account considerations of the fair, efficient, and orderly administration of justice, we are not prepared to deprive judges of what may be a necessary response to exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">We turn now to consideration of circumstances where the doctrine of forfeiture may apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">iv. <em>Standards of forfeiture. </em>The Federal courts and several State courts recognize the doctrine of forfeiture. We look to these jurisdictions for guidance as to the doctrine\u2019s contours. Our review discloses four considerations that generally govern whether forfeiture is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">First, forfeiture of counsel typically is applied in circumstances where a criminal defendant has had more than one appointed counsel, perhaps because in those circumstances the means of proceeding with counsel have been exhausted or found futile.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leggett, supra </em>at 240 (second appointed counsel); <em>United States </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>53 F.3d 322, 325 (11th Cir. 1995) (second appointed counsel); <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilchrist, </em>239 A.D.2d 306 (N.Y. 1997) (fourth appointed counsel); <em>People </em>v. <em>Sloane, </em>262 A.D.2d 431, 432 (N.Y. 1999) (fourth appointed counsel); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carruthers, </em>35 S.W.3d 516, 538, 539 (Tenn. 2000) (fourth appointed counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Second, forfeiture rarely is applied to deny a defendant representation during trial. It is more commonly invoked at other stages of a criminal matter, such as a motion for a new trial, sentencing, appeal, and pretrial proceedings. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>335 F.3d 782 (8th Cir. 2003), cert, denied, 540 U.S. 1134 (2004) (forfeiture of right to counsel on appeal); <em>United States </em>v. <em>McLeod, supra </em>at 326 n.13 (forfeiture expressly \u201climited to [defendant\u2019s] forfeiture of his right to counsel at the hearing on the motion for a new trial\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilchrist, supra </em>(forfeiture of right to counsel at sentencing).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>feiture of counsel at [a nontrial phase of proceedings] does not deal as serious a blow to a defendant as would the forfeiture of counsel at the trial itself.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leggett, supra </em>at 251 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Third, forfeiture may be an appropriate response to the defendant\u2019s threats of violence or acts of violence against defense counsel or others.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Gilchrist </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>260 F.3d 87, 89 (2d Cir. 2001) (forfeiture upheld at sentencing phase where defendant \u201cpunched his appointed trial counsel in the head\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leggett, supra </em>at 240 (forfeiture upheld at sen-tenting phase after defendant had attacked his second appointed counsel in court room, \u201cpunched him in the head, knocking him to the ground\u201d and then \u201cstraddled him and began to choke, scratch and spit on him\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>McLeod, supra </em>at 325-326 &amp; n.13 (forfeiture upheld at motion for new hearing after defendant verbally abused his appointed counsel, threatened to kill counsel, threatened to sue counsel, and attempted to persuade counsel to engage in unethical conduct); <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilchrist, supra </em>at 307 (forfeiture upheld at sentencing phase where \u201ccourt properly found that, by brutally assaulting his attorney, the fourth one appointed by the court, on the original sentencing date, defendant forfeited his right to counsel\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Sloane, </em>262 A.D.2d 431, 432 (N.Y. 1999) (forfeiture of defendant\u2019s right to counsel \u201cby his persistent pattern of threatening, abusive, obstreperous, and uncooperative\u201d behavior toward four appointed attorneys); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carruthers, supra </em>(forfeiture upheld at trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>where defendant threatened fourth appointed counsel and judge found that these actions were \u201cploy\u201d to delay trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The fourth and final area of general agreement we discern is that forfeiture should be a last resort in response to the most grave and deliberate misconduct. See <em>Gilchrist </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe, supra </em>at 100 (\u201ctrial courts have the discretion to take intermediate steps short of complete denial of counsel\u201d before finding defendant has forfeited his right, but forfeiture without warning might be permissible in appropriate circumstances at trial). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>208 Ariz. 241 (2004), for example, the court refused to conclude that a defendant with gang ties who had mailed credible death threats to two court-appointed counsel had forfeited the right to counsel because \u201cforfeiture is reserved for the most severe cases of misconduct and should result only when less restrictive measures are inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244 &amp; n.4, 245. In <em>King </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>107 Cal. App. 4th 929, 934 (2003), the court held that the right to counsel is subject to forfeiture only when a defendant engages in a \u201ccourse of serious misconduct towards counsel\u201d and when \u201clesser measures to control [a] defendant are insufficient to protect counsel and appointment of successor counsel is futile.\u201d The court concluded that \u201conly in those rare cases of serious misconduct towards counsel where it is apparent that any lesser measures will be patently inadequate to protect counsel may the right to counsel be forfeited in the first instance\u201d without a warning. <em>Id. </em>at 944. These cases reflect that, even when the defendant\u2019s conduct is violent or threatens violence, courts often forebear in the interests of justice from invoking the extreme sanction of forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In our view, the four general areas of agreement outlined above offer useful guidelines for application of the principle of forfeiture. We add that, consistent with our jurisprudence, forfeiture is inapplicable where the defendant is determined mentally incompetent to waive the right to counsel and proceed pro se.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Trial judges have \u201ca special \u2018protecting duty\u2019 to question whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>[a mentally ill defendant\u2019s] election to proceed without counsel is grounded in an incapacity to choose sensibly.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blackstone, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 209, 212 &amp; n.6 (1985). Where \u201cthere is some indication of mental disorder or impairment sufficient to create a \u2018bona fide doubt\u2019 as to the defendant\u2019s ability to make an informed decision to proceed without counsel,\u201d a \u201ccompetency hearing or inquiry to waive counsel\u201d is required, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>399 Mass. 385, 389 (1987), so that a mentally ill defendant is not forced to \u201cstand[] helpless and alone before the court.\u201d <em>Massey </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>348 U.S. 105, 108 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The scope of the inquiry into a mentally ill defendant\u2019s competence to waive counsel and self-represent are determined by the circumstances at hand, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, supra </em>at 389 &amp; n.3, 391; the inquiry must be on the record. See <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 351-352 (1970) (separate opinion of Douglas, J.) (\u201cthe difficult questions as to what a trial judge should do . . . with a defendant whose . . . antics may not be volitional\u201d poses \u201cperplexing problem which we should not reach except on a clear record\u201d). We are, moreover, mindful of the admonition of the United States Supreme Court, which recently \u201ccaution[ed] against the use of a single mental competency standard for deciding both (1) whether a defendant who is represented by counsel can proceed to trial and (2) whether a defendant who goes to trial must be permitted to represent himself,\u201d adding that \u201c[mjental illness itself is not a unitary concept. It varies in degree. It can vary over time. It interferes with an individual\u2019s functioning at different times in different ways.\u201d <em>Indiana </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>128 S. Ct. 2379, 2386 (2008). In short, even where a trial judge has appropriately applied the doctrine of forfeiture, it may be necessary during the proceedings to revisit the issue of the defendant\u2019s mental competency to represent himself. We now turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">c. <em>Forfeiture of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel. </em>The Commonwealth does not contend that the defendant waived by conduct his right to assistance of counsel. Nor could it, for any such argument would fail: from the outset, the judge did not warn the defendant of the risks of his conduct.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>67 F.3d 1092, 1101 (3d Cir. 1995) (judge who finds waiver by conduct instead of forfeiture \u201cwould be on tenuous ground\u201d if he failed to warn defendant of consequences of further misconduct). We therefore consider whether the judge acted appropriately in determining that the defendant had forfeited his right to counsel. We first address the adequacy of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Because the consequences of forfeiture of counsel are so severe, the sanction of forfeiture should not be imposed until the defendant has had a full and fair opportunity at a hearing to offer evidence as to the totality of circumstances that may bear on the question whether the sanction of forfeiture is both warranted and appropriate. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>107 Cal. App. 4th 929, 945-950 (2003) (describing due process requirements of forfeiture hearing). When the judge learns of information or allegations that, if true, may cause the judge to consider a finding of forfeiture, the judge should issue a show cause order, directing the defendant to appear at a hearing to show cause why the court should not order forfeiture of his right to appointed counsel. At such a forfeiture hearing, the defendant should be represented by counsel; if the conduct at issue is violence or threats directed at his defense counsel, separate counsel may need to be appointed for the limited purpose of representing the defendant at the forfeiture hearing. The judge should hear evidence regarding the alleged conduct that may give rise to the finding of forfeiture. The defendant should have the opportunity to offer evidence, and to cross-examine witnesses, both as to the allegations of his misconduct and the totality of the circumstances that may bear on the forfeiture finding, including his mental competency and psychological condition, any other mitigating considerations, and the willingness of appointed counsel to continue the representation. After hearing, the judge may then determine whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was so egregious as to warrant the sanction of forfeiture, and, if so, in view of the totality of circumstances, whether the sanction of forfeiture is in the interests of justice. The judge must set forth factual findings that support a forfeiture of the right to counsel. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>The hearing in this case fell well short of what is adequate in view of the severity of the sanction of forfeiture of the right to counsel. Although the judge knew of the threats made by the defendant, which the judge rightly characterized as serious, in March, 2005, because the defendant disclosed them in his affidavit in support of his motion for appointment of new counsel, the judge did not conduct a hearing on the motion until five months later, in August, 2005. That hearing, which was conducted by video conference, was on the motion for appointment of new counsel; the judge gave no notice that she was considering a sanction, let alone a sanction of forfeiture of counsel. The hearing was perfunctory. Because no notice had been given that the judge was considering forfeiture, there was no evidence presented as to the defendant\u2019s psychological condition, the circumstances that led up to the threatening letter, or even defense counsel\u2019s willingness to continue as counsel if the alternative was that the defendant would be required to proceed without counsel.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">If fair notice had been given of a forfeiture hearing, and if the defendant had been given a full and fair opportunity to provide mitigating evidence at such a hearing, we cannot say with confidence that the result would have been the same. The defendant disclosed in an affidavit dated the day after he sent the blood-stained threatening letter that he had \u201cmajor mental health deficiencies\u201d and \u201cvery serious\u201d anger management issues, \u201cdue to lack of treatment.\u201d He stated in a subsequent affidavit that he had a bipolar disorder,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201cintermittent explosive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>anger disorder,\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and \u201cother mental health ailments.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The judge acknowledged on the day the trial began that she was \u201caware that [the defendant] has a history of treatment\u201d for mental illness. The forensic psychologist called by the judge on the day of trial testified that the defendant had told him that he was taking at that time \u201c900 milligrams of Lithium and 100 milligrams of Seroquel,\u201d two potent psychotropic medications.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> However, the judge made no inquiry whether the defendant was medicated when he sent the threatening letter to his lawyer six months earlier, and the record is silent on the question. At a minimum, there were sufficient facts that raised a bona fide question whether the defendant suffered from a mental illness that impaired his ability to control his actions, and that may have been a cause of his threatening and bizarre conduct toward his attorney.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Threats of violence by a defendant (or others) are antithetical to the work of justice, and judges can and must take decisive measures to control any such threats. Nothing in our conclusions or reasoning should be read to suggest otherwise. Our concern is one of process. Before a judge orders the forfeiture of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to appointed counsel based on the defendant\u2019s misconduct, the judge must give notice of and conduct a hearing in which the defendant is given a full and fair opportunity to show why so severe a sanction should not be imposed. Because the defendant was not given that opportunity, and because we cannot say with confidence that the result may not have been different had he been given that opportunity, we reverse the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We reverse the judgments on the habitual criminal charges, reverse the judgments on the assault charges, and remand the case to the Superior Court for a new trial on the charges of assault and battery on a correction officer and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. The defendant must, if he so requests, be appointed counsel for his retrial. Retrial shall take place before a judge different from the one who presided at the defendant\u2019s two prior trials, the assault case and the habitual criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-29\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides in pertinent part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.\u201d Article 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution provides in pertinent part that \u201cevery subject shall have a right ... to be fully heard in his defence by himself, or his counsel at <em>his </em>election.\u201d The defendant does not argue that his right to counsel as guaranteed under .art. 12 was violated. We invited the submission of amicus briefs by interested parties. The Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS), the body statutorily charged with providing counsel to indigent criminal defendants, see G. L. c. 211D, has filed a brief resting its claims in part on art. 12. \u201cWhile this court ordinarily restricts its discussion to the arguments made by the parties and does not address arguments of amici curiae . . . the argument presented by this amicus is sufficiently related to that of the [defendant] to warrant our discussion\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Bongaards </em>v. <em>Millen, </em>440 Mass. 10, 19 n.6 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-43\">The letter is not included in the record appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b105-8\">In the Appeals Court, the defendant also argued that the trial judge erred in not reexamining the jury for prejudice and bias prior to the habitual criminal proceeding.

We have required, even where an attorney has an impeccable reputation, that specific inquiry be made into the nature of a defendant\u2019s precise complaint against counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuitt, </em>393 Mass. 801, 804 (1985) (denial of defendant\u2019s motion for removal of counsel proper on day on which trial was scheduled to begin, where judge conducted detailed colloquy, and concluded that \u201cthese motions for a new attorney [were] no more than a delaying tactic\u201d).

No such motion appears in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"ABq\">The defendant attempted to appeal to the Appeals Court from the judge\u2019s ruling on his motion to reconsider. A single justice of the Appeals Court issued an order stating that, because the defendant appeared to be raising a matter within the trial judge\u2019s discretion, the court was without authority to review the interlocutory order. The defendant has included in the record an \u201cEmergency Petition to the Single Justice,\u201d appealing from the judge\u2019s forfeiture ruling on an interlocutory basis to this court. There is nothing in the record to confirm that the petition was filed; no motion was docketed, and no response from this court is in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"ASj6\">As to competency, the judge stated that she found \u201cno evidence of incompetence.\u201d Nevertheless, the judge heard testimony from a forensic psychologist whom she had ordered to speak with the defendant on the morning of trial.

The judge so found.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b110-7\">We consider whether forfeiture itself and this particular application of the doctrine are consistent with the Sixth Amendment and art. 12.

But waiver and forfeiture are doctrinally distinct. It is \u201cimperative that there be a clear recognition of the distinction between \u2018waiver by conduct,\u2019 \u201d which requires prior warning to the defendant against misconduct, such as engaging in dilatory tactics, and \u201cforfeiture,\u201d which does not. Courts in other jurisdictions have occasionally confused these terms, and this can \u201cfrustrate appellate review.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>67 F.3d 1092, 1101 (3d Cir. 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>425 Mass. 718, 719-720 (1997). \u201cWe have not prescribed the questions that a judge must pose to an accused who desires to represent himself nor is there any \u2018particular piece of information that is essential to an effective waiver of counsel.\u2019 <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>545 F.2d 273, 279 (1st Cir. 1976). . . . The focus of our review is the defendant\u2019s subjective understanding of his decision and its consequences. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>394 Mass. 209, 216-217 (1985).

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delorey, </em>369 Mass. 323, 330 (1975) (\u201cthe legal effect of what occurred in this case is that the defendant intentionally and knowingly waived his constitutional right to be represented by counsel\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Godwin, </em>60 Mass.

Where trouble in an attorney-client relationship extends through multiple counsel, it is less likely that the disquiet is due to the particular attorney-client relationship, and more likely that the difficulty is due to the client\u2019s intransigence or misconduct.

Because dilatory tactics, even when extreme, can readily be addressed by a waiver by conduct warning, we are not so persuaded. We are not aware of any case where forfeiture has been upheld solely because of the dilatory tactics of a criminal defendant. All of the cases in which forfeiture was upheld in the presence of a specific factual finding of delay or broader manipulation also involved findings of threats or violence. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>53 F.3d 322, 325 (11th Cir. 1995) (death threats and attempts to enlist attorney in unethical conduct); <em>People </em>v. <em>Sloane, </em>262 A.D.2d 431, 432 (N.Y.1999) (threats and attempts to \u201cdelay the orderly administration of justice\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carruthers, supra </em>at 539-540, 550 (threats and \u201cploy\u201d to delay trial).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The inapplicability of forfeiture to mentally incompetent defendants is also true of the waiver-by-conduct cases we have cited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Babb, </em>416 Mass. 732 (1994) (\u201cintelligent and articulate\u201d defendant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>389 Mass. 359, 366-368, cert, denied, 464 U.S. 941 (1983) (\u201cliterate, competent, and understanding\u201d defendant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pamplona, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 241-242 (2003) (defendant acted \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Thus, for example, when the defendant first requested that he be appointed new counsel, the judge did not warn the defendant that he had one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>two choices: continue with his appointed counsel or represent himself at trial. This was before the defendant had made any threats to his lawyer. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Woodard, </em>291 F.3d 95, 106 (1st Cir. 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The defendant, not defense counsel, disclosed to the court the threatening letter to defense counsel, even though defense counsel was ethically permitted to disclose the threat to the court. A lawyer may, consistent with his professional obligations, disclose to a judge a credible threat of violence by a client. See Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.6 (b), 426 Mass. 1322 (1998) (\u201cA lawyer may reveal . . . such information... to prevent the commission of a criminal or fraudulent act that the lawyer reasonably believes is likely to result in death or substantial bodily harm . . .\u201d). We also note that five months without incident had elapsed between the threats and the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. During that time the defendant apologized to the attorney and apparently conducted himself appropriately, and the defendant disavowed his stated intention to do violence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\">For individuals with Bipolar I Disorder, \u201cviolent behavior may occur during severe Manic Episodes or during those with psychotic features\u201d and \u201c[cjompleted suicide occurs in 10%-15% of individuals with Bipolar I Disorder.\u201d American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Manual of Mental Disorders 384 (4th ed. rev. 2000).

The Commonwealth conceded at oral argument that the judge did not rely on, nor refer to, the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that the defendant\u2019s several motions for appointment of new counsel were intended to manipulate or obstruct the orderly procedure of the court. The Commonwealth was free to, but did not, oppose the many continuances throughout these proceedings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Philyaw, </em>55 Mass.
