We do not indorse the practice except in civil trials where all parties agree, but conclude that the defendants suffered no prejudice in this case from the judge\u2019s decision to allow the jury to do so. We also must decide whether the judge correctly instructed the jury on the \u201ccontrol\u201d an employer must exercise over an independent contractor to be liable for the contractor\u2019s negligence. We conclude that the judge\u2019s instruction on \u201ccontrol\u201d was proper. We affirm judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">1. <em>Facts. </em>This case arises from tragic events on August 29, 2003. Based on the evidence, the jury could have found the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Early in the afternoon, a bus carried passengers from a golf tournament in Norton to Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, where the passengers previously had parked their vehicles. As the bus traveled down an access road owned by the defendant Foxboro Realty Associates, LLC (Foxboro), a large security gate arm swung into the road, piercing the side of the bus. A number of passengers suffered serious injuries; one passenger, Thomas Kelly, later died from his injuries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Foxboro owned the property on which the accident occurred, Apollo Security, Inc. (Apollo), provided security guards for the stadium parking lots and surrounding areas, and Standard Parking Corporation (Standard) managed stadium parking operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">On the second day of what was to be a two and one-half week trial, the judge instructed the jurors that they would be permitted to discuss the evidence among themselves throughout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the course of the trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The instruction directed, however, that they could exercise this option only when they were together as a group,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and cautioned that they could not \u201cjudge\u201d the evidence midtrial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">During the trial, the parties first focused on the condition of the security gate at the time of the accident. The defendants conceded that the gate arm was normally secured in the \u201copen\u201d position by dropping a three-pound pin through a hole in the gate pole and a sleeve in a post on the side of the road. If the pin was twisted, a flange would lock into place, preventing the pin from being lifted out of the sleeve. At the time of the accident, the pin was found in an unsecured, raised position; witnesses were unsure when it had been placed in that position or who had placed it there. There was evidence of strong wind gusts on the day of the accident, and the plaintiffs\u2019 expert opined that the wind blew the unsecured gate arm into the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Next, the parties offered evidence with respect to who was responsible for safely securing the gate. It was uncontested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Foxboro hired Standard, an independent contractor, to run stadium parking operations for New England Patriots football games, soccer games, and other events; and that Foxboro hired Apollo, also an independent contractor, to handle security operations on the day of the accident. Foxboro and Apollo employees testified that prior to a stadium event, the ten to fifteen security gates would be in the \u201cclosed\u201d position, each secured by a padlock. Apollo employees would then unlock the padlocks, but leave the gate arms in the closed position with the unlocked padlocks loosely holding the gate arms together. At a specific time, Standard employees would then remove all the padlocks, open the gates, and begin directing traffic into the parking lots. Foxboro stipulated that it \u201cestablished the protocol for how the gate was to be opened and how the gate was to be secured in the open position.\u201d However, witnesses testified that protocols relating to gate arm safety were never put into writing, and they were unsure whether Foxboro had explained the protocols to Standard or Apollo. The plaintiffs essentially argued that Standard and Apollo were responsible for opening and maintaining the gates in a safe \u201copen\u201d position, and that Foxboro was liable for their negligent performance of that responsibility because of its \u201ccontrol\u201d over Standard\u2019s or Apollo\u2019s operation of the gate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The jury found Foxboro, Apollo, and Standard liable for Thomas Kelly\u2019s pain and suffering prior to his death and for the Kelly family\u2019s loss of consortium, and awarded $4,400,000 in damages.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Foxboro and Apollo appealed, and we granted Fox-boro\u2019s application for direct appellate review, which Apollo had joined.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>On appeal, the defendants argue that the judge improperly (1) instructed the jury that during the trial they could discuss evidence as a group, and (2) failed to instruct the jury that Foxboro could be liable for its contractors\u2019 negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>only if it exercised a \u201cdegree of control\u201d over the contractors\u2019 work.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">a. <em>Instruction allowing a jury to discuss evidence during the trial. </em>When reviewing jury instructions to which there has been an objection, we conduct a two-part test: \u201cwhether the instructions were legally erroneous, and (if so) whether that error was prejudicial.\u201d <em>Masingill </em>v. <em>EMC Corp., </em>449 Mass. 532, 540 n.20 (2007), citing <em>Blackstone </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>448 Mass. 255, 270 (2007). This is also the standard for reviewing the use of an \u201cinnovative\u201d jury technique over a party\u2019s contemporaneous objection. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>716 F.2d 16, 19 (D.C. Cir.), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Motlagh </em>v. <em>United States, </em>464 U.S. 996 (1983) (standard on appeal from conviction by \u201cdual jury\u201d is \u201cwhether there exists evidence indicating that the dual jury caused specific prejudice to someone\u2019s defense at trial\u201d). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britto, </em>433 Mass. 596, 611 (2001) (\u201cdefendant has the burden of showing actual prejudice from juror questions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">As to the first part of the test, the defendants argue that the instructions were legally erroneous under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>369 Mass. 770, 772 &amp; n.2 (1976) <em>(Benjamin). </em>In that case, the court specifically \u201cdisapprove[dj\u201d the judge\u2019s instructions, given to the jury on the first day of trial, that they were \u201cfree to discuss the case in the jury room among themselves and that a married juror could tell his or her spouse what the juror had heard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 771-772.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court further noted that where there had been no objection to the instruction by trial counsel, the issue was waived, and because there was no showing of prejudice by the defendant, the court would not consider the matter further under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. However, the court took the opportunity to direct trial judges to use \u201c[a]n appropriate instruction for such occasions\u201d which pointedly included an admonition that \u201c[ujntil this case is submitted to you, you must not discuss it with anyone, even with your fellow jurors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 772. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>We have not had occasion to consider again the propriety of giving a variant of the type of instruction that we explicitly disapproved in <em>Benjamin.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Since that case was decided, however, several States (including Massachusetts) have conducted studies to determine whether certain innovative jury practices would improve the quality of jury deliberation. See, e.g., Diamond, Juror Discussions During Civil Trials: Studying an Arizona Innovation, 45 Ariz. L. Rev. 1, 16-17, 22-32 (2003); Lakamp, Deliberating Juror Predeliberation Discussions: Should California Follow the Arizona Model, 45 U.C.L.A. L. Rev. 845, 850 (1998); Massachusetts Project on Innovative Jury Trial Practices Final Report, National Center for Citizen Participation in the Admin, of Justice at 55-56 (2001) (Massachusetts Report). The Massachusetts study analyzed a wide range of innovative techniques (sixteen in all) during the course of 150 actual trials, including allowing jurors to suggest questions for witnesses, placing time limits on attorneys, giving jurors notebooks to enable them to take notes during the trial, providing jurors with written or recorded instructions, and allowing the jury to discuss evidence as it is entered. <em>Id. </em>at 48, 51, 54. Some of these techniques are minimally intrusive, and others (including the one at issue here) change more fundamentally the jury\u2019s deliberative process, as we have traditionally administered it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Twenty-four judges, including the trial judge in this case, participated in the Massachusetts study.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> During the study, only one of the judges employed the innovation at issue here \u2014instructing juries that they were permitted to engage in discussions during trial \u2014 and did so in only six civil trials. The parties in those trials all agreed to the instruction, and before employing the practice in those trials, the judge sought and received permission from a single justice of this court. While some of the innovative techniques used in the study have gained a measure of acceptance in Massachusetts and elsewhere,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> this one remains controversial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Massachusetts judges enjoy discretion in using the innovations included in the project, except where the court has specifically disapproved of the proposed innovation. While the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury in this case differed from the judge\u2019s instructions in <em>Benjamin, </em>and were less objectionable, they still violated our directive in <em>Benjamin </em>not to permit jurors to discuss the case with each other before they commenced deliberations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>That directive remains unchanged, except as to civil trials with the agreement of all parties. See note 17, <em>infra. </em>Without further study, we are not prepared to indorse a different approach to this issue, which reasonable practitioners and judges conclude may affect the ability of members of a jury to keep an open mind until the entire case has been submitted for their consideration under instructions from the court. See <em>Benjamin, supra </em>at 772 (midtrial jury discussions may cause \u201ca variety of troubles\u201d). See also <em>Winebrenner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>147 F.2d 322, 328 (8th Cir.), cert, denied, 325 U.S. 863 (1945) (\u201cwhat one himself publicly declares touching any controversy is much more potent in biasing his judgment and confirming his predilections than similar declarations which he may hear uttered by other persons\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>182 Conn. 419, 428 (1980) (\u201cdistinction between discussion and deliberation is more apparent than real\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kerpan, </em>508 Pa. 418, 422 (1985) (once jurors state opinions aloud, they may be less willing to change their minds). It was error for the judge to have proceeded in this fashion, without the consent of all parties.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">We proceed then to the second part of the test: whether the judge\u2019s instruction prejudiced the defendants. Under the well-established standard, the court must determine whether the \u201cresult might have differed absent the error.\u201d <em>Blackstone </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>448 Mass. 255, 270 (2007). We are convinced that it would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">First, the judge gave repeated, forceful instructions limiting the type of discussions in which the jurors permissibly could engage during the trial.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> These instructions directly countered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>the defendants\u2019 primary concern that the jurors would \u201cprematurely deliberate[] critical issues, even before the defense had begun its case.\u201d Additionally, at the close of the evidence the judge instructed jurors to end any predeliberation discussions; this helped confine the jury\u2019s discussions to evidentiary issues only. \u201cWe presume that the jury followed the judge\u2019s instruction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pillai, </em>445 Mass. 175, 190 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Second, we reject the defendants\u2019 claim that questions (for witnesses) proposed by some of the jurors during the trial demonstrate that the jurors \u201cprematurely deliberated critical issues.\u201d Questions highlighted by the defendants are requests only for additional facts,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> an expert opinion,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> or a response to a particular piece of evidence.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The questions do not demonstrate that the jury had engaged in any preliminary deliberation, and they certainly do not show the preliminary <em>group </em>deliberation that the defendants posit. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Urena, </em>417 Mass. 692, 700 (1994) (even if one juror\u2019s suggested question showed improper midtrial deliberation, it did not \u201csupport the assertion that other jurors were influenced improperly and prematurely\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Third, in this case much of the evidence was uncontested. Apollo, Standard, and Foxboro agreed that the gate created an unsafe condition when it swung open; that it caused Kelly\u2019s death; that the arm was usually secured by a three-pound pin; that the pin was found in an unsecured position after the accident; that Apollo and Standard were responsible for interacting with the gate on the day of an event; that Foxboro had the right to control the gate arm; that Foxboro had created a safety protocol regarding the gates; and that the safety protocol had never been reduced to writing. The stipulated and uncontested evidence against the three defendants was powerful, and, even without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>contested instruction, we are persuaded that the jury\u2019s verdict would not have been different. <em>Blackstone </em>v. <em>Cashman, supra </em>at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Finally, the jury never actually requested time to discuss the evidence in the manner permitted by the judge.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The jury may not have exercised their power to discuss evidence at all; at the very least, they spent little time doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">b. <em>\u201cControl\u201d instruction. </em>Foxboro argues that the judge improperly instructed the jury on the \u201ccontrol\u201d necessary for an employer to be held liable for the negligence of its independent contractor. Employers are typically not liable for the negligence of their independent contractors unless they have \u201cretained some control over the manner in which the work was performed.\u201d <em>Herbert A. Sullivan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>439 Mass. 387, 407 (2003), citing <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Morphew, </em>424 Mass. 828, 834 (1997). Foxboro requested that the judge instruct the jury using language from Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 414 comment c (1965).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Instead, the judge gave an instruction with language from <em>Corsetti </em>v. <em>Stone Co., </em>396 Mass. 1, 9-10 (1985).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Foxboro argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>judge erroneously instructed the jury that the issue was only \u201c \u2018control\u2019 versus \u2018no control,\u2019 \u201d and that the judge should have stated that Foxboro must have had a sufficient \u201cdegree of control necessary for liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u201cA trial judge has wide latitude in framing the language to be used in jury instructions\u201d as long as the instructions adequately explain the applicable law. <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Pine Manor College, </em>399 Mass. 411, 414 (1987). \u201cThe judge [is] not bound to instruct in the exact language of the requests\u201d; \u201c[t]he test of the charge is the impression created by it as a whole.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>359 Mass. 77, 92 (1971). In this case, the charge as a whole constituted a proper instruction on the applicable law. The judge correctly stated that an employer can be held liable for an independent contractor\u2019s negligence only if the employer \u201cgives direction for the work, furnishes equipment for the work, or <em>retains control over any part of the </em>work\u201d (emphasis added). He also stated that \u201cone who entrusts work to an independent contractor, but who <em>retains control over any part of the work, </em>is subject to liability\u201d (emphasis added). These instructions were almost identical to our rule: \u201cOne who entrusts work to an independent contractor, but who <em>retains the control of any part of the work, </em>is subject to liability for physical harm to others for whose safety the employer owes a duty to exercise reasonable care, which is caused by his failure to exercise his control with reasonable care\u201d (emphasis added). Restatement (Second) Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 414. See <em>Corsetti </em>v. <em>Stone Co., supra; Dilaveris </em>v. <em>W.T. Rich Co., </em>424 Mass. 9, 11-12 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">We agree that in some cases it might be helpful to instruct juries that \u201c[tjhere must be such a retention of a right of supervision that the contractor is not entirely free to do the work in his own way.\u201d <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>411 Mass. 615, 622-623 &amp; n.11 (1992), quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 414 comment c, and citing <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Rust Int' l, </em>901 F.2d 183, 184 (1st Cir. 1990). That type of instruction would be particularly important where the facts could support a conclusion that the employer possessed only \u201ca general right to order the work stopped,\u201d which is insufficient for liability to be imposed. <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Morphew, </em>424 Mass. 828, 835 (1997), quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra. </em>In this case, however, Foxboro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>stipulated that it \u201cestablished the protocol for how the gate was to be opened and how the gate was to be secured in the open position.\u201d This was more than a mere \u201cgeneral right\u201d to control the gate arm; as a result, while the judge could have added the language from \u00a7 414 comment c, it was not necessary in this case. The language proposed by the defendant is \u201cmore beneficial to the [defendants] than the evidence warranted.\u201d <em>St. Ger-maine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, supra </em>at 623. The instruction was legally accurate, and the precise wording of the charge was not an abuse of discretion. <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Pine Manor </em>College, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The judgments in favor of the plaintiffs are affirmed on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b329-11\">Thomas Kelly\u2019s wife, Janice Kelly, filed this lawsuit individually and as executrix of his estate against Foxboro; Apollo; Standard Parking Corporation (Standard); Rebecca Valentin, the bus driver; and Arrow Line Acquisition, LLC (Arrow), the bus owner and operator.

[Ejxperience has shown that, in a long case and in a case with many witnesses and of some complexity, that it may be useful in some respects for the jurors to talk about the evidence in a limited way with one another during the trial. For example, if you misunderstood something, it may be better to get it corrected at the beginning of the trial rather than to wait two weeks or so and have been thinking, under the mistaken impression, that something was so when it was not. It may also help you to better remember and understand the testimony. But that\u2019s up to you.

Such a general right is usually reserved to employers, but it does not mean that the contractor is controlled as to his methods of work, or as to operative detail. <em>There must be such a retention of a right of supervision that the contractor is not entirely free to do the work in his own way.\u201d </em>(Emphases added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\">\u201cSo far as <em>the employer in fact gives direction for the work, furnishes equipment for the work, or retains control over any part of the work, </em>then, if any of those applies, the employer itself is required to exercise reasonable care for the protection of others. On the other hand, if the employer retains no control over the manner in which the work is to be done, the work is to be regarded as the independent contractor\u2019s own enterprise .... However, if the employer retains the right to control the work, in any of its aspects including the right to initiate and maintain safety measures and programs, then the employer, as well, . . . may be liable for damages caused by its failure to do so. In other words, <em>one who entrusts work to an independent contractor, but who retains control over any part of the work, is subject to liability . . . </em>.\u201d (Emphases added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Although we need not reach the issue, we also note that Foxboro was not prejudiced by the instruction. <em>Masingill </em>v. <em>EMC Corp., </em>449 Mass. 532, 540 n.20 (2007). There was ample evidence supporting the jury\u2019s conclusion that Foxboro retained sufficient control over its independent contractors for liability to be imposed. See <em>Corsetti </em>v. <em>Stone Co., </em>396 Mass. 1, 11 (1985) (whether control over contractor sufficient to impose liability is question of fact for jury). At trial, Foxboro conceded by stipulation that it owned the gate; that it \u201chad control over the gate and the padlocks used to secure the gate\u201d; that it \u201chad the power and the authority to direct the manner in which the gate would be secured in the open position\u201d; and that it \u201cestablished the protocol for how the gate was to be opened and how the gate was to be secured in the open position.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
