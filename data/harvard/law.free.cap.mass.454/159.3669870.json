L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A (a); possession of a class B substance, two \u201cpercot pills,\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34; and a school zone violation, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J. He moved to suppress the evidence of controlled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>substances, arguing that the police officers conducted an impermissible patfrisk of him in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. A judge in the District Court allowed the motion after an evidentiary hearing. In an unpublished memorandum and order issued pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals Court reversed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Johnson, 71 Mass. App. Ct. 1124 (2008). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review, and, like the Appeals Court, we reverse the order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We set out the facts as found by the motion judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">\u201cOn August 29, 2006 Springfield police officers Edward Van Zandt (\u2018Van Zandt\u2019) and Justin Walter (\u2018Walter\u2019) were on uniform patrol assigned to the street crimes unit of the department targeting high crime areas of the city. At about 11:54 a.m. they were patrolling the vicinity of Bay and Girard Streets. They knew the area as a high crime neighborhood replete with drug dealings, gangs, gun violence and property crimes. Each had made multiple arrests in the area and they would patrol the location daily approaching people gathered together to check identities and for warrants. As they approached the vicinity of 21 Girard Street, a multiple apartment residential area, they noticed approximately 6 young people standing under a tree. All but one were males. One was known to both officers as having received a trespass for the location.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]Both officers left the cruiser approaching the group. No siren or cruiser lights were used. No guns were drawn. The man with the trespass notice was arrested. The defendant separately was approached by Officer Walter who had seen him digging into the front pockets of his sweatshirt and jeans as if looking for something. He was told to remove his hands from his pockets. He briefly complied and then again began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>putting his hands into his pockets.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] Walter approached him and patted down the defendant feeling an object in a pocket which he felt could be the but[t] of a gun or other weapon. Retrieved, it was a round glass jar, with a red plastic top. Looking through the glass, Walter recognized he believed to be packages of crack cocaine. Neither officer knew the defendant. Other than the arrest of a member of the group for trespass no other actions of significance were observed of the group including the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The judge then determined that in the circumstances, where the police approached the six young people on a routine check for identification against warrants, in daylight, in the absence of any threatening behavior, and without any knowledge of the individuals except the trespasser, \u201c[tjhere [was] an objective ambiguity in what the defendant\u2019s hand movements represented. Such movements may be representing a danger to the police in seeking a weapon or they may be for a variety of legitimate purposes.\u201d He concluded that no \u201creasonable suspicion existed to pat-frisk on these facts,\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">2. <em>Analysis. </em>\u201cIn reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress evidence, we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error and leave to the judge the responsibility of determining the weight and credibility to be given oral testimony presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>at the motion hearing. . . . We review independently the application of constitutional principles to the facts found.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>441 Mass. 390, 393 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The sole issue presented in this case is whether the patfrisk of the defendant was constitutionally permissible.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *6*\u201cA patfrisk is constitutionally justified when an officer reasonably fears for his own safety or the safety of the public ... or when the police officer reasonably believes that the individual is armed and dangerous\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah </em>I., 450 Mass. 818, 824 (2008). For an officer\u2019s fear or belief to be \u201creasonable,\u201d it must be based on specific, articulable facts, and inferences fairly permitted by those facts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Two questions arise in connection with a determination whether a police officer had a sufficient, reasonable basis to conduct a patfrisk: (1) was the officer rightfully in the presence of the party who was ultimately frisked; and (2) did the officer have a reasonable basis to suspect that this party was likely to be armed and dangerous. See 4 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.6(a), at 615 (4th ed. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Here, the officers were legitimately in the presence of the group that included the defendant because the two officers knew that one of the young men standing in the group was committing a trespass by being at that location, and the officers were clearly authorized to approach the group and arrest him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knowles, </em>451 Mass. 91, 99 (2008) (officer had basis to approach defendant to follow up and inquire further on report of man swinging bat on street even though location not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>high crime area, there was no report of violence, and it was not dark).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The second question \u2014 was there a reasonable and sufficiently specific basis for Officer Walter to suspect that his safety or the safety of the public was at risk or that the defendant was armed and dangerous \u2014 is more difficult. On the one hand, as the motion judge determined and in contrast with many of our patfrisk cases, the encounter at issue here occurred in broad daylight, not at night; there were no recent reports of criminal activity in the vicinity to which the police were responding; and the group of young people were not collectively engaged in any suspicious or potentially threatening conduct. Cf., e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 542-547 (1991). See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knowles, </em>451 Mass, at 97-99, and cases cited. On the other hand, Officer Walter, who conducted the frisk, indicated that in view of the particular area \u2014 as the judge described it, \u201ca high crime neighborhood replete with drug dealings, gangs, gun violence and property crimes\u201d \u2014 the defendant\u2019s specific action of disregarding the direction to take his hands out of his pockets gave the officer a concern for his and the other police officer\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The fact that the officers were in a high crime area is unquestionably a factor to consider, albeit with caution; we recognize that so-called high crime areas are inhabited and frequented by many law-abiding citizens who are entitled to be protected against being stopped and frisked just because of the neighborhood where they live, work, or visit. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 659. 663 (2001). The term \u201chigh crime area\u201d is itself a general and conclusory term that should not be used to justify a stop or a frisk, or both, without requiring the articulation of specific facts demonstrating the reasonableness of the intrusion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>453 Mass. 506, 513 (2009). Here, however, the undisputed testimony of the two police officers was that the particular area of Springfield where the patfrisk occurred was, at the time of the frisk, \u201cwell known as a high gang area\u201d with gun violence, citizen calls for shots fired, and heavy drug dealing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 41, 42-43 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The judge found the defendant\u2019s hand movements to present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>an \u201cobjective ambiguity.\u201d The officer, on the scene, was not required to accept the risk of that ambiguity. The officer\u2019s command to the defendant to take his hands out of his pockets presumably was intended to avoid the need for any frisk; when the defendant disregarded the directive, from the officer\u2019s perspective, the need arose. \u201cStrange, furtive, or suspicious behavior or movements can infuse otherwise innocent activity with an incriminating aspect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 780, 782-783 (2005). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>413 Mass. 598, 601 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass, at 542-543 &amp; n.2, 546; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 499, 509-511 (1996), <em>S.C., </em>425 Mass. 99, 105-106 (1997). \u201cThe officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; the issue is whether a reasonably prudent [person] in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.\u201d <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. at 27. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 406 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order allowing the motion to suppress the evidence is reversed. The case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Two police officers, called by the Commonwealth, testified at the motion to suppress hearing. There were no other witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Neither the judge nor the parties on appeal has defined or explained the phrase \u201creceived a trespass,\u201d but we understand it to mean that the person in question has been ordered \u2014 presumably by the property owner or one in control of the property \u2014 not to enter particular property, and informed that if the person does so, he or she will be subject to arrest for criminal trespassing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Officer Justin Walter testified to this point more than once. He stated: \u201cHe was standing there and he was digging \u2014 you know, he had his hands in his pockets. And he was digging around from sweatshirt to jean pocket like he was looking for something or maybe trying to hide something. Due to the area, knowing, you know, that some guys carry weapons in that area, I asked him to, \u2018Take your hands out of your pocket.\u2019 He briefly took them out, went to reach again. And that\u2019s when I gained control of him.\u201d A little later he testified, \u201cI mean, he [the defendant] was feeling into his front hooded sweatshirt pocket, his front jeans pocket, rear pocket. He just kept moving. Real fidgety. Kept moving around. . . . When he first began, I asked him to keep his hands out of his pockets, you know. We don\u2019t know if there\u2019s weapons in the pockets, if there\u2019s drugs he\u2019s trying to hide, whatever. He briefly took his hand out of the pocket, went back to reach in his right front pocket. That\u2019s when I gained control of him.\u201d Somewhat later, Walter stated that he believed he had asked the defendant \u201ctwice, maybe three times\u201d to take his hands out of his pockets. We infer from his findings that the judge did not credit the officer\u2019s last statement (\u201ctwice, maybe three times\u201d), and we do not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b184-8\">There is no question that the patfrisk of the defendant that Officer Walter initiated and conducted constituted a seizure of the defendant\u2019s person, and thereby implicated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See, e.g., <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 16-17 (1968); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 544 (1991). The defendant challenges the constitutionality of the patfrisk, but does not argue \u2014 correctly, in our view \u2014 that he was seized at any point before that frisk. See <em>id. </em>(police officer\u2019s request that defendant remove his hands from pockets, without more, did not convert encounter into seizure). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass. 367, 370-371 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b184-13\">We do not reach the question whether the officers would have been justified in conducting a patfrisk of the defendant or any member of his group for the officers\u2019 protection if the sole reason they had approached and were in the group\u2019s presence was in connection with a routine effort to check identifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
