L. c. 90, \u00a7 24. The roadblock was conducted pursuant to State police General Order TRF-15 (TRF-15), which sets forth protocols and guidelines governing sobriety checkpoints conducted in Massachusetts, supplemented by orders and instructions specific to this roadblock included in a sobriety checkpoint written operations plan and officer\u2019s directives (operations plan). At the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest, TRF-15 allowed, but did not require, an officer who makes an initial stop of a vehicle at a sobriety checkpoint to divert the vehicle to a secondary screening area for further inquiry when the officer has a reasonable suspicion, based on articulable facts, that the driver is operating while under the influence of alcohol or drugs (GUI) or has committed another violation of law. A judge in the Quincy Division of the District Court Department allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence resulting from his seizure at the roadblock, concluding that the guidelines contained in TRF-15 are unconstitutional on their face because they permit \u201carbitrariness\u201d in deciding which drivers stopped at the initial checkpoint will be directed to secondary screening.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The first question presented is whether TRF-15 allows a constitutionally impermissible amount of discretion to the initial screening officers to select which drivers are diverted to secondary screening. We conclude that TRF-15 falls within constitutional parameters, because its guidelines permit a vehicle to be diverted to secondary screening only when the officer has a reasonable suspicion, based on articulable facts, that the driver has committed an GUI violation or another violation of law. The second question presented is whether TRF-15 allows a constitutionally impermissible amount of discretion to the initial screening officers to question drivers when there is no indication of intoxication. We conclude that, as a result of the orders and instructions in the operations plan that governed this sobriety checkpoint and supple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>mented the guidance provided by TRF-15, the discretion provided to the initial screening officers in greeting motorists was appropriately limited to pass constitutional muster. Accordingly, we reverse the order allowing the motion to suppress and remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\"><em>Facts.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On July 27, 2007, a vehicle operated by the defendant, Robert R Murphy, was stopped at a sobriety checkpoint operated by State police officers on Quincy Shore Drive, in Quincy. The roadblock detail began at exactly 11 p.m. on July 27 and ended at 3 a.m. on July 28. Seventeen uniformed State troopers took part in the roadblock. They were instructed to stop every vehicle as it approached the roadblock site, but to allow vehicles to pass through the roadblock without stopping if traffic became backed up to the safety officer\u2019s position.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Officers were told that the initial contact should be no more than one minute for each individual operator. During that brief period, the officers were to say: \u201cThis is a State Police sobriety checkpoint. We are checking all operators for sobriety.\u201d The officers were to look for clues of impaired operation, including the condition of the eyes of the operator, the odor of alcohol, the speech of the operator, alcohol in plain sight in the vehicle, and other indicators, which, if observed, were to be documented. If the officers saw no problems, they were to allow the vehicle to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">TRF-15 governed the officers\u2019 conduct when such clues were observed. The relevant provision of TRF-15 in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest stated: \u201cIf there is reasonable suspicion, based upon articulable facts, that the operator and/or passenger(s) is committing or has committed an OUI violation or other violation of law, that vehicle <em>may </em>be directed from the normal flow of traffic and the offender(s) checked further\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When an officer suspected that the operator had committed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>OUI violation, the officer was to instruct the operator to drive to a screening area. There, the operator would be asked to produce a driver\u2019s license and motor vehicle registration and to perform three field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The operations plan governing this roadblock included written instructions issued on June 24, 2007, by Major Michael P. Con-cannon, the troop commander, to Captain Thomas Stewart, the officer charged with carrying out the roadblock. The instructions directed, among other things, that the planned roadblock \u201cwill be conducted in accordance with\u201d TRF-15 and according to a written operations plan approved by Major Concannon. Paragraph eight of the written instructions specifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">\u201cIf the officer observes any articulable sign of possible intoxication, impairment or contraband, then further inquiry <em>should </em>be made at the area designated on the diagram. The operator of the motor vehicle shall be allowed to drive to the designated area at the direction of officers at the initial point unless extreme intoxication is evident and obvious.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">In allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the judge considered TRF-15 and the written instructions from Major Concan-non to Captain Stewart, and concluded that the roadblock\u2019s written operations plan \u201cdoes not neutrally guide the initial point contact officer. Left to the discretion of a trooper are considerations such as gender, race, and economic status.\u201d In short, the judge reasoned, because TRF-15 and Major Concannon\u2019s written instructions use the word \u201cmay\u201d (rather than \u201cmust\u201d) and \u201cshould\u201d (rather than \u201cshall\u201d), there remains a constitutionally impermissible threat of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in the manner in which motor vehicles are diverted to the secondary screening area.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>The Commonwealth moved for reconsideration and the judge, without a hearing, denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion. The Commonwealth sought leave to file an interlocutory appeal pursuant to Mass. R. Grim. R 15 (a) (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996), which was allowed by a single justice of this court and transmitted to the Appeals Court. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Few would deny the strong public interest in keeping drunk drivers off the road. In <em>Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police </em>v. <em>Sitz, </em>496 U.S. 444 (1990) <em>(Sitz), </em>the Supreme Court recognized what was obvious then (and now) when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">\u201cNo one can seriously dispute the magnitude of the drunken driving problem or the States\u2019 interest in eradicating it. Media reports of alcohol-related death and mutilation on the Nation\u2019s roads are legion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 451. See <em>Breithaupt </em>v. <em>Abram, </em>352 U.S. 432, 439 (1957) (\u201cThe increasing slaughter on our highways . . . now reaches the astounding figures only heard of on the battlefield\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, </em>396 Mass. 81, 86 (1985) <em>(Trumble), </em>quoting <em>South Dakota </em>v. <em>Neville, </em>459 U.S. 553, 558 (1983) (recognizing \u201ccarnage caused by drunk drivers\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">It is equally beyond question that the stop of a vehicle at a fixed roadblock, however brief, constitutes a warrantless seizure of that vehicle and its driver without individualized suspicion under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 556 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, </em>389 Mass. 137, 139 (1983). In determining whether such seizures are reasonable, we have recognized that we must balance the strong public interest in reducing the number of persons who die each year on our highways from alcohol-related accidents \u201cagainst \u2018the individual\u2019s right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law officers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Trumble, supra </em>at 86, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 878 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Guided by Supreme Court case law, we have found that, for sobriety checkpoints to be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment and art. 14, \u201cthe selection of motor vehicles to be stopped must not be arbitrary, safety must be assured, motorists\u2019 inconvenience must be minimized, and assurance must be given that the procedure is being conducted pursuant to a plan devised by law enforcement supervisory personnel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, supra </em>at 143. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>406 Mass. 343, 347 (1989) (brief seizure of motorist at sobriety checkpoint established for purpose of detecting drunk drivers is \u201creasonable\u201d under Fourth Amendment and art. 14 if \u201croadblock meet[s] standard, neutral guidelines\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pohce officers may not, within the limits of the Fourth Amendment and art. 14, have discretion to target which vehicles to stop, such as in roving roadside checks, or fixed checkpoints in which cars are stopped according to no set pattern. See <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 663 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra. </em>Because sobriety checkpoints, by their very nature, initially stop drivers without any individuahzed suspicion, giving pohce officers such discretion poses too high a risk that the discretion will be \u201cstandardless and unconstrained.\u201d <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, supra </em>at 661. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>402 Mass. 162,165 (1988). Instead, we have required that sobriety checkpoints be governed by standard, neutral guideEnes that clearly forbid the arbitrary selection of vehicles to be initially stopped. See <em>Trumble, supra </em>at 89; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 348-349.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In <em>Trumble, supra </em>at 82-83, we concluded that the written guideEnes governing a sobriety checkpoint conducted by State police officers in 1983 on Route 116 in Sunderland did \u201cmake adequate provisions so as not to offend the guarantees\u201d of the United States Constitution and our own Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The guideEnes we approved in the <em>Trumble </em>decision were adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>almost verbatim as State Police General Order TRF-13 <em>(Trumble </em>guidelines), the predecessor guidelines to TRF-15. The <em>Trumble </em>guidelines provided that the \u201c[selection of vehicles to be stopped must not be arbitrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92 (Appendix). The supervisor of the sobriety checkpoint was empowered to decide whether all vehicles were to be stopped, or a \u201cset number, i.e., (1) one of every ten passing cars.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93 (Appendix).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The guidelines governing secondary screening provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">\u201cA. If after brief stop, the officer develops specific and articulable facts which lead the officer to believe the motorist may be intoxicated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">\u201c1. Vehicle operator requested to drive onto the shoulder of road</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">\u201c2. Driver requested to produce license and registration</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">\u201c3. Driver may be requested to perform certain motor coordination tests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 94 (Appendix).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">The defendant argues that the <em>Trumble </em>guidelines required a police officer who reasonably suspected that a driver was intoxicated to request the driver to proceed to the shoulder of the road for secondary screening. The defendant contends that TRF-15 is unconstitutional because its guidelines provide that, once the initial screening officer has reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts that a driver is under the influence of alcohol, the officer \u201cmay\u201d direct the driver to proceed to secondary screening, thereby vesting the initial screening officer with substantial discretion, beyond that approved in the <em>Trumble </em>case, to determine whether to subject a driver showing signs of impairment to the more significant intrusion of secondary screening. We conclude that this apparent grant of discretion in TRF-15 is constitutionally permissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">The constitutional jurisprudence regarding roadblocks in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>general, and sobriety checkpoints in particular, has focused on the reasonableness of the initial stop of a vehicle, which constitutes a seizure without individualized suspicion. For such a suspicionless seizure to be reasonable, its \u201cobjective\u201d intrusion, measured by the duration of the seizure and the intensity of the investigation, must be minimal, allowing only a brief window of a minute or two in which the officer may observe the driver for indicia of intoxication. See <em>Sitz, supra </em>at 452; <em>Trumble, supra </em>at 89-91. Its \u201csubjective\u201d intrusion on motorists, that is, \u201cthe fear and surprise engendered in law-abiding motorists by the nature of the stop,\u201d must also be minimal, which is why it must be apparent to a motorist that he or she is not being singled out for a stop and why police officer discretion in deciding whom to stop must be severely circumscribed by clear guidelines. See <em>Sitz, supra </em>at 452-453; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Secondary screening, as permitted under TRF-15, in contrast, is not a seizure without individualized suspicion, because it must be predicated on reasonable suspicion, based on articulable facts, that the driver is operating while under the influence or that the driver or any passenger has otherwise committed a violation of law. For constitutional purposes, a driver directed to the secondary screening area has been stopped in accordance with principles set forth in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968), under the familiar standard of \u201creasonable suspicion.\u201d See <em>Sitz, supra </em>at 451 (\u201cDetention of particular motorists for more extensive field sobriety testing may require satisfaction of an individualized suspicion standard\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 561-563 (1976).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The only factor that distinguishes a secondary screening stop from the more traditional <em>Terry </em>stop on the roadway or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>sidewalk is that the information that gave rise to reasonable suspicion was obtained from observations made during the brief initial suspicionless stop at the sobriety checkpoint. As in any encounter between a police officer and a driver of a lawfully stopped vehicle, if the officer, during the brief window of time allowed by our cases, observes articulable signs of intoxication, then the officer may further detain the driver for a reasonable time to permit the officer\u2019s initial observations to be confirmed or dispelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">We have never required an officer with reasonable suspicion to make a stop, or for that matter required an officer with probable cause to make an arrest. See, e.g., <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra </em>at 22 (recognizing that \u201ca police officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bostock, </em>450 Mass. 616, 622 (2008) (officer \u201cmay\u201d issue, in appropriate circumstances, exit order to suspect in automobile); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>449 Mass. 476, 486 (2007) (\u201cit is clear that the police need not arrest a suspect the moment they obtain probable cause\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>430 Mass. 725, 729 (2000) (officers \u201cmay\u201d stop automobiles to conduct threshold inquiry). See also G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 28 (\u201cAny officer . . . may arrest, without a warrant ... a person found in the act of stealing property in the presence of the officer . . .\u201d). We see no reason to require it when the stop comes in the form of secondary screening at a sobriety checkpoint. We shall evaluate the lawfulness of a secondary screening, or any <em>Terry </em>stop, based on whether the evidence supports the officer\u2019s finding of reasonable articulable suspicion, not on whether the police officer had the discretion, despite reasonable suspicion, to forgo or defer a <em>Terry </em>stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">We acknowledge that allowing initial screening officers at sobriety checkpoints the discretion to determine whether to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>divert motorists they reasonably suspect to be intoxicated to secondary screening potentially could allow officers to misuse that discretion, as the judge feared, by selectively diverting motorists based on race, gender, or economic status. The risk that this discretion will be misused, however, is no different, and no greater, for <em>Terry </em>stops at sobriety checkpoints than for <em>Terry </em>stops on the street or the roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The defendant also argues that the provision of TRF-15 regulating the brief initial encounter between officer and driver lacks sufficient guidance as to what an officer may or may not say, and, therefore, is constitutionally flawed. The judge did not address this argument in allowing the motion to suppress, but we address it here in view of the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The <em>Trumble </em>guidelines provided detailed guidance to the initial screening officer as to what should be said when the motorist arrives at the sobriety checkpoint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201cA. A very brief and courteous statement should be made by officers manning the checkpoints: Example \u2014 \u2018Good evening, this is a routine sobriety checkpoint. Sorry for the inconvenience, good night.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">\u201cB. Only upon observing an articulable sign of possible intoxication will further inquiry be warranted. In other words, the officer should develop at least an indication that the driver has been consuming alcohol before . . . engaging in conversation regarding the consumption of alcohol.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\"><em>Trumble, supra </em>at 93 (Appendix). These guidelines made it explicit that the initial screening officer may not ask whether the driver had been drinking without \u201cat least an indication that the driver has been consuming alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">For reasons unclear from this record, TRF-15 incorporated only the first half of this guidance, omitting the second half. The relevant provisions of TRF-15 provide that \u201c[vjehicles stopped at the checkpoint should be greeted for a period of one minute or less\u201d and that \u201c[a]ll contacts should be kept brief with a short greeting, such as \u2018Good evening, this is a State Police Sobriety Checkpoint. Sorry for the inconvenience, thank you.\u201d In short, TRF-15 limits the duration of the initial screening, and suggests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the greeting that should be used, but does not provide any guidance or any limitation on the questioning that may follow the greeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">As noted earlier, however, TRF-15 was supplemented by written guidance in the operations plan that governed this roadblock. The written instructions issued by Major Concannon to Captain Stewart provided more detailed guidance to the initial screening officers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">\u201cUpon stopping a motor vehicle, the officer shall make a brief and courteous statement to the operator of the motor vehicle, such as \u2018Good Evening, this is a State Police Sobriety Checkpoint, we are checking all operators for sobriety.\u2019 If the officer observes any articulable sign of possible intoxication, impairment or contraband, then further inquiry should be made at the area designated on the diagram [the secondary screening area].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Under these written instructions, the initial screening officer is permitted simply to give the suggested greeting and is not allowed to make any inquiry regarding drinking; any such inquiry is to be conducted at the secondary screening, which under TRF-15 requires a predicate of reasonable articulable suspicion based on the observations of the initial screening officer (e.g., red eyes, slurred speech, container of alcohol in plain view), or information volunteered by the driver or passengers. While it would be clearer if this additional guidance were found within TRF-15 rather than in a separate written directive governing the particular sobriety checkpoint, Major Concannon\u2019s written instructions may be considered part of the written guidance that governed the operation of this sobriety checkpoint. The inquiry permitted by the initial screening officer under these instructions is less intrusive to the motorist than the inquiry we allowed under the <em>Trumble </em>guidelines, and therefore plainly passes constitutional muster.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">We conclude that the Commonwealth has satisfied its burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>of establishing that the roadblock in this case was governed by lawful guidelines. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, </em>389 Mass. 137, 144 (1983), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leone, </em>386 Mass. 329, 336 (1982), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Antobenedetto, </em>366 Mass. 51, 57 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\">We draw the facts of this case from a memorandum of law written by the District Court judge after a consolidated hearing addressing motions to suppress submitted by eleven defendants, including the defendant, Robert R Murphy, who had been charged with alcohol-related offenses arising out of the same sobriety checkpoint in Quincy.

We know that this decision resolves only part of the motion to suppress filed by the defendant, because he has also reserved his right to challenge whether the written guidelines governing the Quincy roadblock were, in fact, adhered to during the sobriety checkpoint. We, therefore, leave to the judge the factual question whether the initial screening officer who stopped the defendant made inquiry of him that exceeded the parameters established in Major Concan-non\u2019s directive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b351-8\">We are aware that other cases involving this same roadblock are pending in District Court awaiting the resolution of the facial constitutional issues in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
