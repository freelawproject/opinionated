The board appealed. On direct appellate review, we are asked to determine whether the board can access information contained in a physician\u2019s credentialing files prior to commencing an adjudicatory proceeding against that physician. Because G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 205 (b), expressly provides for such access, we vacate the judge\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>We summarize the relevant facts from the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision and from undisputed facts in the record. Following a patient complaint, the disciplinary unit of the board initiated an investigation of Dr. Doe. In the course of the investigation, the board \u201cdeveloped information\u201d that suggested that Dr. Doe \u201cfraudulently procured renewal of his medical license by failing to report criminal charges on his license renewal applications,\u201d and which \u201crequir[ed an] investigation of whether Dr. Doe has practiced medicine while the ability to practice medicine is impaired by alcohol or drugs.\u201d See 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.03(5)(a)(l) &amp; (4) (1994). Pursuant to statutory authorization to compel document production \u201cat any stage of an investigation,\u201d G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the board issued subpoenas to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>each of the hospitals on February 13, 2007, seeking documents related to Dr. Doe\u2019s credentialing, employment, and competence to practice medicine, as well as incident reports and complaints related to him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Hallmark Health Corporation is the parent of Hallmark System, Inc., a licensed hospital facility whose \u201ccampuses\u201d include the former Melrose-Wakefield and Lawrence Memorial Hospitals (collectively, Hallmark). The information sought from Hallmark by the board is located in Dr. Doe\u2019s credentialing files, which Hallmark maintains pursuant to the requirement that all hospitals have a \u201cqualified patient care assessment program\u201d (QPCAP) to address, among other things, the credentialing of medical staff members. See G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 203 <em>(d)\\ </em>243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 3.03(l)(c) &amp; (2), 3.05(1) &amp; (3) (1994). Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Hallmark\u2019s medical staff credentialing policy, physicians seeking clinical privileges at Hallmark must apply for an initial appointment and must apply for reappointment at periodic intervals no greater than two years thereafter. See 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.05(1) (1994) (\u201chealth care facility must repeat these credentialing requirements at least every two years\u201d). An applicant for an initial appointment must provide, among other things, information about prior education, training, experience, and licen-sure, as well as potentially negative information, including whether the applicant has ever been a criminal defendant, lost a professional license, had clinical privileges withdrawn, or been involved in any professional misconduct proceedings. For reappointment, an applicant must provide, among other things, information about compliance with Hallmark\u2019s rules, continuing qualifications, pending malpractice challenges or challenges to licensure, and any limitation, reduction, or loss of clinical privileges. In addition to information supplied by the physician, any incident reports or complaints involving the particular physician become part of the physician\u2019s credentialing file.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The credentialing process at Hallmark involves the medical staff credentials committee, the medical council committee, and the board of trustees or its patient care assessment committee, each of which has been designated by Hallmark as a peer review committee.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Documents in a physician\u2019s credentialing folders are generated by the credentials office and reviewed by members of the credentials committee, who send their recommendation to the medical council, which in turn makes a recommendation to the board of trustees. The board of trustees or its designee makes the final decision on credentialing.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">At issue in this matter are the contents of Dr. Doe\u2019s credentialing files at Hallmark for the years 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2005. All of the documents contained therein were, according to Hallmark\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr. Mike H. Summerer, obtained in conjunction with the credentialing process at Hallmark. According to Hallmark, the files are similar in content: each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>contains, among other things, a letter to Dr. Doe from Hallmark regarding his application for reappointment to the Hallmark medical staff, an application for reappointment submitted by Dr. Doe, insurance information (including malpractice claims), licensing information, controlled substances certifications, and professional references and evaluations. The folders also contain Dr. Doe\u2019s curriculum vitae and a copy of his medical license, as well as materials generated by the board, including a document regarding physician verification data and a registration renewal application for the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">2. <em>Prior proceedings. </em>After receiving the subpoena from the board, Hallmark declined to provide any of the information requested, asserting that, because the materials constituted either \u201crecords of a peer review committee\u201d or \u201cinformation and records necessary to comply with risk management and quality assurance function requirements,\u201d they were protected by G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 204 (a), or G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 205 (b), and therefore were \u201cnot subject to a Board subpoena\u201d prior to the commencement of an adjudicatory proceeding by the board under G. L. c. 30A.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In response, the board filed a verified complaint for injunctive relief in the Superior Court on March 12, 2007, pursuant to G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3, and G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 10, seeking to compel Hallmark to comply with the subpoenas because, according to the board, the subpoenas did not seek disclosure of materials protected by G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 204 (a), and because G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 205 (b), \u201cspecifically empowers\u201d the board to \u201cinspect\u201d the materials withheld by Hallmark. Hallmark, in turn, provided a privilege log dated March 23, 2007, containing brief descriptions of responsive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>documents from Dr. Doe\u2019s credentialing files. Following a hearing, a judge in the Superior Court issued a written memorandum on April 25, 2007, in which he declined to attempt a \u201cpiecemeal analysis from the vague descriptions in Hallmark\u2019s privilege log to determine which documents are subject to the peer review privilege\u201d and ordered Hallmark to \u201cproduce all documents that are not privileged \u2018proceedings, records, and reports\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 204 <em>(a), </em>including, inter alia, all incident reports, credentialing items, and other \u201craw materials\u201d not \u201ccreated by, for, or otherwise as a result of the peer review committee.\u201d Hallmark did not produce any responsive documents but instead submitted affidavits from officers at Hallmark, together with information describing Hallmark\u2019s credentialing policy. Hallmark also agreed to produce Dr. Summerer for a deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In August, 2007, having received no responsive documents from Hallmark, the board filed a motion to compel compliance with the judge\u2019s April 25 order. The board\u2019s motion was allowed on January 10, 2008, the judge ordering that Hallmark \u201cshall provide the requested material within 10 days of this order . . . or appear in court to show why it should not be held in contempt.\u201d Rather than comply with the order, Hallmark moved for summary judgment on January 22, 2008.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> After a hearing, the same judge allowed Hallmark\u2019s motion and denied the board\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Final judgment entered pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 54 (b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974), and the board appealed. We granted Hallmark\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>Because we have previously described at some length the \u201ccomplex\u201d regulatory scheme governing health care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>facility quality assessment and risk management, <em>Vranos </em>v. <em>Franklin Med. Ctr., </em>448 Mass. 425, 433 (2007), citing <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>426 Mass. 514, 517-526 (1998), and <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>401 Mass. 172, 177-182 (1987) <em>(Beth Israel), </em>we begin by briefly describing those contours of the scheme particularly pertinent to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u201cStrong public policy mandates the highest quality of care in our health care facilities. That public policy finds voice in, among others, a strict regulatory scheme covering virtually all aspects of hospital operations.\u201d <em>Vranos </em>v. <em>Franklin Med. Ctr., supra. </em>The board has the \u201cprimary responsibility\u201d within that scheme for regulating the practice of medicine \u201cin order to promote the public health, welfare, and safety.\u201d <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Med., </em>378 Mass. 519, 524 (1979), quoting St. 1975, c. 362, \u00a7 3. For this reason, the board has \u201cbroad authority to regulate the conduct of the medical profession.\u201d <em>Sugarman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>422 Mass. 338, 342 (1996), citing <em>Kvitka </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>407 Mass. 140, cert, denied, 498 U.S. 823 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Among other things, the board protects the \u201cstrong public interest in promptly disciplining errant physicians.\u201d <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Med., supra, </em>quoting <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Stem, </em>560 F.2d 477, 480 (1st Cir. 1977), cert, denied, 434 U.S. 1034 (1978). General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 5, \u201cmandates that the board \u2018investigate all complaints relating to the proper practice of medicine by any person holding a certificate of registration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wang </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>405 Mass. 15, 18 (1989), quoting G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5. To further this purpose, G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5, \u201cis to be broadly construed.\u201d <em>Kvitka </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., supra </em>at 143, citing <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Med., supra </em>at 525. See <em>Wang </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., supra </em>at 20 (\u201cThe board\u2019s purpose is protection of the public interest, and when the board exercises its statutory function of conducting disciplinary proceedings, it is pursuing that purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Also \u201c[i]ntegral\u201d to the regulatory scheme is \u201can effective process for self-scrutiny, manifest most prominently in the medical peer review process.\u201d <em>Vranos </em>v. <em>Franklin Med. Ctr., supra </em>at 433. To \u201cpromote candor\u201d and \u201cfoster aggressive critiquing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>of medical care by the provider\u2019s peers,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 434, quoting <em>Pardo </em>v. <em>General Hosp. Corp., </em>446 Mass. 1,11 (2006), the law affords medical peer review proceedings the protection of confidentiality. <em>Vranos </em>v. <em>Franklin Med. Ctr., supra </em>at 433. See G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 204 (a) (making confidential the \u201cproceedings, reports and records of a medical peer review committee\u201d). As we shall explain in more detail below, G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 205 <em>(b), </em>extends most \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the protections of \u00a7 204 <em>(a) </em>to qualified patient care assessment materials. It is the difference between these statutes that is determinative in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In his decision allowing Hallmark\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the judge concluded that the documents in Dr. Doe\u2019s credentialing folders are covered by the medical peer review privilege and are therefore not available to the board at this stage of its investigation because the documents are \u201cnecessary to comply\u201d with the board\u2019s risk management and quality assurance programs and are \u201c \u2018necessary to the work product\u2019 of a peer review committee.\u201d See note 7, <em>supra. </em>The board argues that the judge erred in two respects in reaching this conclusion. First, the board maintains that the judge did not fully consider the distinction between G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 204 <em>(a) </em>and 205 <em>(b), </em>and, in particular, the difference in the extent to which each shields materials from the board, as distinguished from all other third parties. Second, the board asserts that the judge erred in ruling that the documents as a whole were inaccessible to the board without carefully considering whether each document was part of the \u201ccore\u201d materials protected by \u00a7 204 (a), or, indeed, was privileged at all. We agree with the board on both points. Briefly, although \u00a7\u00a7 204 <em>(a) </em>and 205 <em>(b) </em>operate similarly with respect to shielding information from the public and all third parties other than the board, they operate differently with respect to the board. As we shall explain, while \u00a7 204 (a) materials \u2014 proceedings, reports, and records of a medical peer review committee \u2014 are accessible to the board only after commencement of an adjudicatory proceeding under G. L. c. 30A, materials that are, in the words of the board, \u201cless central\u201d to the peer review process are protected only by \u00a7 205 <em>(b) </em>and are therefore accessible by the board at an earlier stage of an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Section 204 <em>(a) </em>provides that \u201cthe proceedings, reports and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>records of a medical peer review committee\u201d shall be \u201cconfidential\u201d and \u201cshall not be subject to subpoena or discovery\u201d except in \u201cproceedings held by [the board].\u201d In <em>Beth Israel, supra </em>at 181-183, this court concluded that the statutory language \u201cproceedings held by [the board]\u201d referred to formal proceedings pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, and that the board therefore could not access \u201cproceedings, reports and records\u201d of a peer review committee prior to the initiation of a proceeding pursuant to G. L. c. 30A. The <em>Beth Israel </em>court also recognized, however, that because board access to \u201call other information generated by the QPCAP system in no way would violate the [peer review committee] privilege and is within the board\u2019s authority,\u201d a hospital \u201cshould make available to the board all incident reports, patient complaints, . . . <em>credentialing items </em>. . . and other items\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 183. Moreover, because \u00a7 204 <em>(a) </em>\u201cpromotes the uninhibited expression of professional opinions before a [peer review committee] and protects the [peer review committee\u2019s] work product,\u201d the court concluded, the statute \u201cdoes not protect ... the \u2018raw materials\u2019 relied on by a [peer review committee] if obtained from other sources.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting \u00a7 204 <em>(b), </em>(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Shortly after the <em>Beth Israel </em>decision, the Legislature enacted \u00a7 205 (b), inserted by St. 1987, c. 579, \u201cto protect QPCAP documents and records that might fall outside the scope of the \u00a7 204 (a) privilege.\u201d <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>426 Mass. 514, 519 (1998) (discussing legislative history of \u00a7 205 [6]). Section 205 (b) thus extends the medical peer review privilege to materials that, while not necessarily \u201cproceedings, reports and records,\u201d of a peer review committee, are nonetheless \u201cnecessary to comply with risk management and quality assurance programs established by the [board] and which are necessary to the work product of medical peer review committees.\u201d G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 205 <em>(b). </em>Such materials include \u201cincident reports required to be furnished to the [board] or any information collected or compiled by a physician credentialing verification service operated by a society or organization of medical professionals for the purpose of providing credentialing information to health care entities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In one important respect, however, the protections of \u00a7 205 (b) are not coextensive with those afforded by \u00a7 204 (a). Section 205 <em>(b) </em>specifically provides that documents protected by that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>statute \u201cmay be inspected, maintained and utilized by the [board], including but not limited to its data repository and disciplinary unit,\u201d and it does not require that such access be conditioned on the commencement of a formal adjudicatory proceeding. Thus, while \u00a7\u00a7 204 <em>(a) </em>and 205 (b) both shield information from the general public and other third parties to the same extent, only information protected by \u00a7 204 <em>(a) </em>is shielded from the board prior to the commencement of a G. L. c. 30A proceeding. For this reason, Hallmark\u2019s argument that \u00a7 205 (b) affords the \u201cfull protections\u201d of \u00a7 204 (a) is unavailing: the unambiguous language of the statute leaves no doubt that the Legislature intended that the board would have access to materials protected only by \u00a7 205 (b). Moreover, in providing for such access, the Legislature did not distinguish between the board\u2019s disciplinary unit and other units of the board, but rather made clear that it was referring to the board as a whole. See \u00a7 205 (b) (information may be inspected by board, \u201cincluding but not limited to its data repository and disciplinary unit\u201d). Simply put, \u201c\u00a7 205 (b) specifically grants the board access to such materials.\u201d <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 532 n.21. Where the language of the statute is unambiguous, we need not look to legislative history, but we observe that \u201c[t]he legislative history of \u00a7 205 shows that it was enacted to permit use of these materials [referring to incident reports] by the board without sacrificing the confidentiality provided by \u00a7 204.\u201d 7J.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Our conclusion is consistent with the strong public policy protecting the confidentiality of peer review. While certain materials related to credentialing are available to the board, they remain shielded from the general public. See G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 205 <em>(b) </em>(materials accessed by board \u201cshall remain confidential, and not subject to subpoena, discovery or introduction into evidence\u201d). In other words, the board, but only the board, can access \u00a7 205 <em>(b) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>materials, and the core \u201cproceedings, records and reports\u201d of a peer review committee remain cloaked by the stronger protections of \u00a7 204 (a) and thus inaccessible to both the public and, absent a G. L. c. 30A proceeding, the board. For these reasons, our conclusion advances the policy favoring the \u201chighest quality of care in our health care facilities,\u201d <em>Vranos </em>v. <em>Franklin Med. Ctr., </em>448 Mass. 425, 433 (2007), because it ensures that the board can effectively comply with its statutory mandate to investigate physicians about whom complaints have been made while maintaining the sanctity of \u201cproceedings, records and reports\u201d of medical peer review committees and the views expressed therein. Moreover, because both medical peer review committees and the board serve the broad purpose of protecting and enhancing patient care, allowing the board alone to access certain materials in a physician\u2019s credentialing files to facilitate its investigations of physician misconduct enhances the statutory goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Having determined that \u00a7 205 <em>(b) </em>allows the board to access certain materials prior to an adjudicatory proceeding, we now address whether the \u00a7 204 <em>(a) </em>privilege applies to the materials sought by the board in this case. Hallmark argues that all of the materials in Dr. Doe\u2019s credentialing files are the core peer review \u201cproceedings, reports and records\u201d that are protected by \u00a7 204 (a) and that the entire contents of those files are therefore shielded from the board at this stage of its investigation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In determining whether a medical peer review privilege applies in a particular circumstance, we look to \u201cthe way in which a document was created and the purpose for which it was used, not ... its content.\u201d <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 531. Therefore, the proper inquiry as to whether a document qualifies for protection under \u00a7 204 (a) is whether it was created \u201cby, for, or otherwise as a result of a \u2018medical peer review committee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Milton Hosp. &amp; Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 499 (2002). Under that formulation, while the work product of the various committees involved in credentialing at Hallmark \u2014\u25a0 e.g., minutes from meetings, reports, or recommendations generated by or for the committees \u2014 are protected by \u00a7 204 (a), documents used by such committees are not necessarily similarly pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>tected.

The decision of the judge in the Superior Court allowing Hallmark\u2019s motion for summary judgment did not make reference to the January 9 order.
