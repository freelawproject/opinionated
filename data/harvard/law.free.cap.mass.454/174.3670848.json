L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5 (outstanding credit balance exemption), applies to certain uncashed checks issued by Biogen IDEC MA, Inc. (Biogen), for purposes of the abandoned property laws, codified at G. L. c. 200A (c. 200A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Treasurer Shannon O\u2019Brien first promulgated regulations interpreting \u201coutstanding credit balances\u201d in 2001. See 960 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 4.00 (2001). Her successor, Treasurer Timothy Cahill, amended those regulations in 2004. See 960 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 4.00 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In 2003, Treasurer Cahill initiated an audit of Biogen\u2019s records to determine whether it had complied with c. 200A. See G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 12 <em>(a). </em>In 2005, an independent auditor, using the amended regulations, concluded that Biogen should have reported $781,251.34 in uncashed accounts payable checks as abandoned property from 1984-2004. Biogen appealed from the auditor\u2019s findings, see G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 12 (g), arguing, inter alia, that the amended regulations could not be applied retroactively. A deputy treasurer concluded that the amended regulations could be applied retroactively because they were necessary to correct the definition of \u201coutstanding credit balances\u201d in the original regulations, which he believed was overly broad and in conflict with the statute\u2019s language. The deputy treasurer\u2019s decision was affirmed by the Treasurer\u2019s designee. See G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 12 <em>(h).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Biogen appealed from the Treasurer\u2019s final decision to the Superior Court, see G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 12 (z), seeking declaratory relief stating that the amended regulations could not be applied retroactively. Biogen did not dispute that the original regulations, on their face, did not exempt uncashed accounts payable checks, but argued that it was Treasurer O\u2019Brien\u2019s policy to interpret the regulations as extending the outstanding credit balance exemption to such checks. In support of this contention, Biogen offered electronic mail messages (e-mails) it received from Treasurer Cahill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>indicating that Treasurer O\u2019Brien in fact did have a policy of applying the outstanding credit balance exemption to uncashed accounts payable checks. A Superior Court judge allowed Biogen\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, vacated the final agency decision, and entered judgment for the Treasurer as to a portion of the auditor\u2019s findings that Biogen did not dispute. The Treasurer appealed and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Chapter 200A sets forth a comprehensive scheme governing the disposition of abandoned property. The purposes of c. 200A include protecting true owners\u2019 rights, bringing additional revenues to the treasury, and providing a procedure for the transfer of abandoned property. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen. </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>388 Mass. 410, 423-424 (1983). Pursuant to G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">\u201c[A]ll intangible personal property not otherwise presumed to have been abandoned under any other section of this chapter, including but not limited to all certificates of ownership, dividends, stocks, bonds, money, drafts and claims for money and credits, except deposits and the increments thereon referred to in [\u00a7 3] that are held or owing in the commonwealth in the ordinary course of the person\u2019s business, including all such property held by any fiduciary, shall be presumed abandoned unless claimed by the beneficiary or person entitled thereto within three years after the date prescribed for payment or delivery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Property presumed abandoned must be reported to the Treasurer in accordance with G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 <em>7.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The holder of abandoned property must additionally \u201cpay or deliver to the treasurer at the time of filing the report all property presumed abandoned specified in the report.\u201d G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 8A <em>(a). </em>The failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>comply with the reporting and property surrender provisions may result in, among other things, see G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 12 (d), (&lt;?), a penalty of not more than $500. G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 12 (c). General Laws c. 200A, \u00a7 13A, authorizes the treasurer to \u201cto make necessary rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Amy\">In 2000, the Legislature enacted St. 2000, c. 198, \u201cAn Act relative to abandoned property,\u201d and added the following exemption to G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aca-dedup-0\">\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, <em>any outstanding credit balances to a vendor or commercial customer from a vendor resulting from a transaction occurring in the normal and ordinary course of business shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter. </em>This exemption shall not apply to unallocated distributions from securities held by financial intermediaries including, but not limited to, brokers, mutual funds, custodians, trust companies and depositories and owing to unknown beneficiaries but held in the intermediary\u2019s nominee names.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoC\">St. 2000, c. 198, \u00a7 2 (outstanding credit balance exemption).</p>\n<p id=\"AIgd\">The act introducing the exemption also established an amnesty period during which holders of abandoned property would not, in certain circumstances, be subject to penalties, fines, or interest on unreported abandoned property, St. 2000, c. 198, \u00a7 4, and required the Treasurer to \u201cconduct an outreach and publicity program to notify business entities and other holders of abandoned property of their obligations under the General Laws, and the amnesty program.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A6I\">Following enactment of the outstanding credit balance exemption, then-Treasurer Shannon O\u2019Brien promulgated implementing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>regulations. Pursuant to those regulations, credit balances shall include, but not be limited to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">\u201c[A]ny outstanding credits; overpayments; refunds; vouchers; accumulated value in the form of points, discounts, or other incentive type programs; or <em>any other value potentially due and owing to a vendor or commercial customer; whether currently remaining as a credit, previously resolved, revised, expired, or issued to the vendor or to a commercial customer as a credit memo or repayment. </em>Credit balances shall pertain to credits either current or past that are or were owing to a vendor or commercial customer, whether or not those vendors or commercial customers are currently determinable. Credit balances as used in 960 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7] 4.00 shall not include consumer retail credits.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-18\">960 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.02 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-19\">Title 960 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.03(13) (2001) further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-21\">\u201c(a) [A]n exemption shall exist for any outstanding credit balances between vendors or commercial customers resulting from a transaction occurring in the normal and ordinary course of business. This exemption shall apply to all prior and current reporting years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-24\">\u201c(b) Credit balances, as defined in 960 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 4.02, shall not be considered abandoned property, in accordance with G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5. Credit balances, when they arise in the normal and ordinary course of business, may originate from activity such as overpayments, payment mis-postings, volume discounting, customer re\u00eda-tions programs, and payments to satisfy other obligations between two commercial customers, and may take the form of credits, credit memos, refunds, vouchers, discount points or programs, and other transactions between the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Seeking to avail itself of the amnesty period, Biogen retained a consultant to bring it into compliance with c. 200A. By October, 2002, Biogen had reported $220,308.74 in abandoned property, omitting certain sums it believed fell within the outstanding credit balance exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">By a notice dated September 17, 2003, the deputy treasurer of abandoned property, Mark Cavanagh, informed Biogen that Treasurer Cahill<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was invoking his right to examine Biogen\u2019s records to determine whether Biogen had complied with the reporting requirements, see G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 12 <em>(a) </em>(\u201cThe treasurer may at any reasonable time and upon reasonable notice examine the records of any person to determine if said person has complied with the provisions of the chapter\u201d), and had retained Kelmar Associates, LLC (Kelmar), an independent accounting firm, to serve as an auditor on the Treasurer\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">On February 12, 2004, while Biogen\u2019s audit was underway, Treasurer Cahill filed a notice of the adoption of emergency amendments concerning the outstanding credit balance exemption. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 2, fifth par. The emergency regulations defined \u201ccredit balances\u201d differently from the original regulations,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and changed the circumstances in which the outstanding credit balance exemption applied.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On June 18, 2004, Treasurer Cahill filed the final version of the amendments, which are nearly identical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>to the emergency regulations. Pursuant to the final amended regulations, \u201c[c]redit [b]alances\u201d are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u201cOutstanding balances that are recorded as current accounts receivable or accounts payable of a holder. The bal-anee must have been generated in the normal and ordinary course of business between the holder and a then current commercial customer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">960 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.02 (2004). The amended regulations further provide that the credit balance exemption applies in the following circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-13\">\u201c(a) Pursuant to the reporting requirements detailed in [] G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 7, an exemption shall exist for any outstanding credit balance or merchandise credit between vendors or commercial customers resulting from a transaction occurring in the normal and ordinary course of business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-18\">\u201c(b) Credit balances, as defined in 960 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 4.02, shall not be considered abandoned property, in accordance with [] G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5. Credit balances may originate from activities such as customer overpay-ments and shall include balance sheet credits, such as the payment to vendors for the purchase of goods and services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-24\">960 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.03(13)(a), (b) (2004).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-25\">The amended regulations differ in two important respects from the original regulations. First, pursuant to the original regulations, a credit balance included, inter aha, \u201cany other value potentially due and owing to a vendor or commercial customer; whether currently remaining as a credit, previously resolved, revised, expired, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>or issued to the vendor or to a commercial customer as a credit memo or repayment.\u201d 960 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.02 (2001). The definition of \u201c[cjredit [bjalances\u201d pursuant to the amended regulations, in contrast, is much more limited in that it only includes credit balances that \u201care recorded as current accounts receivable or accounts payable of a holder.\u201d 960 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.02 (2004). Second, while the original regulations exempted credit balances \u201cpertain[ingj to credits either current or past that are or were owing to a vendor or commercial customer,\u201d 960 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.02 (2001), the amended regulations allow an outstanding credit balance exemption only if the credit balances \u201care recorded as current accounts receivable or accounts payable of a holder.\u201d 960 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.02 (2004).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Kelmar completed its audit in June, 2005. Its report differentiated between abandoned property that Biogen should have reported from 1984-2004 and abandoned property that would be reportable as of November 1, 2005. Utilizing the amended regulations, Kelmar\u2019s audit concluded that Biogen had not reported $1,234,601.50 in uncashed checks from July, 1984, through June 30, 2004. Of this amount, $781,251.34 was attributable to un-cashed accounts payable checks.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Kelmar determined that Bio-gen voided checks that remained uncashed one year after their issuance \u201cby debiting cash and crediting the appropriate expense account.\u201d In other words, Biogen\u2019s cash account was debited, or increased, see C.H. Meyer, Accounting and Finance for Lawyers 22 (3d ed. 2006), by the amount of the uncashed checks and the appropriate expense account was credited, or reduced. See id,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Biogen did not recredit accounts payable when it voided an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>uncashed check, which would have, for accounting purposes, reflected Biogen\u2019s outstanding obligation to the payee of a check.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Biogen appealed from Kelmar\u2019s findings to the assistant State treasurer of the abandoned property division, see G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 12 (g), arguing that the amounts attributable to accounts payable fell within the outstanding credit balance exemption. After a hearing, Deputy Treasurer Cavanagh issued a decision affirming Kelmar\u2019s findings, reasoning that the Legislature intended the outstanding credit balance exemption to \u201cprotect businesses in the limited circumstance when less than diligent bookkeeping left them with an unexplained credit on their accounts.\u201d He explained that such a case might arise \u201cwhere a vendor delivers more goods than were described on the invoice, and the purchaser merely pays the amount on the invoice, or where the purchaser pays less than the prescribed amount for inventory control purposes.\u201d In his view, the original regulations exceeded the limited bounds contemplated by the Legislature when it enacted the exemption, and the amended regulations correctly construed the outstanding credit balance exemption.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Having concluded that the original regulations were inconsistent with the statute, he dismissed Biogen\u2019s assertion that the original regulations governed its audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-25\">Biogen then filed a petition for further administrative review. See G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 12 (h).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> A designee of the Treasurer affirmed the deputy treasurer\u2019s decision, incorporating his findings and conclusions as her own.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Biogen appealed from the Treasurer\u2019s final decision to the Superior Court, see G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 12 <em>(i), </em>seeking a declaration that the original regulations applied to the portion of its audit concerning uncashed accounts payable checks issued between 1984 and 2004, that the uncashed accounts payable checks were not reportable pursuant to the outstanding credit balance exemption under the original regulations, and therefore, that it did not owe the Treasurer $781,251.34. A Superior Court judge allowed Biogen\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. Judgment entered for the Commonwealth in the amount of $56,094, which represented uncashed accounts payable checks that were not paid to \u201ccommercial customers.\u201d See note 5, <em>supra. </em>The Treasurer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Interpretation of the outstanding credit balance exemption pursuant to the original regulations. </em>The crux of the Treasurer\u2019s appeal is that G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5, second par., unambiguously exempts only outstanding liabilities appearing as credit balances on a business\u2019s accounting records. In keeping with this interpretation, he construes the definition of credit balance under the original regulations as excluding uncashed accounts payable checks not appearing as credit balances on a business\u2019s accounting books because that definition does not, on its face, include such checks. See 960 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.02 (2001). In any event, he asserts, even if the original regulations construing the outstanding credit balance exemption could be interpreted to include uncashed accounts payable checks and even if it were the policy of his predecessor to construe the regulations in that manner, her policy conflicted with G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5, second par.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Contrary to the Treasurer\u2019s contention that such checks cannot be read into the original regulatory definition of \u201ccredit bal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>anee,\u201d the regulation employs broad, nonexclusive language. See 960 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.02 (2001) (credit balances \u201c[s]hall include, <em>but not be limited to </em>. . . any other value potentially due and owing to a vendor or commercial customer\u201d [emphasis added]). The breadth of \u201ccredit balances\u201d under 960 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.02 (2001) clearly reserves to the Treasurer\u2019s policy-making discretion any determination concerning the exemption\u2019s applicability to obligations not specifically referenced in the regulation. Therefore, the pivotal threshold question is whether Treasurer O\u2019Brien interpreted the regulation as exempting uncashed accounts payable checks issued to satisfy credit balances.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Normally, the application of a regulation to the particular facts of a case is within an agency\u2019s discretion and we accord an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations substantial deference. See <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 782 (1980), and cases cited. In this deferential posture, we would ordinarily overturn the Treasurer\u2019s interpretation, which excludes such checks from the definition of \u201ccredit balances\u201d under the original regulations, only if it was arbitrary, unreasonable or inconsistent with the plain terms of the regulation itself. See <em>id. </em>This case stands on somewhat different footing because the regulations in question were promulgated by Treasurer Cahill\u2019s predecessor, Treasurer O\u2019Brien, and there is a question whether Treasurer O\u2019Brien interpreted the regulatory definition of \u201ccredit balance\u201d to include uncashed accounts payable checks. Ascertaining whether the former Treasurer implemented such a policy is critical because it bears on whether Treasurer Cahill may now impose a different interpretation retroactively. If Treasurer O\u2019Brien did not include uncashed accounts payable checks under the outstanding credit balance exemption, then Treasurer Cahill\u2019s interpretation of the original regulation would govern. If, on the other hand, Treasurer O\u2019Brien had a policy of applying the outstanding credit balance exemption to uncashed accounts payable checks, Treasurer Cahill\u2019s position would represent a departure from past policy and raise retroactivity concerns. See <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality Eng\u2019g, </em>387 Mass. 372, 379 (1982) (\u201cWe recognize, of course, that the application of new principles or standards announced in a decision may be so unfair as to amount to an abuse of discretion\u201d). In the latter case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>we would necessarily have to consider the Treasurer\u2019s contention that such a policy was inconsistent with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Our treatment of this issue is further complicated by the motion judge\u2019s consideration of e-mail correspondence between Treasurer Cahill\u2019s associate general counsel, Thomas McAnespie,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and Deputy Treasurer Cavanagh, stating that it was Treasurer O\u2019Brien\u2019s \u201cinternal policy\u201d to construe the outstanding credit balance exemption as \u201cextend[ing] to any uncashed accounts payable checks if the holder could demonstrate that the check emanated from what once appeared on the books of the holder as a credit balance.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Biogen received the e-mail correspondence between McAnespie and Cavanagh pursuant to a document request during proceedings in the Superior Court and later submitted them to the judge.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Treasurer Cahill claims that he objected to the admission of these e-mails at the hearing on Biogen\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that G. L. c. 30A limited judicial review of the decision below to the administrative record.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The transcript of that hearing has not been included in the record on appeal, which leaves us unable to determine whether the Treasurer\u2019s objection was properly preserved, the judge\u2019s precise ruling, and the basis for his ruling.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Consequently, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>cannot say that consideration of these e-mails to establish that Treasurer O\u2019Brien applied the outstanding credit balance exemption to uncashed accounts payable checks was error. See <em>State Line Snacks Corp. </em>v. <em>Wilbraham, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 717, 720 (1990).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In any event, Treasurer Cahill does not dispute that Mc-Anespie\u2019s e-mail indicates that it was Treasurer O\u2019Brien\u2019s internal policy to apply the outstanding credit balance exemption to uncashed checks. To the extent he argues that he is not bound by Treasurer O\u2019Brien\u2019s internal policy, we disagree. \u201cAlthough courts give the force of law only to formal agency regulations, administrative agencies must abide by their own internally promulgated policies.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>BayBank Middlesex, </em>421 Mass. 736, 739 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">b. <em>Validity of the original regulations. </em>We employ a two-part inquiry to analyze the validity of duly promulgated regulations. <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 632-633 (2005). Using conventional tools of statutory interpretation, we first consider \u201cwhether the Legislature has spoken with certainty on the topic in question, and if we conclude that the statute is unambiguous, we give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent:\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the Legislature has not directly addressed the issue, we consider whether the relevant statutory language is sufficiently ambiguous to support multiple, rational interpretations.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 633. See 1 R.J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law \u00a7 3.6, at 169-171 (4th ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>2002 &amp; Supp. 2009) (discussing analysis under <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. </em>v. <em>National Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837 [1984]).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Then, if the Legislature has not directly addressed the issue and the statute is capable of more than one rational interpretation, we proceed to determine whether the agency\u2019s interpretation may \u201cbe reconciled with the governing legislation.\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, supra, </em>quoting <em>Nuclear Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Mgt. Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 211 (1995). The ultimate question is whether the policy embodied by the agency\u2019s interpretation is reasonable. 1 RJ. Pierce, Jr., <em>supra </em>at 172-173. In assessing the reasonableness of an agency\u2019s policy, \u201cit is unimportant whether we would have come to the same interpretation of the statute as the agency.\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, supra </em>at 633. Our focus is on whether the agency\u2019s regulation is the product of reasoned rule mating. See 1 RJ. Pierce, Jr., <em>supra. </em>We accord substantial deference to the agency\u2019s regulations and \u201capply all rational presumptions in favor of the validity of the administrative action and [do] not declare it void unless its provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 855 (1977). This deference is heightened where an agency\u2019s interpretation is contemporaneous with the enactment of the statute construed, see <em>EMC Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>433 Mass. 568, 572-573 (2001), because \u201cthe interpretation was made close to the time the Legislature enacted the statute and may represent \u2018understanding of the public regarding the enactment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Connery </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>414 Mass. 1009, 1010 (1993), quoting <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Riverside Park Enters., Inc., </em>399 Mass. 533, 539 n.14 (1987). Thus, a party challenging the validity of an agency\u2019s regulations has a formidable burden. <em>Student No. 9 </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>440 Mass. 752, 762 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The Treasurer contends that \u201coutstanding credit balance\u201d refers to \u201c[t]he status of an account when the sum of credit entries exceeds the sum of the debit entries,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 396 (8th ed. 2004), and that the original regulations were inconsistent with the statute because they deemed \u201cany other value potentially due and owing to a vendor or commercial customer\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>to be a credit balance without reference to the status of the obligation in a holder\u2019s accounting records.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The statute does not define the phrase \u201coutstanding credit bal-anee,\u201d and neither party has identified any conclusive legislative history concerning its meaning. We therefore consider whether the statute is capable of more than one rational interpretation. See <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, supra </em>at 632-633. While the Treasurer\u2019s interpretation is certainly plausible, nothing in G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5, compels it. Cf. <em>First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>372 Mass. 478, 483 (1977) (discerning \u201cno basis ... for assuming that the Legislature intended to import accounting practice into its statutory language and thus to permit accounting principles to be the guide to the meaning of the words [in question]\u201d). We think that interpreting the outstanding credit balance exemption to apply to uncashed accounts payable checks is also rational. An expansive construction of the outstanding credit balance exemption finds support in the statute\u2019s requirement that the credit balance be \u201coutstanding,\u201d or \u201cuncollected, unpaid . . . continuing in being: unresolved.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 1604 (1993).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> When a check issued to pay a credit balance remains uncashed, the underlying liability remains unpaid or uncollected. A broad interpretation of the phrase \u201coutstanding credit balance\u201d also furthers the ostensible purpose of the outstanding credit balance exemption, i.e., to exempt certain obligations between businesses from the abandoned property laws. We note that nothing in G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5, or the surrounding sections definitively demonstrates that the Legislature intended to limit the exemption to credit balances presently recorded as such in a holder\u2019s accounting records.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Because the outstanding credit balance exemption is susceptible of multiple, rational interpretations, we conclude that the words \u201coutstanding credit balances\u201d are ambiguous and thus properly the subject of agency rale making. See G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 13A.</p>\n<p id=\"ABq1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Turning to whether the original regulations interpreting the words \u201coutstanding credit balances\u201d are reasonable and applying all rational presumptions in favor of validity, see <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, supra, </em>we conclude that applying the outstanding credit balance exemption to un-cashed accounts payable checks is consistent with c. 200A. The original regulations were enacted contemporaneously with the statute and thus are entitled to heightened deference. See <em>Connery </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AjC\">A review of the testimony at the hearing concerning the original regulations indicates that Treasurer O\u2019Brien, who appears to have been the impetus behind St. 2000, c. 198, considered the input of a number of business and trade organizations in promulgating the regulations. Treasurer Cahill does not suggest that Treasurer O\u2019Brien failed to engage in thoughtful, reasoned deliberation in promulgating the regulations. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>Because we dis-cem nothing in the record suggesting that the original regulations were the product of rash, uninformed rule making, we conclude that the original regulations were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"AD6\">c. <em>Retroactivity of the amended </em>regulations.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Treasurer argues that even if we find the original regulations valid, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>current regulations apply retroactively because they are curative, and, in any event, do not affect Biogen\u2019s substantive rights because Biogen did not have any right to unclaimed funds. For the reasons discussed above, we reject the former contention because the original regulations did not suffer from any defect requiring a curative regulation. The latter argument also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Principles governing statutory construction and application also apply to regulations. See <em>Hellman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>404 Mass. 800, 803 (1989). Thus, a regulatory change affecting substantive rights generally only applies prospectively. See <em>Hanscom </em>v. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Gas Light Co., </em>220 Mass. 1, 3 (1914); <em>Figueroa </em>v. <em>Director of the Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Workforce Dev., </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 64, 70-71 (2002). A new policy may not be retroactively applied where a prior agency policy existed, unless the existing policy was plainly contrary to the enabling statute. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>BayBank Middlesex, </em>421 Mass. 736, 741-742 (1996). However, regulatory changes may operate retroactively \u201c(1) where legislative intent expressly or impliedly indicates retroactive application is desirable; (2) where the statute is ameliorative or curative in nature; or (3) where fulfillment of the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations may require the statute\u2019s retroactive application.\u201d 2 N.J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 41:4, at 399 (6th ed. rev. 2001). See <em>Canton </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>361 Mass. 598, 606-607 (1972) (legislative changes to remedy past errors, omissions, and neglects, may be retroactive); <em>Figueroa </em>v. <em>Director of the Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Workforce Dev., supra </em>at 71 &amp; n.11. Cf. <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, supra </em>at 639 <em>(not </em>irrational or arbitrary for Department of Environmental Protection to conclude that regulation increasing setback distance for landfill site not applicable where landfill operator had reasonable expectation that prior regulation would apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Passing the issue whether the amended regulations were properly promulgated, see note 14, <em>supra, </em>there is no basis for applying the amended regulations retroactively. The uncashed accounts payable checks may fall within the outstanding credit balance exemption under the original regulations, but indisputably do not qualify for the outstanding credit balance exemption under the amended regulations. As a result, if the original regulations govern, Biogen would not be required to surrender $781,251.34; but, if the amended regulations apply, it would be required to pay the Treasurer that amount. That Biogen merely holds that money for a third party and does not own those funds does not alter the fact that the amended regulations make Biogen hable to the Treasurer for those funds, while the original regulations do not. In essence, because the credit balance exemption under the original regulations applied to uncashed accounts payable checks, the amended regulations effectively impose a new liability on Biogen to surrender those funds to the Treasurer. In these circumstances, the amended regulations cannot be retroactively applied.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\">General Laws c. 200A, \u00a7 5, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"Alg\">\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, any outstanding credit balances to a vendor or commercial customer from a vendor resulting from a transaction occurring in the normal and ordinary course of business shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-8\">We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted in support of the plaintiff by the New England Legal Foundation and Associated Industries of Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b198-9\">General Laws c. 200A, \u00a7 7, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">\u201c(a) Every person holding property declared by this chapter to be presumed abandoned shall report to the treasurer as provided in this section. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\"><em>\u201c(d) </em>The report shall be filed no later than November first of each year as of June thirtieth or the end of the fiscal year next preceding . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b199-32\">This act also directed the treasurer to \u201cprepare a report of the activities, procedures, performance, operation and implementation of the abandoned property system established by this act; provided that, the treasurer in preparing the report shall consult with the Massachusetts Bankers Association, the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Hospital Association and ACS Unclaimed Property Clearinghouse, Inc.

The plain meaning of a statute, however, is not the only tool of statutory construction that may aid courts in determining whether an ambiguity exists for purposes of analyzing an administrative regulation. Excessive reliance on the plain meaning rule in this context may improperly invade the policy-making province of an administrative agency. Surrounding statutory language, the statute\u2019s purpose, and its legislative history, if any, also may assist courts in determining whether the relevant statutory language may plausibly be interpreted in more than one way.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b210-33\">The Treasurer contends that a credit balance cannot be outstanding once it has been reduced to a check.
