While on duty on November 1, 2004, he responded to an emergency report of a pedestrian-automobile accident. On his way to the scene of the reported accident, Lea-vitt\u2019s police cruiser was hit by another vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Leavitt was seriously and permanently injured. It subsequently was determined that the pedestrian involved in the accident to which Leavitt was responding had earlier that day undergone a colonoscopy at the Brockton Hospital, Inc. (hospital); the patient was struck by a vehicle while walking home from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">Leavitt alleges that the hospital and two of its registered nurses owe him a duty of care and committed a breach of that duty when it \u201creleased\u201d the patient without an escort \u2014 allegedly in violation of hospital policy \u2014 after the patient had received sedating medication for his colonoscopy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the hospital\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted, Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), a judge in the Superior Court concluded that the hospital did not owe Leavitt, an unrelated third party, any duty of care, and allowed the hospital\u2019s motion. Judgment entered for the hospital, and Leavitt appealed. We granted his application for direct appellate review. We affirm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>i</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The allegations concerning the pedestrian accident to which Leavitt was responding, which we take as true, <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are as follows. The patient underwent a colonoscopy at the hospital on November 1, 2004. In connection with that procedure, he was administered fifty milligrams of Meperidine (Demerol) and two milligrams of Midazolam (Versed), narcotics \u201cspecifically used as sedatives and anesthetics\u201d and \u201cknown to have the effect of causing tiredness, weakness, problems with coordination, and the inability to think clearly.\u201d The policy of the hospital, as well as (it is alleged) \u201cgood and accepted practices,\u201d required that colonoscopy patients be escorted when leaving the hospital while under the influence of narcotics. The patient was discharged from the hospital without an escort,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and shortly thereafter, as he was walking home, he was struck and killed by a car on the side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">To prevail on his negligence claims, Leavitt must prove that the hospital owed him a duty of reasonable care, that the hospital committed a breach of that duty, that damage resulted, and that there was a causal relation between the breach of duty and the damage. See <em>Jupin </em>v. <em>Kask, </em>447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006), citing J.R. Nolan &amp; LJ. Sartorio, Tort Law \u00a7 11.1 (3d ed. 2005); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number><em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc., </em>408 Mass. 355, 358 (1990). The hospital argues that the motion judge correctly dismissed the complaint because Leavitt cannot establish the first element, duty, as a matter of law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Whether a duty of care exists is a question of law, <em>Jupin </em>v. <em>Kask, supra, </em>and an appropriate subject of a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule 12 (b) (6). See <em>O\u2019Meara </em>v. <em>New England Life Flight, Inc., </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 543, 544 (2006) (affirming dismissal under rule 12 [b] [6] on ground that defendants owed no duty to plaintiff). See also <em>Remy </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>440 Mass. 675, 677 (2004) (\u201cIf no such duty exists, a claim of negligence cannot be brought\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Leavitt contends that a duty of care exists under any one of three theories: general negligence; a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d the hospital had with the patient and with Leavitt, respectively; and a voluntary assumption of a duty of care by the hospital to protect third parties from harm caused by \u201cimpaired\u201d patients. We reject each theory. Reduced to its essence, each rests on a proposition that a hospital or medical provider owes a duty of care to a nonpatient third party to detain a sedated patient in its care and to prevent such a patient from leaving the hospital without an escort.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Citing <em>Coombes </em>v. <em>Florio, </em>450 Mass. 182, 213-214 n.6 (2007) (Cordy, J., dissenting), Leavitt argues that the hospital\u2019s duty to him under the first two theories (general negligence and special relationship) rests on the \u201ccontrol\u201d it had over the patient before he left the hospital. The proposition is unpersuasive.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Absent a special relationship with a person posing a risk, there is no duty</p>\n<p id=\"AjvS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>to control another person\u2019s conduct to prevent that person from causing harm to a third party, and as we shall explain, there is no special relationship between the hospital and the patient that would give rise to such a duty in the circumstances of this case. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 315 (a) (1965).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See also Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical Harm \u00a7 41 (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, 2005).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consistent with that principle, this court has recognized a duty to control the conduct of another for the benefit of a third party in narrowly prescribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Jean W. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>414 Mass. 496, 513-514 (1993) (Liacos, C.J., concurring) (Department of Correction and parole board \u201cmay have been in a special relationship with [the released prisoner] because of their custody of and control over him\u201d). We have also recognized such a duty based, in part, on statutory responsibilities. See, e.g., <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, 392 </em>Mass. 745 (1984) (town liable to motorist injured by intoxicated driver whom police officer had permitted to drive on highway).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We have not previously recognized, and do not now recognize, a duty to a third person of a medical professional to control a patient (excluding a patient of a mental health professional, see note 10, supra) arising from any claimed special relationship between the medical professional and the patient.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In so deciding we are in accord with courts in other jurisdictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>that have addressed the question. See, e.g., <em>Hoehn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>217 F. Supp. 2d 39, 47, 48 (D. D.C. 2002) (where patient was \u201cvoluntary outpatient,\u201d hospital \u201chad no right or ability to control her\u201d and \u201cowed no duty to unidentified third parties to control [the patient] and prevent her from driving upon release\u201d); <em>Young </em>v. <em>Gastro-Intestinal Ctr., Inc., </em>361 Ark. 209, 214-216 (2005) (rejecting argument that medical center\u2019s policy, which required staff to ensure that no colonoscopy patient was sedated unless patient had another person to drive patient from hospital, imposed duty to control patient and restrict her ability to leave medical center); <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Quesenberry, </em>144 Cal. App. 3d 888, 894 n.3 (1983) (rejecting theory of physician liability based on failure to control patient\u2019s conduct by permitting her to drive: such liability \u201ccertainly cannot be imposed\u201d in conventional doctor-patient relationship); <em>Shortnacy </em>v. <em>North Atlanta Internal Med., P.C., </em>252 Ga. App. 321, 325-326 (2001) (physician had no duty to third party to control patient under Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 315).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Hoehn </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 47 (fact that patient who decided to drive while medicated \u201cmay have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>created a dangerous situation\u201d does not \u201ccompel the conclusion that medicated patients in general are inherently dangerous\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The hospital owed no duty to Leavitt to control or detain the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The hospital also claims that it should not be held liable on a separate, independent ground: the injury to Leavitt was not \u201ccaused\u201d by any action on its part. We agree. Leavitt\u2019s injury was not \u201ccaused\u201d by the hospital because it falls outside the scope of foreseeable risk arising from any negligent conduct that would make the hospital\u2019s alleged misconduct tortious.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">As noted earlier, this case is here on the allowance of the hospital\u2019s motion to dismiss. Although causation is generally left to a jury to decide, <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Pine Manor College, </em>389 Mass. 47, 58 (1983), it may be determined as a question of law where there is no set of facts that could support a conclusion that the plaintiffs injuries were within the scope of liability. See <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>437 Mass. 312, 320, 322 (2002) (scope of liability [\u201cproximate cause\u201d] determined on motion to dismiss); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>Stamas </em>v. <em>Fanning, </em>345 Mass. 73, 76 (1962) (\u201cThere are situations where it can be said, as matter of law, that a cause is remote rather than proximate\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Poskus </em>v. <em>Lombardo\u2019s of Randolph, Inc., </em>423 Mass. 637, 638 (1996) (causation resolved on motion for summary judgment); <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>407 Mass. 640, 646 (1990) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The law does not impose liability for all harm factually caused by tortious conduct.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See Restatement (Third) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at special note on proximate cause, at 574. Liability for conduct obtains only where the conduct is both a cause in fact of the injury and where the resulting injury is within the scope of the foreseeable risk arising from the negligent conduct.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 29, at 575; <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 320 (plaintiff must show cause in fact and that injury was \u201cforeseeable result\u201d of conduct); <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., supra </em>(no causation where \u201charm which occurred was not within the scope of foreseeable risk to the victim\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>In <em>Poskus </em>v. <em>Lombardo\u2019s of Randolph, Inc., supra </em>at 640-641, this court rejected the argument that a nightclub that negligently permitted a customer\u2019s vehicle to be stolen was liable to a police officer who was injured during a subsequent chase involving the operator of the stolen vehicle. The court did so because \u201cthe reasonably foreseeable risk of harm to others created by [the nightclub\u2019s] negligence did not include harm caused when the thief resisted arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 640. We reach the same conclusion here: the harm that befell Leavitt \u2014 an injury from a collision not involving the patient \u2014\u25a0 arose not from the \u201csame general type of danger\u201d (harm to the patient or to those injured by the patient as a result of being released while medicated) that the hospital allegedly should have taken reasonable steps to avoid, but from \u201csome other danger\u201d (the collision between the police cruiser and another vehicle unrelated to the patient). See Restatement (Third) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 29, Reporters\u2019 Note to comment b, at 609 (proposed jury instructions). While a third party nonpatient directly injured by a medicated patient who drives an automobile from a hospital may be within the scope of foreseeable risk, a police officer injured in an accident in which the patient is not involved is outside that scope. Cf. <em>Whittaker </em>v. <em>Saraceno, </em>418 Mass. 196, 200 (1994) (landowner not liable for \u201crandom violent criminal conduct\u201d on landowner\u2019s property even though \u201cthe possibility of criminal conduct occurring is present in almost every aspect of daily life\u201d and, \u201c[i]n that sense the possibility of a violent attack is always able to be foreseen\u201d). A contrary conclusion would require \u201cinference upon inference.\u201d <em>Griffiths </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>425 Mass. 31, 35 (1997) (landlord\u2019s failure to act on suspicion of illegal drug activity on premises did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>make landlord liable for harm to police officer killed during raid on premises). See Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 29 comment d, at 579-580 (\u201cscope of liability\u201d serves to avoid \u201cwhat might be unjustified or enormous liability by confining liability\u2019s scope to the reasons for holding the actor liable in the first place\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Leavitt also argues that the hospital is liable under the \u201crescue\u201d doctrine, quoting Judge Cardozo: \u201cDanger invites rescue.\u201d <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>International Ry. Co., </em>232 N.Y. 176, 180 (1921). Massachusetts has recognized the rescue doctrine, albeit in circumstances very different from those presented here. <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 600, 602-612 (2000) (police officer who responded to call for assistance injured after arriving at scene and attempting to assist another officer). However, not all injuries to rescuers are within the scope of foreseeable risk: liability does not attach for injuries suffered as a result of \u201crisks that would not be anticipated to arise from the rescue.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 32 comment c, at 653. Leavitt cites no authority to support his claim that a collision between a police cruiser and a vehicle unrelated to the accident to which the officer in the cruiser was responding is a risk that would be anticipated to arise from the rescue. We decline to extend the rescue doctrine to encompass such a risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b60-12\">The vehicle that struck Dean Leavitt\u2019s cruiser was not involved with the pedestrian-automobile accident to which Leavitt was responding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b60-13\">The complaint does not allege that the patient was impaired by any medications when he left the hospital or when he was hit by the vehicle while walking home, although that is implicit in the relief Leavitt seeks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b60-14\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs filed by the Massachusetts Academy of Trial Attorneys in support of Leavitt, and by the Massachusetts Defense Lawyers Association and the Professional Liability Foundation, Ltd., in support of the hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b61-8\">After the judge had ruled on the hospital\u2019s motion to dismiss, we adopted as applicable to our civil rules the United States Supreme Court\u2019s revision of the standard for reviewing the adequacy of a complaint challenged by a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. R 12 (b) (6). See <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 635-636 (2008), quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007) (\u201cWhat is required at the pleading stage are factual \u2018allegations plausibly suggesting [not merely consistent with]\u2019 an entitlement to relief . . .\u201d). The hospital does not ask that we apply the new, \u201cstricter\u201d standard. See <em>Flomenbaum </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>451 Mass. 740, 751 n.12 (2008). The complaint would not survive the hospital\u2019s motion to dismiss under either standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Leavitt alleges that the individual defendants, Sullivan and Smith, \u201cnegligently and carelessly\u201d released the patient without an escort, violated hospital policy and a physician\u2019s orders in so doing, and failed to take \u201creasonable and appropriate steps\u201d to ensure that the patient was properly escorted when released. We do not regard as \u201ctrue\u201d legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations. <em>Schaer </em>v. <em>Brandeis Univ., </em>432 Mass. 474, 477-478 (2000), citing <em>Judge </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>160 F.3d 67, 77 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b62-8\">This is not a case of a physician or medical provider\u2019s failure to warn a patient.

As noted earlier, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>that case concerned a duty to warn the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>patient, as did the cases on which Justice Cordy relied. See <em>Hardee </em>v. <em>BioMedical Applications of S.C., Inc., </em>370 S.C. 511, 516 (2006); <em>Joy </em>v. <em>Eastern Me. Med. Ctr., </em>529 A.2d 1364, 1366 (Me. 1987). Cf. <em>Wilschinsky </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>108 N.M. 511, 515-516 (1989) (limiting duty to circumstances in which patient drives automobile from doctor\u2019s office). None recognizes any duty to detain a patient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 315 (1965) provides in pertinent part: \u201cThere is no duty so to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him from causing physical harm to another unless (a) a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person\u2019s conduct . . . .\u201d The special relationships between the actor and the third person that require the actor to control the conduct of the third person are stated in \u00a7\u00a7 316-319. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 315 comment c. Sections 316-318 set forth three specific relationships imposing such a duty \u2014 parent and dependent children, master and servant, and possessor of land or chattels and licensee \u2014 none of which is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Section 319, in turn, addresses the duty of those in charge of a person who has \u201c[d]angerous [propensities,\u201d and provides that, \u201c[o]ne who takes charge of a third person whom he knows or should know to be likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the third person to prevent him from doing such harm.\u201d Leavitt does not argue that \u00a7 319 applies in the circumstances of this case. In any event we agree with the reasoning of the court in <em>Hoehn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>217 F. Supp. 2d 39, 47 (D. D.C. 2002), that medicated patients do not have \u201cdangerous propensities\u201d simply because they are medicated, and that a medical facility does not \u201ctake charge\u201d of a patient undergoing a voluntary colonoscopy within the meaning of \u00a7 319.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical Harm \u00a7 41 (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, 2005), titled \u201cDuty to Third Persons Based on Special Relationship with Person Posing Risks,\u201d replaces \u00a7\u00a7 315(a), 316, 317, and 319 of the Restatement (Second), see note 9, <em>supra, </em>and enumerates four special relationships that give rise to a \u201cduty of reasonable care to third persons\u201d: \u201c(1) a parent with dependent children, (2) a custodian with those in its custody, (3) an employer with employees when the employment facilitates the employee\u2019s causing harm to third parties, and (4) a mental health professional with patients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 41 &amp; comment a, at 778, 779.

In the <em>Irwin </em>case, this court concluded that \u201cthere is a special relationship between a police officer who negligently fails to remove an intoxicated motorist from the highway, and a member of the public who suffers injury as a result of that failure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 762. This conclusion was based, in part, on the existence of \u201cstatutes requiring police officers to act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 759.

Any claimed duty to control a patient similarly cannot derive from any special relationship between physician and patient. See Restatement (Third) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 41, Reporters\u2019 Note to comment h, at 808-809 (\u201cSome courts have reasoned that because a physician does not have control over the patient, no special relationship exists. . . .

While comment h \u201caddresses that question\u201d and states that the absence of the physician-patient relationship from the enumerated list of relationships in this section \u201cdoes not mean that physicians have no affirmative duty to third parties,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 790, the Restatement ultimately \u201cleaves to further development the question of when physicians have a duty ... to protect third persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790-791.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Leavitt argues that this case is \u201csomewhat similar to a licensed commercial establishment that knowingly overserves an intoxicated person and then discharges [that person] onto the roadway where they cause plainly foreseeable carnage.\u201d The analogy is misplaced. In a negligence case against a tavern owner or bartender, liability is premised on a defendant\u2019s failure to refrain from serving liquor to an intoxicated patron in circumstances (a) in which the defendant should have known that the patron was intoxicated and (b) where the patron\u2019s subsequent operation of a motor vehicle was reasonably foreseeable. See, e.g., <em>Cimino </em>v. <em>Milford Keg, Inc., </em>385 Mass. 323, 331-332 &amp; n.9 (1982). Liability is not premised on a tavern owner or bartender\u2019s \u201cdischarg[ing]\u201d an intoxicated person \u201conto the roadway.\u201d See <em>O\u2019Gorman </em>v. <em>Antonio Rubinaccio &amp; Sons, </em>408 Mass. 758, 761-762 (1990) (bar owner who did not serve alcohol to already intoxicated patron had no right or duty to prevent intoxicated patron from driving patron\u2019s vehicle away from defendant\u2019s bar); <em>Shortnacy </em>v. <em>North Atlanta Internal Med., P.C., </em>252 Ga. App. 321, 327 (2001), quoting <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>State, </em>244 Ga. App. 871, 873 (2000) (law does not mandate \u201cprovider of alcoholic beverages must prevent an intoxicated person from driving\u201d); <em>McKeown </em>v. <em>Homoya, </em>209 Ill. App. 3d 959, 963 (1991) (\u201ca tavern has no duty to restrain a patron from driving away no matter how intoxicated that individual may be\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Leavitt cites to cases from other jurisdictions that, he argues, support his claim that a medical provider has a duty to third parties in circumstances similar to this case. None establishes that a hospital has a duty to third parties to restrain or prevent a patient from leaving the hospital. Some of the cases on which he relies concern a duty to warn a patient, see, e.g., <em>McKenzie </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>Hawai\u2019i Permanente Med. Group, Inc., </em>98 Haw. 296, 308 (2002); <em>Burroughs </em>v. <em>Magee, </em>118 S.W. 3d 323, 333 (Tenn. 2003), with some of those expressly distinguishing a duty to warn from a duty to control a patient, see <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Quesenberry, </em>144 Cal. App. 3d 888, 894 n.3 (1983) (rejecting theory that physicians were liable for failure to \u201ccontrol [patient\u2019s] conduct by permitting her to drive to and from\u201d hospital); <em>Gooden </em>v. <em>Tips, </em>651 S.W. 2d 364, 370 (Tex. Ct. App. 1983) (\u201cwe do not hold that a duty arose on the part of [the physician] to <em>control </em>the conduct of his patient\u201d; \u201c[w]e do not hold [the physician] had a duty to <em>prevent </em>[the patient] from driving, if she so desired\u201d [emphases in original]). Other cases involve allegations that a physician negligently diagnosed or treated a patient, an issue not raised here. See, e.g., <em>Cheeks </em>v. <em>Dorsey, </em>846 So. 2d 1169, 1173 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2003) (physician allegedly failed to verify whether patient was under influence of another drug before administering methadone).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Leavitt\u2019s de minimis argument as to the third theory \u2014 that the hospital voluntarily assumed a duty of care to nonpatient third parties \u2014 lacks merit. A similar argument was rejected in <em>Coombes </em>v. <em>Florio, </em>450 Mass. 182 (2007), and Leavitt provides no reason for us to revisit it. See <em>id. </em>at 187 (Ireland, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 200-201 &amp; n.5 (Greaney, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <em>id. </em>at 207 n.2 (Cordy, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b66-10\">See Restatement (Third) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 29 comment b, at 576: \u201cthe term \u2018proximate cause\u2019 is a poor one to describe limits on the scope of liability.

See <em>id. </em>at special note on proximate cause, at 574. Applying the risk standard requires consideration of \u201cthe risks that made the actor\u2019s conduct tortious\u201d and \u201cwhether the harm for which recovery is sought was a result of any of those risks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 29 comment d, at 579-580. As applied to this case, assuming the hospital had a duty to prevent the patient from leaving its premises, the risk standard would limit the hospital\u2019s liability to foreseeable harms created by the risk that made the conduct (release of the patient) negligent: the risk of harm to the patient, and to others injured by the patient as a result of the patient\u2019s medicated condition. Stated differently, the reason a hospital might be held liable to a third party for releasing a medicated patient is not to protect a police officer injured in an accident unrelated to the patient, but to prevent the patient from doing harm to himself or others. See <em>Palsgraf </em>v. <em>Long Island R.R., </em>248 N.Y. 339, 344 (1928) (\u201crisk imports relation; it is risk to another or to others within the range of apprehension\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Restatement (Third) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 29 comment j, at 594, provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>in relevant part: \u201cMany jurisdictions employ a \u2018foreseeability\u2019 test for proximate cause, and in negligence actions such a rule is essentially consistent with the standard [of risk] set forth in this Section.\u201d See note 19, <em>supra. </em>\u201cProperly understood, both the risk standard and a foreseeability test exclude liability for harms that were sufficiently unforeseeable at the time of the actor\u2019s tortious conduct that they were not among the risks \u2014 potential harms \u2014 that made the actor negligent. Negligence limits the requirement of reasonable care to those risks that are foreseeable. . . . Thus, when scope of liability arises in a negligence case, the risks that make an actor negligent are limited to foreseeable ones, <em>and </em>the factfinder must determine whether the type of harm that occurred is among those reasonably foreseeable potential harms that made the actor\u2019s conduct negligent\u201d (emphasis added).
