The defendant argues further that the prosecutor impermissibly vouched for witnesses during her closing argument. For all these reasons, the defendant requests that we reverse the judgment and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">We conclude that the first complaint doctrine, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 242-243 (2005), cert, denied, 546 U.S. 1216 (2006) <em>(King), </em>permits testimony from two first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>complaint witnesses in circumstances such as those here, where each witness testifies to disclosures made years apart concerning different periods of time and escalating levels of abuse, which constitute different and more serious criminal acts committed over a lengthy period. In addition, the other multiple witness complaint testimony to which the defendant objects was properly admitted, not as first complaint testimony, but rather in response to cross-examination by the defendant and contentions raised in his defense. We conclude further that the defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements were not protected by the priest-penitent privilege because they were not made in the course of seeking spiritual comfort or guidance. We determine also that there was no vouching in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. We therefore affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><em>Background and proceedings. </em>We recount the facts from evidence at trial, reserving specific details for later discussion. The defendant began sexually abusing his older daughter, Rachel, when she was in sixth grade, and his younger daughter, Patricia, when she was in third grade. The assaults continued throughout the girls\u2019 high school years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The assaults against Rachel escalated from sexualized touching to digital penetration when Rachel was in junior high school to penile penetration when she was in ninth grade. The incidents became less frequent in Rachel\u2019s later high school years; she sought to avoid being around her father. Later, Rachel did not return home from college on weekends. The last incident occurred when Rachel was home for Thanksgiving break during her freshman year at college. When the defendant attempted to touch Rachel, she refused and threatened to call the police. The defendant became angry, showed Rachel a nine millimeter handgun, and said, \u201cI could kill you if you ever open your mouth.\u201d Although the defendant did not touch Rachel after this incident, she continued to fear for her safety and for that of her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The assaults against Patricia followed a similar pattern of escalation while Patricia was in elementary and junior high school, and became less frequent during her high school years as well.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Patricia often stayed away from home during junior high and high school; when the defendant attempted to assault her, she at times told him not to touch her or put out her hand to stop him. On one occasion when Patricia was sixteen or seventeen, the defendant grabbed her by the throat, pinning her against a wall, because she did not respond quickly enough when he called her. The defendant also attempted sexual assaults on Patricia on her visits home from college, but she fended off his attempts.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Rachel first disclosed the abuse to her mother, Solange, when she was in seventh or eighth grade.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After Rachel told Solange that the defendant had been touching her inappropriately, Solange confronted the defendant, who responded by yelling at Solange. A few days later, the defendant told Rachel that she should not have disclosed the abuse to her mother, that nothing would come between him and his wife, and that, in any case, no one would believe Rachel. There was no further discussion of the abuse until Rachel disclosed to Azanda Seymour, an academic advisor at her college, that she did not want to go home because her father was molesting her. Seymour referred Rachel to the school\u2019s counselling center, and also attended a counselling meeting with Rachel.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">When Patricia was a senior in high school, she disclosed the abuse to Ralph Massillon (\u201cPastor Ralph\u201d), one of the pastors at her church. Patricia told Pastor Ralph that she had not disclosed the abuse previously because she did not think that anyone would believe her and because the defendant had threatened her if she did so. Pastor Ralph suggested alternative actions that Patricia could take, including contacting the police or confronting her father, but Patricia decided that the best option would be to leave home to attend college. However, after a long weekend home from college in February, 2002, Patricia informed Pastor Ralph that she wanted to confront the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>A family meeting was held at the church in February, 2002. The defendant\u2019s two daughters, their mother, Pastor Ralph, two other pastors, and the defendant attended the meeting. During the meeting, the defendant made inculpatory statements to Pastor Ralph and the other pastors. The defendant apologized to his daughters for \u201cwhat he did\u201d and asked for forgiveness.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The meeting ended without agreement concerning any future action.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Several weeks after the meeting, Solange informed her son James of what had occurred at the meeting. With Solange present, James confronted the defendant, who stated, without specifying further, that he had done inappropriate things to Rachel, but denied harming Patricia. The defendant was upset and crying during this encounter, and said to James, \u201cWhat do you want me to do? Do you want me to kill myself?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The defendant was asked to leave the family home. He initially agreed to do so, but then refused to move. He became angry and verbally abusive. Eventually, in September of 2002, Rachel and Solange went to the Lynn police department. At the suggestion of the detective who conducted the interview, Rachel and Solange obtained a restraining order against the defendant. The defendant was arrested a few days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Prior to trial, asserting that his statements at the church meeting were protected by the priest-penitent privilege, the defendant moved to suppress these statements. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial judge denied the motion. The defendant sought relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. A single justice of this court denied the defendant\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The decision in <em>King, supra, </em>which replaced the fresh complaint doctrine with the first complaint doctrine, was decided a few weeks before the trial in this case. <em>King </em>provided that its changes would apply to sexual assault cases tried after the issuance of the rescript in that case. See <em>id. </em>at 218, 248. The re-script issued during the present trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">At the beginning of the trial, the Commonwealth filed motions in limine to allow testimony from multiple first complaint witnesses. The trial judge ruled that one first complaint witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Pastor Ralph, could testify as to the abuse of Patricia and two first complaint witnesses, Solange and Seymour, could testify concerning the abuse of Rachel. The defendant did not object to the first complaint witness for Patricia, but did object to the two first complaint witnesses for Rachel. The judge instructed the jury on first complaint witnesses pursuant to <em>King, supra </em>at 247-248.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The jury convicted the defendant of eight of the nine charges for which he had been indicted; the defendant was found not guilty of incest. This appeal ensued. We transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>First complaint testimony, </em>a. <em>Multiple first complaint witnesses. </em>The defendant claims that the judge should not have permitted testimony of two first complaint witnesses regarding Rachel\u2019s complaint. He argues here, as he did at trial, that this violated the first complaint doctrine set forth in <em>King, supra </em>at 242-243. That doctrine permits only one witness to testify to a complainant\u2019s report of an alleged assault. That witness, who ordinarily will be the first person to whom the alleged victim disclosed the assault, may testify to \u201cthe details of the alleged victim\u2019s first complaint of sexual assault [including the victim\u2019s statement of the facts of the assault] and the circumstances surrounding that first complaint as part of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243. The complainant may also testify to the details of the first complaint and why the complaint was made at that time. <em>Id. </em>at 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The first complaint doctrine was designed to help counterbalance the continuing inaccurate assumptions about delayed reporting by victims of sexual assaults, which may lead juries to view skeptically statements by rape victims if the assault is not reported contemporaneously. <em>Id. </em>at 240-241. Allowing only one first complaint witness to testify addresses this concern while avoiding the prejudice to the defendant that could result from a \u201cpiling on\u201d of multiple witnesses\u2019 testimony that might unfairly bolster the complainant\u2019s credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 245. In certain circumstances, such as when the first person told of the alleged assault is \u201cunavailable, incompetent, or too young to testify meaningfully,\u201d the trial judge may admit testimony from a substitute first complaint witness. <em>Id. </em>at 243-244.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>As stated, the hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s motions concerning the first complaint witnesses was conducted immediately after our decision in <em>King, supra. </em>The first complaint rule set forth in <em>King </em>became effective as of October 27, 2005, prior to the judge\u2019s charge to the jury. The judge\u2019s decision on the motions was based on his thoughtful and well-reasoned interpretation of that decision. He allowed both Rachel\u2019s mother, Solange, and her academic advisor, Seymour, to testify as first complaint witnesses for Rachel because he concluded that Rachel\u2019s statements to Seymour were made in respect to different and escalating incidents of abuse, and that there would be no \u201coverlapping incidents.\u201d The judge reasoned that our holding in the <em>King </em>case could not have been intended to exclude first complaint testimony about a rape that occurred after disclosure of a lesser offense to an earlier witness. He determined, therefore, that Solange could testify to the disclosure of events from the beginning of the abuse until Rachel was thirteen or fourteen years old and that Seymour could testify to the disclosure of later incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The defendant contends that Seymour should not have been allowed to testify at all since <em>King </em>permits only one first complaint witness and Solange was the proper first complaint witness in this case. The defendant asserts that Seymour\u2019s testimony was unnecessary \u201cpiling on\u201d and unduly prejudicial because it unfairly bolstered Rachel\u2019s credibility in the manner that <em>King </em>sought to avoid. The defendant argues that the judge misinterpreted our holding in <em>King, </em>and that each incident could not be treated as a separate incident to which a new first complaint witness may testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In addition, the defendant maintains that, even if testimony from two first complaint witnesses is permissible in certain circumstances, those circumstances were not present here. The defendant argues that the judge misconstrued the testimony given by the two first complaint witnesses because their testimony did not describe different incidents. The defendant claims that Rachel\u2019s disclosure to Seymour did not indicate that the defendant\u2019s acts escalated over time, but rather essentially repeated the disclosure about inappropriate \u201ctouching\u201d that she made to Solange. Alternatively, the defendant argues, if Solange\u2019s testimony was likely to be inaccurate or incomplete because of a conflict of interest, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>if Seymour\u2019s testimony was required to show escalation, then Seymour alone should have been permitted to testify as the first complaint witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murungu, </em>450 Mass. 441, 446 (2008) (exception to first complaint witness limitation where first complaint witness has obvious bias or reason to minimize or distort victim\u2019s complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">There was no error in the judge\u2019s decision to permit both Solange and Seymour to testify. As the judge observed, the circumstances in <em>King </em>were quite different from those in this case because they involved multiple witnesses testifying to reports of a single assault. Our discussion of the first complaint doctrine in that case, therefore, arose in the context of a single assault. See <em>King, supra </em>at 218-220, 235, 242-244. Here, however, the disclosures involved multiple and increasingly more serious assaults during a lengthy period. The two disclosures were made separately, one toward the beginning and the other at the end of this period, and they concerned significantly different types of assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">As stated, Rachel\u2019s first disclosure to her mother, when she was in seventh or eighth grade (1988-1990), was made after years of sexual abuse involving genital touching that began when Rachel was in the sixth grade (1987-1988). The abuse later escalated to digital penetration, and, ultimately, to sexual intercourse when Rachel was in the ninth grade (1990-1991). The instances of rape continued for a period of years. Rachel\u2019s second disclosure, after the rapes had occurred, was made to her college advisor (1994). The defendant was charged separately with different offenses arising out of the different circumstances; he was indicted on charges of indecent assault and battery for the earlier occurrences and rape and incest for the later events. The judge relied properly on both the different time frames and the escalating nature of the abuse in determining that two first complaint witnesses could testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">To deprive the Commonwealth of the ability to introduce the first complaint testimony from Seymour, the college advisor, which concerned a separate and more serious crime, would have defeated the purpose underlying the first complaint doctrine. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murungu, supra </em>at 446 (first complaint doctrine counteracts frequent perception that years of silence following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>sexual assault means that complainant may have fabricated claim). In the circumstances of this case, if the jury had heard that Rachel complained to her mother of the defendant\u2019s touching her \u201cwhere he should not,\u201d but then heard no evidence that, as an older teenager, Rachel had disclosed the subsequent events, the jury might have concluded that the rapes were a fabrication. Allowing only Seymour to testify, however, would also have been unfair; the jury could have questioned Rachel\u2019s credibility for enduring the abuse for years without any complaint.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">In an effort to avoid any \u201cpiling on\u201d of testimony by Seymour concerning incidents described in Rachel\u2019s disclosure to her mother, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass. 449, 451 (2008), the judge repeatedly instructed the prosecutor, both prior to and during the trial, that each first complaint witness could testify only to events within carefully delineated time frames. The judge provided proper limiting instructions on the use of first complaint testimony after Rachel\u2019s testimony about her disclosures, after each first complaint witness\u2019s testimony, and again during his jury charge. See <em>King, supra </em>at 247-248.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The defendant contends further that it is irrelevant that the two disclosures involved escalating abuse because Rachel did not refer to the rape in describing her statement to Seymour. This issue arose because at trial Rachel testified, inconsistently with the characterization proffered by the prosecutor during the hearing, that she made only the same vague, general disclosure to both witnesses. She testified that she disclosed inappropriate \u201ctouching\u201d to her mother and that she told Seymour that the defendant \u201cmolested\u201d her.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Nonetheless, at the hearing on the motion in limine, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>prosecutor described with specificity the different acts encompassed by each disclosure and the time period in which those acts occurred. The judge properly determined to admit both first complaint witnesses based on the prosecutor\u2019s proffer of evidence of different types of escalating assaults during different time periods. Although the defendant objected to the judge\u2019s initial determination to permit both first complaint witnesses, he did not object at the time of Rachel\u2019s trial testimony describing her second disclosure, nor did he object when Seymour testified.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whelton, </em>428 Mass. 24, 25 (1998) (motion in limine seeking pretrial evidentiary ruling insufficient to preserve appellate rights unless there is objection at trial). Moreover, nothing in the record suggests, nor does the defendant imply, that the prosecutor had any basis prior to trial to believe that Rachel would testify that she had complained only of \u201cmolestation\u201d to Seymour. Given the circumstances here, the judge\u2019s determination to admit the testimony of both first complaint witnesses was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We emphasize that the Commonwealth may not introduce a \u201cparade of multiple complaint witnesses\u201d in a case involving repeated instances of abuse by a single defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, supra </em>at 457, n.11. We state only that, in the circumstances here, where there was both ongoing abuse over a period of many years and escalating abuse during that period, with disclosures at two widely separated intervals, the judge\u2019s decision to allow two first complaint witnesses was appropriate. Any determination concerning first complaint testimony is fact-specific and requires, in the first analysis, a careful evaluation of the circumstances by the trial judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murungu, supra </em>at 446-447. Judges and attorneys are apprised, however, to be cautious in ensuring that, if more than one first complaint witness is allowed, the complaint testimony introduced at trial must relate to different crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>b. <em>\u201cBack door\u201dfirst complaint testimony. </em>The defendant contends also that other witness testimony was improperly admitted essentially as multiple first complaint testimony. First, the defendant asserts that portions of Seymour\u2019s testimony concerning Seymour\u2019s interactions with third parties should not have been allowed. Seymour testified that, following Rachel\u2019s disclosure, she consulted with her director concerning the best course of action. The director told Seymour to refer Rachel to the campus counselling center; Seymour did so and then brought Rachel to the center for a counselling session.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In addition, Seymour spoke with the Department of Children and Families, then known as the Department of Social Services (DSS). The defendant claims that each of these pieces of evidence unfairly bolstered Rachel\u2019s credibility by suggesting that Seymour and the director found Rachel\u2019s allegations believable. Since the defendant did not object to Seymour\u2019s testimony about her reports to third parties,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we consider whether the testimony was properly admitted and, if not, whether the testimony created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 17 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The theory of the defense was that Rachel and Patricia had fabricated or embellished their claims of sexual abuse because they resented the defendant\u2019s harsh upbringing and strict disciplinary techniques (including beatings), his extramarital affairs .and out-of-wedlock children, his failure to work while his wife worked two jobs, and also because they wanted him to move out of the house. Therefore, much of the defendant\u2019s cross-examination was directed at questioning the victims\u2019 credibility and emphasizing any discrepancies in their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Seymour\u2019s testimony concerning speaking with her director and her testimony about attending the counselling session with Rachel was introduced in response to cross-examination by the defendant. Rachel had testified differently at trial about the sequence of events surrounding her disclosure to Seymour than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>she had in statements contained in a Lynn police report. Rachel\u2019s disclosure to the Lynn police matched the sequence of events that Seymour described at trial, but did not coincide with Rachel\u2019s trial testimony. The defendant sought to exploit these differences as part of his strategy to discredit Rachel and Patricia\u2019s testimony. Because Seymour\u2019s testimony was introduced to rebut questions raised by the defendant, it was not first complaint testimony and was therefore properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Concerning Seymour\u2019s testimony about her conversation with DSS, the Commonwealth appropriately conceded at oral argument that the testimony was inadmissible. Admission of this evidence did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 17 (1999). Seymour\u2019s brief mention that she called DSS only for purposes of obtaining information, because she was a relatively new counsel-lor and wanted to follow proper procedures, could have had slight, if any, effect on the outcome. Unlike the testimony at issue in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, supra </em>at 456, where the guidance counsellor testified that she believed the complainant and immediately filed a report of abuse with DSS, Seymour\u2019s testimony did not create a strong impression that Seymour found Rachel\u2019s complaint to be credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Next, the defendant contends that Rachel\u2019s statements about speaking to the Lynn police and obtaining a restraining order should not have been allowed because they unfairly repeated her story and buttressed her credibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuck-ich, supra </em>at 457 (allowing victim to testify to multiple complaints is essentially permitting those other witnesses to testify). The defendant cross-examined Rachel in an attempt to discredit her testimony by showing that she fabricated detailed allegations of abuse in order to obtain a restraining order.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The statements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>which the defendant complains were introduced on redirect examination in response to the defendant\u2019s extensive cross-examination, and were therefore permissible. Once the defendant opened the door on cross-examination, the Commonwealth was entitled to attempt to rehabilitate the witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Mendes, 441 Mass. 459, 469-470 (2004) (prosecutor entitled to rehabilitate witness and witness may properly explain on redirect examination testimony elicited on cross-examination).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In addition, the defendant argues that Christine Sporanza-Petrasella, the detective who first interviewed Rachel and who assisted Rachel in obtaining the restraining order, should not have been permitted to testify. Although there was no objection to her testimony at trial, the defendant asserts that the detective\u2019s testimony about her interview with Rachel was further piling on of first complaint testimony that should have been excluded. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass. 214, 229 (2009). The testimony was properly admitted. As the judge commented when Rachel initially testified about her conversation with the detective, this testimony was allowed not as first complaint testimony but in response to the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Rachel about Rachel\u2019s attempts to obtain a restraining order.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See M.S. Brodin &amp; M. Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 6.19, 6.23-6.24 at 368, 374-376 (8th ed. 2007). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 390, 394-395 (2006) (where defendant has raised issue of witness\u2019s credibility, evidence relevant to correcting jury\u2019s possibly mistaken conclusions about witness\u2019s state of mind based on defendant\u2019s questions is admissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Finally, the defendant contends that Rachel should not have been allowed to testify, in her description of the meeting at the church in February, 2002, that she there disclosed to her mother for the first time details of the defendant\u2019s abuse. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>claims also that Rachel\u2019s statement that she described at the meeting \u201ceverything\u201d that she had testified to in court concerning the defendant\u2019s actions, including sexual intercourse, should have been excluded. The defendant asserts that this testimony was equivalent to having all of the attendees at the meeting testify and repeat Rachel\u2019s account of the events. There was no error. This testimony was not offered as first complaint testimony, but rather to provide context for the defendant\u2019s admissions at the meeting and his statement that the things that Rachel had been describing did occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">c. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant\u2019s claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Rachel\u2019s testimony about the circumstances of seeking the restraining order is also unavailing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As discussed, <em>supra, </em>it was defense counsel, during cross-examination, and not the prosecutor, who introduced the evidence that Rachel had sought a restraining order because of a sexual assault. To the extent that the defendant implies that his counsel was ineffective for pursuing such questions, his claim fails. The questions were part of counsel\u2019s obvious strategy to discredit both Rachel and Patricia by asserting that their hatred and fear of the defendant induced them to fabricate their claims of sexual abuse as a means of revenge for his earlier harsh discipline, extramarital affairs, out-of-wedlock children, and failure to provide for the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Given the absence of physical evidence, this case turned on the daughters\u2019 credibility. Thus, attacking the daughters\u2019 credibility was not a manifestly unreasonable trial strategy, even where this strategy ultimately resulted in the admission of some evidence that the jury might otherwise not have heard. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>448 Mass. 286, 288 (2007) (when attorney\u2019s conduct represents strategic or tactical decision, defendant must demonstrate that attorney\u2019s decision was \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d when made). As the judge commented during the precharge conference, the defendant deliberately chose to introduce much prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>bad act evidence that could have been properly excluded, without requesting limiting instructions, as part of his trial strategy to show that members of his family desired revenge and thus lied about the sexual assault charges. Counsel was not ineffective for pursuing such a strategy in the face of powerful evidence against the defendant that included the defendant\u2019s confessions to three different witnesses in addition to his daughters\u2019 testimony concerning his apology.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">2. <em>Priest-penitent privilege. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred in denying his motion to suppress his inculpatory statements made at the family meeting at the Haitian Baptist Church in February, 2002, because the statements were made in the course of seeking spiritual guidance and counselling from pastors of that congregation. Pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20A,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">\u201cA priest, rabbi or ordained or licensed minister of any church or an accredited Christian Science practitioner shall not . . . testify as to any communication made to him by any person in seeking religious or spiritual advice or comfort, or as to his advice given thereon in the course of his professional duties or in his professional character, without the consent of such person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Although the testimonial privilege conferred by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20A, is strictly construed, see <em>Matter of a Grand Jury Subpoena, </em>447 Mass. 88, 90 (2006), the limits of what constitutes \u201cseeking religious or spiritual advice or comfort\u201d have not been defined to any great extent in our cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Here, the trial judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress inculpatory statements during the family meeting because he concluded that the defendant\u2019s statements were not made in the process of seeking \u201cspiritual advice or comfort,\u201d and were not \u201cmotivated by a religious or spiritual purpose.\u201d See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20A. Based on this conclusion, the judge stated that he need not reach the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that any privilege was waived due to the presence of the defendant\u2019s daughters when some of the statements were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">We set forth facts derived from the judge\u2019s findings based on the evidence at the hearing on the motion to suppress, supplemented by uncontested evidence. The meeting was held in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>classroom at the Haitian Baptist Church in Lynn. Patricia, Rachel, and Solange regularly attended services at this church. The defendant was not a member of the church and attended church services only a few times each year. The meeting was held at Patricia\u2019s request so that she could confront her father in a location Patricia believed would be safer than confronting the defendant in his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">At the beginning of the meeting, Pastor Ralph announced \u201crules\u201d for the meeting, including that any discussion at the meeting would remain confidential. The meeting became heated at times, and the defendant denied his daughters\u2019 descriptions of abuse. The defendant said that he did not think the meeting was the proper place to have such a discussion and that any discussion should take place in the family home. When the defendant attempted to leave the meeting, one of the pastors advised the defendant that he could leave if he chose to do so, but that the meeting would continue in his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">During the first of two breaks when, at Pastor Ralph\u2019s suggestion, Rachel and Patricia left the room to calm down, the defendant stated that \u201csomething\u201d inappropriate had happened with Rachel. He also admitted that some of the events Patricia had reported did happen, but claimed that others had not happened. During the second break, the defendant asked Pastor Ralph what he should do to \u201cmake things better.\u201d Pastor Ralph told the defendant that he should examine his conscience, and that the response should come from the defendant, not from Pastor Ralph. When the defendant\u2019s daughters returned to the room, Pastor Ralph told them that the defendant had something to say to them, and the defendant apologized and asked for forgiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The defendant asserts first that the entire meeting, conducted at the church, led by Pastor Ralph and facilitated by the other two pastors, was held in the context of family counselling for the purpose of \u201creconciliation and forgiveness,\u201d was conducted as part of the pastors\u2019 pastoral duties, and therefore was a privileged communication between the pastors and the family as a unit. The defendant argues in addition that, even if he did not originally attend the meeting seeking spiritual support and guidance, the character of his interactions with the pastors changed when he asked Pastor Ralph what he should do to make the situation better.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. He found permissibly that the nature of the defendant\u2019s participation in the meeting was not \u201cfor the purpose of seeking spiritual advice or comfort,\u201d but rather to avoid what the judge characterized as the \u201ctrain going right at [the defendant\u2019s] forehead.\u201d Whether the defendant\u2019s communications at the meeting are protected under the terms of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20A, is a question of law. Part of this analysis, however, involves factual determinations concerning the defendant\u2019s intent in attending the meeting, and his later intent in asking what he should do to \u201cmake things better.\u201d Such factual determinations are for the trial judge. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Milton Hosp. &amp; Med Ctr., Inc., </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 495,498-499 (2002) (existence of claimed privilege depends on facts found by trial judge). The evidence clearly supports the judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant did not attend the meeting for a spiritual or religious purpose, but rather attended at the urging of his wife and his wife\u2019s pastor to discuss a \u201cfamily issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">That the defendant was not a member of the church, and did not attend services regularly, is not dispositive, since the statute plainly applies to \u201cany person . . . seeking religious or spiritual advice.\u201d See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20A. Nonetheless, the defendant\u2019s prior sporadic contact with the pastors and lack of regular attendance at church services is relevant to his purpose in attending the family meeting. The defendant\u2019s angry demeanor and denials of the allegations, as well as his repeated statements that he wanted to leave the meeting, further support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">There was also no error in the judge\u2019s finding that the meeting did not change to one in which the defendant was seeking spiritual comfort or guidance during the second break. The defendant\u2019s question to Pastor Ralph about what he should do to make it \u201cbetter,\u201d and Pastor Ralph\u2019s suggestion that the defendant follow his \u201cconscience,\u201d are not inconsistent with the judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was seeking pragmatic advice rather than spiritual guidance.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">3. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>a new trial is required because the prosecutor vouched for the credibility of a number of witnesses during her closing argument. \u201cVouching\u201d occurs when a prosecutor expresses his or her own belief in the credibility of witnesses or implies that he or she has knowledge independent of the evidence presented at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>451 Mass. 290, 296-297 (2008). Because the defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument at trial, we review to determine whether the statements were improper and, if so, whether they created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Renderos, </em>440 Mass. 422, 425 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In support of his claim of vouching, the defendant points to three statements by the prosecutor. First, the prosecutor stated, \u201cYou have to believe that Solange, [Patricia] and [Rachel] as well as James, [Pastor Ralph] and [Seymour] are all outright liars who have conspired against the defendant to bring this case against him.\u201d Later, in reference to both Rachel\u2019s and Patricia\u2019s eventual decision to go to the police, the prosecutor remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s not the act of a calculated manipulative liar acting out of revenge. It\u2019s the action of a person who is also the victim and a casualty of his victimization.\u201d Towards the end of her closing argument, in reviewing the witness testimony beyond that of the defendant\u2019s two daughters, the prosecutor said, \u201cThose people[\u2019]s corroboration are your moral certainty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">As stated, there was no objection to these statements and no request for curative instructions. See <em>id. </em>at 426 n.3. In any event, the prosecutor\u2019s statements do not constitute vouching. The prosecutor was entitled, as she did here, to argue strenuously from the evidence that the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses were credible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>425 Mass. 223, 232-233 (1997). Nothing in the prosecutor\u2019s remarks indicated that she had personal knowledge of the witnesses\u2019 credibility or any independent knowledge of evidence not before the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanders, supra </em>at 297; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 265 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s statements that the jury should find the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses credible were made in the context of the defendant\u2019s vehement attack on those witnesses\u2019 credibility during his own closing argument. As stated, the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>revolved entirely around the credibility of the witnesses. Not only did the defendant\u2019s counsel assert in closing that each of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses had motives to lie and had, as a group, decided to do so, defense counsel made particular and extensive statements concerning Rachel\u2019s and Solange\u2019s lack of credibility. Counsel stated repeatedly that Solange was a liar and had \u201clie[d]\u201d when she took the oath \u201cto God Almighty\u201d to tell the truth during her testimony. Counsel also argued that Rachel \u201ctwisted,\u201d \u201cturned,\u201d and \u201csp[un]\u201d events in an effort to benefit herself. The prosecutor was entitled to respond to these statements with a forceful argument, based on the evidence and the jury\u2019s common sense understanding of the events, that the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses were telling the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-13\">The defendant was acquitted of a charge of incest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b310-14\">We refer to the victims by the names used by the parties.

Rachel testified that she told Seymour she did not want to go home; Seymour then brought her to the counselling center; and Rachel then disclosed to Seymour for the first time, during a counselling session, that the abuse had occurred. There was no objection to this statement at trial. Because Rachel testified that her disclosure to Seymour was not made until the counselling session, the statement was necessary as part of the context in which Rachel made that disclosure. In addition, the statement, unaccompanied by details, did not imply that Seymour believed Rachel or that she took any action as a result of the disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\">It may well be, as a sidebar discussion indicates, that discussion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>second disclosure was deliberately vague in an effort by all parties to avoid an issue concerning another potential victim-witness to whom Rachel also made a disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\">A second witness, to whom Rachel had made a detailed disclosure of incidents of rape while she was in high school, had been expected to testify about Rachel\u2019s disclosure. That witness, however, became unavailable during trial and Seymour testified as a substitute complaint witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The sequence of events surrounding the disclosure that Seymour described differed from the sequence of events that Rachel described; as stated, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>Rachel testified that she first made the disclosure to Seymour at the counselling session.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The defendant objected only when Seymour began to recount what she had been told by the DSS representative; the judge properly sustained that objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The defendant claims in addition that Patricia\u2019s testimony that she went to the Lynn police to obtain a restraining order should not have been allowed. When the prosecutor initially asked Patricia whether she, too, reported the abuse to the Lynn police, the judge, sua sponte, ordered that line of questioning stopped and the testimony struck, despite defense counsel\u2019s failure to object. Nonetheless, when the prosecutor subsequently asked Patricia, after Patricia\u2019s testimony concerning the meeting at the church, whether she at some point went to the Lynn police, the defendant again did not object. Patricia replied, without further details, that she did so for the purpose of obtaining a restraining order. While this testimony was impermissible, there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comtois, </em>399 Mass. 668, 674 (1987). The jury had already heard graphic details concerning Rachel\u2019s efforts to obtain a restraining order during the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Rachel. That Patricia also sought a restraining order would have had little effect, if any, on the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The defendant asserts also that the detective\u2019s testimony that, based on Rachel\u2019s statements, she sought a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest, was impermissible. There was no error. This testimony was elicited by the defendant in an attempt to show that the detective conducted a hasty and shoddy investigation before seeking a warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\">In analyzing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we review the claim to determine whether trial counsel\u2019s actions fell \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary, fallible attorney \u2014 and, if that is found, then, typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Because the defendant\u2019s statements were not made in the course of seeking spiritual guidance or support, we need not address whether any privilege was waived by the presence of third parties not covered by the statute.
