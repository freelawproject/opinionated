In her complaint, Ms. Pharr alleged, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Walker has continuously stalked me at my job, home in VA, &amp; NC. On the late evening of 4/8 Mr. Walker strangled me by placing his hands over my neck. He sat outside my home. After being arrested in another state, and a emergency protective order was served and it stated no to come to my job in NC he did any way and sat in his car across the street. He stuck [illegible] his middle finger &amp; used profanite. He was charged with (M) stalking. Then after [illegible] violate conditions\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 7 April 2016, Mr. Walker filed a \"Complaint and Motion for Domestic Violence Protective Order\" against Ms. Pharr. In his complaint, Mr. Walker alleged as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [Ms. Pharr] harass me all the time text messages phone calls, voicemails, threats left on my voicemail even text messages ... Change my number she found it some how and still harass me even told me she gone Punch me run off the Road\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 7 April 2016, the trial court entered an order refusing to issue an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   DVPO in favor of Mr. Walker, concluding that he \"failed to prove grounds for ex parte relief.\" On 15 April 2016, an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   DVPO was issued in favor of Ms. Pharr, stating that on 8 April 2016 \"[Mr. Walker] attempted to strangle [Ms. Pharr] after waiting at her home and calling [sic] threatening to assault her; [Mr. Walker] got arrested in Court on 4/14/16 for stalking [Ms. Pharr], and bonded out and went to [Ms. Pharr's] job saying 'what's up b[***]h' violating his release conditions[.]\" The\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order required Mr. Walker to stay 100 yards away from Ms. Pharr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Both parties' motions were consolidated for hearing on 25 April 2016 before the Honorable Jefferson Griffin in Wake County District Court. At the hearing, Mr. Walker was represented by counsel while Ms. Pharr appeared\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . Both Mr. Walker and Ms. Pharr testified at the hearing. At the close of the hearing, the trial court stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   All right. In 16 CVD 4089, plaintiff, Sterling Walker, defendant, Sierra Pharr, I'm going to grant a protective order. I'm going to order the defendant not assault, threaten, abuse, follow, harass or interfere with the plaintiff. The same applies to-well, the defendant shall not threaten members of the plaintiff's family or household.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant shall stay away from the plaintiff's residence or any place where the plaintiff receives temporary shelter. Defendant shall stay away from where the plaintiff works. Defendant shall stay at least one hundred yards away from the plaintiff at all times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant is prohibited from possessing, receiving, or purchasing a firearm for the period of this order. If you have a concealed handgun permit, it's suspended. If you have any firearms, ammunition or gun permits, they need to be turned over to the sheriff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   This will be a year-long, no-contact order. There should be no contact between the parties, direct or indirect, except through an attorney. That's anything. No contact. You have no children. You don't live together. There should be no contact whatsoever between you all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   All right. Again, that will be valid until April 25th, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   In 16 CVD 04872, I'm going to find that the plaintiff has failed to prove grounds for issuance of a domestic violence protective order. That's the plaintiff, Sierra Pharr, defendant, Sterling Walker. The action is dismissed, and any\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order that had been issued is null and void.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   It sounds like y'all should have no contact through a bunch of different means. Sounds like there's criminal stuff pending, too. But that's the order of The Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The trial court made the following findings of fact on the DVPO form order in file number 16 CVD 4089:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [T]he defendant\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   placed in fear of continued harassment that rises to such a level as to inflict substantial emotional distress ... the plaintiff ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   by ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant continuously calls, texts, and drives by the work of Plaintiff. Plaintiff has threatened to have the Defendant arrested several times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Footnote added). Based on these findings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court made the following pertinent conclusion of law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1. The defendant has committed acts of domestic violence against the plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ms. Pharr filed a timely written notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal, Ms. Pharr primarily argues that no competent evidence supported the trial court's finding that Mr. Walker suffered \"substantial emotional distress\" as a result of Ms. Pharr's actions. \"When the trial court sits without a jury regarding a DVPO, the standard of review on appeal is whether there was competent evidence to support the trial court's findings of fact and whether its conclusions of law were proper in light of such facts. Where there is competent evidence to support the trial court's findings of fact, those findings are binding on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Hensey v.
