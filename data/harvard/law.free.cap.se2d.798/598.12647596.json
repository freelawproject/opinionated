County of Hanover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12644339\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/781/181/#p20\">\n    291 Va. 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12644339\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/781/181/#p20\">\n    781 S.E.2d 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185 (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 30, 2010, Manu was a passenger in a vehicle driven by Benjamin Boateng (Boateng) that was involved in a multi-vehicle automobile accident. Boateng had a personal auto insurance policy with a $25,000 limit. Manu was insured by GEICO Casualty Company (GEICO) under a personal auto insurance policy, which provided UM coverage with a $25,000 limit. On November 22, 2010, Manu notified GEICO of a potential UM claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Manu incurred $27,189.12 in medical bills and $6,375 in lost wages as a result of the accident. On October 19, 2012, Manu sued Boateng and John Doe in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County. Answers obtained in discovery from several drivers involved in the accident purportedly established that a John Doe driver was the cause of the accident. On September 19, 2013, Manu submitted this information to GEICO and advised GEICO of his intent to seek the $25,000 in UM coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   GEICO elected to defend John Doe. The trial against the defendants was scheduled for February 9, 2015. On January 30, 2015, Manu offered to settle the case for $12,500 from GEICO, and subsequently rejected GEICO's counter-offer of $5,000. One week\n   before the trial, Manu settled the lawsuit against Boateng for Boateng's liability policy limit of $25,000, and proceeded to trial solely against John Doe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the trial against John Doe, the circuit court ruled that John Doe was negligent as a matter of law and that his negligence was a proximate cause of the collision. The trial proceeded on damages, and while GEICO did call a medical expert to testify, the expert did not contest Manu's medical bills or injuries. The jury returned a verdict of $68,528.24 in favor of Manu, plus costs and prejudgment interest, and, on February 10, 2015, the court entered judgment against John Doe for that amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 14, 2015, Manu filed a complaint against GEICO. Manu alleged that pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1, GEICO was \"charged with the duty to evaluate, adjust, and settle [uninsured motorist] claims against it in 'good faith,' \" and, \"notwithstanding said duty, GEICO's failure to settle plaintiff's claim within the $25,000 policy limit after plaintiff's January 30, 2015 demand violated Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1,\" and constituted a breach of GEICO's duty to act in good faith. Manu sought judgment against GEICO in the amount of $18,528, \"representing the amount of the unpaid compensation damages awarded by the jury,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   plus unpaid prejudgment interest, reasonable attorneys' fees of $30,000, and expenses, costs and double interest as provided under Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   GEICO filed a demurrer. On July 24, 2015, the circuit court held a hearing on the demurrer, and the presiding judge overruled GEICO's demurrer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Manu served discovery requests upon GEICO on August 20, 2015. He subsequently filed a motion to compel when GEICO did not provide all the requested documents. GEICO responded, in part, that Manu had no right to the documents because he had not satisfied the statutory prerequisites of Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-66.1 and 38.2-2206 in that, at the time of the alleged bad faith, he had not obtained a judgment against John Doe. During a December 18, 2015 hearing on this motion, the court deferred ruling on the motion and ordered additional briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   By letter dated January 28, 2016, the circuit court again deferred ruling on Manu's motion to compel, and invited GEICO to move for reconsideration of the prior decision overruling GEICO's demurrer. Following argument on February 26, 2016, the circuit court granted GEICO's motion to reconsider. It vacated the order overruling GEICO's demurrer, sustained GEICO's demurrer with prejudice, denied Manu's motion to compel as moot, and dismissed Manu's complaint with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Manu appeals. His assignment of error asserts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The Trial Court erred by sustaining GEICO Casualty Company's Demurrer to Mr. Manu's Complaint which alleged a cause of action under Virginia Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1). Specifically, the Trial Court erred in ruling that Virginia Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) did not provide Mr. Manu a remedy against GEICO Casualty Company for its alleged bad faith conduct in adjusting his uninsured motorist bodily injury claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Manu argues that Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) imposes a duty of good faith upon a UM carrier to evaluate, adjust and settle a demand by an insured for UM coverage, prior to the insured's obtaining judgment against the uninsured tortfeasor. GEICO responds, in part, that any duty of good faith imposed by Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) arises concurrently with a UM carrier's obligation to pay its insured under the policy, and that the obligation to pay under a UM policy is governed by Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, which does not obligate the insurer to make any payment to the insured until after the insured obtains a judgment against the alleged uninsured tortfeasor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This appeal addresses the interpretation and interaction of two statutes concerning the duties of UM carriers in Virginia, Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 and Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1. \"[A]n issue of statutory interpretation is a pure question of law which we review de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Conyers v.

Accordingly, we first address a UM carrier's obligations which arise pursuant to Code \u00a7 38.2-2206. We then address whether and when Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) is triggered by the obligations imposed upon a UM insurer under Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, and whether Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) independently establishes any duty on the part of a UM carrier to adjust and settle UM claims before trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

[N]o policy or contract of bodily injury or property damage liability insurance relating to the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be issued or delivered in this Commonwealth to the owner of such vehicle or shall be issued or delivered by any insurer licensed in this Commonwealth upon any motor vehicle principally garaged or used in this Commonwealth\n   <em>\n    unless it contains an endorsement or provisions undertaking to pay the insured all sums that he is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   F. If any action is instituted against the owner or operator of an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle by any insured intending to rely on the uninsured or underinsured coverage provision or endorsement of this policy under which the insured is making a claim, then the insured shall serve a copy of the process upon this insurer in the manner prescribed by law, as though the insurer were a party defendant.... The insurer shall then have the right to file pleadings and take other action allowable by law in the name of the owner or operator of the uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle or in its own name.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The parties agree that the instant UM policy comports with the requirements of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206. They also agree that, among the other prerequisites, an insured must be \"legally entitled to recover\" the damages he is seeking before a UM carrier's obligation to pay arises. However, they disagree as to the meaning of the phrase and the obligation it imposes upon a UM carrier. Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 does not define the phrase or any of its parts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"When the language of a statute is unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language.

Manu misconstrues the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Dodson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court in\n   <em>\n    Dodson\n   </em>\n   did not reach the issue of legal entitlement to payment, because it determined that the estate did not meet the threshold requirement of having a valid tort cause of action against the uninsured owner/operator, which is necessary to bring any potential claim within the scope of a UM policy. \"Inapposite\" means \"not pertinent.\" Webster's at 1140. Rather than being a repudiation of\n   <em>\n    Midwest Mutual\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   the statement in\n   <em>\n    Dodson\n   </em>\n   that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Midwest Mutual\n   </em>\n   was inapposite was a recognition that the issue before the Court in\n   <em>\n    Midwest Mutual\n   </em>\n   -the point at which the insured was legally entitled to payment from the UM carrier-was different from the issue in\n   <em>\n    Dodson\n   </em>\n   . The issue in\n   <em>\n    Dodson\n   </em>\n   was whether the Workers' Compensation Act completely foreclosed the insured's legal right to recover from the uninsured motorist such that the insured did not even have a potential right to recover from the UM carrier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Rainey\n   </em>\n   also concerned the scope of coverage, analyzing whether the UM policy requirement that \"the injury or damage sustained must have been caused by accident and arise out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the uninsured motor vehicle\" was met where the alleged operator was 200 feet away from the vehicle at the time of the accident.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2102955\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/237/270/\">\n    237 Va. at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=377%20S.E.2d%20393\">\n    377 S.E.2d at 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties stipulated that the other elements of the policy, which \"mirrored\" Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, had been met, and asked the Court only to define the meaning of \"operator\" within the context of that statute; the Court was not asked to decide whether the requirement of legal entitlement to recover was satisfied.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

Bad faith is failure to perform one's duty of good faith, and, in the insurance context, that duty flows from the obligations created by the insurance contract. Therefore, there can be no bad faith by an insurer in declining to perform an action the insurance contract does not require of it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14 Couch on Insurance 3d \u00a7 204:3 (observing that the essential question in determining bad faith is: \"given the insurer's implied and express contractual duties ... did the insurer act in a reasonable manner under the circumstances?\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First-party insurance pays directly to the insured. It is defined as \"[a] policy that applies to an insured ... such as life insurance, health insurance, disability insurance, and fire insurance.\" Black's at 922. UM coverage is characteristically similar to first-party insurance, because it is paid directly to the insured for the loss suffered by that same insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   A \"claim\" must be \"[t]he assertion of an\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   right.\" Black's at 301 (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   6 New Appleman \u00a7 63.18[1];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   14 VAC \u00a7 5-400-20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, in the context of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1), a request for payment is not a \"claim\" subject to a covenant of good faith unless the insurer has a present contractual liability to pay it. In other words, a \"claim\" as defined in Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) must arise out of the occurrence of the contingency or loss covered by the insurance policy. The contingency or loss covered by a UM policy is payment to the insured of all sums that he is\n   <em>\n    legally entitled to recover as damages\n   </em>\n   from the owner or operator of an uninsured or underinsured vehicle. That contingency or loss does not\n   occur until the insured obtains judgment against the uninsured tortfeasor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Rather than creating a new duty, Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) incorporates the duties already established in the insurance policies it references and provides a remedy for the bad faith violation of those contractual duties. As discussed above, an insured does not have \"an existing right\" to payment from his UM carrier until he meets certain conditions: providing notice to the carrier and obtaining judgment against the underinsured motorist. Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-2206(E) and (F). It follows that an insured does not have a UM \"claim,\" as that term is used in Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D), until he obtains judgment, and further that there cannot be a bad faith denial of a demand for payment under a UM policy before the demand ripens into a \"claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) applies to any insurance policy as defined in Code \u00a7 38.2-124, not just UM policies. Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) uses the term \"claim\" as a trigger for the good faith protection afforded as to all of the policies incorporated within the statute. Under most first-party policies, an insured's \"claim\"-existing, enforceable right to payment-arises prior to and is not contingent upon obtaining a judgment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   ., collision claims under Code \u00a7 38.2-124(A)(1) ; medical payment claims under Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A). However, as discussed above, a UM \"claim\" is unique because, pursuant to the terms of UM policies, as required by Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, an insured is required to obtain a judgment against the uninsured tortfeasor before the UM carrier is obligated to pay the insured on any such policy. Therefore, because there is no valid UM claim until judgment is obtained, there is also no duty for a UM carrier to pay or settle a demand for payment under the policy until judgment is obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The statutory framework and legislative history confirm that UM carriers have no duty to settle prior to trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oraee v.

First, a UM insurer's pretrial participation is discretionary. Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-2206(E) and (F) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nationwide v.

It would be illogical for Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) to create a duty in UM carriers to settle at a stage in the proceeding where Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 imposes no duty to participate. Rather, reading the statutes in harmony indicates that the UM carrier's decision to settle pretrial is similarly discretionary; a carrier may settle prior to the insured obtaining judgment, but it has no duty to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Second, Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) states that when an insurer is found to have acted in bad faith, the insured is entitled to the amount due, and interest on that amount \"from the date that the claim was submitted to the insurer or its authorized agent, together with reasonable attorney's fees and expenses.\" The fact that interest and costs are measured from the date of the claim shows that the General Assembly intended the duty of good faith to arise when the insured is presently owed under the terms of the policy. In a UM policy context, that does not occur when the insured requests damages the insurer has no present obligation to pay, but rather when the insured obtains judgment against the uninsured tortfeasor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Third, neither the Virginia Unfair Trade Practices Act, Code \u00a7 38.2-500\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., nor the statutory history of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) indicates the existence of a pretrial duty of good faith in the context of UM insurance, because each of those provisions addresses certain conduct by carriers\n   <em>\n    vis-a-vis\n   </em>\n   \"claims.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   ., Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-510(A) (6), (7), (14) ; Final Report of the Joint Subcommittee Studying Motor Vehicle Insurance and Unisex Ratings, S.

Additionally, although not conclusive, the failure of House Bill 1771 in 2015, which proposed adding a subsection E to Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1 specifically regarding UM claims, suggests that UM claims are presently governed by the same statutes as other insurance claims, as discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, this interpretation of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) is consistent with this Court's treatment of remedial statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    USAA Cas.

The wrong that Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) is intended to address is the arbitrary refusal of insurance claims that an insurer has a present obligation to pay. Under Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, an insured is not entitled to payment from the UM carrier until she obtains judgment. Thus, any burden of litigation costs in the liability trial which may be incurred by an insured pursuing an uninsured tortfeasor is required by statute prior to a UM carrier becoming obligated to pay its insured under the terms of the UM policy. It is not the product of a UM carrier's bad faith and requires no remedy under Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Relief Afforded By Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   That a duty of good faith arises in the context of UM policies only after a judgment has been obtained does not render Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) meaningless. This statute creates a remedy for an insurance company's breach of contract in failing to pay amounts due under its policies and, as regards most first-party automobile insurance claims, no judgment is required to obligate the insurer to pay. In the UM context, a breach occurs when a UM carrier arbitrarily refuses to pay once judgment has been obtained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14 Couch on Insurance 3d \u00a7 198:8 (\"Because the covenant of good faith is an implied term of the contract, a breach of that covenant entitles the non-breaching party to seek contractual remedies.\"). In breach of contract actions, the insured can recover, at most, the policy limit; not punitive damages or attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manss-Owens Co. v. H.S. Owens &amp; Son\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1859066\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/129/183/#p201\">\n    129 Va. 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 201,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20S.E.%20543\">\n    105 S.E. 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 549 (1921) (holding that the damages recoverable for breach of contract are those which arise from the breach of the contract itself). However, under Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D), an insured may recover not only the amount due (the contract damages), but also double interest and attorneys' fees and costs. Thus, Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) creates an enhanced recovery for an insured in proper UM bad faith actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In conclusion, we hold that Code \u00a7 8.01-66.1(D)(1) does not create a duty for UM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   carriers to settle a case prior to trial, but rather creates a remedy for the conduct of UM carriers that refuse in bad faith to pay once the insured has obtained judgment. Therefore, for the above-stated reasons, Manu's complaint failed to state a cognizable claim, and the circuit court did not err in sustaining GEICO's demurrer and dismissing Manu's claim with prejudice. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    It is undisputed that GEICO promptly paid the limit of its UM policy after Manu obtained judgment against John Doe.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    While the general definition suggests that a\n    <em>\n     claimed\n    </em>\n    amount constitutes damages, the sources relied upon indicate that damages are\n    <em>\n     determined\n    </em>\n    to be owed, not merely claimed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The fact that\n    <em>\n     Midwest Mutual\n    </em>\n    concerned a contribution action between two UM carriers does not render its holding inapplicable to the case at bar, because the basis for the Court's determination that Midwest was not liable to Aetna was that\n    <em>\n     neither carrier was liable to the insured\n    </em>\n    , as the insured had not obtained judgment against the tortfeasor.\n    <em>\n     Midwest Mut.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2124889\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/216/926/#p929\">\n     216 Va. at 927-29\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=223%20S.E.2d%20901\">\n     223 S.E.2d at 902-04\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Code \u00a7 38.2-124 states, in relevant part, that\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n    A. \"Motor vehicle insurance\" means insurance against.... 2.

Under Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, an insured does not have a \"claim\" against the UM carrier until he satisfies the contractual prerequisites for payment by the insurer; a mere assertion or demand is not a \"claim\" in this context.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The unique nature of good faith as regards UM policies distinguishes this case from our holding in\n    <em>\n     Nationwide Mut.

Unlike UM claims, the duty to pay medical claims arise prior to entry of judgment, and thus the statute is structured such that the insured should not have to bear the costs of litigation to obtain judgment. However, because an insured is not entitled to payment from a UM policy until she obtains judgment, the cost of litigation to obtain judgment against an uninsured tortfeasor is not an unjust burden for which a remedy is required.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
