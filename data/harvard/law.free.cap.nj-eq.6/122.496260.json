The bill charges, that on the said June 25, 1839, the said sum of $48,754 80 was in the hands of the said Hope Haines and of the surviving trustees of the will of Hope Cowperthwaite, for the purposes of the trusts thereby created. That Hope Haines did not by writing under her hand attested by two credible witnesses require of the said Wallace Lippincott and the complainant Aquila, trustees as aforesaid, or of the survivor of them, any of the principal money of the fourth part so bequeathed in trust for her; but that the -whole of the said principal money continued as a part of the trust fund up to the death of the said Hope Haines, and still of right continues part thereof.

The bill states, that, from the time of the death of Hope Cowperthwaite, Hope Haines and the complainant Hannah Lippincott, as executrices of the said will, had the management of the estate of Hope Cowperthwaite, deceased, and the possession and control of the trust funds belonging thereto ; and that, on the 25th June, 1889, after the duties of the executors touching the said estate had been discharged, and after the trust funds had passed into the hands of the trustees, the said Hope Haines, having great confidence in her own management of money affairs,- and an excessive love of money and of power, insisted on retaining the whole of the trust funds in her own hands and under her own control; and that the complainants Hannah and Rebecca yielded to her solicitations; and the complainant Aquila, having had difficulties with the said Hope Haines in regard to the disbursement of his own funds by her as one of the executors of the will of Hope Cowperthwaite, and being desirous of avoiding all altercations with her, also consented to her wishes; and that it was accordingly agreed by and between Hope Haines and the complainants Hannah and Aquila, that the complainant Aquila should forbear to act as trustee, and that the whole trust funds to which Hope Haines and the complainant Hannah were, respectively, entitled, and of which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>complainant Aquila was the sole surviving trustee, should remain in the hands of the said Hope Haines and the complainant Hannah, respectively. That the said Hope Haines and the complainant Hannah did, by writing under their hands and seals, dated the said June 25, 1839, declare that the complainant Aquila was to remain the trustee of the said Hope Haines and the complainant Hannah, and did thereby exonerate him, (so far as they were personally concerned,) from all liability which he might incur from permitting the said portions, with the evidences and securities thereof/to remain in their hands and under their control. That in pursuance of the said arrangement, and at the special solicitation of the said Hope Haines, the complainant Aquila, surviving trustee as aforesaid, did permit the whole of the funds so bequeathed in trust for the said Hope Haines and the complainant Hannah to remain in their hands, and that they did, until the death of the said Hope Haines, remain in their hands without being divided between them, the said Hope and Hannah. That on the said June 25, 1839, it was further agreed by and between the said Hope Haines, the complainants Hannah and Rebecca and the complainant Aquila, that the portion bequeathed in trust for said Rebecca should remain in the hands of the said Hope Haines and the complainant Hannah, with the securities thereto belonging, under their management and control, without any interference of the complainaxxt Aquila, though he was to remain a trustee for the said Rebecca; and that the complainant Rebecca, by writing under her hand and seal, dated the same June 25, 1839,- did, so far as she was personally concerned, release the complainant Aquila from all liability for permitting the said trust funds and the securities therefor to remain in the haixds of the said Hope and Hannah and under their control; and that the complaiixant Aquila, one of the trustees of the said Rebecca, did, in pursuance of the said arrangement, and at the special solicitation of the said Hope Haines, permit the said fund so bequeathed in trust for the said Rebecca, with the securities therefor, to remain 'in the hands of the said Hope and Hannah; and that the same, ever after, until the death af the said Hope, did remain in their hands and subject to their management and control.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>The bill states, that the said Aquila has never renounced the trusts so confided to him; that at the time of the agreements aforesaid, it was distinctly understood and agreed, that the complainant Aquila should remain a trustee of the said trust funds; and that the complainant Aquila has always continued and still is a co-trustee, with the complainant Hannah, of the share of the said Rebecca, and the sole surviving trustee of the shares of the said Hope Haines and the complainant Hannah; and that he still remains liable, as trustee, for the faithful execution of the said trusts, except in so far forth \"as he was discharged from liability by the releases aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-3\">The complainants Hannah and Rebecca say, that by reason of the age and infirmity of the complainant Hannah, she is becoming inadequate to the sole management of the said trust funds, and that they are desir\u00f3us that the complainant Aquila should assume the management of the funds bequeathed in trust for them, respectively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-4\">The complainant Hannah says, that after the said June 25, 1839, the whole of the said trust funds so left in the hands of the said Hope Haines and her, the said Hannah, together with the share of the said trust funds belonging to the complainant Aquila, with the securities therefor, remained in the hands and under the management and control of the said Hope Haines and the complainant Hannah, until the death of the said Hope, the accounts thereof being kept solely by the said Hope.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-5\">The bill states, that by a statement in the handwriting of the said Hope Haines, dated June 25, 1843, now in the possession of the complainant Hannah, it appears that there was then in the hands of the said Hope Haines and the complainant Hannah- securities for the payment of money, belonging to the said trust funds-, amounting to $&gt; 61,347 37; and the complainants believe that the said writing contains a true enumeration of the securities belonging to the said trust estate, and the amount thereof on that day, and that the whole of the said sum, with the accumulated interest thereof, belongs to the said trust estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-6\">That Hope Haines died in January, 1844, leaving a will, dated November 17, 1841, of which she appointed the defendants Charles Stokes and Thomas F.

That the said Charles Stokes and Thomas F. Budd, on or about March 5, 1844, under pretence of making an inventory and appraisement of the goods, chattels and credits which were of the said Hope Haines, deceased, as executors of her will, caused to be inventoried and appraised a large number of securities for money, amounting, as the complainants have been informed and believe and charge the truth to be, to $56,991 17; that the said Stokes and Budd, under pretence that the said securities were jointly owned by the said Hope Haines and the complainant Hannah in their own rights, caused one-half of the amount then due on the said securities to be appraised as the personal property of the said Hope Haines; whereas the complainants charge, and they say that it so appears on many of the said vouchers, that the securities so inventoried and appraised were and are a part of the said trust estate; and that the complainants Hannah and Aquila, or one of them, as trustees as aforesaid, or (as to the securities standing in the name of Hope Cowperthwaite, deceased,) as surviving executors of the will of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Hope Cowperthwaite, or (as to the securities given or assigned to the said Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott jointly) the complainant Hannah, as surviving payee, are or is entitled to have and hold each and every of the said securities so inventoried and appraised by the said Charles Stokes and Thomas F.

That a part of the securities so inventoried by Stokes and Budd were given to the said Hope Cowperthwaite, deceased, in her life time, and are still standing in her name, which securities can be collected only by the complainants Hannah and Aquila as surviving executors of the will of Hope Cowperthwaite, who alone can give a discharge for the money, or acknowledge satisfaction on record of the mortgages. That Stokes and Budd, not satisfied with making an inventory of the said bonds, mortgages and other securities, under pretence of making a division thereof between the estate of Hope Haines and the complainant Hannah, on or about May 5, 1844, against the remonstrances of the complainants Hannah and Aquila, took into their possession, out of the custody and possession of the complainants Hannah and Aquila, the following bonds, mortgages and securities belonging to the trust estate under the will of Hope Cowperthwaite, that is to say; (specifying them particularly;) amounting, in all, to $28,-651 00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-6\">The bill states, that on the 9th May, 1844, the complainants Hannah and Aquila, by their duly authorized attorney, demanded of Stokes and Budd the bonds, mortgages and other securities so taken by them, and demanded that they should be restored to them the complainants; but that the said Stokes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Budd refused to deliver the same to them, the said complainants, or to their attorney, and still unlawfully detain the same from the said complainants Hannah and Aquila; that the said Stokes and Budd have collected money on the said securities, and are still, as the complainants are informed and believe, proceeding to collect money thereon, and to dispose of said securities, against the will of the said complainants Hannah and Aquila. That the said Stokes and Budd, executors as aforesaid, under pretence of making an inventory and appraisement of the goods, chattels and credits which were of Hope Haines, deceased, on or about May 5,1844, caused to be inventoried and appraised, and took into their possession, as the sole property of the said Hope Haines, a bond and mortgage made by William Warner, jr. to the said Hope Haines, dated 3d month 25th, 1842, for $4,547 20, on which a large arrear of interest had accrued ; and that the said Stokes and Budd still retain the possession thereof, or have disposed of it, without the permission and against the will of the complainants Hannah and Aquila, which last mentioned bond and mortgage, the bill charges, belongs to the complainants Hannah and Aquilla, trustees as aforesaid under the will of Hope Cowperthwaite.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-5\">The defendants put in their joint and several answer; in which, after admitting the will of Hope Cowperthwaite, deceased, and the codicil thereto, as stated in the bill, they say, that as to the allegation in the bill that on the 25th of June, 1839, it was ascertained that the personal estate of Hope Cowperthwaite, deceased, bequeathed in trust as aforesaid, amounted to $58,954, they have no personal knowledge; and that the papers and writings of Hope Haines which might and probably would throw light on the matter have been taken and are withheld from them, as in their answer is afterwards stated. That, as to the statement in the hand writing of Hope Haines which the complainants allege is in their possession, they have no such knowledge as will enable them to answer whether the contents thereof are truly set forth, or whether the whole of its contents have been set forth- i\u00e1 the bill. That they have reason to believe, that at or about the time for that purpose mentioned in the bill, some Statement was made in regard to the rights and interests of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>complainants and the said Hope Haines, under the will of Hope Cowperthwaite, deceased. That the amounts severally due Rebecca Zilley and Aquila S. Ridgeway, after deducting what had been paid to each of them, was then ascertained. That Aquila assigned over to Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott all his right and interest in the bonds and securities which had been given to them as executors, or to which as executors they were entitled, and in which the said Aquila appeared to have any legal interest, with some few exceptions ; that the said Hope and Hannah, thereupon, took or retained possession of the whole of said bonds and securities; That at the same time, as these defendants have understood, Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott executed and gave to the said Rebecca and Aquila some obligation or writing or writings, by which they became bound to Rebecca and Aquila to the amount of their shares, respectively, as then ascertained; but who, thereupon, became legally or equitably entitled to the said securities the defendants submit to the judgment of the court. That from the papers they saw and the assignments thereon and other information, they are induced to believe, that from the time of such ascertainment Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott took possession of their several shares under the will of Hope Cowerthwaite, as their own individual and separate property, for their common benefit. That up to that period bonds and securities were taken and the business conducted in the names of Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott as individuals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-3\">They say that after the time when the said shares were ascertained as aforesaid, as these defendants have understood, and after the assignment of the bonds and securities by the said Aquila to the said Hope Haines and Hannah Lipnincott, the said Aquila did not in any wise act as trustee; and whether he considered himself still as trustee and liable as such, or whether he actually continued to be such trustee, in law or in fact, they cannot answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-4\">They say they are not informed, or able to answer, whether Hope Haines did or did not at any time require of the'; said Wallace Lippincott and Aquila S. Ridgeway, or the survivor.of them, in the mode provided in the will of Hope Cowperthwaite, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>part of the principal of the fourth of the personal estate of Hope Cowpertliwaite; nor whether the whole of the said principal money continued as a part of the said trust fund up to the death of Hope Haines, and still of right so continues. That they were under the impression and belief, when they qualified as executors of the will of Hope Haines, that the principal of the said one-fourth part had in some way become the absolute property of the said Hope Haines, and that she so considered it in her life time, and that the same was so considered and understood by the complainants; but whether the said principal has in fact and in law become the property of the said Hope Haines, or whether it remains a trust fund, they submit to the determination and direction of the court. They say they have understood and believe that, after the death of Hope Cowperthwaite, Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott, as executors of her will, had the management of the estate and the possession and control of the funds belonging thereto; hut whether, after the duties of the executors were discharged, the said Hope Haines insisted on retaining the whole of the trust funds in her hands and under her own control they are unable to answer ; nor can they answer how far or on what consideration the complainants yielded to such insistment; nor whether it was agreed that the whole of the trust fund to which Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott were, respectively, entitled should remain in the hands of the said Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott; nor whether the said Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott, at the time in that behalf mentioned in the bill, did, by writing under their hands and seals, declare that Aquila was to remain the trustee of the said Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott, and did exonerate the said Aquila from all liability by reason thereof, so far as they were personally concerned; nor whether, in pursuance of the said arrangement and at the special solicitation of the said Hope Haines, the said Aquila permitted the whole of the said trust fund bequeathed for the benefit of the said Hope and Hannah to remain in their hands; but they believe that the amount of their said shares was, at the death of Hope Haines and for several years after had been in the hands of Hope Haines and Hannah Lippin\u00aeottj that money was loaned and securities taken therefor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>their own individual names, and that the whole business in relation thereto was managed and conducted without referenee to any trust whatever. That, though it may be, as stated in the bill, that no actual separation or division of the said fund or the securities belonging to it ever took place between Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott; yet the defendants believe that the said Hope Haines, who was the principal accountant, did, from time to time, make out a statement of the funds in the possession of herself and Hannah; and, after giving credit, or deducting such amount as they might be liable for to Aquila and Rebecca, or as would be sufficient to meet the obligations or engagements so given and made to them as aforesaid, the balance remaining was divided into two equal parts, and one part designated as belonging to the said Hannah Lippincott, and the other as belonging to the said Hope Haines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-3\">They say it may be true, as stated in the bill, that it was further agreed, at the tim\u00e9 aforesaid, by and between Hope Haines and the complainants, that the portion of the trust funds belonging to Rebecca should remain in the hands of Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott, to be managed by them, without any interference on the part of Aquila, the still remaining trustee; and that Rebecca did release Aquila from all liability by reason thereof; and that, in consequence thereof, Aquila permitted the said fund so to remain <em>\u2022, </em>but they say they have no knowledge of the said agreement, and can neither admit or deny it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-4\">They say they have understood, however, and did suppose and believe, that when the portions due Aquila and Hannah were ascertained, or the securities constituting the same were left in the hands of the said Hope and Hannah, they, the said Hope and Hannah, by their own individual obligations or other writings, became personally responsible to the said Aquila and Hannah, severally, for their respective shares; and that thus being equitably entitled to the securities constituting said shares, they took the same as their own and managed the whole as one common fund; especially as most of said securities were actually assigned over by Aquila to the said Hope and Hannah.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-5\">They admit that Hope Haines did not by her will make any direction or appointment of the fourth part of the residue of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>personal estate of Hope Cowperthwaite, as such residue, as authorized to do by the will of Hope Cowperthwaite ; hut whether in the will of Hope Haines any such appointment or direction has been made as is authorized by the will of Hope Cowpertbwaitc, or whether the whole of the said Hope Haines\u2019s share, with its accumulated interest, or any part thereof, remains subject to the trust created by Hope Cowperthwaite\u2019s will, they submit to the decree and direction of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-5\">They admit that Hope Haines died possessed of a valuable personal estate, independent of the trust fund bequeathed by Hope Cowperthwaite ; and they have supposed that her personal estate, exclusive of her said trust fund, would be sufficient to pay her debts and the legacies bequeathed by the will, and leave a surplus for the residuary legatees ; but that they are now under the impression that if the claims made in the complainants\u2019 bill are all allowed, and the one-fourth, with the accumulated interest thereon he decreed to be a trust fund to be applied according to the will of Hope Cowperthwaite, there will not be sufficient to pay the debts, expenses and pecuniary legacies;

which said bonds, notes and other securities being payable to or assigned over to the said Hope and Hannah, the defendants charged themselves in the said inventory with half the amount of each security, as the property of the estate of Hope Haines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-9\">Thirdly, certain other bonds, notes and securities, some of which were originally payable to Hope Cowperthwaite, in her life time, and others of which were payable to the executors of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>her will, after her death, and others of which were assigned over to the said executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-5\">These securities being found with the other securities of the said Hope Haines, deceased, and almost all of them having been assigned over to the said Hope Haines and Hannah Lippineott by the said Aquila, either as executor of or as trustee under the will of Hope Cowperthwaite; and the said Aquila representing, \u2022at the time of taking said inventory and appraisement, that the bonds which had no such assignment on them were in that condition only because he had omitted to make the necessary and proper assignment thereon,' and that he claimed no property or interest therein, as he held an obligation against the said Hope Haines and Hannah Lippineott for his interest in the estate ; these defendants, under the impression and belief that there had been some settlement made between and among the persons interested in the personal estate of Hope Cowperthwaite, deceased, and that Hope Haines and Hannah Lippineott had given to Aquila and Rebecca their individual obligations for the amounts due them, severally, and were therefore personally responsible therefor, and that the said bonds, notes and other securities so given and assigned, and so found as aforesaid, were the individual property of the said Hope Haines and Hannah Lippineott, and that the estate of the said Hope Haines had an equal interest therein, charged themselves in the said inventory with one-half aforesaid. That in so doing they acted in good faith, and according to the best of their judgnent, from the facts and circumstances before them and within their knowledge. That the whole amount of the securities last mentioned was, at the time of taking said inventory, $41,375, and that they charged themselves with the half thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-6\">That at the time of taking said appraisement and inventory, Aquila made no claim to the bonds or to any part thereof, either as executor, or as trustee, or in any other capacity, nor did he represent himself to these defendants as a trustee or as having any interest in the said property, either as trustee, or <em>cestui que trust; </em>that there was nothing in the said bonds or securities, or any Of them, to show the defendants that Aquila or Rebecca had any interest in them, except that one of said bonds, originally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>given for $1000, was made payable to Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott, trustees of Rebecca Zilley, and one other, for $270,. was drawn payable to them as trustees generally.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-5\">They admit they took into their possession, among othei s, the several bonds and mortgages specified in the hill; but do not admit that the said securities are part of a trust fund, nor can they answer as to their character further than they have answered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-6\">They deny that they were taken out of the custody of Hannah Lippincott and Aquila S. Ridgeway against their will and remonstrance, as is alleged in the hill; and allege the truth to be that, after some conversation between them, the defendants,, and Aquila and Hannah, in regard to the disposition of the said bonds and mortgages, it was eventually agreed that one-half, in amount, of all the bonds and securities, (excepting those payable to or standing in the name of Hope Haines alone,) should be retained by the defendants as executors as aforesaid, and that the other half should be given up and delivered over to Hannah Lippincott; which was accordingly done by these defendants and the same were taken and received by the said Hannah; and each party gave to the other a list of the bonds and securities so taken and received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-7\">They say that the said bonds and securities were not in the possession of the said Hannah and Aquila, or either of them, but in the custody of these defendants; that they were in the same chest in which were found the other bonds and papers of Hope Haines; which chest was delivered to them, as executors of her will, together with the key of it. That after taking the inventory, they took with them the bonds and securities belonging to the estate of Hope Haines, deceased, and retained possession of the key, (leaving the chest at the late residence of the said Hope Haines, in which chest were many papers appertaining to the estate and business of Hope Haines, deceased, which had not been carefully examined,) until the key was, at the request of Ab. Brown and John R. Slack, esquires, delivered to them, in confidence, that they might examine the papers and other writings remaining in the chest for the purpose of arriving at some conclusion or getting some information as t\u00a9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the trust or trusts set up in the bill and the management of the said property by the said Hope Haines, or by the said Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-5\">They say that the key was delivered to Brown and Slack as the agents or friends of the complainants or some of them, as they understood, in the full belief that it would be returned to them; but that it has never been returned, and that the key, with the chest and the papers therein, have ever since been withheld from them, though they have demanded them, considering that they were entitled to them, and that they might be aided by them in the proper understanding and prosecution of their rights and duties as such executors ; and they say they suppose and believe, that the statements, papers and agreements, or some of .them, specified in the stating part of the complainant\u2019s bill, were found in the said chest 5 and they hope that the fact that they have had no opportunity carefully to examine these papers will satisfactorily account for the imperfect answers they have been obliged to give to various parts of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-6\">They admit that Abraham Brown, about the time in that respect stated in the bill, demanded of them the bonds or obligations in their hands, and that they declined surrendering them either to him or to the said Aquila and Hannah; but say they have repeatedly offered to the complainants, or some of them, to surrender up to Rebecca and Aquila obligetions, or pay over to them money, equivalent in amount to the obligations or agreements by them held against the said Hope Haines or her estate, whenever the said Aquila and Rebecca would deliver up to the defendants the said agreements or obligations 3 and that they are still willing to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-7\">They admit they received monies on some of the securities 3 but say they have not in any instance solicited payment, being desirous that the monies should remain as invested so long as any question was made as to its appropriation or ownership 3 and that most of the money they have received has been deposited in bank for safe keeping, the residue having been placed at interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-8\">They admit that they inventoried and took possession of, as the separate property of Hope Haines, the bond and mortgage given by William Warner jr. to Hope Haines, dated 8d month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>25, 1842, for $4,500, stated in the bill, as they supposed they had an undoubted right to do; but deny that they did so against the will of Aquila and Hannah, or either of them, as far as they know; and they deny that at the time of the filing of the bill they had disposed of the said bond and mortgage; but they allege, that after the bill was filed, Warner proffered himself ready and desirous to pay off the said bond and mortgage, and that the defendants, finding that it was claimed in the bill as trust property, and denied to be the separate property of Hope Haines,, declined, on that account, to receive the money; whereupon Warner tendered the money in specie, and that the defendants,not feeling at liberty to refuse it, received the money and deposited it in bank for safe keeping; and they deny that the said bond and mortgage is a part of the trust fund, or in any way* connected with it, so far as they have any knowledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-5\">They say they are willing to render a true account of all the securities which came to their hands as executors aforesaid, and that the inventory a copy of which is annexed to their answer contains such account, as they verily believe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-6\">They say they have always been and still are ready and willing to pay over or deliver to Aquila and Hannah any money, securities or other property in their hands, as soon as it may be ascertained that the same belongs to the said Hannah and Aquila, or either of them, or that they are entitled to the custody of the same, as trustees or otherwise, and they, the defendants, be indemnified and made safe in so doing; that they are desirous to act under the direction of the court, and to have the benefit of its protection ; the more especially as those who claim under the residuary bequest in the will of Hope Haines, or some of them, allege and insist that the whole of the fourth part of the estate of Hope Cowperthwaite which was given in trust for the benefit of Hope Haines, became, according to the requirements of the trust or in some other way, in the life time of said Hope Haines, the separate and sole property of the said Hope Haines: that the same was withdrawn from the trust fund, and that it now constitutes a part of the estate of said .Hope Haines; and,, particularly, they insist that the interest on said share, the said share being in the actual possession of the said Hope Haines,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>in her life time, and the interest received by her, constitutes a part of the separate estate of said Hope Haines, even if it should be ascertained that the share itself is trust property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-5\">They further say that, according to the terms of the trust in Hope Cowperthwaite\u2019s will, the interest on the share given for the benefit of Hope Haines, and the other <em>cestuis que trusty </em>was payable annually \u2022, that they have understood and believe, that in the life time of Hope Haines, she paid the interest annually to Aquila and Rebecca on the amount for which they held the obligations of the said Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott; that as to the interest annually and accruing and received by the said Hope Haines, on her share of the said fund, they are unable to say when the same was invested or in what securities; and whether, if a trust be established and the said share be decreed to be held in trust for the purposes of Hope Cowperthwaite\u2019s will, the said interest, or any part of it, shall be considered as belonging to said trust, they submit to the court, and say they are ready to abide its decision and indemnity. But they submit that they are not responsible for any loss that may accrue, in case the trust be established; that they have acted in good faith, on the facts and information before them, and on the advice of counsel, and thrown no obstacle in the way of a speedy decision and adjustment of the rights and claims of all who may be interested. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-6\">And they further say that the complainants, having withheld from them the papers which they, the complainants, now insist establish the trust and their right to the said bonds and securities, or a part thereof, have no just grounds of complaint against them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-7\">They further say that Hope Haines never, as they believe, received any commission or other compensation for her services as one of the executors of Hope Cowperthwaite\u2019s will; and submit that her estate is entitled to a proper allowance for the same, and for any services rendered to the complainants in and about the management of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-8\">A copy of the inventory and appraisement caused by them to lie made of the property inventoried as the property of Hope Haines is annexed to this answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Interrogatories wove exhibited by the defendants to the complainants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\">In answer thereto, Rebecca Zilley says, that she received from the executors of her mother\u2019s will, on account of her share, pri- or to 1839, $2,483. The money was handed to her by Hope Haines, the acting executor. This is all she has received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">Aquila, in answer to the said interrogatories, says, he received of the residuum of the estate of Hope Cowperthwaite, from Hannah Lippincott and Hope Haines, executors of and trustees under the will of Hope Cowperthwaite, prior to June 25, 1839, in different sums, at different times, $5,938 ; that though Hope Haines was, on that occasion, the acting person, the business was done in the names of both his trustees, Hope and Hannah. The securities lie received were assigned to him by both of them. That on the 25th Juno, 1839, he received the further amount of $1,781 73. These sums were in full of what was bequeathed to him absolutely. On that day an instrument of that date, executed by Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott was delivered to him, a copy of which is annexed to these answers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-7\">Rebecca says, an instrument was given to her, a copy of which is annexed to the answers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-8\">Aquila answers, further, that there are papers in the box, relating to the trust funds, consisting of memoranda and accounts, some in his hand writing, but most in Hope Haines\u2019s writing. There are also in the box some accounts &amp;c. which appear to relate to the separate estate of Hope Haines : these he offered to Mr. Stokes, but he declined to receive them. As to those which relate to the trust fund, lie caused an offer to he made to Stokes to produce them in the presence of the complainants and defendants and their respective counsel; but the proposition was declined. A further offer was made to furnish copies, which was also declined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-9\">Rebecca and Aquila further say, that Hannah Lippincott and Hope Haines did pay to them, respectively, on the 25th June, of each of the years 1840, 1841, 1842, 1843, to Rebecca $735 33, and to Aquila $42111. That no payments have been made to either of them on that account since June 25, 1843, either by Hannah or Hope. That the throe first years\u2019 payments were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>made to Rebecca in money; for tbe last two years Hannah and Hope gave their bond to her, conditioned for the payment of\u2019 $1,477, with interest, dated June 25, 1843, which bond she now holds, but has received on account, January 8,1844, $942 50, a credit for which is endorsed on the bond.

That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>it should be recollected that unless a judge was satisfied that he had a distinct view of every thing material in the testimony, he could not feel willing to decide a cause; and that the burden of wading through a volume of useless matter should not be imposed.</p>\n<author id=\"b147-5\">The Chancello\u00bb.</author>\n<p id=\"AYi\">The question in this case is, whether the securities which have been inventoried, appraised and taken by the executors of Hope Haines as belonging to her estate, (other than those which she held in her individual name,) belong to the trusts created by the will of Hope Cowperthwaite, or belong to the estate of Hope Haines, and are to be disposed of under her will. If the disposition of these securities was the same under both wills, it would probably be of no great importance which set of trustees should have the charge of them. But the disposition of the different wills is different; and the question involved affects substantial interests of opposing claimants to these securities. The <em>cestuis que trust </em>under the different wills are different; not altogether so, indeed, but sufficiently so to make it a question between substantial adverse claims. These securities belong to the trusts under Hope Cowportliwaite\u2019s will, unless something has been done, conformably, in the judgment of a court of equity, to the provisions of that will, withdrawing them from those trusts and making them the property of Hope Haines, discharged from those trusts.

She gives her son Wallace only a small sum, he having been provided for in her life time.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">.After certain bequests, she divides her personal estate into four parts, and bequeaths one-fourth to trustees for each daughter, with certain provisions and limitations in reference thereto. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Wallace Lippincott and Hope Haines are by the will appointed the trustees of the Martha Woolston fourth. By the will and codicil Hope Haines, Hannah Lippincott and A quila S. Ridge-way are the trustees of the Rebecca Zilley fourth. Wallace Lippincott and Aquila S. Ridgeway were appointed the trustees of the Hope Haines <em>fourth; </em>and also of the Hannah Lippincott fourth: and on the death of Wallace Lippincott, Aquila S. Ridgeway became the sole surviving trustee of Hope Haines\u2019s fourth and of the Hannah Lippincott fourth; and by the death of Hope Haines, Hannah Lippincott and Aquila S. Ridgeway became the surviving trustees of the Rebecca Zilley fourth. Hannah Lippincott, Hope Haines and Aquila S. Ridgeway were appointed executors of the will and codicils; and since the death of Hope Haines, Hannah Lippincott and Aquila S. Ridgeway are the surviving executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\">The trusts of the different fourths are of the same general character.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The trust in reference to the Hope Haines fourth is, in substance, as follows : \u2014 This fourth is bequeathed to Wallace Lippincott, since deceased, and Aquila S. Ridgeway and to the survivor of them, in trust to place the same at interest, and to pay the interest arising thereon, yearly, to Hope Haines so long as she shall live; and also in trust to pay to Hope Haines so much of the principal as she shall, from time to time, by writing under her hand, attested by two credible witnesses, require of the said trustees; and if she shall leave children living at her death, or descendants of children, then that what shall remain undisposed of, of the said fourth, with its accumulated interest, shall belong to and vest in her children, to be paid to them at twenty-one, respectively; the issue of any deceased child to stand in the place of the deceased parent; but if she die, not leaving any child or descendant of any child living at her death, then that the trustees pay what may remain of this fourth undisposed of at the time of her death, with its accumulated interest, unto such of her brothers or sisters or their children and in such proportions as she, the said Hope Haines, shall by will or writing in nature thereof, signed by her hand and attested by two credible witnesses, direct and appoint; she, the said Hope, in such case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>to have power to dispose of the same among her brothers and sisters and their children, in such proportions as she may think fit, but to no other person or persons whomsoever; and if she die, not leaving any child living at her death, nor descendant of such child, and without having made such appointment, then that the said trustees pay what shall remain undisposed of, as aforesaid, of this fourth, unto the brothers and sisters of the said Hope, in equal proportions, (the shares of any sisters that may then be married to he paid to their trustees, for their separate use, free from their husband\u2019s control.) The children of any deceased brother or sister to stand in the place of his, her or their parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">On the 25th June, 1889, there was an ascertainment of the amount of the estate. It is called a settlement. The exhibits, I think, show that it was intended as a settlement of the executors\u2019 accounts; and it is to be considered, for the purposes of this case, in the same light as a settlement in the orphans\u2019 court would he.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Hope Haines died leaving no child or descendant of any child.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The bill is filed by Hannah Lippincott, Aquila S. Ridgeway and Rebecca Zilley; Hannah and Aquila claiming to be surviving trustees of the Rebecca Zilley fourth; Aquila claiming to be the sole surviving trustee of the Hope Haines and Hannah Lippincott fourths; and Rebecca Zilley being a <em>cestui que trust </em>of the fourth bequeathed in trust for her &amp;c. The object of the bill is, to recover from the executors of Hopo Haines the securities inventoried and taken by them as belonging to the estate of Hope Haines, other than those which stand in her own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">As to the Hope Haines fourth, the first question is, did Hope Haines, in her life time, require the said trustees to pay to her any part of the principal of this fourth, in the manner prescribed by the will for that purpose, or in any manner which should be considered in equity as equivalent thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">It is contended on the part of the defendants, that the settlement of the estate by the executors, the assignments by Aquila, one of the executors, to Hannah and Hope, the other two executors, and the exhibit O. and the other exhibits in the cause, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>should he considered as amounting, in effect, to a requirement <em>by </em>Hope Haines inher'life time, on her trustee, Aquila S. Ridgway, to pay to her the principal of the Hope Haines fourth.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">As to the settlement, it was necessary or proper, in order to ascertain the amount of the estate which would be subject to trusts. It seems to have been in lieu of a settlement by the executors in the orphan\u2019s court. As to the assignments by Aquila, they were assignments by one of three executors to the other two, of all his interest in the securities so assigned. As to exhibit 0., it does not seem to me to furnish sufficient evidence that Hope intended by it to extinguish the trust as to the Hope Haines <em>fourth; </em>.and, as has been observed before, the burthen is on the defendants to show enough to enable the court to affirm that such was her intention. The fact that she did not adopt the mode prescribed in the will for doing it, is certainly to be considered as opposed, more or less, to the idea that she intended to do so. If she had so intended, she had only to declare that intention to the trustee, by writing under hand attested by two witnesses. When she could do it by so plain and easy a mode, a mode that would have been subject to no misapprehension, would so careful a woman, scrupulously particular, according to the-accounts we have of her, be likely to be satisfied with any other mode, or, at any rate, with one so equivocal in its character as that from which the counsel for the defendants ask us to infer such intention on her part 1</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Again, exhibit 0., after reciting that.Aquila, since the death of Wallace Lippincott, is the sole surviving trustee of the Hope Haines fourth, and of the Hannah Lippincott fourth, expressly declares that \u201che is to continue our trustee.\u201d All the securities belonging to the trust had remained in the hands of Hope and Hannah, two of the executors of the will of Hope Cowperthwaite, from: the time of her death, in 1829, up to the said settlement and the date of this exhibit, June 1839; Aquila, the other executor, consenting to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">After \u00e1-. careful examination of the testimony, and exhibits in the cause, I do not feel .willing-to-affirm that what was done on the 25th-June, 1839, was intended by Hope Haines as an execution of- the power given'her to .withdraw the principal money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>from tlie trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">If it was intended by her to do something, on that day, in or towards, or as equivalent to the execution of the power, we must suppose that such intention would have been communicated to her counsel who drew the writings ; and it appears to me to be beyond all credence that counsel, having the idea of such intention on her part in his mind, could have drawn so many writings in reference to the different fourths, and avoided any expression of such intention. .But there is not only an entire absence of any such expression; but, as if for the purpose of excluding a conclusion that she intended to do so, a clause is inserted in exhibit O. expressly declaring that Aquila is to remain a trustee. When the meaning of a party\u2019s acts is so equivocal and difficult to be understood, I see no reason for rejecting Ins express declaration of what ho does mean. But if this declaration is to be considered as not conclusive, it is certainly entitled to weight in examining the case with a view to ascertain the intention of Hope Haines ; aud 1 think it may be safely said, that nothing stronger than conjecture can be reached, in opposition to this declaration. How are we to apply principles, where we have only conjectures in place of established facts ?</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The court may aid a defective execution of a power; but will not supply the execution where none has been attempted or intended. It will not do that for a party which he does not think fit to do for himself. 1 <em>Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. sec. </em>170.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The only safe principle, as it seems to me, on which this cause can be decided, is this : Where the circumstances are so equivocal as to leave the mind in doubt whether an execution of the power was at all intended, the court should not interpose. An intention to execute the power should clearly appear. 1 <em>Story sec. </em>172.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">I will not guess on either side in the case; either that Hope Haines intended to withdraw the principal from the trust; or that she intended that the yearly interest received by her was to be added to the principal and subjected to the trust. The interest was to bo paid to her by her trustee, yearly, without any demand ; and when she received, it, she received it as hers absolutely, not subject to any trust. It is not easy to perceive how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>she could, after receiving the interest, add it to the trust fund. At all events something affirmative would he necessary ; something equivalent to declining to receive the interest from her trustee and leaving it to accumulate in his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">As to the question, then, whether Hope Haines did any thing in her life time equivalent to requiring her trustee, conformably to the will of Hope Cowperthwaite, deceased, to pay her the principal of this fourth, to be her own, free from the trust, I am of opinion that there is no sufficient evidence that she did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">As to the interest of this fourth, I am of opinion that, inasmuch as it was received by her, it is to be considered in the same light as if it had been paid to her by her trustee; and that there is no sufficient ground for holding that it became a part of the trust fund after being received by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">It is difficult to perceive how the words \u201cwith its accumulated interest,\u201d used in the will, can apply to the interest which should be actually paid, yearly, to the <em>cestui que trust, </em>for her use free from any trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">As to the will of Hope Haines, it cannot affect the right to the custody of the papers belonging to the trust fund. The will of Hope Cowperthwaite provides that if Hope Haines die without leaving any child, or descendant of any child, then that the trustees of the Hope Haines fourth pay what may remain undisposed of of this fourth unto such of her brothers or sisters, or their children, as she shall by will direct. Even if the will of Hope Haines, therefore, can be considered as an appointment in favor of the persons named in the residuary clause thereof, the trustee under Hope Cowperthwaite\u2019s will would be the person to receive the money or these trust securities and pay it to the appointees.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Whether the persons named in the residuary clause of Hope Haines\u2019s will are entitled to this fourth is a question which it would not be proper now to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">As to the commissions claimed by Hope Haines, she was not entitled to commissions for investing and managing the fourth over which she had the power of appointment; and, it seems to me, I cannot act, in this suit, in reference to commissions to the executors of Hope Cowperthwaite\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Hannah Lippincott is surviving obligee of the securities taken to her and Hope Haines; and it is claimed that she is entitled to the possession of them. I think this is so; and for this reason; the surviving co-obligee is entitled to half the monies recovered on the securities to oblige him to divide the securities, in amount, would subject him to the risk that some retained by him might prove worthless.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">An order of reference will be made in accordance with the foregoing view.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
