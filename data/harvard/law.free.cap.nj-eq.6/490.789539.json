That at his marriage he had completed his professional studies, and was qualified and competent to engage in the business of instruction or teaching, especially of the young; and that he had in hand, of his own proper moneys, several hundred dollars; and that having been treated with rudeness and incivility by the complainant, (impelled and actuated by an evil agent and influence readily imagined from the admissions in the bill, and which this defendant cannot avert to without grief and mortification,) this defendant, yet in the lifetime of his mother-in-law, left the residence of the complainant, with the design of making, so soon as he should be able, ultimate and final arrangements for the separate and independent support of himself and family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-5\">That, with such purpose and design, he removed, in the fall of 1836, to Newton, Sussex county, and engaged in the business of a teacher for two or three months, and while so employed, upon a visit to his family, was urged by complainant to abandon his said business at Newton, and return to the vicinity of complainant\u2019s residence, the complainant then and there promising him, as an inducement for such return, to convey to his wife, in fee, a lot of land of ten acres, lying on the west side of the road leading from Boundbrook to Middlebush, and not adjoining the homestead farm of the complainant, as is stated in the bill, and would largely contribute to the building of a convenient and comfortable house thereon, for the accommodation of this defendant\u2019s family, and to be his property, in which this defendant-might resume and prosecute his business of a teacher of youth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-6\">That this defendant, relying on the faithful performance by the complainant of such explicit and solemn agreement, returned, and soon after commenced the erection of a house on said lot, and expended thereon, of his own moneys, $450, and incurred debts on account thereof to $1200, which debts the complainant, from time to time, neglected and refused to assume and pay, meanwhile leaving this defendant exposed to the clamorous demands and solicitations of impatient creditors, in direct violation of said solemn and explicit agreement before stated. That this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>state of things remained unchanged till about April 1st, 1838, when the complainant borrowed of George Windsor $1000 and applied it to the liquidation of the aforesaid debts, and, induced by the repeated solicitations of his wife, Martha Staats, afterwards executed a deed for 4 66-100 acres to his daughter, the wife of this defendant, in fee, in lieu of a conveyance of ten acres to this defendant, as was by the complainant promised as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-5\">That during the summer of 1840, this defendant, influenced by the abusive and unstable conduct of the complainant, again determined to withdraw himself from the neighborhood of complainant, and with the view of selecting a proper location, devoted between one and two months to a visit to and examination of the western part of Hew York, and that shortly after his return, that is to say, within two or three months, according to this defendant\u2019s best recollection, the complainant, without the knowledge of this defendant, and in fulfillment of\u00b0a solemn and express promise made to his said wife during her last illness and shortly before her death, made and executed a conveyance of the residue of the aforesaid farm, of which the said ten acres, promised as aforesaid, were part, by the complainant purchased as aforesaid, to his daughter, the wife of this defendant, in fee ; but in violation measurably of the spirit of each express and solemn promise, nevertheless withheld the delivery of said deed, until certain terms by the complainant propounded were complied with or assented to by this defendant, viz., that this defendant should gather the growing crops of both the aforesaid farms, estimated to amount to $800 or $900 in value, allow the complainant to take of the same sufficient for the consumption of his family and stock, and apply the residue to the payment of the debts of the complainant particularly incurred in the erection of the said house, which said debts, amounting to $1600, the complainant stipulated should be assumed and paid by this defendant, and that the complainant should have, to his own use, the one-half of the winter grain and of a thirty-acre field of grass, part of said farm, the season then next ensuing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-6\">He avers that the said terms were complied with on his part, but that subsequently the complainant refused to allow the pro-seeds of the said two farms to be divided as above stipulated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>him, and applied the whole to his own use, to the detriment and loss of this defendant of $600 or $700. And that this defeudmade and executed to George Windsor a bond and mortgage, said mortgage containing said premises, to secure $1600, being the complainant\u2019s debts, and $1000 thereof, or rather $1400 thereof, borrowed by the complainant of the said Windsor, as before stated, with several years\u2019 unpaid interest thereon, and that afterwards, a barn being built on said premises, the said debt was increased thereby, and the interest in arrear on said mortgage, to $2500, and a bond and mortgage to secure that amount executed by this defendant and his wife to Hannah and Maria Ten Eyck, of New Brunswick, the interest of which has been paid by this defendant, and that so much of the consideration of this last mortgage as was needful was applied to the payment of said mortgage to George Windsor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-5\">He says, iu correction of the erroneous or inconclusive statements of the bill in this behalf, that he remained with his family in the occupancy of said house, built as aforesaid, for four or five months, when, at the request of the complainant, he with his family removed to the house occupied by the complainant, to superintend the farming business of the complainant, and to take care of the wife of the complainant, then in feeble and declining health.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-6\">These defendants deny'that during the time of their residence with the complainant, he gave to said Freeman sums of money amounting to $300, or that he gave to these defendants personal property amounting to $1000, or that the fifth part of the tract called the basin property was worth $1000; on the contrary, they say that the complainant gave to his said daughter, during that period, property to the amount of $150 or $160 only, $65 of which was in the proper moneys of the mother of his said daughter, so deemed by the family of the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-7\">The defendant Freeman charges the truth to be, in that behalf, that the complainant, having an unsettled controversy, in 1834, with the Delaware and Raritan Canal Company, offered this defendant $100 if he would obtain a satisfactory settlement of said controversy ; and he avers that he earnestly engaged in said undertaking, at such request, and in the prosecution thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>was obliged to visit Princeton eight or ten times, and New Brunswick more frequently, and finally succeeded in arranging said controversy to the complainant\u2019s satisfaction, after great pains and difficulty ; and, in the arrangement, obtained from the company the right to erect a basin adjacent to said canal, on the lands of the complainant. And, upon the like further request of complainant, this defendant superintended the making of such basin, and when it was completed, the complainant sold it, with an adjacent lot of eighteen and three-quarter acres, for $3775 ; and in the conveyance thereof caused the name of this defendant to be inserted as one of the grantors, as an acknowledgment and compensation to the amount of $755, and not $1000, as charged in the bill, for the specific services and labors of this defendant of the nature before stated, as this defendant then supposedj such acknowledgment and compensation being freely and voluntarily made by the complainant, without any demand or request made or intimated by this defendant, or with his knowledge inducing the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-5\">They admit, with grieij the complainant\u2019s marriage with Maria Matthews.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-6\">But the defendant Freeman answering for himself, denies that, soon after said marriage, or at any time, ho insinuated to the complainant or to other persons, that the said Maria was not faithful to her marriage vows; that she was a bad woman, and would ruin complainant and strip him of his property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-7\">And the defendant Margaret is constrained by self-respect to deny that such charges and insinuations were made by her, or that by any means whatever the complainant was or could have been induced by these defendants, or either of them, to credit and believe such statements. On the contrary, they allege that, had they not been restrained therefrom by the relation subsisting between themselves and complainant, and by delicacy and propriety, yet they solemnly aver that the notoriously bad character and conduct of the said Maria made any such allegations entirely unnecessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-8\">And the defendant Freeman says that, before he ever saw or knew said Maria, the complainant, before his unhappy and disgraceful marriage with her, deliberately characterized her to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>defendant and to others as the lowest of the low; stated that she was then pregnant by a person he named, and that he never would marry her. And this defendant avers that, in less than four months after said marriage, the said Maria was delivered of the child called by the complainant in his bill his child.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-5\">These defendants say that the charges aforesaid, though not made by them, are true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-6\">Freeman denies that he urged the complainant to apply for a divorce, with or without the charges that his said wife was loose and unfaithful, and would ruin him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-7\">The defendants aver that the said Maria, after the marriage, and after she was brought home by the complainant, was frequently intoxicated, and neglected household matters, &amp;c., and that the provisions.laid up, &amp;c., were exhausted by midsummer. That, in this state of affairs, in July, 1828, the complainant and his said wife quarreled, and she withdrew from the home of complainant, after complainant had deliberately declared that if she did so she should never return.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-8\">They declare that such quarrel and withdrawal of said Maria were wholly uninfluenced by any act, procurement, or advice of them or either of them. That, on the day after said quarrel, the said Maria returned, with her sister; and that the complainant, of his own motion, and without any interference or influence by any person, of any kind, so far as these defendants have ever known or believed, refused to admit her into the house, and she accordingly went away.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-9\">They say they have heard and believe that said Maria, thereupon, consulted counsel as to her marital rights and the mode of enforcing a support from the complainant. Then it was, as these defendants aver, that the complainant, of his own motion, took Samuel Van Arsdale with him, went to Somerville, and caused to be inserted in one or both of the newspapers there published, a notice or advertisement to the effect that he would not pay any debts said Maria might contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-10\">Freeman says that the complainant, in a state of sobriety and recollection, requested him to go with him to counsel; and that, \u2022on such request, and not otherwise, he went. That the object was to advise on the practicability of the complainant\u2019s obtain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ing a divorce. That this defendant went first to the office of William Thompson, Esq., with whose view of the case the complainant was not satisfied, and himself proposed and went thence to the office of T. A. Hartwell, Esq., and advised with him, and at his request produced witnesses who were examined by said Hartwell, and a note of their testimony was taken by him in writing, on which occasion the complainant withdrew and became grossly intoxicated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-5\">This defendant avers, that the complainant, acting, as this defendant supposed, under the advice of his counsel, certainly not under the advice of this defendant, also sent said Wan Arsdale to Hunterdon, in which county the complainant had been informed, as this defendant understood, the said Maria had formerly lived, to procure testimony or information, as the complainant stated, in aid of his application for a divorce.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-6\">The defendants distinctly charge that these several stops were taken by the complainant uninfluenced in any way by them or either of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-7\">They say that while they lived apart from the complainant, having left his house in 1840, and before said Maria had finally withdrawn as aforesaid, they were repeatedly importuned by the complainant to return, especially that this defendant Margaret might superintend the household matters of the complainantj on which occasion the complainant charged his said wife with negligence, waste, and even theft, and declared that he, the complainant, would bo ruined in consequence. That from sympathy with the deplorable situation of the complainant with reference to his personal and family affairs, they consented and returned and resumed the charge of the complainant\u2019s family. Then it was, as the defendant Freeman alleges, that the complainant having sent for this defendant, the complainant being quite sober, as of himself, and speaking his own uninfluenced sentiments, declared his apprehension that his said wife, absent, and clothed by law with authority to contract debts on his account, would ruin him ; to avert which he, the complainant, proposed to convey his property to his daughter, and cause a judgment to be entered against him in favor of this defendant. And he, this defendant, utterly denies, again, that he directly or indirectly persuaded or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>urged, in any way induced or influenced the complainant so lo convey his property or confess said judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-5\">He denies that he stated to said complainant that his said wife had run him iu debt or would run him in debt, and that all his personal property would go to satisfy the debts by her contracted. On the contrary, he charges that the complainant himself made such statements, and added that she had stolen his money, and that he had not money even to pay his harvest hands, but had been obliged to borrow it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-6\">These defendants deny that on the 2d of September, 1842, at or before the execution of the deed of that date, the complainant was in a state of gross intoxication. On the contrary, they aver that, although not perfectly sober, he well knew what he was about doing, and the nature of the transaction, and freely, intelligently, and voluntarily executed said deed, and' entirely uninfluenced by these defendants or either of them in the way charged in the bill, or in any way, and that, in like manner, the execution of the promissory note was well understood by the complainant, as were the other papers connected with said judgment for $1655, that the same were the complainant\u2019s measures, suggested by him, and not by these defendants; and, as these , defendants believe and charge, perfectly understood by him. That, as to the consideration of the judgment, they submit that the said consideration was a fair, just, and legal one. That these defendants, after their marriage, for eight years lived with complainant under an assurance that he would do better for the defendant than he could do for himself elsewhere, and during that period devoted their time and services, to a very considerable extent, to the supervision and management of the family and business of the complainant, and during the whole period, received from him $80, the price of a horse given by the complainant to the defendant, and $3.50, more than which last sum was- expended by the defendant for tobacco for the complainant, at his request. That, during the said period, a very unusual amount of anxious, patient and enduring care, attention and forbearance was exacted by the situation and habits of the complainant; and that a very moderate estimate of their services for such period would, at least, amount to the consideration of the said judg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>meat. These defendants, therefore, feel authorized to deny, that when said judgment was confessed, the complainant was not justly and truly indebted to this defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-5\">The defendants deny that the person who drew said deed, after it was executed advised the complainant not to deliver it, but to wait a few days, during which he would take and keep it, and if, upon reflection, the complainant should order it to be delivered, he would do so, but not till then.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-6\">They charge that said deed was fully delivered, and the said scrivener expressly authorised by the complainant to take it and have it recorded ; that said scrivener voluntarily made the suggestion that he would retain it for a few days, that if complainant should change his mind, he might recall the deed; that such suggestion, if assented to, was scarcely adopted by the complainant, and that, for all that occurred, the scrivener was still at liberty to have the said deed and accompanying mortgage recorded forthwith, had he desired to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-7\">These defendants, and especially Freeman, deny, that while said deed was in the hands of the scrivener, he induced a delivery thereof, or influenced the mind of the complainant\u2019 against his said wife, or to deprive her of support. This defendant pronounces the whole statement utterly untrue, if not preposterous, under the circumstances of the case, as hereinbefore stated ; and, in like manner, he denies that he obtained possession of the complainant\u2019s account book, or placed within it the note referred to in the bill. On the'contrary, he charges that any such memorandum or note, if written by him, of which he has no distinct recollection, was written at the request and under the dictation of the complainant himself \u2014 placed within said book by himself, and for his own purposes, with which this defendant felt so little interest that, with the aid of the best reflection he can bestow on the point, he has not been able more distinctly to recall the occurrence. With respect, nevertheless, to the purport or substance of said memorandum, unlike the complainant, these defendants entertain no doubt that such purport and substance were entirely true. This defendant denies that he wrote said note, on the supposition that he wrote it at all, for the purpose of gel ting, fraudulently, the possession of said deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>These defendants deny that he (Freeman), while complainant was in a state of intoxication, prepared and addressed the order mentioned in the bill, or that the same is forged, or the signature thereto, or by the complainant unintelligently executed; but they affirm that said order was written early in the morning, under the dictation of the complainant, and at his request, and without the slightest influence exerted of these defendants, or either of them, and was deliberately signed by the complainant after it had been read by him and in the presence of the defendant Margaret.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-5\">They deny that the complainant, when he executed said deed, note, and warrant of attorney, had not power of mind to comprehend the contents thereof, but allege that they were fairly, intelligently, and in good faith executed, without the intervention of these defendants, their influence, or the exercise of any compulsion, concealment, or fraud, and were just, proper, and necessary acts in themselves, were designed by the complainant, and, in effect, have subserved the- true interests of the complainant hitherto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-6\">They admit that, at the complainant\u2019s request, they, shortly after the execution of said deed, removed to the house and farm in said deed mentioned, and have received the issues and profits thereof, and faithfully and liberally applied a large share thereof to the support and maintenance of the complainant and his said wife, actually advancing towards the expense of said wife, during the first year after the date of said deed, upwards of $150, and applied, of the residue, from time to time, not less than $500 towards the liquidation of the debts of the complainant, by him contracted before the execution of said deed, to which same object the complainant applied $250, by the assignment of several notes by him previously taken, and, to the time of such application, held and owned by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-7\">They admit the judgment and execution, and, after two years thereafter, a sale of the personal property of the complainant, and the purchase thereof by Freeman, and held and owned by him ever after, and that such sale was made necessary and proper by the following circumstances: that, after their removal to the homestead farm, the complainant, under agencies which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>they niZKngly forbear to specify, desired to bring his said wife back, from which he was deterred a considerable time by the declaration of these defendants that if he should persist in doing so they would leave him. Yet he, notwithstanding, brought her back. That her condaet became so intolerable that the complainant, by the advice and influence of a friend principally. Was induced to send her away again, but in doing so authorised her to iasia debts on his account. That his said wife and also the complaiBSJst did, from time to time, incur such debts, to such extent that the whole net profits of said two farms were absorbed by the payment thereof with such payments as were before mentioned,, by upwards of $200; and the complainant was subjected to suits on account thereof, before justices of the peace, and judgments rendered against, him, in consequence of all which the preservation of the just rights of this defendant made such sale necessary; at which sale he became the principal purchaser for such prices as the property would bring, as he supposed was his right and duty to do; and that the property has since remained in his possession, subject to ordinary wear and transfer for the benefit of the family, and in a good degree for the benefit of the complainant himself</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-5\">He denies that at the time of filing the bill he was engaged in cutting down large quantities of wood for sale, for rails or other purposes; or that he ever declared it was his intention to cut the whole or nearly the whole of the timber standing on said farm, so far excepted- only as was necessary to pay the costs and expenses of the litigation in which he was involved by the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-6\">In like manner, ho denies that he has carted from said premises large quantities of soil, manure or compost, or more than a just proportion of either.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-7\">He says that though the wood and trees on said farm, unless felled, will deteriorate, <em>yet </em>he has neither cut, nor authorized to be cut, any timber during the spring of the present year, other than for ordinary use for fuel, except from 150 to 200 rails, to be used on the back farm, and 4 or 5 cords of fire-wood. That during the last winter, 4 or 5 cords of wood were sold or exchanged for coal, and a shoemaker\u2019s bill of $8 or $.10 paid by so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>much wood; and none cut or disposed of beyond these items; and that, in truth, by far the greatest part of the wood cut from said premises was cut during the winter of 1842-3, to pay the \u25a0debts of the complainant, and at his request.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-5\">They deny that the complainant ever applied for or requested a re-conveyance of said farm; and in their judgments, it would-be devoted to the purposes of vice and intemperance, to the great grief of the complainant\u2019s relatives and friends, in all probability, should the complainant become re-invested with said property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-6\">On this answer, a motion was made to dissolve the injunction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-7\"><em>Leupp, </em>in support of the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1o\">He cited 1 <em>Halst.
