That Stevens nominated them the said William Cook, Richard Stockton and Isaac Fisher a committee to examine several general statements or schedules, in large sheets of paper, which had been previously laid on the table.

That the said loan was illegal, not only on the ground that the New Brunswick Co. have no authority by their charter to loan money, but because the Camden and Amboy Railroad and Transportation Co. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>have no authority to borrow money; and that the said loan is a violation of trust on the part of said Stevens, James Neilson and such other of the directors of the New Brunswick Co. as assented to it, and a violation of their duty as such directors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-5\">That ho also discovered an entry made in said book, signed by-John R.

That he then asked the chairman for the book of minutes, that he wished to examine it, and the chairman replied that he knew nothing about it; that he then applied to the secretary, R. Stockton, for the book, and he replied that the complainant could not have it, that the gate was shut. And while the complainant was talking privately with the secretary, J. R.

To this resolution some of the stockholders objected, and M. C.

This resolution was seconded by Mr. Laurence Fisher, one of the stockholders present. Upon this, E. A. Stevens rose, and in a rude and offensive manner, said, that Hager and his man William Halsted should not have the books. That while the resolution to go into liquidation was under consideration, the complainant offered, as an amendment to it, the following resolution, viz: \u201cResolved; that the books be opened to every stockholder, and time be given for examination.\u201d This resolution the chairman refused to put to-the meeting, or to allow any vote to be taken on it.

To this question J. R. Thomson replied, in a low tone of voice, that the Chancellor had enjoined E. A.

Fisher, A. S. Neilson, B. Fish, Wm. Me Knight and J. Me Knight be empowered to act with the board of directors in the sale of the property of the company. That the complainant protested, and voted against this resolution; but that the same was passed, by a majority of the \u25a0 stockholders then present; though the complainant believes, and charges, that the stockholders who voted for it were a minority of the whole number of the stockholders of the company, many of them not being present, and some of those present not voting on the resolution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\">That on all the questions submitted to the said meeting the vote was taken <em>viva voce, </em>each stockholder giving one vote.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">That the number who voted for the resolution to go into liquidation, and the resolution offered by Stevens, was not more than thirteen.

and that the resolutions offered by Thomson and Stevens wore concerted and contrived by them for the sole purpose of enabling Stevens to dispose of the property of the company without the consent of all the stockholders, and in violation, virtually, if not literally, of the injunction issued in this cause, and that the stockholders who voted for the said resolutions offered by said Thomson and Stevens were either directors or agents or engineers of the Camden and Amboy Railroad and Transportation Co., or of the Delaware and Raritan Canal Co., or interested in the same, or under the influence of the said Thomson and Stevens.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-7\">That tho directors of the company are not authorised to discontinue tho corporate business, and distribute the capital stock among the stockholders, and wind up the concerns of the company, without the consent of the Legislature, though a majority of the stockholders should consent thereto;

That if the last mentioned salo to Buckman was a <em>bona fide </em>sale, it was made at a price much less than the real value of said thirteen barges, it being only, as complainant has been informed, for about $1,400 apiece, whereas he charges that said barges, at the time of the sale, wore worth $2,000 apiece.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">The complainant charges, that said sale of the thirteen barges for the consideration aforesaid, and while the said ten barges remained unpaid for, was a breach of trust in Stevens and a violation of his duty as a director.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-6\">Tho complainant states, that ho believes that said I.

But they deny that said book was wanted by or for E. A. Stevens, and deny that the same, or the alleged copy thereof, was ever delivered to said Stevens, or has ever been in his possession or custody; and they deny that the complainant is now, or, has been since the first Monday in May, 1889, the secretary of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"200\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-3\">They admit that the complainant has not since that time been requested to attend any meeting of the board as secretary; but they deny that the reason therefor is, or that it is true, that E.

L. &amp; E. A. Stevens the money paid by them,. and assumed the payment of the said bonds and mortgages, and the said real estate continued to be so held, owned, used and enjoyed until 1839. That prior to that year it became necessary for the said transportation company to have the use of some stores and offices and water front in Philadelphia for the purposes of their above mentioned transportation business; and thereupon, and in or about 1837, the said R. L. &amp; E. A. Stevens, by and with the concurrence of the said Ferry Co., permitted the said transportation company to have the use of about one-third of the said real estate, (being the portion thereof which is denominated the Walnut street property,) at a rent of $2,800 per annum; and the said transportation company, by the authority of the directors thereof, took the possession and had the use thereof from that time, at the rent aforesaid, until the spring of 1839. That on the 20th of May, 1839, .at a meeting of the director\u2019s of said transportation company, held, on that day, the said E. A. Stevens presented a map of the said portion of the \u25a0said' real estate then rented by the said company, and submitted to the said directors the propriety of purchasing the said property, consisting of two stores, a wharf and water lot, at a price not to exceed the capital of the then present rents, viz. $46,-666 66; and it was thereupon, at the same meeting, resolved by the said directors, that the said E. A. Stevens be athorized to purchase the said property for the said transportation company, on the terms aforesaid, and that the sums paid from time to time be applied to the payment of the said mortgages on the said property; in which terms the said ferry company acquiesced, and the said suin' was afterwards advanced by the said transportation company, to effect the object of the said resolution; and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>said transportation company continued in the use and enjoyment of the said property for the purposes of their said business and of the income and receipts arising therefrom; and thereupon, or shortly thereafter, the said R. L. &amp; E. A. Stevens caused the conveyances to be prepared to vest the legal title to the same in the said last mentioned company; but before consummating the said contemplated purchase, eminent counsel in Philadelphia was consulted, and the said directors of the said company were advised, and as these defendants verily believe, truly advised, that the said company could not, under the laws of Pennsylvania, hold real estate within that State; in consequence of which advice and belief, the said deeds were never executed and delivered by the said R. L. &amp; E. A. Stevens ; but the said amount of the said purchase money had, nevertheless, in good faith, and without any knowledge of the existence of any obstacle to the said purchase, and to secure the necessary and proper use and enjoyment of the said premises for the benefit and advantage of the said transportation company, been applied to the said mortgages thereon. By reason of all which the said transportation company became equitably entitled, either to have the said money refunded to them by the ferry company, or to have and receive the proceeds of the sale of said property whenever the same should be sold; and their equitable rights in this respect were fully recognized by the said ferry company, who permitted them to continue in the use and enjoyment of the said property and of the receipts therefrom, and thereafter, in March 1846, the agent and superintendent of the ferry company stated an account of the said transaction, by crediting the. transportation company the amount of the said advance, with interest thereon, and all payments made by them on account of said property, with interest thereon, and charging them with the rent for the use of the said property and their receipts from the same and interest on such rents and receipts, by which statement it appeared that . the balance due said transportation company, according to such Statement, was $48,014 20; which sum is the amount in the bill untruly stated to be or to have been invested in property in Camden, New Jersey. And the said transportation company have not, in fact, so far as these defendants have any knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>or information, any money whatever invested in any property in Camden.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"209\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-3\">They say, that eminent counsel in the State of Pennsylvania did advise the said company that the said property could not be held in trust for' the said company; and they say, as to all the statements in the bill in regard to said Walnut street property and the said sum of $48,014 20, and in regard to the conversations or admissions of E. A. Stevens, so far as such statements in the bill are inconsistent with the truth of. the foregoing allegations in respect thereto, they are false and untrue; and, on the best of their knowledge, information and belief, they deny, that the said property has yielded an annual income of 15 per cent, upon the sum so as aforesaid advanced by the company, or any thing near it; or that the said property has in any degree increased in value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"210\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-4\">The defendant Stevens says, that E.

Stevens otherwise purchased the said property, although he acted, in procuring the conveyance, on the be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>half of the said company, and hy the authority and with the concurrence of the directors; and they deny that there was any breach of trust or violation of duty in relation thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"213\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-5\">They deny that E. A. Stevens, as sole manager or otherwise as in the bill is stated, made the loan to himself in the bill alleged ; but they say it has been the practice of the 'company from its first organization to reserve a portion of their earnings or profits, from time to time, to provide for the building or purchase of boats for the carrying on of their business as they were required, and also to provide against the very heavy risks necessarily incident to the extensive business in which they were engaged, which at times involved the transportation of more than \u00a7100,000,000 worth of goods in a year ; and that, out of such reserved earnings, the directors of said company, in or about 1840, did lend to said 11. L. &amp; E. A. Stevens, who are both of ample responsibility to render the same secure, the sum of \u00a714,400 20; but not on their personal security alone. On the contrary, they say, that the payment thereof, with interest, was secured by their note and the hypothecation of stock, worth, as these defendants believe, at least 50 per cent, more than the amount of such loan; and the same was regularly entered in the hooks of account of the treasurer of said company, the proper place for such entry; and they deny that .said loan was any breach of trust or violation of duty on their part or on the part of any of the directors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"214\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-6\">The defendants admit, that other monies have in like manner been loaned hy said directors of said company, to other individuals, amounting to $12,810 63 ; hut they say that ample security has at all times been taken and held for the repayment thereof, with interest; and they deny all breach of trust or violation of duty in regard thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"215\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-7\">They deny that any agreement was entered into by any company or companies, or on their behalf, with the said transportation company, or with any person on the behalf of the said transportation company, that the said transportation company should pay an aggregate yearly sum for transportation on the said canal, as in the bill is stated, or that any similar agreement was made, or of any purport similar to that stated in the bill.

Fish; and the accumulation of property in the hands of said company has, by the aforesaid investments, made for the purpose of carrying on its said business as aforesaid, amounted to upwards of $200,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"218\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-7\">They say that a meeting of the board of directors of the said company was regularly held on the 18th of March, 1846, at which, proceedings were had which they believe to be referred to in the bill; but no meeting was held on or about the 30th of January of that year. That J. R. Thomson tendered the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>signation of R. F.

The president declining to preside, J. Neilson was appointed chairman, and Richard Stockton was appointed director, in the place of R. F. Stockton, who was then absent from the United States. The said Richard Stockton took his seat as such director. It was moved that the connection then existing between the Camden and Amboy Railroad Co. and the New Brunswick Steamboat and Canal Transportation Co. be dissolved on and after the 1st of April; which motion was passed; the said Smith declining to vote ; and the secretary was directed to enclose such resolution to the directors of the said railroad company accompanied with the following note:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"219\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-5\">\u201cGentlemen: I am directed to enclose to you the following resolution, which has been adopted by the directors of the New Brunswick Steamboat and Canal Transportation Company, and to inform you, at the same time, that the motive for discontinuing the connection which has existed for some time with your company is the inadequacy of tlm compensation received for doing the business of the transportation on the railroad.

Stevens.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"231\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-6\">As to the amounts of the said earnings of the respective boats, vessels and lines conducting the business of said company, they cannot state whether they amount to the various sums in that behalf alleged in the bill, from the year 1836 to this time; but they admit that the amounts of such earnings have been great ; \u2022and they say they have all been duly accounted for and divided to and among the stockholders, invested, expended or reserved in manner above stated; and that, over and above the current expenses of the company, there has been actually paid, since 1836, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>for dividends, the sum of $96,000, and the amount accumulated and now belonging to the company, invested in steamboats, canal boats, and other property purchased in good faith for the carrying on of their business, together with their aforesaid reserved or surplus fund, amounts to more than four times the capital of the said company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"232\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-5\">As to the alleged concealment of the aforesaid books of account of the business of the company, or any orders or directions to have the same concealed, or any efforts made by the stockholders or any of them to see or have an opportunity to examine said books, the defendants Neilson and Thomson have made no such concealment, nor given any such orders, nor received any such application, nor had the custody or keeping of such books of account, nor had any information of any such orders, concealment or directions. And the defendant Stevens for himself says, that he has never had the said books of account in his possession, keeping or custody, the same being, at all times, in the hands of the proper agents, treasurer and other officers of said company; that he has never given any orders or directions to such agents, treasurer or other officers, to conceal the said books, or to keep the same concealed from the stockholders or from any of them; and that it is not true that he has been repeatedly called upon by the complainant, or by other stockholders, to permit them to see the books of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"233\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-6\">That, according to his best recollection, and as he verily believes, the only stockholder who has' ever, prior to the 18th of March, 1847, applied to him, or to any other agent or officer of the company to see the books of the company, was James Bishop, senior, now deceased, about three or four years since, whose object, as understood by this defendant E. A. Stevens, was to learn the value of his interest in said company as a stockholder, and in two conversations made such request. This defendant stated to said Bishop his opinion that it was important to the interest of the stockholders that the business of the company and the profits of the business should not be made public, and the interests of the stockholders be prejudiced by the competition which would thereby be attracted, and in good faith, and with the only desire to benefit the stockholders and promote their common interests, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>gave said Bishop his reasons for such opinion, which were as hereinafter more particularly stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"234\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-3\">That, though it is true that said Stevens did not exhibit to said Bishop the books of the company, or give any orders or directions to the clerks, agents, book-keepers or treasurer of the company to exhibit the same to him for his inspection, this defendant did not refuse to allow him to inspect or examine them ; but gave to him such information and explanations that he declared himself perfectly satisfied; and, so far as he, Stevens, has ever known or heard, the said Bishop was perfectly satisfied, and so continued to the time of his death. And as to any refusal by him, Stevens, to give the complainant any account or information as to the mode or manner in which the affairs of the company are or have been conducted, and as to any calls made upon him or upon any other officer or agent of the company by the complainant or any other stockholder or stockholders to see and haVe an opportunity to examine the books of said company, either in the possession of said Anderson, or the said treasurer, or of any other agent or officer of the company, or the said book of minutes, none of which were or have been in the possession or custody of said Stevens.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"235\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-4\">Stevens says, he has no knowledge, information or recollection, and does not believe, that prior to said March 18th, any such call or request was ev\u00e9r made on him or any other agent or officer, .by the complainant or any other stockholder not being a director of the company; and that the only application or applications made to him by complainant, prior to the day last mentioned, for information in regard to the affairs of the company, were for this defendant\u2019s appraisal of the value of the property of the company, consisting of steamboats, iron propellers, canal boats, and other property of the company, and a statement founded upon such appraisal of all the assets and liabilities of the company, to enable the complainant to sell his stock in the company, as hereinafter stated, and under the circumstances following, viz: at or about April 1,1846, James Bishop, junior, a stockholder, called on the defendant E. A. Stevens, and stated to him that he, Bishop, wished to sell his stock in the said \u2019 company, and with that object, and for that purpose, wished to learn from this de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>fendant what was its then value ; and the defendant, from a desire to oblige Bishop, and aid him in making a just estimate, prepared, in good faith, and according to the best information he possessed or could obtain, and according to his best judgment, this defendant\u2019s appraisal of the property of the company, and a statement founded thereon of the assets and liabilities of the company, so as to show the value of the stock; and this defendant is informed, and verily believes, that a similar appraisal, statement and estimate was, without any concert or communication with this defendant, E. A. Stevens, prepared by M. C. Smith, the president, in connection with one or more of the stockholders, which said statements and estimates were found by said Bishop very nearly to agree in their results; and thereupon, this defendant, E. A. Stevens, consented to purchase the stock of said Bishop, such purchase to bo for the company, if the board of directors should deem it expedient and for the interest of the stockholders to take the same, and if not, then for the private account of this defendant, and did purchase the same accordingly *, and the said appraisals and estimates so made, and the said sjale, were communicated to the complainant, who, thereafter, saw this defendant and requested him to buy his, the complainant\u2019s stock, at the same price: which this defendant declined, and stated to him that it had been suggested that his aforesaid estimate and statement was in some respects inaccurate ; upon which the complainant requested this defendant to reviso his aforesaid estimates, and appraisals, and prepare a now statomtnt for him; which this defendant consented to do as soon as his leisure would permit j and thereafter, on or about March 12, 1847, the complainant called on this defendant, at his private residence at Hoboken, before this defendant had been able to revise or re-examine the said statement, and urged this defendant to buy Ms said stock at the price aforesaid 5 and on several occasions the complainant saw this defendant, and made the like request; and in one instance in company with Lawrence Fisher, another stockholder, who also expressed a desire to soil Ms stock. And, so far as this defendant then had any intimation, or believed, 03\u201c now believes, the refusal of this defendant to buy the steels of the complainant was the only subject or occasion of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>satisfaction on the part of the complainant. And this defendant denies that said Bishop, junior, or the complainant, or the said Fisher, or any other of the stockholders, have made any request to see the said books of the company, or asked any other information of the affairs or business of the company, or of the manner in which the same were conducted, except as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"236\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-5\">The defendants admit and say, that said Stevens has frequently, in conversations with the stockholders or some of them, and as they believe in his said conversations with said Bishop, senior, expressed his strong desire that the business of the company and the profits thereof should not be made public, and for the reasons then and often before and since given, that it would invite competition and so prejudice the intei'ests of the stockholders ,\u2022 and that in the peculiar business in which they were engaged, it was especially important and had been found essential to success in the business, by all steamboat and transportation companies; and such was in fact his opinion, in good faith, without any concealment or deceit; and so far as he ever knew or believed, until the filing of the bill, all the stockholders concurred; and he says that, otherwise than so far forth as he entertained and expressed the said opinion, he has never expressed any unwillingness to have any of the affairs of the company, or books of account, or proceedings examined by any person, or to give any person any information in relation thereto in his power. And he says, that so far as he has had any agency, management or superintendence of the affairs of the company, the same has always been fully accounted for to the board of directors, and the business so done regularly entered in the books of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"237\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-6\">The-defendants, in relation to the alleged call made on Stevens on the 18th of March, 1847, say it is not true that Stevens stated to the complainant that he, Stevens, managed the company as a close corporation, and should not give any statements of the earnings or profits of the company to the complainant. But, on the contrary, Stevens, being in attendance at New Brunswick upon a meeting of the directors held that day, stated distinctly to the complainant, and to other stockholders then present, that he would cause a meeting of all the stockholders of the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>to be called within a few days, and that at such meeting all the books of the company, and all the accounts of the business of the company, from the first, would be laid before the stockholders for their examination; and thereupon, and without any notice of any application, by the complainant to this court, or of any intention on the part of the complainant to make such application, a meeting of the stockholders of the company was called by the secretary of the company, by authority of the said directors, to be held at New Brunswick on the 3d of April, 184V.\u2014 And for the purpose of facilitating the full and satisfactory examination of the said books of the accounts of the business of the company, and the property thereof, and all the earnings, dividends and profits arising therefrom, the said directors, without any notice as aforesaid, caused full and accurate abstracts to be made up from the said books of the book-keepers in the employment of the company, showing the assets and property of the company, the state of their said accounts, and the business, earnings, profits and dividends therefrom, and all and every the matters aforesaid, from the first organization of the company, to be laid before the said stockholders to be examined, together with the said books, to be compared therewith, and investigated as the said stockholders might think proper. .And in pursuance of such call, the said meeting of stockholders was convened, at the time and place aforesaid, and in pursuance of the assurance so given to the company, the said other stockholders, by said E. A. Stevens, and not for the purpose or with any intent to elude or evade any action or order of this court, or on account or in any manner by reason of any application to this court, but in good faith for the full satisfaction of all the stockholders, in accordance with such assurance, all the books of the said company, and the said abstracts thereof, were laid before the said stockholders by the treasurer and board of directors; and a committee was thereupon appointed to examine the same, and report thereon; by whom, during an interval of adjournment allowed for that purpose, such investigation and examination was made, and reported, and as these defendants believe, to the entire satisfaction of all the said stockholders except the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"238\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-5\">The defendants say there is no provision in the charter of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>company requiring that the office of the directors be kept in New Jersey ; but, nevertheless, they' say that an office has always been kept in New Brunswick, by the treasurer of the company, in which the hooks of accounts of the treasurer are and always have been kept.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"239\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-3\">The defendants say, that on,or about March 18, 1847, they were informed, and they believe it to be true, that the complainant was, in connection with sundry associates, about to commence the running of a steamboat from New Brunswick to New York, in opposition to the boat of the company ; and they say he has admitted that such is his intention; and they believe that the whole object of the complainant, since he conceived such intention, and the object of filing his said bill, is to create difficulty in the company, expose its affairs and the private interests of the stockholders therein to the public, and, so far as in his power; to injure and break down the business of the company. And they say that since they received such information, E. A. Stevens has, as they admit, as one of the stockholders, having a very large interest in the company, and not otherwise, remonstrated and objected to subjecting the affairs of the company to such exposure, for the reasons above set forth, and for no other reason whatever, and with no purpose, object or design than to promote the best interests of all the stockholders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"240\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-4\">The defendants say, that the said hoard of directors, and not E. A. Stevens, in the exercise of their best discretion, and, as they then believed and now believe, for the best interest of the stockholders, sold sixteen coal barges, the property of the company ; that they did not call a meeting of the stockholders to consult them\u2019in regard to such sale; that it has not been usual to call such meetings or consult the stockholders in regard to the details of the business of the company, from the first organization to the present time; these defendants believing that the purpose for which the, directors of the company were appointed was the conduct and management of such details, in their discretion, as the interest of the stockholders might require j and they deny that Stevens, or any of the defendants, or the \u2022 said hoard of directors, have any intention, of selling the said sixteen freight barges in the bill mentioned, unless the company should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>go into liquidation and cause its affairs to be wound up and settled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"241\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-4\">The defendants, denying, as before, that Stevens has independently, and not in subordination to the hoard and with their authority, concurrence or approbation, done anything in the premises, say that the business of the said company has, by and with such consent, authority and approbation, been done, and the accounts thereof kept, in and under various names used to discriminate the different branches of their business, and for greater convenience in keeping the accounts thereof and distinguishing the different interests of the various persons who have from time to time been interested with them in the business done by them or in the different branches thereof. And in so doing, although these defendants do not now recollect the use of all the names in that behalf alleged in the bill, they are willing, for the purposes of this suit, to admit, and do admit, that all of the said names may have been used for the purposes aforesaid, during the period of the existence of the company; but they utterly deny that such names have been used for the purpose of con-sealing or keeping secret the operations or business of said company from the public or the stockholders, or to prevent them, from obtaining any information in regard to the proceedings of the company, or for any unlawful or improper purpose, or from any other design or motivo than to promote the convenient, safe and successful prosecution of the said business, and make the same profitable to the stockholders for their benefit and advantage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"242\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-5\">They admit, and say, that from the time when E. A. Stevens consented, on the application of the said associates who after-wards became stockholders in the year 1881, to unite his interest in the transportation business with them, and became a stockholder, as before stated, ho has given thereto Ms best endeavors and exertions, in good faith, to promote the success of the company, enlarge its business and increase its profits for the benefit of the stockholders therein; and that in so doing he has at all times preserved a vigilant general superintendence of the affairs of the company and its various agents, and under the authority of the board of directors and with their concurrence and appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>bation and in subordination to the president and directors, has-managed the affairs and business of the company with fidelity an&lt;4 skill and greatly to the advantage of the said stockholders,, and. in such wise that the board of directors have been able to declare and pay to the stockholders annual dividends of from 16 to 18 per cent, per annum, from 1831 to this time, over and above- the current expenses of the company and the aforesaid accumulation of capital, by earnings and profits of the business of the company, invested and reserved as aforesaid, amounting to more than four times the amount of the capital paid in by the stockholders; and that, in his said general superintendence, the said Stevens has,- with the concurrence and approbation of the said board of directors, and with the full knowledge and acquaintance of all the stockholders, from the year 1831 to the filing of the bill, exercised broad discretionary powers, and that no complaint has ever been made by any stockholder in relation thereto, or the management of the affairs of the company; and in such management the said Stevens has always done what, in good faith, and in his best discretion, he deemed for the interest of the stockholders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"243\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-5\">The defendants say, that the conduct and management of the affairs of the company, so far as the same has' devolved on said Stevens as above stated, has been, and as they believe, is now entirely satisfactory to every stockholder in the company, the complainant not excepted; and in confirmation of this they say, that at the said meeting of the stockholders at New Brunswick, on the 3d of April, 1847, every share of stock was represented by the holder thereof, in person or by proxy, except two shares in the name of A. Jenkins, deceased, in behalf of whose estate, however, his brother M. Jenkins was present and acted, (in what capacity the defendants are ignorant,) and except, also, one share in the name of William Gulick, who was absent. That at such meeting the said stockholders were informed that the complainant had given notice of an intention to apply to this court for the Receivers prayed for in the bill, and thereupon the following resolution was unanimously passed by the stockholders, the complainant being present and voting for it, viz :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"244\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Resolved, That the thanks of the stockholders are due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Edwin A.

An injunction pursuant to the prayer of the hill was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">A supplemental bill was afterwards filed, stating other facts, and making other persons defendants, and praying the same relief against them; and praying that they and the defendants in the original bill may he restrained by injunction from disposing of any property of the company, and from winding up its affairs, or causing it to go into liquidation, without the consent of the stockholders. An injunction pursuant to the prayer of this hill was also allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">A motion is now made, on the part of the complainant, for the appointment of a receiver, to take charge of certain real estate situated in Pennsylvania, on the Delaware river, one tract in Bristol and the other in Philadelphia, (called the Walnut street property,) alleged by the bill to have been purchased with the funds of the said \u201c The New Brunswick <em>See.,\u201d </em>the legal title to which tracts, respectively, is in the name of one or more individuals, without the recognition of any interest of \u201cThe New Brunswick <em>See.\u201d </em>therein; and also to take charge of certain monies, alleged in the original hill to be the funds of \u201cThe New Brunswick &amp;e.\u201d in the hands of E. A. Stevens, the use of which the bill alleges he has improperly obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The answer of the defendants to the original and supplemental bill has been read in opposition to the motion ; and, among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ether things, states that the said monies were loaned to said .\u2022Stevens by the board of directors of \u201cThe New Brunswick Steamboat and Canal Transportation Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">There is one ground' on which, in view of the whole case as \u2022developed by the bill and answer, the motion for a receiver might, perhaps, be safely denied, without considering other objections to the allowance of it. From the allegations of the bill it would seem to appear, that the enormous accumulation of property by The New Brunswick Co., of which the property for which a Receiver is asked is claimed to be a part, is the result of a fraud \u2022on the rights of others, not parties to this suit, nor parties to the arrangement between The New Brunswick Steamboat and Canal Transportation Co. and the united railroad and canal companies, set forth in the bill, which produced such accumulation. And this may turn out to be so notwithstanding any thing said in the answer. If this be true, this Court would not become the instrument to distribute the spoils, on the application of one who has been a stockholder from the beginning in The New Brunswick Steamboat and Canal Transportation Co., and cog* nizant of the fraudulent arrangement and proceedings which produced such accumulation; which is the position of the complainant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">But the motion must be denied on othei grounds. As to the Walnut street property, it was in the use of 'The New Brunswick Co. a number of years, and during that time the situation of it in reference to title was the same as it is now. While the arrangement with the said united companies existed, and the business charged by the complainant to be illegal and fraudulent, and from which the overgrown accumulation of property arose, was continued, the complainant, with full knowledge of the arrangement, was silent. But when the business was discontinued, the complainant filed his bill, alleging that this property is not necessary for the legitimate business of The New Brunswick Steamboat and Canal Transportation Co., and prays that it may be sold, and the proceeds of it distributed; and asks that a Receiver may, at once, on the filing of his bill, be appointed to take \u2022charge of it. The complainant is in no more danger now in reference to the title .of this property than he has been for years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>and no apprehension of danger is alleged as to the responsibility of the person in whom the title is. Delay is often fatal to an application for a Receiver; and in this case, an application by this complainant for the prompt action be asks of the Court comes with ill grace. As to the real estate in Bristol, the title is in a director of The New Brunswick Co. whoso responsibility is not questioned; and no danger of loss is suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">As to the money loaned to Stevens: when the object of a suit is to compel the payment of a sum of money, there seems to be no propriety in ordering it to be paid to a Receiver on the filing of the bill. It may also be said, in reference to this money, that no danger or apprehension of loss is suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">It is unnecessary to consider the difficulty suggested on the argument of appointing a Receiver to take charge of real estate situated in another State.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
