Tuers, when he was enfeebled by age and infirmity, represented to the said John I. Tuers that the deed he had given to this defendant was invalid, and that this defendant had absconded and left this part of the country, and wished him to make a will, giving to him, the said Frederick Adams, some part of his property; that the said John I. Tuers for a long time refused, stating that he had already conveyed the same to this defendant, but that, finally, overcome by the importunities of the said Frederick Adams, who was not related to the said John I. Tuers, but who married a distant relative of the said Margaret Tuers, this defendant has heard that the said John I.

Tuers, so far forth as regards the said property of this defendant so conveyed by the said John I. Tuers to this defendant, is inoperative, because the right of the said John I. Tuers in the same, being for his natural life, was determined by the death of the said John I.

Garrison to foreclose his mortgage, and make all the said persons parties, so that the rights of all the said parties could be determined in such suit, and the question put at rest forever; whereupon the said Abraham H. Garrison sent his papers to the said counsel; but, owing to the difficulty of ascertaining who were the legal devisees and legatees mentioned in said will, and where they resided, the said information could not be obtained before the said Albert N. Van Voorhis filed his bill to foreclose his mortgage, and that this was the only reason why this defendant did not proceed to get possession of the said farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-5\">He saith that this defendant, being justly and truly indebted to the said Abraham H.

William H. Winters. \u2014 I am sixty-eight years old, and have always lived in Franklin township ; I knew John I. Tuers in his lifetime; knew him more than thirty years before his death ; in May, 1823,1 knew him, and heard of his having given a deed to John I. Ryerson \u2014 the time when, I do not know; at that time John I. Tuers was a very intemperate man ; had been so all along; he said he must go to hell, and that he did not care what he was doing; about, or at that time, he was frequently drunk, so that he was not able to do anything; after the deed was given he got a little better, did not drink so much, but this was some time after giving the deed; at the time, and before giving the deed, he was very generally drunk; I lived about a mile from him at that time; Tuers lived about one-half mile from Ryerson\u2019s; at that time John I. Ryerson kept liquor to sell, and Tuers went there to get his liquor; after the hubbub in his family, and his wife went to Paterson, Tuers went to Ryerson's and stayed there; Ryerson kept a grocery, and sold liquor; I have seen Tuers drinking there, and that he had too much liquor; 'I don\u2019t know that Tuers lived there, but saw him there off and on; Ryerson told me that Tuers was not fit to go to church, and he had given him a new suit of satinet, which his daughter Jenny made for him; Tuers did not stay as much as a year at Ryerson\u2019s; while at Ryerson\u2019s he was not a beast in drinking, that I saw; not so that he-laid by it; but he had too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>much liquor; he was rash in talking; can\u2019t say whether he was worse while there than he had been before; I have heard say that before this Tuers had a quarrel with his wife, and she had left him, and gone to Lake\u2019s, at Paterson; Tuers and his wife, as long as I knew them, were quarreling with each other; I know the farm that Tuers lived on; he lived on the farm till <em>he </em>died, and for as long back as I can remember; since his death, his widow and Abraham Lake have lived on it, and still live there; I never heard John I. Ryerson say for what Tuers had given him the deed, but he talked to me about it afterwards, one day, on my field, and told me he had a good deed for the property from John Tuers, as good as anybody\u2019s deed, but did not say whether Tuers had given it or sold it to him ; I never heard that he had given anything for the deed ; can\u2019t say how long after the deed was given, it was that Ryerson told me this on my field \u2014 whether ten years, or how long after; at that time, Ryerson told me that his children might as well have it as Lake\u2019s children, as they always had a nest there to eat him up. [The solicitor objects, on the part of the executors of Abraham H. Garrison, to all the declarations of Mr. Tuers, or of John I. Ryerson; also objects, on the part of John I. Ryerson, to any declarations or conversations of John I. Tuers: this objection to extend to all subsequent testimony that may be offered.] I heard John I. Tuers say that he had given Ryerson the deed, but it was good for nothing, and he could get it back again at any time he wanted; this was towards the close of his life \u2014 a year or two before his death \u2014 a little while before he died, and he was by his senses when he told me; never knew that Tuers was out of his senses, except when he was drunk; then he was everything; when perfectly sober, he was a pretty good neighbor, and his mind then was good, so far as I know; when Tuers was in liquor, he was very wild \u2014 cursed and swore, and talked at the highest rate; when he began to drink, sometimes he took a long frolic, and stayed drunk as long as he could get liquor \u2014 some shorter and some longer; I don\u2019t know, of my own knowledge, that he was in one of his drunken frolics at the time his wife left him, and he went to Ryerson\u2019s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-5\">Being cross-examined, deponent says \u2014 John I. Tuers never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>had any children at home or anywhere else, that I ever heard of; I don\u2019t think he was over eighty years of age when he died, but he was between seventy and eighty; I cannot say whether the hubbub which occurred in the family of Tuers when his wife went to Paterson, was before or after I heard of the deed being given ; I cannot say that, at that time, Tuers moved to Ryerson\u2019s, nor that he made his home there, at all, but he was there sometimes; I don\u2019t know of his ever staying there three days in succession, as I was not there to see him every day; some years afterwards, he got quite over his drinking; he became quite a man, and talked quite like a different man; he lived a different life, it appeared, from what he had done; from that time on, he remained quite a different man; could not call him a drunken man from that time; I cannot say that he was drunk when the deed was given, as I was not present; Tuers could get liquor, always, on credit, when he wanted it, as I suppose, for he had a good property; I don\u2019t know that he could always get to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-5\">Lawrence John Ackerman. \u2014 I am fifty-six years old, and have always lived in Franklin township; I knew John I. Tuers as long as I can remember; I lived about one-half mile from him, till within nine years last past; I understood that Tuers had given a deed to Ryerson, but the deed may have been given six months, perhaps, before I heard it; at that time, when the deed was given, Tuers was in the habit of drinking some, and both before and after that; when he was a-drinking in his frolics, he was quite rough; when he was in the way of drinking, he was like other people when half drunk \u2014 not capable of doing business; about the time of the giving of the deed, he was not half the time drunk, but he took hard frolics; he was sober a good deal more than half the time; I saw him buy liquor wherever he happened to be when he wanted it; he bought it whenever he had a chance; I do not remember having ever seen him buy any liquor at John I. Ryerson\u2019s; Tuers and his wife were quite often in trouble \u2014 disputes between them; I think his wife was away at Paterson, one time, and think it was after the deed was given ; I know there was once a vendue of personal property at Tuers\u2019, but who was the manager, I cannot tell; I don\u2019t know whether Ryerson collected the money of the vendue; Tu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ers\u2019 wife was there at the time of the vendue ; I think this vendue was before the deed was given j at the vendue there was some of the household furniture sold ; cannot say how much ; I don\u2019t remember that anything else, except what was in the house, was sold; I cannot tell that the vendue was while he and his wife were separated, but I know she was home at the vendue ; it was said at the vendue, among the people, that the vendue was made to spite and oppose his wife; Ryerson was at the vendue; he was around there; I don\u2019t know that he had any management of any consequence; he was helping hand out the things; I have heard Tuers tell Ryerson how his wife was; and Ryerson answered that if he had a wife like that, he would kick her out of doors; this was about the time of the vendue, but not at the vendue; after the vendue Tuers was sometimes home, sometimes at Ryerson\u2019s, and running about a good deal; I cannot tell whether or not Tuers was in liquor at the time of the vendue; at the time of the vendue, and before and after, Ryerson and Tuers were together a good deal, and Ryerson called him \u201c Uncle John; \u201d he was not Ryerson\u2019s uncle; during this time, while Tuers was in a frolic, he was a man of bad disposition, ami would do mischief to anyone he had a grudge against; Tuers was a man easily persuaded to anything, and to all appearance, I suppose he was a good deal under Ryerson\u2019s influence at the time; Tuers never told me that he would put big property out of his hands, so that his wife could not get it; I never heard him make any threats about her; I don\u2019t know that Mra, Tuers was kept out of doors at the time of the vendue, but I know she was opposed to the vendue; about eleven years ago, when I was at work mowing grass, Tuers came to me and after talking I told him he might rather have kept his property in his own hands; he answered that that was all nothing, as they had an article between them, so that he could get the deed back again at any time he wanted to do so; he did not tell me why he had done it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-5\">And being cross-examined, deponent says \u2014 When Mr. Tuers was free from liquor, he was a sensible man and capable of doing business; he was then a good-natured man; when he was in liquor he was foolish, and would do almost anything ; I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>have never known him, whenever in liquor, to make bad bargains in buying and selling property; he was in the habit of buying and selling; the biggest part of the neighbors were at the vendue; at the time of the conversation between Tuers and Ryerson, when Ryerson told him \u201cthat if he had a wife like that he wmuld kick her out of doors,\u201d Tuers told him that his wife was carrying things to the neighbors, such as bedding out of the house, blankets, &amp;c.; he also complained that she was mischievous ; that she did not give him good answers; that she quarreled with him, and had disputes with each other; that he could not live in peace with her; he did not complain to Ryerson that his wife was keeping with another man; I never heard him complain of that; I have heard a story of that kind in the neighborhood, that she kept with another man, but never heard Tuers had complained of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-5\">Being re-examined-in-ehief, deponent saith \u2014 I have heard the story from others besides Ryerson, about Mrs. Tuers keeping with another man, and I have heard Ryerson talk about it; I have heard this story from others besides those to whom Ryersan had told it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-6\">Being again cross-examined, deponent saith \u2014 That Ryerson did not tell me that he heard Tuers speak about his wife in this way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-7\">Elizabeth Van Houten. \u2014 I am sixty-seven years old, and have lived in Franklin over fifty years; I lived about a mile from Tuers, and was well acquainted with him the whole time; he was a very intemperate man ; many a night he has laid on the floor at our house; I heard of the deed being given the same year he was in the habit of getting drunk; it all happened when he was a drunken man ; I don\u2019t mean he was drunk at the time the deed was given, because I know nothing about that; about that time he was at my house frequently; was in the habit of coming there; a fortnight before Tuers died, I was there at Tuers\u2019; he told me that he now felt so well satisfied in his mind that he had made his will; that he wanted to send for Mr. Fredericks, but had no chance; I asked him how he could make a will? he said, why? and I said to him, don\u2019t Ryerson own it; the devil, says he, I have fixed it iust as I wanted; then I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>asked him if Ryerson had not a deed ; he said no ; what Ryerson had was good for nothing ; that Ryerson knew that the place belonged to him, (Tuers,) and that he willed it away; after-wards I told this conversation to Mr. Ryerson, and he said that old Tuers would talk a good deal, but said nothing further about it; Tuers lived on the place, and appeared to use it as his own up to the time of his death, the same as before the deed was given, as far as I saw; I was present at Tuers\u2019 vendue; household furniture was sold ; I don\u2019t know who held the vendue, but, at the time, it was said and understood that William Voorhis, who then lived on the place, and Mr. Ryerson, held it; Ryerson was active about the vendue, and was giving directions there; I think the vendue was before the deed was given, but cannot say how long; it was held while Tuers and his wife were separated, while she lived at Lake\u2019s, at the Ponds; she was at the vendue; she got in the kitchen, but not in the house; the neighbors kept her out; Mr. Ryerson kept her out of the house j Mr. Ryerson was the only one kept her out; at the time Mr. Tuers was very much opposed and violent to his wife; Tuers and his wife lived apart a year or a year and a half; when Tuers was in his frolics he would talk that, out of his spite, he would put his property out of his hands, so that his wife could not get it; I expect he meant out of spite to her and her friends ; at the time of the vendue, I believe Tuers was partly sober, so that he knew what he was about; not very bad in liquor that day ; about the time of the vendue and the giving of the deed, I very seldom saw Tuers entirely sober; at one time Tuers talked to my husband about giving him a deed for the place, that he would sell it to him, not give it to him; and he said that he could not do it; don\u2019t remember that he said he wanted to do it to keep his wife out of it; he said he would sell it and frolic it up, so that nobody should have anything of it, but he would have all the good of it himself; about the time the deed was given I have known him to go through the woods at our house, and get lost, aud he would lie and halloo, and our folks would go and get him right again ; Mr. Van Houten, my husband, is dead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-5\">Being cross-examined, deponent saith \u2014 when Mr. Ryerson kept Mrs. Tuers out of the house, he did not take hold of her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>put her out;

Tuers ; I was adopted by them when a child, and lived in their family until the year 1821; I had then been married seveii years, when I moved to about a mile from Tuers\u2019 house, and lived there about four years, until the spring of 1825, when my husband and myself mbved back to Tuers\u2019; I then lived at Tuers\u2019 for four years; I recollect the time of Tuers being separated from his wife; it was during the first four years that I lived away from him, between 1821 and 1825; when I went back to them, in the spring of 1825, they had lived together again for one year; they lived apart about a year and a half; don\u2019t know that it was quite a year and a half, but over one and less than two years; while they were separated Mrs. Tuers lived with me, at my house, and during that time Mr. Tuers was a part of the time at John I. Ryerson\u2019s and a part of the time at his own house, I believe; he was backwards and forwards ; it was generally understood in the neighborhood that Tuers resided at Ryerson\u2019s ; during the time of that separation, and just before and afterwards, he was almost the whole time in liquor; 1 saw him quite often during that time, sometimes he came to my house, sometimes he passed by ; I never saw him sober in that time, and when he was in liquor he was very unreasonable \u2014 the worst man that I ever saw when in liquor; Ryerson had had a grocery in the neighborhood for the sale of liquor for some years before I left Tuers\u2019 the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>time, cannot tell how long; after this grocery was opened, and Tuers got running there, he got a great deal worse than he had been before; the year before I left there he got very outrageous; when in a frolic he was very ugly to his wife, more so than to other people; he treated me very kindly, even when he was drunk; at one time I went to Ryerson\u2019s and saw Tuers there drunk, sitting there, and heard Ryerson putting him up against his family, and heard Ryerson tell him, that if it was him, he would clear the whole damned lot out; when Tuers came home in liquor he was always ugly and quarrelsome towards his wife ; Ryerson was intimate with Tuers, but was an enemy to the family as long as I can remember; when Ryerson came to see Tuers, he seldom or never carne into the house, but sneaked around out of doors to find him ; at the time of his separation from his wife, I never saw Tuers sufficiently sober to do business; from what I know of Tuers\u2019 habits before and at that time, I don\u2019t think he was ever, at .that time, sufficiently by himself to do business or give a deed ; in 1825, after we had moved back to Tuers\u2019, he had, the same spring, a settlement with Ryerson, and came into my room one evening, and asked one Chester Abby, then a school teacher there, to go with him to Ryerson\u2019s to settle; Tuers could neither read nor write ; when they came back, they came into the room where I was, and got into conversation about the settlement, and Abby said to Tuers, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, Mr. Tuers, what you ought to have done, you ought to have taken that deed when Mr. Ryerson offered it to you ; \u201d Mr. Ryerson had said to them, while lookiug over the papers, \u201c here is that deed, what are you going to do with it; \u201d and Tuers told Abby \u201c that it was not good for anything, what would I do with it;\u201d I was present at the vendue, and Ryerson was boss, with William Van Voorhis and Lawrence Ackerman; all the furniture was sold, except one bed; the bed was reserved for Mr. Tuers; there was no bed reserved for Mrs. Tuers, I asked him myself; when Mrs. Tuers and I tried to go into the house that day, Ryerson and his wife, and Ackerman and wife, and Van Voorhis, were in the house, and the door was shut upon us; I did not see who shut it; they were handing out things to sell; there was a hubbub, more like war than like a vendue; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Mrs. Tuers did uofc get into the house at all that day, but only into the kitchen; Tuers was not perfectly sober when the sale commenced, and before it was over he sat in the kitchen stiff drunk; I did not see Tuers do anything at all in managing the sale; during the first of the sale I went to him, while he was in the door-yard, and asked him to reserve a bed for Mrs. Tuers; he said he would see about it; and afterwards, before they came to it, I went to him and asked him again, and he said he would be damned first; when I spoke to him in the door-yard Ryerson and others were about, but can\u2019t say that any of them were present and heard the conversation; at Mrs. Tuers\u2019 request, I also went to Tuers and asked him for a brass kettle that she got of. her mother, and he said she should not have it; it was then sold, and Mrs. Ryerson bought it; after Mr. Tuers and his wife came together again, he became quite temperate, he became a nice man; after Mr. Ryerson opened his grog shop, and Tuers began to go there, he began to grow ugly towards me and my husband ; before that he treated me well; in the year 1825, when we came back, he gave to my husband a deed for a part of his main farm; from that time'to the present my husband and those to whom he sold, have always been in possession of that part; Frederick Adams is no relation of Mr. Tuers; his wife is great-niece of Mrs. Tuers; I am a niece of Mrs. Tuers; I never knew Tuers\u2019 sister Rachel, the wife of Michael Moore, but have often heard him talk of her; they lived in New York at the time, I believe; Mrs. Moore is dead 5 I knew one son of hers, named Samuel, who lived in the English neighborhood ; 1 believe he is dead too; I never knew any other of her children; I don\u2019t know any other children of Rachel Moore, but have often heard she had eight or nine; I knew Tuers\u2019 sister Mary, the wife of Jacob Fredericks ; she is dead, and left three daughters, and one son, named Jacob, now living; they are said to be all living; I did not know Tuers\u2019 sister Leah, the wife of John King; she is dead, and left one son, whom I saw at Paterson, after having been to see Mr Tuers; this son has died since Tuers\u2019 death, leaving one son, now living; I have seen him within a few weeks, and understand his name is Jacob King.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Being cross-examined, deponent saith \u2014 I never saw Rachel Moore, or any of her family, at Mrs. Tilers\u2019, that I'know of; I never saw Leah King, nor any of her family, at Tuers\u2019; Mr. Ryerson had a cotton-mill, grist-mill, saw-mill, and part of the time a bark-mill; when we moved away from Tuers\u2019 the first time, to the Ponds, we had.a farm, and kept tavern; Mr. Tuers used to come to the tavern that we kept; sometimes he got liquor there, sometimes not; sometimes he was drunk there; he was always drunk when he came there; sometimes I refused to give him drink; sometimes I had to give it to him for peace\u2019 sake, as I was afraid of him; while Mrs. Tuers was living with us, I saw Mr. Tuers as often as once a fortnight, or once in three weeks; I went with Mrs. Tuers to the vendue; I went to see, like other folks; she wanted me to go with her, and she went there to see if she could not save some of her things that she had brought there from her mother; she did not go there to make a disturbance; she made a good deal of noise at the sale; she got a crying, and cried wonderfully, and she talked, too; don\u2019t recollect what she said, nor that she made a good deal of noise, otherwise than by crying; there was a good deal of noise there; more like war than a vendue; I don\u2019t know of any disturbance among the others, except what arose from Mrs. Tuers being there; I made no disturbance there; Mr. Ryerson and myself have never been at variance; we have never been intimate ; he has always been unfriendly to me, and I treated him the same as he treated me; last Saturday I met him on the Paterson bridge, when he turned his head the other way, and did not speak to me; by Mr. Ryerson\u2019s sneaking about the house, I meant he did not come into the house; when he came to see us, he came about the barn and - barn-yard, and around openly, so that we could see him; he did not come into the house and house-yard ; he does the same now; before that conversation in my room with Mr. Abby, Tuers had always denied to his wife that he had given a deed to Ryerson; this was the first that she knew of it with certainty ; she flew into a passion when he said so, and made a great noise about it; this was the spring of the first year after my return, in 1825.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-5\">Abraham Lake. \u2014 I have known Mr. Tuers, and lived in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>neighborhood for between thirty and forty years : I arn the husband of Margaret Lake, the last witness; I went to live in Mr. Tuers\u2019 family when I was first married, a little over thirty years ago ; I lived there at that time for seven or eight years ; when I first got there, Tuers was quite a peaceable man to live with ; he drank, then, but after a while he got so Intemperate that there was no living with him ; when 1 first got there I cannot say with certainty that Ryerson kept a grocery store for the sale of liquor ; before I left, he did keep a grocery store, and sold liquor j Tuers was in the habit of going over in the direction of Ryerson\u2019s, and I saw him return from that direction ; I cannot say that he got liquor there, but there was no other place in that quarter where he could get it; sometimes he would bring liquor home with him ; he was not much at home; he would be home a little while, and then be off again; he went in the direction of Ryerbou\u2019s, and came back from that way oftener than any other direction ; that was his general route; the last part of this time I lived there, Tuers was hardly ever sober; he was scarcely by his senses any part of that year or two; after we moved away, and during the separation between Tuers and his wife, I used to see Tuers go backwards and forwards, once in a week, or every two or three weeks \u2014 -I can\u2019t exactly say how often; I have seen him go past more than once, when he was lying in the back part of Ryerson\u2019s wagon, seemingly not able to sit, and Ryerson\u2019s wife and daughter on the seat of the wagon; he appeared to me at those times to be dead-drunk; during the time I was living at Tuers\u2019, he was at Ryerson\u2019s quite a good deal; he was from home a good part of his time ; whether he was at Ryerson\u2019s all the time, I can\u2019t say, but I have seen him there; during the time that Tuers and his wife were separated, I don\u2019t know that I ever saw him sober; from my knowledge of his habits before the separation, and from what I saw of him during that time, I should say that, during the separation, he was never in a condition to do business ; I heard of the deed to Ryerson before I got my deed from Tuers ; Tuers conveyed to me a part of his homestead ; my deed was for twenty-one one-hundredths acres, and was given to me about the year 1825; as the consideration for this deed, I was to pay $300 debts for Tuers; I should say this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>was about the value of the land, or pretty near to it; I paid this $300 of debts for him, and have got the receipts for it; he proposed it to me; came to me crying, and said that he had about so much debt that must be paid, and if I would come back to live there, and pay it, he would give me a deed for a certain part of his farm; he did cnot say that Ryerson was to have paid these debts; before I got my deed, there was a report in the neighborhood that Ryerson had a deed for the farm ; and, to be sure about it, I went down to the record, and found there was none on record, so I took my deed and came right down and had it recorded; I got the deed before I moved back to Tuers\u2019; I meant to be safe about it; we went back to Tuers\u2019, after having been away from there four years; then I lived with him four years, and moved away again; I have never lived with him since; when-I first went back there, and when his wife and he got together again, he was not quite so bad; but after that he got worse again; the constables came there, and' rather than have them come there so often as they did, I paid the money before I was bound to pay it, as I was to have made it off the farm first; and when Tuers found out that I had nearly paid the debts, he got running to Ryerson\u2019s, and became worse again; I was obliged to leave Tuers\u2019 then, on account of his intemperance; he threatened to burn us all up ; he continued drinking until his leg got injured, when he had to stop it and leave off drinking; his legs became almost rotten, and when he died they were really rotted off; it was not five years before his death when his leg was injured, and he stopped drinking; after I left his house I moved to Paterson, in 1829, when I did not go back there for some time; after I lived in Paterson, I saw Tuers sometimes come to market there, and sometimes, on such occasions, he was sober, and sometimes he had been drinking; I have now got possession of the place, under Mrs. Tuers, I believe; she and I live there, and have possession of the whole of it; she and I have had the possession ever since Tuers\u2019 death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-5\">Being cross-examined, deponent saith \u2014 Before I left Tuers\u2019 I can\u2019t say how long Ryerson had kept liquor at his store for sale; Mr. Tuers appeared to be pretty near right when I got my deed; this was at the time when he was in want of money, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>and after all had been taken away from him, and when he was a little better; it appeared that he knew what he was about when he gave me the deed; Chester Abby drew the deed, and Abraham Man Cleve took the acknowledgment; there was, at the same time, an article between Tuers and myself, drawn by Man Cleve; the article was, that I was to have the deed for a certain part (which deed I got), and I was to pay $300 debt, and I was to have the whole farm ; and both of our families were to have their living out of it first, and the overplus should go to pay this debt of $300; and when it was paid, the article was to be given up, and the part I had a deed for should be mine; after this \u2014 before I left Tuers\u2019 and went to Paterson \u2014 he sued me for cutting wood, and I left there; since Tuers\u2019 death, I have been cutting wood on the farm; I have cut it under the orders of Mrs. Tuers, and took some down, and got tea and sugar with it, under her orders; I have worked the place on shares for Mrs. Tuers, since her husband\u2019s death;

Ryerson, but he did not express to me exactly what it was; I don\u2019t know that he did, particularly, state to me his impression as to whether the paper he had was good or not; he told me either that the paper was in the hands of Garret Man Dicn, or at Hackensack, if I recollect right, and said that he did not mean to bother himself about it, or something to that effect \u2014 that he was getting old; I was one of the appraisers who appraised Mr. Garrison\u2019s effects after his death; there was no mortgage, or deed in the nature of a mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>gage, to my knowledge, produced to the appraisers by his executors, to be appraised; the notes of John I. Ryerson were produced, and appraised as notes simply; I can\u2019t say whether the notes had seals to them; I know the Tuers farm; can\u2019t say what its value is; don\u2019t recollect the number of acres in it; the farm is a rough kind of an establishment; I would not undertake to affix a value to it; I knew John I. Tuers about, the time he was separated from his wife; I knew him from about the year 1820 to his death; for a year or two \u2014 perhaps a little more\u2014 before his death, he was a little reformed as to temperance, but before that, he was a miserable wretch; I mean he was a miserable drunkard; I kept a public house for several years, and my sons have kept it since; I have always resided in the same house there; I can\u2019t say that I ever knew a more miserable, besotted drunkard than John I. Tuers was; if he got out where there was liquor, he was not apt to keep sober; I suppose that, before he reformed a little, in his latter days, he was in the front rank as to drunkenness; this continued until within a few years of his death; after that, he came frequently to my house, after groceries and the like, and he said he did not dare to drink, on account of his sore leg; when in liquor, he was pretty roaring; liquor always appeared ,to make him kind of crazy; not oftentimes when I saw him, during the first ten years and more, down to 1835, that I knew him, was he in a fit condition to give a deed for his property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-5\">Being cross-examined, deponent saith \u2014 When I saw him, it was, principally, from home; I have seen Tuers at his own house, too, but can\u2019t say that I have been there often \u2014 once, twice, or oftener; can\u2019t say how often; when I saw him at his own house, I don\u2019t distinctly recollect how he was, as to liquor; from my own knowledge, I don\u2019t know how he was at home \u2014 whether temperate or not \u2014 but have seen him at his house when he was drinking hard cider; I was not present when he made his will, and don\u2019t know how he was then.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-6\">Rachel Blauvelt. \u2014 I am a daughter of Judge Martin Van Houten, senior; I was born and brought up at the Ponds, and lived there till a few years ago; I knew John I.

he would take a glass sometimes, but I have known him more than once to refuse it; he has refused to drink with me, and said he was afraid to drink on account of\"his sore leg; I like a glass sometimes, and I always asked him to drink if he was present;

when Tuers was sober, I thought he was about as capable of doing business as any other man without learning ; Ryerson gave up his store and selling liquor as much as twenty years ago ; he did not sell liquor nor <em>keep store, to </em>my knowledge, <em>in </em>1831;

my lease from Tuers is about yet somewhere ; the rent was ten dollars ; I never lived in the house with Tuers; never lived on his place, except the part I built on ; I worked it for Tuers on shares, two, three or four different years, but not successively; I never worked the whole of the farm of Tuers on shares, except perhaps, one year ; he generally kept a potato patch and garden for himself; I have torn down the house that I built upon <em>the seven or </em>eight acres;

I always considered my title good enough ; my barn and hovel are yet on the land ; I built the house in the year 1831, the same spring T got the lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-5\">[The complainants produce and offer a deed from John I.

This shows that the deed was inoperative up to August 20th, 1831, more than eight years after it was left with Ryerson.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">To estimate, rightly, the transaction of August 20th, 1831, the testimony as to the habits of Tuers, and his capacity to make a deed at the date of the deed, and from that time onward, and to a period subsequent to August, 1831, must be taken into consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The testimony shows such a state of mental and physical imbecility in Tuers \u2014 the result of excessive and long-continued intemperance \u2014 that a deed from him, without consideration, to a man who, from day to day, ministered to his passion for strong drink, if it had been accepted by Ryerson, would, I think, at this day, be declared void. Ryerson\u2019s own conduct in reference to the deed, shows a consciousness on his part, that it could not be considered a valid deed. This consideration has great influence in our examination of the transaction of August, 1831, That transaction was based by Ryerson and Van Dien on the instrument purporting to be a deed made in 1823.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The deed being admitted by Ryerson to be inoperative, up to August, 1831, the allegations of the answer on which Ryerson claims that the deed then became valid, must be proved. The proof does not sustain the answer. On the contrary, the testimony in relation to the transaction of August, 1831, compared with the answer, and the nature of the writing then given by Ryerson \u2014 called, in the answer, a lease for life \u2014 and the fact stated by the witness Van Dien, that that writing was not seen by or read to Tuers, throw too much suspicion on that transaction to permit the court to say, from anything which took place, that any such assent was given by Tuers to this last arrangement as would give life and effect to the writing purporting to be a deed made iu 1823.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>I am willing to order a reference, for the purpose of ascertaining how much Ryersou has paid, and when, and how much he received from the sale of the goods at the vendue, or otherwise, from Tuers, reserving the question whether he shall have a lien <em>\u25a0on </em>the lands for what he may be found to have paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Decree for complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Affirmed, 2 <em>Hal.
