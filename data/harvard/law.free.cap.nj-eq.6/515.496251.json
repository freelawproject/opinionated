The other ground or reason now set up for the making of the conveyance, namely, the providing for his imbecile daughter after his death, was not, it appears to me, the real motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">I am of opinion that a voluntary conveyance by a main, on the eve of marriage, unknown to the intended wife and made for the purpose of defeating the interest which she would acquire in his estate by the marriage, is fraudulent as against her. I see no sound distinction between this case and the like conveyance by a woman under like circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Decree for complainant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
