Eliza continued to live with her father until his death, on the 26th January, 1830. Immediately after his death, Eliza took possession of the house and lot and the household furniture. She sold the household furniture and other personal property of the testatrix, and converted it, or the most of it, into money, and placed the moneys arising therefrom at interest, or purchased stocks therewith, or otherwise invested the same, and conveyed the said house and lot for the consideration of $ \u2014 , which sum was placed at interest, or invested in stocks or otherwise, and has been kept at interest or otherwise invested ever since by her trustee hereinafter named.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Shortly after the execution of the conveyance by the said Eliza of the said house and lot, an ante-nuptial contract was made between the said Eliza and her intended husband, Andrew C\u201e Armstrong, and William Kent, party thereto of the third part, reciting that the said Eliza was possessed of and entitled to certain personal estate, viz: a bond and mortgage for $2,000, (describing them,) dated November 1, 1836, a bond and mortgage for $1,400, (describing them,) dated December 1, 1835, and 17 shares of bank stock, (describing them,) and two shares of insurance stock, (describing them,) and that a marriage was intended &amp;c.; and that it was agreed that all the personal property of the said Eliza should be settled as therein provided; and conveying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the said personal property mentioned in the said marriage articles, and all other personal property of the said Eliza, to 'William Kent, in trust for the said Eliza until the said marriage, and after the marriage to collect and re-invest the same; and during the joint lives of the said Eliza and Andrew to hold, convey and transfer the said property and pay and apply the interest, dividends and income thereof to such persons and for such purposes as the said Eliza should, from time to time, notwithstanding her coverture, by any writing under her hand direct or appoint; and in default of such appointment, to apply and pay such interest, dividends and income into the hands of the said Eliza, for her sole and separate use and benefit, independent of her said intended husband, and without being subject to his debts or control; and, from and after the death of the said Andrew, if the said Eliza should survive him, to convey said property and pay all the interest and income thereof to the said Eliza, absolutely, and free from all trusts. But if the said Eliza should die before the said Andrew, then to convey such property to such person or persons as she should by will or deed, executed in the presence of two or more witnesses, direct and appoint <em>% </em>and in default of such appointment, in trust for the said Andrew, during his natural life, and on Ms death to hold the said property for, or to convey the same to such person or persons as, at the time of the death of the said Eliza, should be, according to the laws of the State of New York, the next of kin.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The marriage took place, and the trustee, William Kent, received the property mentioned in the marriage settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Eliza R. Armstrong died November 27, 1889, without issue and intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The bill prays that the equitable rights of the complainants Charles M. Armstrong and Margaret Salter under the will of their said mother bo ascertained and finally settled <em>i </em>that the rights of the said complainants to the said house and lot may be established, and that the sale thereof by the said Eliza may be set aside or declared void j and that the heirs of Peter Kean, deceased, (made parties defendants,) may convey the legal title to the said house and lot to the complainants Charles and Margaret, and that the possession of the said house and premises be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>delivered to them 5 and that an account may he directed to he taken of the rents and profits thereof since the death of the said Eliza, and that they may he paid to the complainants Charles and Margaret, and that an account may he decreed to he taken of all the rest and residue of the estate of the said testatrix whieh is given by the said will to the complainants Charles and Margaret in the event of the death of the said Eliza \u201cwithout heirs and intestate,\u201d and of the sales and investments thereof, \u2022and of the part or amount thereof transferred to the said William Kent, in trust as aforesaid, by the said marriage articles, and of the investments made thereof by him, and of what he has received for the interest, dividends and income thereof, since the death of the said Eliza, and that he may he decreed to pay or deliver the same to the complainants Charles and Margaret.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Andrew C. Armstrong, William Kent, James Nutman, (who claims the house and lot by mesne conveyance thereof from Eliza\u2019s grantee thereof,) and and the heirs of Peter Kean, deceased, are made defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Assuming that the bonds and mortgages, stocks und personal property conveyed by the said marriage settlement to W Kent, in trust as therein stated, are the proceeds of the property devised and bequeathed by the will of Margaret Armstrong to Eliza R. Armstrong, in the manner in the said will provided, with the limitation over as also therein provided, the questions presented for consideration are the same as would be presented to a court of law under a will'Made by one having the legal estate in this real and personal property devising and bequeathing to Eliza R. Armstrong in the manner provided by this will with the limitation over therein provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">It is a devise of all the rest and residue of the estate, real, personal or mixed, to Eliza R. Armstrong, to he by her possessed, enjoyed and occupied to her and her heirs forever; but if she should die without heirs and intestate, then that' all the estate above devised to her shall vest in her brother Charles M. Armstrong and sister Margaret Salter and their heirs, to be divided between them, share and share alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The questions presented are s</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">1st. Whether these clauses taken together, and by force' of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>the words \u201cand intestate,\u201d do or do not give to Eliza a fee simple in the lands, and an absolute property in the personal estate, or if not a fee simple in the lands, an absoluto property in the personal estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">2d. If by force of the words \u201c and intestate\u201d neither a fee simple in the lands, nor an absolute property in the personal estate is given, what estate is given to Eliza in the lands <em>1 </em>Is it a fee tail in Eliza, with a contingent remainder over to Charles and Margaret, or is the limitation over to Charles and Margaret an executory devise <em>1 </em>In other words, are the words \u201cwithout heirs,\u201d or the words \u201cwithout heirs and intestate,\u201d to be construed to mean an indefinite failure of issue, or only a failure of issue at the time of Eliza\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">8d. If the will he construed to give Eliza an estate tail in the lands, what estate or interest had she in the personal property <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"APk\">4th. Tf the limitation over be construed to he an executory devise, is (such) a limitation over of personal property on -one\u2019s dying without heirs and intestate within the rules of law 1</p>\n<p id=\"AqP\">5th. What was the effect in law of the deed from Margaret Salter, Charles M. Armstrong and Edward Armstrong to Eliza Rosetta Armstrong, referred to in the pleadings, and how does it affect the trust to William Kentl</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">These I conceive to he questions involving rules of property that should be settled by the law courts, and I shall accordingly direct a case to be made for the opinion of the Supreme Court thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The case was argued before the Supreme Court, and the following is a copy of the opinion certified by the Supremo Court to the Chancellor. C</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">NEW-JERSEY SUPREME COURT.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">OCTOBER TERM, 1848.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">Between Charles M. Armstrong, Wil-] liam I). Sadter and Margaret his wife, and Geo.

And I further report as the opinion of the said Court, that the deed referred to did not, in the view taken of the case by the Court, affect the trust in William Kent.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\">Dated, 10th February, 1849.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">HENRY W.
