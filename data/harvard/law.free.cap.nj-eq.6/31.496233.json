Shawger a mortgage on four lots separately described in the mortgage. On the 8th August, 1827, the mortgage was assigned by the mortgagee to William Winters, the complainant. On the same 8th August, 1827, the tract first described in the mortgage was conveyed to Peter D. Henderson. On the 24th September, 1880, the administrator of the mortgagor conveyed the three other tracts described in the mortgage to J. J. Shawger, the original mortgagee, who had previously assigned the mortgage as aforesaid. John Smith and Richard R. Smith are in possession of the said throe tracts, claiming title under deeds from J. J. Shawger and the heirs at law of the mortgagor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-9\">The bill was filed June 19,1845, by William Winters, for the foreclosure of the mortgage and sale of the mortgaged premises, against Henderson and his wife and the Smiths and their wives.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-10\">The Smiths filed a demurrer to the bill, Henderson and wife failed to appear, and a decree <em>pro. con. </em>was entered against him on the 18tli September, 1845. The demurrer of the Smiths was overruled December 16,1845. They neglected to answer; and in March, 1846, without any order of reference to a Master for the purpose of getting a report how the property should be sold, a final decree was taken against all the defendants, in the general form, for the sale of so much of the mortgaged prem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ises mentioned in the bill as would be sufficient to satisfy the mortgage; and a <em>fi. fa. </em>was issued to the sheriff, commanding him to make sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-5\">On the 29th August, 1846, Henderson filed his petition, stating, that, immediately after the service of the subpoena on him, he, being ^ignorant of the character of the process and of his duty under it, and believing it to be necessary for him, personally, to appear at Trenton to answer the command thereof, and residing in a thinly settled part of the County of Morris, made preparations to go to Trenton according to the command of the process. That on his way to Trenton, passing through the village of Rockaway, in Morris County, he applied to L. A. Chandler, Esq., a Solicitor of this Court, and showed him the copy of the subpoena, and told him he was on his way to Trenton to answer the same. That he had been in the habit of advising with said Chandler in legal matters, and relied on him for such directions as were necessary to defend the suit. That Chandler told him it was unnecessary for him to go to Trenton, at all, to answer the subpoena. That relying on this information, and being-unacquainted with proceedings in Chancery, and unable to read or write, and being ignorant of any such mortgage, he desisted from going to Trenton, and went home,' and laid the subpoena by, believing it was unnecessary for him to take any steps to answer it; and that, if it was necessary for any thing to be done by him, the said Chandler -fyould inform him. That 'he frequently saw Chandler afterwards, but that he did not, nor did any other phrson inform the petitioner that it was necessary for him to defend the suit in any way; nor did he know,' suppose or believe it was necessary to do so till after he heard that the land was advertised for sale by the sheriff. The petitioner then states,, that the sealed bill to secure which the mortgage was given was paid by John Winters, in his life time, to J. J. Shawger, -in her' life time, before the mortgage was assigned to William Winters ; and that the sealed bill remained in the possession of one John Hardy, administrator &amp;c. of J. J. Shawger, till a very short time before the bill was filed, and was never assigned by the said Hardy to the complainant. The petition then states the proceedings had in the cause; that under <em>thefi.fa. </em>the sheriff had. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>advertised all the lands mentioned in the bill for sale on the 81st August, 1846, and when applied to by tbe Solicitor of the petitioner, said he expected to sell the land so conveyed to the petitioner, as set out in the bill, first, to raise and satisfy the amount due on the said execution; that when he, the petitioner, purchased the said first described tract, on the 8th August, 1827, \u00a7200, the consideration mentioned in his deed from the said John Winters and his wife, the mortgagors, was a full and fair price for the said first described tract; and that the said John Winters and wife conveyed the same to him in fee simple; Winters warranting in the deed that it was free from incumbrance, and that he would warrant the same to the petitioner against all persons whatever, free from all manner of incumbrance ; and that the said deed to the petitioner was recorded July 1, 1828. The petition states that the proceedings and decrees in the said foreclosure suit was a surprise upon him ; and insists that the final decree is irregular, inasmuch as it appears, by the complainant\u2019s bill, that the conveyance of the three last mentioned tracts was subsequent to the conveyance of the first tract to the petitioner, and that said throe tracts arc liable to be first sold to pay the mortgage. That he gave a note with security for the \u00a7200, the consideration for the tract bought by him, which note was after-wards paid, under the firm belief that the tract so bought by him was free from all incumbrance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-4\">The petitioner prays, that the decree may be set aside or opened, and the petitioner be permitted to answer the hill; or that a reference may be ordered, to ascertain the priority of the conveyances, and whether the mortgaged premises can be sold in parcels; and that the decree may be so amended as to order the parts of the mortgaged premises not belonging to the petitioner to be first sold. The petition was sworn to in the usual form, the petitioner subscribing it by his mark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-5\">A copy of this petition, and of a notice of the motion to the Court, were served on the solicitor of the complainant and on the solicitor of the Smiths.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-6\">On reading the foregoing petition, and a further petition stating the service of a copy thereof and of the said notice as aforesaid, and that the complainant\u2019s solicitor and the sheriff threat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>ened, notwithstanding, to proceed to sell the lands of the petitioner, and praying an order staying the sale till the further order of the Court, an order was made staying the sale.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-3\">P. <em>D.

Smith, stating that before the time for answering had expired, he, for himself and wife and in behalf and by authority of John Smith and wife, in order to save the costs of putting in an answer, as they otherwise would have done and intended to do in case the arrangement had not been made, arranged and agreed with the complainants solicitor that no answer should be put in by the Smiths, provided that part of the mortgaged premises which was in Henderson\u2019s possession should be first sold; which arrangement was entered into between him and the complainant\u2019s solicitor. That, at the time of the said arrangement, he believed that those parts of the premises claimed by and then in the possession of the Smiths were not liable to the payment of the' mortgage debt, by reason of the said mortgage having been paid off; and considered and believed that if Henderson did not and would not resist the suit, the part of the premises claimed by him and in his possession ought to be first sold, and would be sufficient to pay the decree and costs. That if the decree be opened, he believes that they, the Smiths can satisfy the Court that the mortgage had been paid off long before the filing of the bill. That if the Smiths should, unexpectedly, fail in the making such proof, the deponent verily believes, that on a reference to a Master as to priorities, the said Smiths can establish by proof that, as between them and Henderson, the part in Henderson\u2019s possession should be first sold to pay the mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-7\">Mr. Whelpley said, that he made no bargain or arrangement with the Smiths. That their solicitor said to him, that Hen. derson had agreed to pay the mortgage; and that the proper course was to to sell Henderson\u2019s part first. The contest was between the defendants; and he- Mr. W., was not bound to settle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>-dim difference between them. All Henderson is entitled to is, lU,- bayo it referred to a Master, to report how the property \u2022horJd be sold. If he is not right in this, yet the Court should no.t \u00a9pen the decree except on payment of costs; and Henderson should bo confined to the case he makes by his petition, - bat Is, that the mortgage has been paid oil'. He should not 'have leave to make any other defence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-5\"><em>Mr. Vroom </em>replied.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b35-6\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"AT\">If the debt secured by this mortgage is Mill subsisting, the lands last conveyed are liable to be first sold .A&gt; pay it. So far, then, as relates to this mortgage debt, and rhe -estate of the mortgagor, and the rights of Henderson as Against that estate, the administrator of tlio mortgagor could \"/lily sell the three tracts, subject to the whole mortgage. These tkree tracts were, in the hands of the purchaser from the mortgagor5 s administrator, subject to the same equity in favor of Henderson that they were subject to in the hands of the morgagor. I think Henderson is entitled to relief. Without putting the \u2022vei-ion of the Court on his ignorance, but charging him with full knowledge of the mode of proceeding in a foreclosure suit, and allowing him full knowledge of his equities, as we must also do, <em>he </em>had just grounds for relying that such course would bo baken as to subject the three tracts last conveyed to be first sold; and it appears to me that, on the facts stated in the bill .and the decree as it stands, it would have been proper for the \"omplainant\u2019s solicitor to direct the sheriff to sell those three bracts first. But, it seems, the Smiths now make difficulty; and Henderson seems to have just ground to apprehend that his bfuci may he sold first. The question is as to the mode in -winch relief can he extended to Henderson. I say to Henderson. for I see no principle on which any relief can be extended 3k die Smiths. Indeed they have asked none. But if they had, \u25a0she only relief they could have asked would have been the open.rjrjgof the decree, and permitting them to answer and set up <em>kh&amp;t </em>the debt was paid. On what ground could they ask the \u00a3\\&gt;urt to open the decree I They appeared and demurred to the hill, and after their demurrer was overruled failed to answer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Nay, they say they intended to answer, and would have done so and have set up that the mortgage was paid, if they had not thought they had made an arrangement with the complainant\u2019s solicitor that Henderson\u2019s tract should he sold first. Now, the only defence that would have answered their pinpose would have heen that the mortgage had been paid; and if they had so little confidence in that defence, or so little regard for the rights of Henderson, as, instead of answering, to take their chance of inducing the sheriff, or the complainant\u2019s solicitor, to sell Henderson\u2019s tract first, I do -not see that the Court ought, or that it can, on any recognized principle in regard to opening decrees, open this decree in their favor. I do not see that, at present, there is any need of inflicting on either of the parties the expense of opening the decree, or of a reference. The hill states the facts sufficiently, and, as against the Smiths, it should stand as confessed. I see no objection to making an order on the sheriff to sell the three tracts last conveyed first. There can he no doubt they will bring enough to pay the debt. If they should not, the matter may he again agitated, and the Court will decide whether the decree shall he opened to let Henderson in to defend. If it he said, on the part of the Smiths, that the Court should not interfere at all, unless it opens the decree and gives them an opportunity to defend : I do not think they stand in a position to ask that of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
