William Armstrong, of a certain house, lot and garden in Elizabethtown, which she had purchased of one Andrew Wood-ruff, and which had been conveyed to Peter Kean, since deceased, in trust for her and her heirs, and also possessed of considerable personal estate, consisting of household goods and furniture, stocks in banks and insurance companies, money, and securities for money, and other effects, and of other real and personal estate, and havirg lull power to dispose of the same by will, duly made and published her will, dated September 16th, 1827, executed and attested in such manner as to pass real <em>estate; </em>and thereby, after giving her plate to be equally divided among her four children, gave and devised as follows: \u201c Item, I give and bequeath the house and lot which I purchased from Andrew Woodruff, situate in Elizabethtown, and which was conveyed by said Woodruff to Peter Kean in trust for me and my heirs, to my beloved husband, William Armstrong, for and during the full and complete term of his natural life, to be used and occupied by him as a residence, together with the use of all the household furniture (plate <em>excepted) </em>now therein contained ; but if my said husband should marry, remove to foreign parts, or elect to break np housekeeping, then my will is that the above devise to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>shall become null and void, and that the said house and lot, together with all and singular the household furniture therein, shall become the absolute property of my beloved daughter Eliza Rosetta Armstrong, to be taken and held by her under the like restrictions, limitations and conditions as the property hereinafter bequeathed to her.

But, as it has pleased God to place two of them, that is to say, my son Edward and my daughter Margaret, in easy circumstances, and as my beloved son Charles has both the disposition and the ability to provide a decent and respectable maintenance for himself, in his profession, I trust they will all cheerfully acquiesce in this, my last will.

But if the said Eliza should die before the said Andrew, then to convey such property to such person or persons as she should by will or deed, executed in the presence of two or more witnesses, direct and appoint; and in default of such appointment, in trust for the said Andrew, during his natural life, and on his death to hold the said property for, or to convey the same to such person or persons as, at the time of the death of the said Eliza, should be, according to the laws of the State of New York, the next of kin.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The marriage took place, and the trustee, William Kent, received the property mentioned in the marriage settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Eliza R. Armstrong died November 27th, 1839, without issue, and intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The bill prays that the equitable rights of the complainants Charles M. Armstrong and Margaret Salter, under the will of their said mother, be ascertained and finally settled; that the rights of the said complainants to the said house and lot may beestablislied, and that the sale thereof by the said Eliza may be set aside or declared void; and that the heirs of Peter Kean, deceased, (made parties defendants,) may convey the legal title to the said house and lot to the complainants Charles and Margaret, and that the possession of the said house and premises be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>delivered to them ; and that an account may be directed to be taken of the rents and profits thereof since the death of the said Eliza, and that they may be paid to the complainants Charles and Margaret, and that an account may be decreed to be taken of all the rest and residue of the estate of the said testatrix, which is given by the said will to the complainants Charles and Margaret, in the event of the death of the said Eliza <em>\u201c </em>without heirs and intestate,\u201d and of the sales and investments thereof, and of the part or amount thereof transferred to the said William Kent, in trust as aforesaid, by the said marriage articles, and of the investments made thereof by him, and of what he has received for the interest, dividends and income thereof, since the death of the said Eliza, and that he may be decreed to pay. or deliver the same to the complainants Charles and Margaret.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Andrew C. Armstrong, William Kent, James Nutman, (who claims the house and lot by mesne conveyance thereof from Eliza\u2019s grantee thereof,) and the heirs of Peter Kean, deceased, are made defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Assuming that the bonds and mortgages, stocks, and personal property conveyed by the said marriage settlement to W. Kent, in trust, as therein stated, are the proceeds of the property devised and bequeathed by the will of Margaret Armstrong to Eliza R. Armstrong, in the manner in the said will provided, with the limitation over as also therein provided, the questions presented for consideration are the same as would be presented to a court of law under a will made by one having the legal estate in this real and personal property devising and bequeathing to Eliza R. Armstrong in the manner provided by this will, with the limitation over therein provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">It is a devise of all the rest and residue of the estate, real, personal, or mixed, to Eliza R. Armstrong, to be by her possessed, enjoyed, and occupied, to her and her heirs forever ; but if she should die without heirs and intestate, then that all the estate above devised to her shall vest in her brother Charles M. Armstrong and sister Margaret Salter and their heirs, to be divided between them, share and share alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The questions presented are\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">1st. Whether these clauses, taken together, and by force of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>the words <em>\u201c </em>and intestate,\u201d do or do not give to Eliza a fee simple in the lands, and an absolute property in the personal estate, or if not a fee simple in the lands, an absolute property in the personal estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">2d. If, by force of the words \u201c and intestate,\u201d neither a fee simple in the lands, nor an absolute property in the personal estate is given, what estate is given to Eliza in the lands ? Is it a fee tail in Eliza, with a contingent remainder over to Charles and Margaret, or is the limitation over to Charles and Margaret an executory devise ? In other words, are the words \u201c without heirs,\u201d or the words <em>\u201c </em>without heirs and intestate,\u201d to be construed to mean an indefinite failure of issue, or only a failure of issue at the time of Eliza\u2019s death ?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">3d. If the will be construed to give Eliza an estate tail in the lands, what estate or interest had she.in the personal property ?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">4th. If the limitation over be construed to be an executory devise, is (such) a limitation over of personal property on one\u2019s dying without heirs and intestate within the rules of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">5th. W hat was the effect, in law of the deed from Margaret Salter, Charles M. Armstrong and Edward Armstrong, to Eliza Rosetta Armstrong, referred to in the pleadings, and how does it affect, the trust, to William Kent?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">These I conceive to be questions involving rulesof property that should be settled by the law courts, and I shall accordingly direct a case to be made for the opinion of the Supreme Court thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">The case was argued before the Supreme Court, and the following is a copy of the opinion certified by the Supreme Court to the Chancellor:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">OCTOBER. TERM, 1848.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">Between</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">Charles M. Armstrong, William D.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">Salter, and Margaret, his wife, and Geo. T. Elliott, complainants, and</p>\n<p id=\"b573-16\">Andrew C. Armstrong, Wm. Kent,</p>\n<p id=\"b573-17\">James Nutman, John Kean, Hamilton Fish, and Julia, his wife, and Christine Kean, defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-18\"><em>On a ease </em>submit\u00ab <em>ted by the Chancellor to the Supreme Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>I, Henry W. Green, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, do-certify to his Honor, Oliver S. Halsted, Chancellor of the State of New Jersey, that the questions submitted in the above cause-came on to be heard before the justices of the'Supreme Court, at the July Term of said court, in the presence of the Chief Justice and Justices Nevius and Carpenter, and were then debated by the counsel of the respective parties, and the court took time to consider the same until the present October Term of said court, and I report, as the unanimous opinion of the said court, that Margaret Armstrong, by the will in the said case mentiqned, in the residuary clause thereof, devised to her daughter, Eliza-Rosetta Armstrong, an estate in fee simple in the lands, and bequeathed to her an absolute property in the personal estate therein devised and bequeathed to her ; that the words \u201c without heirs and intestate,\u201d'in that clause, imply a power of disposition, and is inconsistent with and avoids the limitation overj that so far as the said lands and personal estate were embraced in the property conveyed to William Kent, the same passed under the trusts expressed in the marriage article referred to in the said case. And I further report, as the opinion of the said court, that the deed referred to did not, in the view taken of the case by the court, affect the trust in William Kent.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Dated 10th February, 1849.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">HENRY W.
