no notice of any of the said proceedings concerning the same having been given to him, and all knowledge thereof seeming to have been purposely withheld from him, in order that he might not have the benefit of a plea of infancy, to which they well knew he was entitled, or of any other defence;

Nelden or bearer; that said suit was commenced by summons returnable <em>to </em>January term, 1843, of said <em>court; </em>which, he admits, was served by the sheriff of that county on Northrup and Staats, but not on the complainant, who, he is informed and believes, was not then residing in the said county; and the said sheriff returned, on the said summons, that the complainant could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>not be found in Ms county; that he has no knowledge, except what he has derived from the bill, whether the complainant knew of the pendency of said suit or not; but he states, and charges the truth to be, that, before the suit was commenced, he several times spoke to Northrup, Staats and the complainant in relation to said notes, and informed them that he held the same, and requested them to pay the same; and that when the complainant was so spoken to by Mm, he made no objection against the said notes, nor against the justness or honesty of the debt due thereon to him; nor did he then, or at any other time, say or intimate to tMs defendant that he was a minor when the said notes were made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\">He says that on the 18th of February, 1846, he assigned the said judgment to Ebenezer Aber, of Sussex, by deed of assignment as follows: (giving the assignment literally.) It is in substance as follows : \u201cWhereas he, in the term of August 1843, or of some3 other term, in the Sussex Circuit, recovered a judgment against Northrup, Staats and Andrew L. Vansyckle for $300 64 damages and $3112 costs, more or less. Now this writing witnesseth that, for the consideration of the amount due thereon to him paid by Ebenezer Aber, he assigns to him, his ex-exutors &amp;c., the said judgment and all moneys due or to become due, and the benefit of all proceedings by execution or otherwise had or to be had or done thereonand he constitutes Aber his attorney irrevocable, in his name, to Aber\u2019s use, to do, for the recovery and settling of the said damages and costs, every thing that he could do ; covenanting to do nothing whereby Aber will be defeated in the recovery of the monies due on the said judgment; but on the express condition that all costs and expenses which may accrue by reason of any thing done in the premises, shall be paid by Aber, and that he, Rorback, shall not be liable for any part of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\">He says, that whatever money was paid for the said assignment was paid to David Thompson, Esq., who, as his attorney, had brought the suit, and drew the assignment of the judgment; and this defendant does not know what amount was paid to him; but believes the whole amount of said judgment debt interest and costs, was received by said Thompson, inasmuch as he paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>this defendant the whole amount of debt and interest due on said judgment, to wit, $300 64, the debt due this defendant, and also the interest thereon from the 15th of August, 1843, until it was paid to this defendant, and informed this defendant that he had received the eosts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-5\">That he does not know of his own knowledge who paid to Thompson the money for the said assignment; that Thompson, as Ms attorney, had his entire confidence, and he left the whole management of the business to him, Thompson, and this defendant gave himself no further concern about it, except to receive what was due to himself; but this defendant believes that he was informed by the said Thompson, that he had received the money for the said assignment from the attorney of Ebenezer Aber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-6\">That after he received the money due him as aforesaid, he gave himself no further concern about the said judgment, or any subsequent proceedings thereon; but admits, that he has been informed that a subsequent judgment was recovered thereon, in his name, for the use of said Aber, in the Sussex Circuit, against Staats and the complainant, (Northrup having previously died,) and was docketed in the Supreme Court, and an execution issued thereon to the sheriff of Hunterdon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-7\">He admits that Staats still resides in Sussex, but he has no knowledge of the amount of his property, nor whether there is property in Hunterdon belonging to Staats or the estate of Northrup.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-8\">He says that the said notes were, on the 15th of September, 1840, and while the said partnership was still in existence, assigned to him by the said Nelden, and the payment thereof guaranteed by him to this <em>defendant; </em>that this defendant received them from him for his accommodation, and at his particular request, and advanced him the money thereon, upon the representation by him, and the belief of this defendant, that they were valid bona fide claims against the said firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-9\">He denies that when he received the said notes from Nelden, he knew that the complainant was a minor; and charges and insists that he never heard or knew that the complainant was a minor while he was a member of said firm, until long after he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>so received the said notes; but at what time he heard of it he does not now recollect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\">He says, that when he recovered his judgment, as aforesaid, in August, 1843, Northruphad considerable property in Sussex; but that the same was incumbered at that time, for greatly more than its value, by prior judgments and mortgages; and that, at the same time, Staats had considerable property in Sussex, which was also incumbered by judgments prior to that of this defendant, although this defendant believes that, if he had pressed a sale of Staats\u2019s property, it would have satisfied his judgment ; but this defendant had no desire to press or crowd Staats, or to sacrifice his property at sheriff\u2019s sale, and at his urgent request delayed enforcing the judgment in order that he might have an opportunity the more easily to pay it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-6\">He denies that there was any contrivance whatever between him and Northrup and Staats, or either of them, for the purpose \u2022of extorting in any manner from the complainant, or oppressing him in any way, or compelling him to pay a debt that he was not bound to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-7\">That this defendant fully believed his debt was a just one, and justly due to him from all the said partners, and proceeded in the collecting thereof in the same manner that he would in any other case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-8\">He denies that, in executing the aforesaid assignment, nor in any of the proceedings connected with the judgment so assigned, he was actuated by any desire to extort money from the complainant, or acted with the assistance or for the benefit of the said Staats; his only desire was to collect the debt honestly due to himself; and insists that, for that purpose, he had a perfect right to assign the said judgment as he did; and that since the said assignment he has given himself no concern about the same, and had no part whatever in any of the subsequent proceedings, and is entirely ignorant at whose instance and by whose contrivance and for whose benefit the same have been had.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-9\">He says he has no knowledge whether the said judgment has been paid or not since the said assignment; but he charges that at the time of the assignment there was due and unpaid upon said judgment, the amount so paid as aforesaid to the said David <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Thompson for the said assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-5\">The answer of Aber states, that on the 18th of February, 1846, Rorback assigned the said judgment to him, by deed of \u2022assignment in the words and figures following, (setting out assignment.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-6\">He says he was not present when the said assignment was executed nor delivered, nor when the money for the same was paid; that he is advanced in years, being upwards of 70, quite lame \u2022and infirm, and but seldom goes from home; and lives about 7 or 8 miles from Newton, where Rorback lives; and whei'o the said business was transacted; that for some years past, M. Ryerson Esq., of Newton, has acted as the attorney of this defendant, and transacted all Ms business requiring professional assistance ; and that the money to pay Rorback for the said assignment was placed in the hands of said Ryerson, who acted in the matter at the request and as the attorney of this defendant, and was requested by this defendant to pay the money to Rorback and procure an assignment from him of the said judgment to this defendant. And this defendant kept no memorandum of the amount of money so deposited with the said Ryerson, or of the amount paid by him, and cannot therefore state from Ms own recollection the exact amount paid; but was informed by the said Ryerson, and so charges the truth to be, that he paid to David Thompson, the attorney of Rorback, on the delivery of the said assignment, the whole amount of the said judgment debt interest and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-7\">That befoi*e the execution of the said assignment, Staats called on this defendant, and represented that Rorback was pressing the payment of the said judgment, and would sell his property, unless the amount of the judgment was soon paid to him; and further stated to this defendant, that the said judgment grew out of the partnership debts of the said firm, and that, in justice the complainant should pay the same, inasmuch as ho, Staats, had already paid large sums of money on account of the debts of the said firm, and the estate of Northrup was insolvent, and that the complainant was bound to pay his proportion of the said firm debts ; and requested the defendant, as his friend, to advance the amount of the said judgment to Rorback, and take an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>assignment thereof from him, and endeavor to collect the same out of the complainant; and this defendant, believing the representations of Staats, and believing that it was just and right that the complainant should pay the said judgment, consented to take an assignment thereof, and to collect the same, if possible, from the complainant, in order to relieve Staats from the payment of what this defendant believes it was unjust for him to be compelled to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-5\">That, after the said assignment was executed, he instructed his said attorney to go on and collect the said judgment, if possible, from the complainant; and that a suit was brought by his said attorney, upon the said judgment, in the said Circuit Court, in the name of Rorback for the use of this defendant, against the complainant and Staats, (Northrup being then dead,) the summons in which was returnable to the t\u00e9rm of May, 1846, of said court, and was returned served on Staats, and \u201cnot found\u201d as to the complainant; in which suit judgment was recovered on the 4th of August, 1846, for $890 92 debt and $24 01 costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">,He admits that before bringing the last named suit, he gave no notice of the said claim to the complainant, nor demanded payment thereof from him; and believes his said attorney did not either.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-7\">He says he has no knowledge, except from the bill, of the time when the complainant was first informed of the existence of either of the said judgments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-8\">He admits that the last judgment was, shortly after it was recovered, docketed in the Supreme Court, and that a fi. fa. was issued thereon to the sheriff of Hunterdon, returnable to October term, 1846, of that court; and that the said sheriff was directed to levy upon all the property of the complainant and sell it to satisfy the said judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-9\">He admits that Northrup died in the spring of 1845, intestate, and charges that he died largely insolvent, and that his estate will not pay 5 per cent, of his debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-10\">He admits that Staats still resides in Sussex, and owns considerable property there; but to what amount it is incumbered he does not know; and he believes that there is no property in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the county of Hunterdon belonging either to him or to the estate of Northrup.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-5\">He denies that he ever knew or heard that the complainant was a minor when the said notes were given, or that he had any defence to the judgment assigned to him, till since the subpoena and injunction in this suit were served upon him; but insists and charges, that when the judgment was assigned he believed it was a regular and valid judgment, and binding on the complainant and Staats, and had no suspicion to the contrary; and he denies that he purposely withheld from the complainant any knowledge of the said proceedings, in order to prevent him from setting up the plea of infancy or any other defence to the said judgement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-6\">He says he is advised by his counsel, that in a suit on the first judgment, a plea, by the complainant, of infancy when the said notes were given would have been no defence, he being of full age when the said first judgment was recovered, as appears by his bill; and that, as the first judgment was recovered before the adoption of the present constitution, and Northrup was dead when the same was assigned, he could not have had the said first judgment docketed in the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AI_\">He admits, that in August 1843, Staats had considerable property in Sussex; but says he has been informed and believes it was incumbered by prior judgments, but to wliat amount he does not know; and that he is informed and believes that Rorback delayed selling the property of Staats, to satisfy his said judgment, on account of the urgent solicitations of Staats, so as not to distress him or cause his property to be sacrificed at sheriff\u2019s sale; Rorback having no immediate want of money; and this defendant knows of no other reason for the delay; and, from the information he has received, denies that there was any combination or contrivance between Rorback and Northrup and Staats, or either of them, for the purpose of unjustly extorting money from the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-8\">Ho says that he never knew or heard, till since the filing of the complainant\u2019s bill, of the recovery of the judgment by A. A. Aekerson, mentioned in the bill, or of any of the subsequent proceedings thereon; and that he does <em>not know </em>at whose instance and by whose aid or contrivance the said proceedings were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>carried on. He denies, that he has ever received any assistance from Staats in any of the aforesaid proceedings; and denies that he ever received from Staats any money whatever, either to procure the said assignment, or to pay the expenses of any of the proceedings which have been had on said judgment since the assignment; but he admits that the judgment so recovered in the name of Rorback for his.use, and the subsequent proceedings therein, are so far for the benefit of Staats, as that if the complainant should be compelled to pay the whole judgment, Staats would be relieved from the payment of all but what his fair proportion would be, .in a settlement between him and the complainant of the said partnership transactions and the debts growing thereout.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-3\">He denies that the proceedings so as aforesaid had in his behalf have been had for the purpose of defrauding the complainant, or of depriving him of any defence he might have to the said judgment; but they have been had for the purpose already staged ; and he supposes and believes, that they have been had with the knowledge and consent of Staats.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-4\">He says he does not know of his own knowledge how much 'was due on the judgment so assigned to him when it was assigned ; but, from representations made to him, he believes and charges that the whole of it was then due and unpaid; and he expressly denies\" that any part of it has ever been paid to him by Staats or any other person, and insists that the whole amount thereof is due to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-5\">The answer of Staats says that for some time prior to December, 1889, he .and Northrup had been doing business in Lafayette, Sussex county, as partners in the milling and foundry business ; and that, in December, 1839, the complainant was taken into the firm as a .partner, and the same business was continued under, the name and firm of Northrup, Staats &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-6\">He admits that the complainant invested $1000, and that each partner was to share in the profits in proportion to his share of capital invested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-7\">He admits, .that in May following the parties opened a store, in connexion-with their other business, which was carried on upon the same capital, and under the same arrangement, as to the division of the profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\u00bf He denies that he then knew that the complainant was a minor ; and whether\u00ae Northrup \u00bfknew it or not he does not know; that, on the contrary, he supposed and believed that the complainant was then of age ; and, to the best of his knowledge and belief, he never \u00a1knew or heard of the complainant\u2019s being a minor while a member of the firm, until long after the firm was dissolved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\">He says, that on or about October 1, 1840, Northrup represented to Mm that the complainant was desirous to dissolve the partnership in such a manner that he, the complainant, might continue the store alone, and leave Northrup and this defendant to continue the rest of the business; but that this defendant utterly refused to do it, and insisted that he would leave the firm himself, and accordingly sold out Ms interest to the complainant and Northrup, and, by the agreement between them, this defendant was to receive back his capital, and $500 for his share of the profits, and the other two were to take the assets of the firm and pay all its debts ; and he says, that in two days after ho had made the said arrangement and sale, some arrangement was made between Northrup and the complainant, by which the complainant sold out Ms interest to Northrup ; but what the particulars of the said sale and arrangement were he did not then and does not now know, not having been present at, nor a party to it. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-6\">He admits that, at the dissolution of the partnership, the partnership property was sufficient to pay the partnership debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-7\">He says that, after he made the said sale, the other parties took into their custody and possession the books, papers and assets of the firm, and afterwards, on the 10th of February, 1841, the complainant gave to this defendant some accounts which had belonged to the firm to collect, amounting to \u00a7172 57, to be applied, when collected, to what was so agreed to be paid to this defendant, when he sold out;

B. Marsh recovered a judgment, in the Common Pleas of Sussex, against the said firm, for $191, on which an execution was issued to the same sheriff, and that he paid off that judgment also, amounting, when paid, to $214 92; and that he has, also, since the dissolution, paid off a note given by the firm to Jos. Strader, for $55, dated August 24, 1840 <em>; </em>and has, also, since that time, paid other debts of the said firm, the amounts of which he cannot now ascertain, not being able to find the receipts for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-3\">He admits that Rorback, in August, 1843, recovered a judgment in the Circuit Court of Sussex, against the firm, for the amount stated in the bill; and says that, before that suit was commenced, Rorback spoke to him about the notes on which it was brought, and that, soon afterwards, and before the suit was brought, he, this defendant, spoke to the complainant on the subject, and that the complainant did not at that time say or intimate that he was a minor when the said notes were given, or that there was any defence to the notes, but seemed to know all about them and for what they were given, and replied that Rorback had better sue on them and collect the money from Northrup as soon as he could.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-4\">He says that, in January or February, 1846, he, this defendant, being pressed by Rorback for the payment of the said judgment, and not being able to obtain any further delay from him, applied to Aber and requested him to pay the amount of said judgment to Rorback and take an assignment of it, and collect it, if he could, from the complainant; and stated to him that it grew out of the partnership debts of the said firm, and informed him that this defendant had paid a large amount of the said debts, when, according to the terms of the dissolution, he was not bound to pay any of the debts 5 but that the complainant and Northrup were bound to pay them; and thereupon Aber consented to take an assignment of the said judgment, and this defendant is informed and believes that the same was afterwards assigned to him by Rorback; but what he paid for it this defendant does not know 5 but he denies that he ever paid any thing to Aber for the purpose of procuring the said assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>He admits the second judgment, in the name of Rorhack for the use of Aber, against the complainant and him; and says he has been informed and believes that the same has been docketed in the Supreme Court, and an execution issued thereon to the sheriff of Hunterdon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-5\">He admits that he still resides in Sussex, and has property there sufficient to pay all his debts ; but has none in Hunterdon, and believes there is none there belonging to the estate of Northrup.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\">Ho says he does not know when the complainant removed from. Sussex, nor when he removed from there to Hunterdon; hut he insists and charges that, before Rorback commenced the first suit, he, this defendant, informed the complainant of the existence of the debt for which it was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-7\">He says that soon after the recovery of the said first judgment, Northrup\u2019s property was sold to pay prior judgments, and that Northrup died largely insolvent; and that the delay given by Rorback to this defendant was at his, this defendant\u2019s solicitation, to prevent a sacrifice of his property; and ho denies that there was any collusion between him and Rorback or Northrup, for the purpose of extorting money from the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-8\">He admits that A.

Ackerson, on the 12th of November, 1844, recovered a judgment in the Supreme Court, against him and the complainant and Northrup, for \u00a7693 40, damages and costs, which judgment was recovered on three notes given by the said .firm, two of them to Paul Ackerson, and the other to the executors of his estate, tho latter for grain sold to said firm, and the two former for money lent to the said firm; and that A. A* Ackerson was executor of the said P. Ackerson, deceased; in which suit, the summons was served on him and, ho believes, ok Northrup, but not, as he believes, on the complainant, who then lived in Hunterdon; and that this defendant and Northrup, knowing the debt for which the suit was' brought to he just, suffered judgment to go by default; and he has heard and believes that the said judgment was paid by the complainant, on an execution issued to tho sheriff of Hunterdon, after the complainant had\u00bb without success, applied to the Suppreroe Court to open said judgment and allow him to plead infancy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-u\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>He admits that, before the said suit was brought, A. A. Ackerson called on him to pay the said notes, and that he told Ackerson he ought to collect the same from the complainant, for that' he, this defendant, had paid a large amount of the debts of the said firm, which, as between him and his partners, he was not bound to pay, and the complainant had not, so far as this defendant knew, paid any of the said debts ; but he denies that the mode of proceeding taken by Ackerson to collect the said notes was at his instance, or by his aid and contrivance, any further than that he told Ackerson, as has been already stated, that he ought to collect the said notes from the complainant, and, when-served with the summons in said suit, knowing the debt to be justly due Ackerson, allowed judgment to go by default; and he denies that he has rendered any assistance to Aber in the proceedings so as aforesaid adopted by him ; but he admits that they are so far for his benefit that if Aber collects the amount of the said judgment from the complainant, he will not be compelled to pay it to Aber, and it may be the means of inducing the complainant' to make a full and fair settlement of the said partnership affairs and debts with this defendant, which he is anxious to have done, and which he has frequently requested the complainant to do, without success.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-3\">He denies that, so far as he knows, the proceedings had as aforesaid by Aber have been adopted for the purpose of defrauding the complainant, or of unjustly extorting money from him, or of obtaining judgment against him without his knowledge, that he might be deprived of any defence; and if any such motive existed on the part of any person, he is ignorant of it; but he admits he knew that Aber intended to collect the said judgment from the complainant, if he could, but did not know what ipode of proceeding he would adopt to dp it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-4\">He says that the notes on which the judgment of Rorback was recovered are in Northrup\u2019s writing, and signed with the partnership name, in Northrup\u2019s writing ; but he does not know for what they were given, or whether Northrup or the complainant had ever paid any thing on said notes or on the judgments recovered thereon, and he has not paid any thing himself on said notes, or on the judgments since recovered thereon, either to Rorback or Aber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>He Says ho does not know, except by the bill, whether the complainant, at the time said notes were given, was a minor; but he insists that during the whole time of the partnership he supposed and believed that the complainant was over twenty-one; and that the people generally, at and in the vicinity of Lafayette, entertained the same belief; and he says he does not know whether or not the knowledge of said suits in the name of Rorback was purposely or by design withheld from the complainant, or whether or not the mode of prosecuting the complainant was adopted in order as much as possible to prevent the complainant from obtaining any knowledge of said proceedings until an execution should be served on him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-5\">It was shown, on the argument, that the complainant was born in March, 1820.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b251-6\"><em>S.
