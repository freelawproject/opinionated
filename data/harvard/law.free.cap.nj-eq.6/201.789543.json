Halsted </em>moved to overrule the plea.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-8\">He said that if there was anything in the provision in the fundamental constitutions for the Province of New Jersey in reference to fourteen years\u2019 quiet possession, it did not apply to this case; for the corporation of Newark subsequently accepted the trust and continued to hold under it. But there is nothing in that provision which can affect the case. No title could be acquired against the proprietors by fourteen years\u2019 quiet possession. The plea does not allege confirmation by the proprietors. The proprietors put down all other titles, and no other than the proprietors\u2019 title was ever recognized in this state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-9\">The plea is that the first settlers held the land in question from 1667 to 1695. Now, the grant from the proprietors, in trust for a burying place, was in 1696, showing that the propri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>sfors did not recognize any other title. The proprietors trace title to the first founders, under the grant from the Duke of York This is the tide under which all lands are held in New Jersey; no other title is recognized in this state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-5\">The plea does not state under whom possession was held. It <em>may </em>mean under the Indian title. But our legislature, in 1703 declared all Indian titles void. 1 <em>Allison </em>1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-6\">The plea does not answer the bill. True, the mayor and common council are in possession, but the plea does not deny that they are in possession as trustees; that is the charge in the bill. A trustee may always say he is in possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-7\">Again, our legislature, by an act passed February 15th, 1804, enacted that the trust estate vested in the said four trustees, by the said conveyance from the proprietors of December 10th, 1696, should be vested in The Inhabitants of the Township of Newark, in the County of Essex ; \u201d and this act provides, that the estate thereby vested in \u201c The Inhabitants of the Township of Newark,\u201d as aforesaid, should be appropriated and forever remain to and for the uses in the original patent aforesaid expressed, and for no other use or uses whatsoever. This act was passed on the application of \u201c The Inhabitants of the Township of Newark, in the County of Essex,\u201d and was accepted by them. They are estopped.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-8\">The plea should have been accompanied by an answer, and the answer should have denied the charge of the acceptance of the trust under the act of the legislature. <em>Story\u2019s JEq.
