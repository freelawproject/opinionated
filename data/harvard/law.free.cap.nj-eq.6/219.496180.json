There lias been a conversation between Sherman and me, about his borrowing some money of me. I cannot say there has directly. There has been a considerable conversation between Watkins, Sherman and me, about borrowing money. The first sum named was $3,500. I think $1,500 was also named. I don\u2019t think I can tell with any certainty when it was ; my impression is it was in the spring, or fore part of summer, of 1844. A mortgage was proposed to be given to me as security for the money, by Mr. Watkins, on Sherman\u2019s property. Named two pieces of property for the purpose. I preferred the mortgage on 24 acres of land. There was some difficulty, I don\u2019t know what; and they proposed a. mortgage on the house and lot described in the mortgage in controversy in this suit. I should say Watkins proposed it. I do not recollect of Sherman and Watkins talking together with me at any one particular time. Watkins did the most of the business; I had some conversation with Sherman. I do not know that he ever proposed to give a mortgage on the property in question. I think it likely Sherman and I had some conversation on the subject; but I cannot remember anything definitely about it. I was notified that the mortgage was ready; and I requested that they should satisfy a friend of mine and a lawyer he should choose, that the mortgage was clear, and the money should be forthcoming; and that was the last I heard from them. The money was not coming from me, but through me. I would not like to say positive who it was said the mortgage was ready, whether Sherman or Watkins. I am under the impression that both of them said so. The money I said would be forthcoming was $1,500. During this negotiation, my impression is I had some conversation with Sherman on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>subject, but I am not certain. I don\u2019t recollect any thing was said about J. P. Judson in this affair. I don\u2019t recollect that I ever talked with him about this property, or the mortgage, up to yesterday. In this negotiation Sherman was said to be the owner of the land. I so understood from Sherman or Watkins or both. I understood, at the time, that Watkins was to get the mortgage of Sherman and sign it over to my friend. How it was to be done, I did not understand. I don\u2019t remember any thing positive as to Sherman\u2019s trying to persuade me to take that mortgage. I never heard that there was any thing done by my friend or the Attorney to satisfy them on the subject. I don\u2019t know how to answer, satisfactorily to myself, whether from my conversation with Sherman I was led to believe the mortgage was a good one. There was a number of circumstances all tending to satisfy me that the mortgage was a good one; but whether I got it from one or the other I cannot say. My own knowledge of the property was evidence to me that it was sufficient if it was clear. I cannot say for a certainty whether Sherman, in his conversations with me, ever said he was not the owner of the property. This mortgage, as I understood, was to be made by Sherman. I understood it that this loan was to be made provided they satisfied my friend and his lawyer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-3\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>I do not recollect what time it was that I was given to understand the mortgage was ready for $1,500. I should not think that, from the time Watkins first applied to me for the money, it was more than four, five or six weeks before the matter was at an end. I think I have seen both Watkins and Sherman together, talking on the subject; but what was said I cannot remember. When the loan of $3,500 was spoken of, Watkins was to give a mortgage on his own place. He was to pay off a mortgage on his own place out of it, and give a mortgage for $3,500 clear. I do not know that Sherman was to have any share in that loan. I never heard him say he was. With the $3,500 to be lent to Watkins, he was first to pay off the $1,700 mortgage on his own place; and for the rest he said he had got into difficulty, and must have the money. Watkins, before the last year was in embarrassed circumstances, as he said. I do not know what his pecuniary situation now is.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>In chief. </em>Watkins stated to me that he had endorsed paper for Sherman; that the paper had fallen duo, and it was necessary, to save his goods and chattels, to raise the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-5\">This is the plea he made for the want of the money. I understood that both Watkins and Sherman wanted money at the time. I should think it was the general opinion at that time that Sherman was in embarrassed circumstances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-6\"><em>John </em>Eadie, for complainant. The mortgage was assigned to mo by Watkins. I was present when he executed the assignment. Cass, one of the subscribing witnesses to the assignment, was serving with mo. Smith, the other subscribing witness, was serving with Watkins. They were laboring men. I saw them witness it. Smith is in Galveston, Texas. Cass, I believe, is living near Camptown. Watkins made the application to me to take the assignment of the mortgage; to discount it. I refused. This was in the fore end of May, 1844. It was a long while after that that I agreed to take it. It was in January, 1845, before I agreed to take it. It was not offered to me again until then. The consideration of the assignment to me was, Watkins was indebted to me much more that the face of the mortgage, for monies advanced to him. Watkins lived next door to me, and Sherman also, one on each side of me. I had a conversation with Sherman about this mortgage, about a week, or perhaps only three or four days after it was offered to me. I believe he asked me why I had not taken the mortgage; that it was a good one, and that I never had better paper of the kind. I refused to have any thing to do with it, stating, that 1 had not money at the time convenient, and that I did not like the paper. I think he observed in this way, that Watkins and him had got into difficulty on account of some notos that was passing betwixt them; that he, Sherman, wished to raise money in order to pay off these notes or judgments; that he did not wish Watkins\u2019s property to be touched on his account. That is all that passed betwixt us, that I recollect, in 1844. I think in the course of the conversation he stated that they had got into difficulty and there were notes betwixt them, and judgments pending against them both upon them. I had no further conversation with Sherman on the subject, that I recollect, until the mortgage was assigned to me. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>When I took the assignment of the mortgage, I considered it a valid mortgage. The other assignment on the mortgage is signed by me. I made the assignment to Mr. Garroch. The subscribing witness is the same man, Smith, who witnessed the other assignment, and is now in Texas. The circumstances of this mortgage being assigned to me are these. Watkins got indebted to me pretty heavy. I pressed him for more securities than what I had, to make me safe. He said he had done all to secure me that he could, that mortgage of Sherman\u2019s excepted. I observed to him that I would take an assignment of that. The assignment was made, in the form and at the time it appears on its face. Between the time Watkins first offered me this mortgage and the time I took it, I advanced to Watkins, at one time, $2,100, in cash, besides $1,500 of an old mortgage that was-pressing upon him, and another $1,000 for which I took a mortgage on his place, making in all $4,600. This is all I advanced him betwixt those two intervals. The $1,000 I believe was used for the purpose of taking up executions against him. (This was-objected to by defendant\u2019s counsel.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-5\">The question being put, \u201cDid you understand, at the time, that the advancement of this money was to relieve Watkins from executions that were against him on Sherman\u2019s account!\u201d the question was objected to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-6\">The Master overruled the objection and the witness answered,, I was informed by Watkins and Mr. Frelinghuysen, his attorney, that such was the case. (The answer was objected to.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-7\">The circumstances of making the assignment by me to Gar- - roch were these : Mrs. Watkins called on me and wished to know if I would not assign over that mortgage of $1,500, in behalf' of Enos Baldwin, William Ashley and Andrew Garroch. She shewed me a title she had for some little property in Scotland,, .and offered to assign that over to me if I would assign that mortgage to those persons, and I agreed to it, for to cover notes they had endorsed for Watkins, I believe to the amount stated in that-paper given by Garroch to me. The proposal was made, unknown to Watkins ; wholly on the part of his wife. As far as I know, he agreed to it. I don\u2019t know that he and I had any conversation about it at the time. He never made any objection. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>to it that 1 ever heard of. 1 am from Scotland. I understood where the property lay, but not much about it. Watkins is from Scotland also, in pursuance of that arrangement J made that assignment on the mortgage. At the time of that assignment, Garroch gave me a back writing, a copy of which has been exhibited on the part of the complainant. The origimal I have in my possession. At the time of making the assignment to Garroch, t considered it a good mortgage. I think likely I told Garroch so. I don\u2019t think Sherman ever told me the mortgage was not a good mortgage until after I had assigned it to Garroch. Sometime in the spring of 1845, after Sherman had returned from the Legislature, and after I had assigned it to Garroch, Sherman told me the mortgage was good for nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-4\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>On the 8th or 9th of May, when Watkins first applied to me to discount the mortgage, I saw it and read it. I did not see any bond accompanying it. I made no inquiry for it. I noticed that the condition of the mortgage called for a bond. The loan to Watkins of $2,100, was made in New York, on the security of Ms own note and an old note for that amount which was taken up by Watkins, in the City Bank, under protest. Watkins was endorser on this old note, for some friends in Rhode Island or Connecticut; I don\u2019t remember where that old note was dated. 1 gave it up to Watkins when I got a deed for his property. This loan was made, as far as my memory serves me, from the 1st to the 10th of July, 1844; it was for 80 days; the new note was payable in 30 days, I think. It was not paid when, it fell due. It was not lodged for collection. When it fell due I did not take any further security until I got a. deed for Ms property. The advance of $1,500 was made in May previous. That was made for the lifting of an old mortgage that was foreclosing against'him, which was assigned to me. This was in the fore end of May, 1844. There was no bond accompanying this old mortgage; but I got a new bond from Watkins alone. This bond has been paid, so far as I have got a deed for his property. The $1,000 loan was made in the same month of May, after the application by Watkins to discount the mortgage in question. I am not sure whether the $1,500 was lifted before or after he applied to me to discount the mortgage in ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>tion in this suit. The $1,000 was advanced after that application. I took a bond and mortgage on the whole of Watkins\u2019s farm as security for this $1,000. This money, I understood, went into the hands of Fred. T. Frelinghuysen, to pay-judgments on endorsements by Watkins and Sherman; but whose debts they were I know nothing about it: that is what I meant in my direct examination. ' I never advanced a dollar on the faith of the assignment by Watkins to me of the mortgage in question. I received the deed from Watkins for his farm in August, 1844, the 24th, I think. It was not acknowledged when I first received it: it was acknowledged about February, 1,1845 ; and at that time Watkins was indebted to me $5,800. Mrs. Watkins never acknowledged the deed: she signed it, but never would acknowledge it. The deed was delivered to me at the time of its date, and remained in my possession from that time till the said 1st of February, 1845. A bill of sale was made by Watkins to me, about the time of the date of the deed, of all his personal property. An estimate was made of its value at the time, and the property was delivered. \u2019 It was taken as collateral security; I do not remember the amount. The deed was not a collateral security: that was a sale. The price of the whole property was $5,800 : it was sold to me out and out, bona fide, for that price. There was an incumbrance on the property of $300 a year. The thing was fairly finished on or about February 1, 1845. The deed was made in August prec\u00e9eding; but the bill of sale was not made, I think, till February; it may have been made in August. The $5,800 was for the whole property, real and personal. The personal property remained as a collateral security until on or about February 1, 1844, Avhen it was turned over to me absolutely. I do not recollect what was the consideration of the real estate; the two was connected together, and amounted to $5,800; but I do not recollect what each was valued at by itself. I have advanced no money to Watkins since that time: there is some rent and other small matters due to me; rent $150 and 10 per cent, on the value of the personal property. The assignment <em>to </em>Garrocli was made just about the same time I finished up a settlement with Watkins, in February 1845. They were both done about the 1st of February; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>but they were distinct transactions, each one by itself; and were not connected together. I took Mrs. Watkins\u2019s statement as to the value of the property in Scotland; I knew something of its value from knowing where it was situated. From what I understood, 1 estimated the value of it to something like from, two to two hundred and fifty pounds sterling. She had the copy of a will of her uncle, willing it to her and a couple of her sisters ; and she gave me a power of attorney to get it. Watkins never signed it; there was never any occasion for it; it had never come into her hands. I hold that power of Attorney, so that, provided I cannot sell the property here to cover me, I may bo safe to the amount due me. I bought the real estate and personal property at an out and out sale for $5,800. There is no time limited in which I am to sell the property here. I may sell it now, or .1 may sell it in 100 years if I choose. There was no bond accompanying the mortgage in question in this suit, when it was assigned to me; T never saw any until I saw it here today. An interlineation in the assignment from Watkins to the witness, in these words, \u201cand the bond therein mentioned and all monies secured by the said mortgage,\u201d being shown to the witness, he says, I think Watkins made the interlineation; but I do not know. It was made at the time it was signed, as far as I know. 1 do not know who wrote with a pencil first, under the interlineation. I think it was done at the same time the body was wrote, but I cannot remember particularly. I cannot say when it was done; I have no recollection of it. The assignment from me to Garroch, I presume, is in Mr. Boylan\u2019s handwriting; the other is not. I don\u2019t think he ever saw it before the execution of the assignment from me to Garroch; it was not out of my possession till then. The assignment from Watkins to me was made, I suppose, in my own house. (An interlineation in the other assignment being shown to witness, and lie being asked when it was made, he says,) 1 don\u2019t recollect when the interlineations were made ; I have no recollection about <em>them </em>; if my .attention had not been called to them now, I should not have known they ever were made. I knew there was no bond with the mortgage when I took the assignment from Watkins; I never looked for one. I did not consider the bond of much worth, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>mere personal thing. I never applied to Sherman for the bond; nor ever asked him why one was not delivered. I cannot say that I said any thing to Garroch about the bond when I assigned the mortgage to him. He must have seen there was none. I negotiated the assignment to Garroch, and the terms of it, at Mrs. Watkinsls request. Watkins gave his consent to it. I believe all the terms of that assignment were made between me and Garroch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">The question being put \u201cI want you to state distinctly and fully the terms on which Garroch holds the mortgage,\u201d the complainant\u2019s counsel objected to the question, and to any evidence as to the terms on which Garroch holds the mortgage, except as they appear by the written agreement. The Master overruled the objection, and the witness answered:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">The terms specified in the paper was agreed upon betwixt him and me, and the money to be paid over to the separate parties, as soon as collected. That is the whole sum and substance of the business. I do not recollect of any conversation in the fall of 1844 between Sherman and me, in referenc to the state of accounts between Watkins and Sherman, in connection with that mortgage. There was a settlement of accounts between me and Sherman that fall. I think w\u00e9 did not at that time, to my knowledge, have any conversation about the state of accounts between him and Watkins, in relation to that mortgage. I did once make an effort, at Sherman\u2019s request, to get a settlement between him and Watkins. This was, to the best of my recollection, early in the spring of 1844. It was before the application was made to me to discount the mortgage, a long time, according to the best of my recollection. Sherman at that time made no mention of the mortgage in question. I heard something of an effort made by Sherman to raise money in New York: I think he mentioned it to me himself, but when it was, I cannot recollect. He said a dark cloud was hanging over him, and he must raise money to get it off. I understood he proposed to give a mortgage on the property and buildings where he lives now. Before any suit was brought by Garroch, on this mortgage, he and I called on Gov. Pennington, with the papers, and showed him the assignments on the mortgage. Gov. Pennington observed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tlie words interlined in the assignment were wanting, and he said if I would leave them with him, ho would make them as they should he, and would send them up to me, to he executed hy Watkins and myself over again. The mortgage w'as sent to me with the interlineations in pencil marks, and Watkins filled up the interlineation in his assignment, in presence of the said attesting witness James Smith, and I filled up mine in presence of the same witness, who then for the first time signed his name as a subscribing witness to the said assignments. This has come to my recollection since my previous examination, and on a conversation with Gov. Pennington. The assignments were re-acknowledged hy Watkins and myself, at that time, in presence of that witness. This was done when Garroch applied to Gov. Pennington to prosecute the mortgage in question; hut before this suit was brought thereon. I think it was within 8 or 10 days after the assignment to Garroch. I held the mortgage in question, at the time of assigning it to Garroch, on account of a debt owed hy Watkins to me for money lent and advanced. I don\u2019t recollect stating to Garroch any thing to the effect that the mortgage was doubtful, or an invalid security. I do not recollect that I gave him, Garroch, any intimation in the negotiation with him in reference to this mortgage, that there was any difficulty about it; for 1 had no such idea myself. I represented it to Garroch as a good and valid mortgage. At our first interview with Gov. Pennington, we left the mortgage with him. I believe I received it again from Gov. Pennington\u2019s hands, at my house, a very short time, one, two, perhaps five days after we left it with him. He said he was going further and would call in the evening, on his return, and get it; which he did. I remember having conversations with Sherman, it strikes me it was in the spring of 1844, in relation to a settlement of accounts between him and Watkins. This was before the settlement of accounts between me and Sherman, sometime before his offering to me the mortgage for discount, as I have before stated. I don\u2019t think I was informed by Sherman, at that time, the time of these conversations, that he owed Watkins nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-4\"><em>In chief. </em>Cass was not present when the assignments were re-acknowledged. I now affirm and approve the assignment by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>me as it now stands. 1 knew before taking the mortgage in question, that Sherman and Watkins had had dealings and accounts together; they both told me so. Sherman has been engaged in business in that neighborhood ever since I have known him. I can\u2019t say that I knew that Watkins was doing any business. I had no knowledge of any business of his except what he told me himself. He lived in Camptown for five or six years, was on a farm he purchased there. I believe his principal business was signing accommodation bills and borrowing money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-5\"><em>Re-cross-examined. </em>I came to Camptown May 29, 1843. The first money I advanced was that for lifting the $1,500 mortgage which I spoke of before. I do not recollect of his applying to me for any amount before that. I may have let him have a few dollars. It was at the time of advancing money for that mortgage, which was foreclosing at the time, that I first learned that Watkins was in failing circumstances. It was public rumor that he had erected large improvements on the property he occupied ; I have no knowledge of it myself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-6\">After the closing and signing of Eadie\u2019s examination, the defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the admissibility of his testimony, on the ground that it appears, on the face of the testimony given by him, that he is interested in the event of the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-7\">The testimony on the part of the defendants, so far as it relates to the points decided, is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-8\"><em>Abraham H.

I invited him into the room, and called my mother. He remained about five minutes. He carn\u00e9 to leave a mortgage. I saw the mortgage ; it was on the premises where the store is. I saw the mortgage a number of times during the summer and fall of 1844; can\u2019t say how late in the fall; think it was September. The mortgage was from my father and mother to Mr. Watkins, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>for $1,500. My father had gone to New York when Gardner called. The mortgage was in father\u2019s secretary when I saw it in the summer and fall of 1844. I do not know the form of taking an acknowledgement. I understood that Gardner had taken the acknowledgement at that time. Judson was not there at that time. I did not see him there during that day. I fix the month of May as the time of taking the acknowledgement of my mother, because I was then assisting in the store. I had never seen the mortgage before then.

I saw it at our place several times during the summer of 1844, and along in the fall of the same year, at the same place. I saw it five or six times. 1 recollect seeing it late in the fall, in my father\u2019s desk, what they cali the secretary. My sister Mary was with me when l saw it in the desk. We were looking at the contents of the paper together, at that time. I saw it several times in the desk besides. I heard a conversation between my father and Mr. Isaac Watkins respecting the mortgage and the purpose for which it was given; it was along in the summer of 1844, as late as Juno or July, and while the mortgage was yet in the secretary. It was stated, in tho conversation, that the object of the mortgage was to raise a fund for father\u2019s benefit; and Watkins said he thought at tho time he would be able to raise the money for him. I know of an effort made by Mr. Watkins for that purpose. He said lie had gone to Westfield to see if he could not raise it from a gentleman there <em>% </em>but he said he could not get it there. He said he wowld go to see Mr. Headley, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>see if he, Headley, could not get it from a lady. I heard him say, afterwards, that he could not get it there. It was along in June, 1844, that he went to see Mr. Headley, or said that he went. (So much of the above testimony as has relation to the conversation between Sherman and Watkins was objected to by complainant\u2019s counsel.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-4\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>The latest date I can fix, with certainty, as to the time when I saw the mortgage in my father\u2019s possession, was along in September, 1844. It was prior to this date that Watkins made the efforts referred to to get the money. Watkins did not take the mortgage with him when he went to raise the money. Can\u2019t say whether there were any assignments on the mortgage at that time or not. My father and Watkins were friends at that time : prior to that time they had considerable dealings together. I know that prior to that time Mr. Watkins had endorsed for my father a few hundred dollars. I should say ten or twelve hundred dollars. I am a son of A. Sherman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6qX\"><em>In chief. </em>The endorsements spoken of were for the firm of C. A. Sherman &amp; Co., composed of Alvah Sherman and his son Charles A. Sherman. I should not think the endorsements were over $1,000; but I have no memorandum of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\">An instrument under the hand and seal of Garroeh, of which the following is a copy, was produced on the part of the complainant : \u201cWhereas John Eadie has this day assigned to me a mortgage made by Alvah Sherman and wife for fifteen hundred dollars. In consideration whereof I do agree to pay the face of the following notes, to wit, one note of $400 drawn by Isaac Watkins and endorsed by Enos Baldwin, one do. of $810, drawn by Isaac Watkins and endorsed by Enos Baldwin, one do. of $420, drawn by Wm. Ashley and endorsed by Isaac Watkins and Enos Baldwin; and I further agree to give up and cancel claims now in my hands against Isaac Watkins and Enos Baldwin, which claims amount to $345. In witness whereof I bind myself, my heirs, executors and administrators, firmly by these presents. Sealed with my seal, and dated this first day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty-five. Signed, A. Garroeh. L.

And there is no proof that Sherman was indebted to Watkins; or that Watkins, either before or since the writing purporting to bo a mortgage came into his possession, paid any of his endorsements for Sherman, or paid money for him in any other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Watkins could not have foreclosed the mortgage, (it purporting to secure a bond,) without producing the bond, unless he could show that he was entitled to the possession of the bond. No reason or consideration has been shown why the bond should have been delivered to Watkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Eadie, who took from Watkins an assignment of the mortgage, admits that he advanced no money on the faith of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">If the assignment by Eadie to Garroch, the complainant, could put Garroch in any better position than Watkins or Eadie occupied ; and if, from the testimony, I could feel well assured that the assignment to Garroch was a bona fide transaction$ yet, the fact that the mortgage showed, on its face, that it was intended to secure a bond was sufficient to put him. on inquiry in reference to the <em>bond; </em>and he, therefore, took the mortgage subject to every defence that could be made against it as between Sherman and Watkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">The bill will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
