Woodruff, leaving a will of which he appointed the complainants executors; admitting that the complainants exhibited their bill of foreclosure against. Housel and the decree and execution thereon ; admitting the first sale by the sheriff to Britton, as stated in the bill, but denying that Britton was the highest bidder at that sale, or that the said sale was duly advertised, so far as this defendant knows and has heard, and leaving the complainants to make such proof thereof as they shall be advised; admitting the petition stated in the bill and the proceedings and orders thereon, as stated in the bill; admitting the second sale stated in the bill, but not admitting that the premises were duly advertised or legally sold, but saying that he has been informed and believes, and therefore states, that the said premises so sold, consisted of divers distinct houses, mills, and lots of land, which have been held, and were held at the time of said sale, separately; and that a part of said premises, if sold separately and at a fair price, would have satisfied the said execution ; and that the said Jacob Housel, this defendant, did, by writing signed by him and delivered to the said sheriff twenty days before the time appointed for the said sale, elect the part of the said mortgaged premises to be sold and the order of selling the same; and that if the said premises had been so sold, this defendant believes that the same would have brought the full amount due the complainants on their said mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-7\">The answer further states that, on the 9th of May, 1815, the said Housel and his wife, the mortgagors, by deed of that date, for the consideration of $38.21, sold and conveyed to this de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\u00edendaut a certain part of said mortgaged premises, butted and bounded as follows, (giving the description,) containing 11-lOOths of an acre, with covenants of seizin, and that said Housel had good right to convey the same, and that this defendant should hold the same, free of all former mortgages and other encumbrances, and general warranty, which deed was acknowledged on the 9th of October, 1822; that on the same 9th of May, 1815, the said Jacob Housel, by deed of that date, for the consideration of $133.60, sold and conveyed to this defendant another part of the said mortgaged premises, butted and bounded as follows, (giving the description,) containing 18-100ths of an acre, with full covenants of seizin, and that he had good right to convey the same, and that this defendant might forever thereafter have and\" enjoy the same, without the lawful let, eviction or disturbance of any person whatever, and that the same were free of all former mortgages and encumbrances, and general warranty, which deed was acknowledged on the 20th of May, 1820, and recorded on the 9th of October, 1822.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-5\">This defendant further answering says, that he has been informed and believes, and therefore states, that there was some agreement, contract or understanding between the said Samuel Britton and the complainants, or one of them, that they, the complainants, would permit the said Britton to buy the mortgaged premises, not conveyed by Housel before the filing of the said bill, as low as possible, at the said last-mentioned sale, upon his agreeing, at all events, to pay the amount due the complainants on the said mortgage, and that the complainants should allow and permit the said Britton to take such proceedings on the said mortgage, in the name of the complainants, as would enable him to raise the difference between the sum for which he might purchase the said mortgaged premises, and the amount due on tho said mortgage, out of the other premises contained in the said mortgage, which had been conveyed by said Housel before the filing of the said bill, or some other agreement to the like effect; and that the said purchase was made in pursuance of the said agreement, and that the said bill filed by the complainants against this defendant and others is really for the use and benefit of the said Britton, and designed to enable him to grasp the whole of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the mortgaged premises, although the part purchased by him is worth considerably more than the whole amount.due on the said mortgage; and the answer insists that the said mortgaged premises, not conveyed by the said Housel, if sold separately, in lots, as was elected and designed by Housel, would have brought more than the whole amount due on the said mortgage, and was worth considerably more; nevertheless, the said sheriff, under pretence that no one would bid for it in separate lots, by the direction of the complainants, put up the whole together, and so sold the same to the said Britton. And this defendant insists that the complainants, having filed a bill against the said Housel alone, upon the said mortgage, without making this defendant and others interested in the premises parties, and having sold a part of the mortgaged premises under a decree obtained in said suit, cannot now resort to the lots held by this defendant; and he claims the same benefit as if he had pleaded the said proceedings in said suit, and submits that the complainants are not entitled to any relief against him. And if the court should be of opinion that the complainants are entitled to relief against him, he insists it can only be upon opening the said decree and sale, or permitting this defendant to redeem the said mortgaged premises not conveyed by Housel before the filing of the said first-mentioned bill, which he offers to do, and prays he may be admitted to do,'upon paying whatever is due thereon for principal, interest and costs, which he prays may be ascertained under the direction of this court; and that, thereupon, the complainants and the said Britton may be decreed to deliver up and surrender the possession of the said premises so sold as aforesaid to- this defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-5\">On the 29th of October, 1845, Maria Schenck exhibited her petition, stating the filing of the bill of Elias D.

Osmun, John Stockton, and Daniel Van Sickle, was filed to this supplemental bill. The causes of demurrer assigned are, that the bill is filed, by leave, as \u00e1 supplemental bill, whereas, the facts set out in it are not material to the matters in controversy in the original suit, as the same are set out in the supplemental bill; that this bill is not any addition, merely, in material matters, to the original bill, in order to supply some defect in it, but is an original bill in its frame and character, and not a supplemental bill, and is, therefore, informal, irregular, and improperly exhibited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-10\">Another cause of demurrer assigned is, that this bill is filed as supplemental to a suit in which one of the complainants died, more than twenty years ago, and the said suit has never been revived by any order of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-11\">Another cause of demurrer assigned is, that it appears, by this bill, that Thomas L. Woodruff, one of the complainants, assigned all his interest in the bonds and mortgage, which are the sole matter of controversy in the suit, to Maria Schenck, the other complainant, several years before the bill was filed, and thst the said Woodruff, therefore, having no interest in the suit ought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Slot to be a party complainant, and that there is an improper joinder of parties eomplainaut.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">And further, that it appears by the biJi that the said Thomas L. Woodruff, the complainant in the original suit, has neglected and refused to prosecute the same, and now exhibits a supplemental bill in the same suit, for the same subject matter, which these defendants are advised is irregular and unlawful.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">Another cause of demurrer assigned is, that the bill is filed, in part, for the purpose of bringing new parties defendants in the original suit before the court, who became interested in the premises in question after the original bill was filed, which is unnecessary, and subjects these defendants to great expense; and that all the relief prayed for in the supplemental bill, and full relief in the premises, independent of what is therein prayed for, could have been granted and afforded in the original suit, if the complainants are entitled to any.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-7\">Another cause of demurrer assigned is, that Maria Schenck has no right to exhibit the supplemental bill, and that upon the facts set forth in this bill, she could only come before this court for relief by original bill, if at all, considering that some twelve years had elapsed, after the bonds and mortgage are said to have been assigned to her, as set out in said bill, before it was exhibited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-8\">Another cause of demurrer assigned is, that the facts and case set out in this bill are within and would be barred by the statute of limitation at law, and that these defendants have been in the peaceable and undisturbed possession for more than twenty years before the said bill was exhibited of the premises, as their own, which are sought to be foreclosed by the said bill, and without any acknowledgment during that time of any right or title <em>to </em>the same in the complainants, or either of them, or any one else..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-9\">Another cause of demurrer assigned is, the lapse of more than twenty years, not satisfactorily accounted for, between the filing of the original bill and the exhibiting of the said supplemental bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-10\">Another cause of demurrer assigned is, that David Williams, Isaac White, William Cooley, William Thomson, Isaac Johns<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>ton and Jacob Moore, of the county of Hunterdon, at the time the said supplemental bill was filed, were interested in and in possession of and claimed title to certain parts of the premises described in the said bill, and ought to be made parties.

The supplemental bill is against some of the defendants in the original suit and against other persons who have become alienees from others of said defendants since the said decree <em>pro confesso </em>was taken. There is nothing in what has occurred since the filing of the original bill making a supplemental bill necessary. The only object of it, therefore, must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>be to avoid the effect which the lapse of time might have upon the original suit or upon a now original bill. The complainant cannot be permitted thus to relieve himself from the effect of his own laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Demurrer allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
