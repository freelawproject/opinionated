And though the defendant continued the business in his own name from the date of said deed until the 24th December, following, yet, everything done by him in the business was done with a view to the speedy winding up and final settlement of the partnership business. That the complainant during that time had nothing to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>in the management of the concern. That the business done consisted almost entirely in the collection of the debts due the firm and the disposition of the old stock which they had on hand. And that the assignment of all the property, by said deed of dissolution, and the surrender of the complainant\u2019s right thereto, was to enable this defendant to indemnify and protect himself, by the exclusive management of the property and assets, against the aforesaid indebtedness of the complainant to the firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\">He admits that on said 24th December, when a final separation took place, the complainant did become the purchaser, as stated in the bill, and paid for the same and took possession as stated in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-6\">And he admits that after the sale and transfer last aforesaid, an inventory was made by the complainant himself, in his own hand writing, intended to include all the bills, notes, books of account and other claims due the firm, accruing either before the dissolution or between that time and said 24th December, when the actual separation took place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-7\">He admits, that the bills, notes, books of account &amp;c. mentioned in said inventory, together with the vouchers, papers &amp;c. relating thereto, were taken possession of by him, for the purpose of collecting and liquidating the same, and, after making proper deductions and payments, to divide the surplus, if any, equally, between him and the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-8\">He admits that schedule A., annexed to the bill, contains a true copy of said inventory, except that the following items are twice inserted in said schedule; (giving eleven items, amounting, together, to $1,237 82 ;) and that the following items are erroneously inserted in said schedule, the same being claims duo this defendant on his individual account, and not due to the firm, to \u2022wit, John Ondcrdonk$17 99, Peter P.

At which appointed time this defendant was under a positive engagement to be elsewhere, and did not attend for that purpose. But shortly after, when this defendant had leisure, he called on the complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>ant and offered and requested of him to come to a final settlement of their affairs, which he positively refused to do, saying that ho had called on this defendant once, and would not trouble himself to do so again. But declared that the law should settle the matters for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">He further saith, that he has frequently and in a friendly manner, applied to the complainant, since their final separation, and requested him to come to a settlement of their affairs. And he further states, that after said separation, to wit, on the 17th September, 1841, and when the affairs of the said firm were in the same situation as at present, except that since that time the defendant has collected the sum of and has paid out the sum of , at the request of this defendant, and through the intervention of Peter P. Runyon, the complainant was persuaded to come to a settlement with the defendant. On which day last aforesaid the complainant, in the presence of the said Peter P. Runyon, had exhibited to him all the books, papers, vouchers, receipts, notes, and other evidences of claims belonging to the said firm which were desired by the complainant, and within the custody and power of this defendant. All of which were then and there examined and inspected by the complainant to his entire satisfaction, as he declared at the time, and all errors, so far as any had been discovered, were corrected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-7\">And he further states, that at such inspection and examination of the books &amp;c. as aforesaid, the said complainant expressed himself satisfied, and fixed the amount himself which he alleged was due from the defendant to Mm at the sum of f878 69; $48 of which amount, he the said complainant then and there admitted that he had previously received from debtors of the said firm on accounts with which this defendant stands charged in the said inventory. And the balance of the said amount was, on the said day of settlement, paid and satisfied to the said complainant by this defendant, amounting to the sum of <em>$335 </em>69, and for which amount the complainant then and there gave this defendant a receipt in writing, which is now in the custody of this defendant, and ready to be produced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-8\">He further saith, that at the time of said settlement, when he allowed, paid and satisfied to the complainant the said sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>$878 69, as above stated, be this defendant was satisfied that the said amount was considerably more than the said complainant was then entitled to, or ever would be, out of the assets of the said firm, and that be so told the said <em>complainant; </em>but for the sake of peace, for the purpose of ending difficulty between them, to avoid law suits, and that the complainant might be fully satisfied that entire justice had been done towards him, this defendant yielded to what he then and now considers an unjust demand, and paid him the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-3\">He admits that he still retains in his possession the books of the said firm, and he humbly submits to this honorable court that he has a right so to do by the terms of the said deed of dissolution ; but he denies that he has ever refused to let the complainant see or examine said books, or to correct any errors contained 'therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-4\">And he further admits that he has since the date of the said receipt, when the said sum of $355 69 was paid by the defendant to the complainant, refused to pay to the complainant any more money, for the reason that he had already paid him more than he was .entitled to have out of the assets of the said firm; but he expressly denies that he has ever refused to come to a full and final settlement of their accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">He admits that after'the dissolution of the said firm, and after the said books and assets had been passed to this defendant as aforesaid, the said complainant did offer to take into his hands the books, notes, and the other assets of the said firm, and to collect and liquidate and pay the debts due to and from the said firm, without any charge on his part against the said firm for such service. And that the defendant declined such offer; first, because the complainant was at the time considered wholly irresponsible and unsafe in a pecuniary point of view, not being the owner of property but to a very limited extent. Secondly, because the complainant was indebted to the firm in the sum of $3,300, or thereabouts. Thirdly, because the complainant was indebted on his individual account to divers individuals to a large \u2022amount, some of which claims were at the time pressing hard upon him. Fourthly, because the assets of said firm amounted to the nominal value of $7,872, or thereabouts, which amount, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>under tho circumstances of the case, the defendant believed would bo placed in great hazard by being confided to the hands of the complainant. Fifthly, because the firm was indebted to the amount of nearly five thousand dollars, for which this defendant was held responsible; and it was thought doubtful whether the assets of the said firm would be sufficient to pay its debts. Under all these circumstances the defendant would have been unwilling that the said assets should have gone into the hands of tho complainant on any terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-5\">But he denies that he ever offered or agreed to take upon himself the responsibility and burthen of collecting the claims, paying the debts, and doing all other things necessary to the entire liquidation and final settlement of tho business and affairs of the said firm without any compensation; but, on the contrary, he saith that the collection of the said claims, and the payment of the said debts, the keeping of the accounts, and the performing of all other duties consequent thereon, imposed upon him a large amount of labor, responsibility and loss of time, for which he submits he is entitled to a just, fair and reasonable compensation out of the property and assets of the said firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">And he further denies, that he ever promised or agreed to hand or deliver over to the complainant tho books, &amp;c. of the said firm, as the continuing partner of the said firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-7\">And he denies, that upon a fair balance of all accounts, relating to the matters aforesaid, he is indebted to the complainant in a large sum of money, or any other sum. But he expressly saith that after charging him, this defendant, with all the monies of the said firm which he has collected, or could have collected, since tho said final separation, and after allowing Mm for all the debts and other expenses which he has fairly and honestly paid out in behalf of the said firm during said time, and after allowing to him the sum of $387 69, paid the complainant as before stated, and after allowing to Mm out of said assets a just and reasonable compensation for his labor and services in liquidating and settling the business and affairs of the said firm, and after charging the complainant with $27 50 which he received of John Chadwick, of Newark, which belonged to this defendant, but which this defendant saith the complainant received, but has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>paid to the defendant, there is due to this defendant from the complainant a large amount of money, which he, this defendant, prays may be decreed to be paid to him, the defendant, by the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-5\">He admits that the said account furnished the complainant by the defendant, as mentioned in the bill of complaint, was hastily made out and was not very precise as regards dates, persons, &amp;c., for the reason that the complainant was supposed to understand them as well as the defendant, he, the'eomplainant, having made out the said inventory at his leisure, and having also before that time seen and inspected the receipts and vouchers of the defendant at the time of settlement and giving the receipt of $885 69 'before mentioned; but that the amounts of debt and credit as contained in said account, so far as this defendant now recoil ects the same, were correct or nearly so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-6\">By consent of the parties, an order was made, April 6, 1848, referring it to Joseph F. Randolph, Esquire, one of the Masters of this court, to take an account of the aforesaid monies and assets come to the hands of the defendant, or which might have been, but for his wilful neglect, received by him, and for all other monies and assets of the said firm for which the said defendant should be made accountable, and which are in the said bill of complaint and agreement specified; the parties to produce before the said Master, upon oath or affirmation, all deeds, books, papers and writings in their custody or power relating thereto, and be examined as the said Master shall direct. And all further equity and directions were reserved till the coming in of said Master\u2019s Report. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-7\">The books were produced before the Master, by the defendant, Under oath.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-8\"><em>Jonathan C. </em>Ackerman, <em>Esq., </em>sworn for complainant, saith that, on complaint to witness of Mr. Hutchinson that he could not get a settlement with defendant, witness spoke to Judge Runyon, the father-in-law of defendant, to endeavor to bring about a Settlement; this was in the summer after the dissolution; complainant frequently complained to him; before then he said he liad received about <em>$300 </em>in part of his claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-9\"><em>Being </em>cross-examined, says he did not speak to the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>on the subject, but went to his father-in-law, Judge Runyon, knowing that he was acquainted with their business prior to the dissolution ; complainant alleged that defendant owed him, and showed a list of notes that he had, a part of Which complainant claimed as his ; the reason why witness did not go at once to defendant was that there was not then a very friendly feeling existing between them; after the dissolution of the parties, witness and two other persons advanced some money to enable complainant to go on with the business in a kind of limited partnership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-5\"><em>Peter P. Runyon, Esq., </em>sworn on the part of the defendant, says, he is acquainted with the parties, and recollects the time when the partnership commenced; witness had a general knowledge of their business, not a particular one; as to the capital of the concern, Mr. Hutchinson obtained from witness about $300, which was, by anoto, increased to 0700, and Mr. Onderdonk advanced \u00a71000 ; this money and their credit constituted their capital; except the $700, the balance of the capital came through defendant and his friends; witness was his father-in-law, and endorsed for him or the firm; witness advanced for the firm, in various ways, so that on the loth of June, 1887, they gave him a bond and warrant of attorney for $4,064 88; this was for money advanced by witness independent of endorsements on business paper then outstanding, amounting to about \u00a78,000. He believes the complainant was indebted to the firm at the time of the dissolution, and for some time before, in about $8,000; the defendant, for some time before the dissolution, sought to have a, dissolution; it took place when it did at his instance ; complainant preferred not to dissolve, but did not object; the first dissolution was intended to bring about a final settlement of the whole concern, and for that purpose complainant remained and attended to the affairs, all of wdiich were under the control of the defendant ; after the final separation, defendant paid witness between 03,300 and $3,400; this money was due him from the firm, and paid by defendant; this last objected to by Mr. Wood\u00bb</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">From December 1840, up to about the first of June, 1841, defendant was engaged in settling up the concerns of the firm, and in no other business that witness knows of, except in preparing to go into business on the water-power. During that time he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>was frequently away from home, and, as witness understood, on the business of the firm; understood that several of the debtors resided out of the State, at Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York and the East; witness supposes that it was necessary, in settling up the firm business, to be considerably from home on expenses; it was, during the time, very difficult to collect money. Taking into consideration the situation of the affairs of the concern, and the condition of the monetary affairs of the country at the time, from witness\u2019s knowledge of the whole matter, he would have charged five per cent, for settling up the affairs of the firm; he thinks that a fair compensation from and after the final separation. Sometime after September, 1841; complainant asked witness if he had said defendant should have commissions; witness does not remember his answer, it was not definite however. Complainant said he had offered to do it for nothing; this he stated as a reason why defendant should have nothing. Previous to September, 1841, complainant called on witness and said he wanted defendant to settle with him; witness said that was right and reasonable, and he would do what he could to effect it. Witness had told complainant,- previous to the final dissolution, that he would do what he could to effect a settlement; witness, accordingly, called on the defendant, and in consequence thereof, the time and place for a meeting of the parties were arranged ; this took place, the witness and both parties being present; September IT, 1841, was the time, as witness believes. After a good deal of conversation, and going over their whole matters, a balance was ascertained to be due the complainant, and this balance was paid by the defendant. Complainant said he would be satisfied with this amount; defendant at first objected, but finally agreed and gave it to him. Thinks defendant paid all complainant demanded, by a check or otherwise ; it was in the neighborhood of $400. This settlement witness understood embraced all matters, except two or three small affairs, amounting to about $100, to be settled in future, of which $T0 was in'a note; all other matters were settled except there were errors; there were some small matters in which the parties disagreed as to whether they belonged to the firm or not; witness says he cannot say whether they were settled or not. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>items were, a charge against John Onderdonk, for $17 99, and for cash charged $13 45. After the settlement defendant complained very much of it, and found fault with witness; he made no resistance to a settlement. Witness says the signature to the receipt marked exhibit No. 1, for defendant, is in complainant\u2019s handwriting, and is the receipt given on the settlement before stated. Mr. Reamer had a judgment against complainant for between $400 and $500 ; he asked witness to endorse notes to enable him to pay it, which witness declined; the judgment was in Middlesex ; complainant lived in Somerset; he may have moved over shortly after the judgment. The $3,300 or $3,400 paid to witness by defendant was in small payments of a few hundred dollars at a time, except the last, which was for $1,600. Witness states that a paper shown him is in his handwriting, and contains an account between himself and the firm, and the payments by the defendant; it was made out at the date of the receipt; it is offered in evidence, and marked exhibit No. 5, for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-5\"><em>Being </em>cross-examined, witness says that when the partnership commenced, the complainant was carrying on the business in New Brunswick; he had previously commenced it; it was an experiment not yet established. Defendant then first entered into business ; defendant furnished no capital, as witness knows, except what he got from witness and his father; whatever witness advanced was accounted for by the firm; to them witness looked for pay; it may he considered a loan; cannot say the amount or the \u2022terms; impression is he advanced $1000; witness was only to he liable for what he endorsed, and the money advanced, not for their debts or losses; no other partners but Hutchinson &amp; Onderdonk ; witness expected some remuneration for <em>his </em>risk, independant of the interest, if the experiment was successful; there was no distinct bargain about it; it was cheerfully awarded. Speaking of the indebtedness to the firm of the complainat, witness refers to the first dissolution; the firm had an account against defendant also ; does not know the amount. After the bond and warrant of attorney was given, an account of the money affairs between witness and the firm was kept separately from that of the <em>bank; </em>witness loaned them money, and they paid him from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>time to time. At the meeting of Sept. 21, 1841, the parties were together an hour or an hour and a half; witness did not go over the accounts with them. Since that time complainant -has called on witness and said that he wanted a settlement; this was sometime before this suit was brought, a month or two; he complained that defendant would not settle, and defendant said that he (defendant) did not owe him anything. Mr. Wood called on witness since, and said, let defendant renderfan account, and a settlement might be effected; this was.atter the suit was brought. Witness did not understand Mr. Wood that he was then authorized to settle; has heard complainant say that he wished defendant would , take the books and make out an account, or let Thompson do it. This was previous to the first settlement. Understood that the parties to this suit were general partners, and each liable as, such, both before and since the dissolution; each to share equally in the profits and losses, according to the rules of law applicable to general partnerships. Witness is not certain that the thirty-three or four hundred dollars embraces all the monies paid him -by defendant; witness incurred the liabilities for the firm on account of his son-in-law ; he would not have done it otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-5\"><em>Being again examined in chief </em>Witness says, that when the complainant called on him and said he wanted a settlement from defendant, he said nothing of any errors or mistakes in the former settlement or account; he did not allude to it; he said he intended to prosecute, and he let him (witness) know first about it; the <em>$500 </em>paid witness for his risk.was by the agreement of both parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-6\"><em>Being again cross-examined </em>he says, that at first there was no specific sum agreed on for his risk; the $500 was agreed on sometime during the progress of the dissolution; witness proposed .to take a portion of the profits, or a specific sum, and complainant said it had better be a specific sum, and then witness proposed this amount and it was agreed to; nothing said about conditions ; thinks both were present, and that it was in the shop, and before the final separation; they agreed- to it cheerfully, particularly the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>EXHIBIT No. 1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-5\">Received, New Brunswick, September 17th, 1841, of Peter C.

RUNYON.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-15\">On the 31st May, 1843, the Master reported as follows: I find that the defendant, subsequent to the dissolution of the partnership, received of the debts and effects due and belonging to the late firm, $5,603 13, as appears by schedule No. 1, annexed that this sum embraces all the monies and effects of the said partnership which came to the hands of the defendant, or might have been received, but for Ms wilful neglect, and also all monies and effects of the said firm for which the said defendant should be made accountable. That the said schedule No. 1 embraces a list of all the accounts and notes specified in the bill, answer and schedule thereto annexed, in the charge filed with the Master, and in exhibit D, on the part of the complainant, being a receipt of the defendant for the amount of the notes of the firm taken by Mm to collect, and also of the monies of the firm not specified in said schedules, and receipts that have been collected by the defendant, as admitted by Mm or proved by the evidence, except such notes as were divided by the mutual agreement of the parties, and such accounts as were taken by the complainant to be collected at his risk, without accounting for the same to the defendant, as agreed upon by the parties before the Master, as will more fully appear in the evidence hereto annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-16\">That the defendant filed with the Master his discharge, hereto annexed, and that I find that the defendant has paid out of the monies received by him belongmg to the said firm for debts due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>by the firm, and other jnst allowances, the sum of $4,640 69, as will more fully appear by schedule No. 2, hereto annexed, which embraces all the items contained in the schedule annexed to the defendant\u2019s answer, and claimed by him as discharges, except the following items, (stating several small items.) In the settlement of the account of Peter P. Runyon, Esq., much difficulty has arisen from the different modes of calculating the interest; the account as made out by Judge Runyon appears to have been based upon a statement made by the complainant, in which the account is made out in the mercantile method, by calculating interest on the several items of debt, and crediting it up to the time of settlement; although this method of computing interest is objectionable, and on a simple bond or note with the interest paid annually at 7 per cent., the payments and the interest thereon would more than exhaust the entire debt in twenty years, <em>(Hoffman\u2019s Master </em>360,) yet inasmuch as the parties have sanctioned that mode of calculation, under the authority of <em>Stoughten </em>v. Lynch, 2 <em>Johns. C. R. </em>213, it might bo recognized in this case; but Judge Runyon had a bond running on interest against the firm at the same time with the account, and to prevent the benefit to him of the annual payment of interest, while the account of the firm was drawing interest, he calculated compound interest on the bond, thereby charging $85 50 more than the simple interest on the bond. As the Master was not aware of any principle by which this could be allowed, it is rejected. The defendant has exhibited a statement and calculation hereto annexed, as schedule No. 3, by which the difficulty is said to be in a great measure overcome. As this calculation is not agreed to by the complainant, nor sanctioned by any adjudicated authority, and is moreover composed in part of compound interest on the one side, while no interest is reckoned on the other side, the whole calculation and result has been rejected; but is herewith reported that the defendant may have the benefit thereof <em>before The </em>Chancellor. To obviate the difficulties as far as possible in this account, the master has deemed it advisable to re-calculate the whole amount upon the principle laid down in <em>Meredith </em>v. Banks, 1 <em>Halst. </em>408, by applying the payments in the first place to pay off the interest, and then to liquidate the principal; and there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>being a running account on each side, as well as a bond due from the firm to P. P. Runyon, the accounts are in the first place taken to balance each other without interest, and the overplus taken to pay off, first, the interest, and then the principal of the bond, making rests wherever .the overplus of payments exceed the interest due on the bond. This method is pursued until the 11th of July, 1889, when the credits in themccounts exceed the payments, and the interest is calculated from that time on the balance remaining due on the bond, also on the balance of the account from the close, and also on the sum of $500 from the time it was agreed to be paid up to the time when the payments by the defendant exceeded the entire interest, viz, January 1, 1841; and the usual method of deducting the payments and calculating interest on the balance is then pursued, until the whole claim is finally liquidated, as will more fully appear by schedule No. 4, hereto annexed, as part of this report. This method lessens the amount of the claim of P. P. Runyon $38 79, and changes the final payment from $1,545 46 to $1,505 67.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-3\">The payment of 0500 is allowed as a compensation to Judge Runyon for his risks in endorsing for the firm and supporting it through difficulties upon the agreement of the parties as proved. Judge Runyon might no doubt have at the time appropriated any of the payments to the interest at the time due on bond, instead of suffering them to be entered in the account current, and so might the firm have done. 1 <em>Pick. Rep. </em>332; 7 <em>Wheaton, </em>332; 9 <em>Cow. </em>409; 8 <em>Wend. </em>403, <em>&amp;c. &amp;c. </em>But where both omit to make such appropriation at the time, it is the duty of the court so to appropriate'them as to do justice to the parties as far as possible,' without violating any settled principle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-4\">The defendant claims a commission of five per cent., which is not allowed by the Master. The evidence goes to show that the defendant was engaged in settling up the business of the firm about six months, and has a fair claim for compensation, if the rules of law permitted compensation to one party of a firm for extra services, without an express agreement; but as the principle against such allowance seems well settled, 1 <em>Vesey &amp; Beam, </em>168; 1 <em>J. C. R. </em>157; 3 <em>P. </em>Wms. 249, the claim is rejected; though the attention of the Master was called to the case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>Bradford </em>v. Kimberly, <em>3 J. C. R. </em>431, to prove an exception to the rule, which the case itself fully recognizes; and the exception, if one it be, is this, that when the joint owners of a vessel appoint one of themselves to receive and sell the cargo, he is to be considered in the light of a \u201cstranger,\u201d as a \u201ccommission merchant,\u201d and entitled to remuneration upon the implied agreement; this is not a case of general partners, where one of them has settled up the concerns or done other extra\" service, but of joint owners, engaging one of them'selves to act as a commission merchant for the owners, being in fact a distinct business from that of the joint parties; besides, in this case, so far from there being an agreement express or implied, the defendant by his deed of dissolution of the 18th of June, 1840, agrees to pay over to the complainant the one-half of the surplus arising from, the debts and credits of the concern, without making any reservation for commissions or other remuneration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-5\">Taking into account the charges and discharges of the defendant as heretofore stated, the balance due the firm on 17th of September, 1841, when a partial settlement was effected, I find to bo $962 44, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-6\">Amount of charges, $5,603 13</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-7\">Amount of discharges, 4,640 69</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-8\">Balance, $962 44</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-9\">The one-half of this was due to the complainant, of which sum I find by the evidence the sum of $378 69 was paid to him on the 17th of September, 1841, leaving the amount to stand thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-11\">One half of the balance, $481 22</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-12\">Paid Sept. 17,1841, 378 69</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-13\">Leaving a balance of $102 53</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-14\">Interest thereon from the 17th of Sept. 1841, to the 31st of May, 1843, 10 48</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-15\">Total due this day, $113 01</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-16\">No other interest is charged against the defendant, because the business appears to have been fairly and expeditiously set-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>tied, and the money was paid out as soon as received, or within a reasonable time after.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-3\">JOSEPH F.

By the terms of the deed of dissolution the defendant was to collect the claims, and pay the debts, and pay over to the complainant half the surplus. This $500 now claimed by Mr. Runyon, and allowed him by the Master for his risks in endorsing for the firm, was certainly not a debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">Again, on the final separation, the defendant, as he admits in his answer, was still to collect, and pay the debts, and pay over to the complainant half the surplus'. In this part of the answer he says he was to pay over after making proper deductions and payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">There is nothing said in the answer about this $500 to be allowed to Mr. Runyon. The general words \u201cafter making proper deductions and payments,\u201d and an item in the schedule annexed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>to the answer, of the date of May 1, 1841, \u201cPaid P. P. Runyon on his account $500,\u201d are the only matters in the answer that can hare any reference to this $500 allowed to Mr. Runyon for liia risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The receipt given by tho complainant, on the 17th December, 1841, is not relied on as proof of final settlement and discharge, for the parties have agreed to go into the account, and it was agreed that a reference should ho made to a Master to state tho accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">This allowance to Mr. Runyon, if made, must he made on the sole ground of what Mr. Runyon, himself, says about it. He was called by the defendant. Nothing is said about it in his principal examination. On cross examination, he says, he expected some remuneration for his risks, independent of his interest money, if the experiment was successful; that there was no distinct bargain about it, it was cheerfully awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Being again examined on the part of the defendant, he says, the $500 paid him for his risk was by the agreement of both\" parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Being again eross-examined, he says, that at first there was no specific sum agreed on for his risk; the $500 was agreed on some time during the progress of the dissolution. That he proposed to take a portion of the profits or a specific sum; that the \u00a9omplainant said it had better be a specific sum, and he, the witness, proposed this amount, and it was agreed to ; that nothing was said about conditions. He thinks both were present, and that it was in the shop before the final separation; that they agreed to it cheerfully, particularly the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">It may be remarked here, that the final separation was in December, 1840; and that to exhibit No. 5, Mr. Runyon\u2019s account against the firm, is subscribed Mr. Runyon\u2019s receipt in full to Onderdonk, dated June 1,1841; and that this exhibit shews,, under date of July 1, 1840, this charge \u201cHis share of the profits, $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">Has this $500 been actually paid by the defendant to Mr. Runyon <em>% </em>If I could be satisfied that it had been, by agreement of the parties, so paid by the defendant that to disallow it would result in loss to him, I would leave the parties in <em>statu quo; </em>but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>I am not satisfied that any thing more has been done, between Mr. Runyon and the defendant, in reference to this $500, than the stating the accounts between them in a way to relieve the defendant to that extent in his accounts with the complainant. If paid, when was it paid <em>1 </em>No one tells us. Nor is there any direct allegation that it has ever been paid. Mr. Runyon says, that besides the bond and warrant for $4,064 84, he had endorsed for the firm to about $3,000; and in another part of his deposition he says, that after the final separation the defendant had paid him between $3,300 and $3,400 due him from the firm. Is this $500 included in the language \u201cdue him from the firml\u201d Was it a debt1? In another part he says, the $3,300 or $3,400 paid him by the defendant was in small sums of a few hundred dollars at a time, except the last which was $1,600. There is-an evident tenderness in reference to the matter of the actual payment of this $500. But, under the circumstances of the case, and in view of the relation existing between Mr. Runyon and the defendant, and the remark of Mr. Runyon that he would not have done what he did had not one of the firm been his son-in-law, I do not think I should have been satisfied to allow this charge even if there had been evidence of a formal payment of it by his son-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The master does not put the allowance on the ground that it had been paid. He allowed it \u201cas a compensation to Mr. Runyon for his risk in endorsing for the firm and supporting it through difficulties, upon the agreement of the parties as proved.\u201d I think it is an agreement which, if clearly proved, the court should not aid in carrying out. It is the first occasion on which I have heard it claimed that one is to be allowed, by a court, compensation for endorsing for another. If he had advanced the money, instead of endorsing notes, he could have but legal interest. To my mind, the sanction of such'a charge would furnish a cover for exorbitant charges, in effect usury, and that, not on money advanced, but on mere liabilities incurred. It would be a mischievous precedent to allow such a charge. This exception of the complainant is, therefore, allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Next, as to the other exception on the part of the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>The Master has charged the defendant with the amount received by him, $5603 13</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">And credited him with amount paid by him, 4640 69</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">And has struck the balance here of 962 43</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The report then divides this balance and says one half of it is due complainant, 481 22</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">And then says that it appears by the evidence that on the 17th Sept. 1841, $378 69 was paid by the defendant to the complainant, and deducts it, 378 69</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">And strikes a balance against the defendant of $102 53</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">The answer says, that on the 17th September, 1841, the defendant paid to the complainant $335 69, and that the complainant admitted he had received $43 from debtors of the firm, on accounts with which the defendant stood charged in the inventory ; which $43, added to the sum actually paid, made $378 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">It does not appear that in the Master\u2019s charging side of the account, the defendant is charged with the accounts from which the $43 was collected by the complainant; but, if I understand it, the defendant is charged by the Master only with the monies actually received by him. The Master says, that he finds that the defendant received, subsequent to the dissolution, of the funds and effects due and belonging to the firm, $5,603 13, as appears by schedule No. 1 annexed to his report; that the said sum embraces all the monies and effects of the partnership which came to the hands of the defendant, and all the monies and effects of the firm for which he should be made accountable ; that schedule No. 1, annexed to his report embraces &amp;c. (see the first part of the report.) Now, schedule A., annexed to the bill as an account of the assets of the firm at the time of the dissolution, amounts to $8,147 41; and schedule B., annexed to the bill as an account of the monies received by the defendant from the assets, amounts to but $5,589 91. I do not see from this that the $43 was received by the complainant from accounts with which the defendant remains charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">The answer gives a list of names, with the amount due from each, which the defendant says he was not able to collect; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>he takes credit for them; and then ssys :</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">' \u201cLeaving in the hands of the defendant claims which have been collected, to the amount of $5,469 87.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">He then admits, that since the making of the inventory, he has collected and received the following items not included in the inventory, (giving names and sums,) amounting to $117 33. And then adds: \u201cwhich, added to the amount <em>in the hands </em>of the defendant as last above stated, makes the sum of $5,587 20;\u201d which sum, it will be perceived, is within $2 71 of the amount of said schedule B., annexed to the bill as an account of the monies-received by the defendant. It seems from this that the defendant has only charged himself with the monies actually received by him; and why should he charge himself with more'?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The Master has charged him-with but $5,603 13; being but $16 93 more than the defendant has charged himself with having actually received. What this additional $16 93 is for, would, I presume, be discovered.by a particular examination of the report ; but this is not necessary; it is not the $43 received by the complainant. And I do not see that the defendant, as the account is stated by the Master, is charged with the accounts from which the complainant received the $43. If it can be shewn that he is, there can be no objection to his doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">To make the account correct, in the Master\u2019s mode of stating it, one of two ways may be taken; either to add the $43 to the whole amount of receipts, which will show the amount to be divided between them, and let the $43 go towards the complainant\u2019s half as already received by him; or, to deduct, from the balance $481.22 struck by the Master, the $335 69 and half of the $43.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">This exception on the part of the complainant is also allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah_U\">\"The exception on the part of the defendant, that the Master has inade no allowance to him by way of compensation for his services in settling the busines of the firm, is, I think, well taken. I shall direct the allowance of 3 per cent, on $5,603 13, and that he be credited therefor, and that the balance in his hands be then struck; which will be the same as deducting half of the commissions from the complainant\u2019s half of the balance struck. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
