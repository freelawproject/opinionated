The Executors of Jacob Young.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b450-6\">Award set aside on the ground that the Arbitrators acted on a matter riot withm the submission.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-7\">Jacob Young died, June 2, 1843, leaving a will, dated July. 1, 1840, of which he appointed Samuel Stewart, Philip Fine, Edward Hunt and his son Abraham P. Young, the complainant, executors. Fine died in May, 1845. Differences having arisen between the complainant and the other surviving executors, they agreed to submit the same to arbitration; and, thereupon, the complainant, in his individual capacity and also as executor, and the said Stewart and Hunt, the other surviving executors, on the 13th June, 1845, entered into an agreement under seal, by which they submitted all matters in difference as set forth in the schedule annexed to the said agreement to three persona therein named, arbitrators by them chosen; and mutually covenanted and agreed, under the penalty of $500, to abide and perform the award of the said arbitrators unanimously rendered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-8\">The Schedule annexed to the agreement contained, on the one side, an account of the complainant against the estate of the testator, commencing March 13, 1814, and running to and including the year 1833, and consisting of charges for rails and fencing stuff, lumber, shingles, glass, carpenter and mason work, work done at house, work at barn, hauling stone and timber, cutting timber, boarding hands, money paid carpenter and mason, lumber for grain house, carpenter and mason work, shingles and nails; and, on the other side, a statement of the claim of the executors against the said Abraham P. Young, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_r\">\u201cBalance on bond dated January 23,1819 ; penal sum $950, conditioned for payment of $415 on or before May 1, 1819, with interest from day of payment, drawn by Abraham P. Young and Jacob Young to Philip Slout, paid off by Jacob Young.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AF6\">The testator had three sons, the complainant and two others; and had, in his life time, put each of them in possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>farm; and had put buildings on the farms, respectively, of which he had put the other two sons, severally, in possession, at his own expense. A large part of Abraham\u2019s account annexed, as aforesaid, to the agreement of submission was for materials furnished and work and labor done in putting up buildings on the farm of which he had been put in possession. The several farms were devised to the sons severally in possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-5\">It was admitted before the arbitrators that an agreement had been made, between the father and the sons, by which the several farms were allotted to the sons severally, and to be devised to them, respectively, on their paying a certain sum per acre. And it was also admitted before the arbitrators that Abraham was charged in the will $4 an acre more for the farm devised to him than by the said agreement he was to be charged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-6\">The arbitrators admitted evidence that Abraham had cut and sold timber from the farm in his possession, (afterwards devised to him,) in the life time of the testator, and twenty years prior to the agreement of submission, and, considering this wood and timber as a set-off against his whole account, allowed him nothing on his account, and made an award against him for the amount of the principal and interest of the bond stated in the schedule annexed to the agreement of submission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-7\">The bill was filed to set aside the award.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-8\">An answer was put in by the executors, and testimony was taken. \u00ab</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-9\">P. <em>B.

Both were very stale demands. The bond was due in May, 1819. When the testator paid it, if he did pay it, did not appear. There was a credit on it, March 17, 1823, of $22 08, signed by the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">On this submission, both parties were at liberty to rely on the lapse of time as a bar, or neither was. The arbitrators could not capriciously give effect to the lapse of time as against one and refuse to do so as against the other. That was not the course adopted by the arbitrators. It is clear that they reached their result by permitting the executors to show that Abraham had cut, from the farm in his possession, wood and timber, twenty years before, and by offsetting this wood and timber against his account, and charging him with the principal and interest of the bond, notwithstanding the lapse of time and his insistment before them that he had paid the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Would Abraham have entered into a submission which would allow the executors to claim, against his account, the value of the wood and timber he had cut from the farm in his possession, and which had since been devised to him 7 He did not make such a submission. The particular subjects of submission were designated. And the case shows sufficient reason why Abraham should not agree to submit the matter of the wood and timber. The father paid for the buildings put on the farms of the other two sons. Should the wood and timber which Abraham took off the farm devised to him be considered as a payment by the father for the buildings put on this farm 7</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Again, it was admitted before the arbitrators that Abraham was charged in the will $4 an acre more, for the farm devised to him, than he was to have been charged under the agreement, also admitted to have been made, by which the several farms were alloted to the several sons and were to be devised to them on paying a certain sum per acre. \u2022 These are abundant reasons why Abraham should not make such a submission as would au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>thorize the arbitrators to charge him with the wood and timber he had taken off the farm allotted and devised to him. The arbitrators did charge him with this wood and timber; and, in doing so, they acted upon a matter not within the submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">For this reason, the award will be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
