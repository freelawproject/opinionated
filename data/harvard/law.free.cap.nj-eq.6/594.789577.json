But, in order to avoid litigation, and in the hope that the matter would be amicably settled, it was agreed, by and between the said executors and this defendant and his said then wife, that this defendant should take $1000 of the proceeds of the sale, and give therefor his bond and mortgage, and, accordingly, on the 15th of April, 1837, four days after the said sale, the said executors paid over to this defendant $1000, part of said proceeds, and he thereupon gave the bond and mortgage mentioned in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-5\">The defendant Anderson further says that his said wife Sarah died January 2d, 1836, leaving a daughter, Ann Eliza, an infant of tender years, and that, on the 6th of June, 1846, he was, by the Orphans' Court of Mercer, admitted as guardian of the estate of the said Ann Eliza, and, as such guardian, he claims to be entitled to the one-seventh of the said $3000, being $428.57, with interest thereon from the said 11th of April, 1837, to be allowed to him out of the sum so secured by the said mortgage, and which, he insists, was loaned to him to secure the payment of such distributive share and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-6\">The defendant Matilda R. Anderson, answering for herself, says that she is the second daughter of the said testator; that she attained 18 on the 4th.of December, 1831; that she lived at home with her mother, the complainant, and earned her livelihood, as she believes, from the time she came of age until she married, and that she never, during that time, or at any time before, demanded or received any part, either of the principal or interest, of her seventh of the proceeds of said sale, but suffered the same to remain in the hands of the said executors, and the interest thereon to accumulate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-7\">The defendants further say that, on the 7th of June, 1839, they intermarried; that after their marriage, they called on the said executors to pay over to them the distributive share to which she, the said Matilda, was entitled, as aforesaid, with interest thereon from the said 11th of April, 1837, but that the said executors refused to do so, still insisting that the said distributive shares were not payable until the youngest daughter attained 18 years, and further represented that, as this defendant Jo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>seph B. Anderson had in his hands $1000 of the proceeds of sale, these defendants were perfectly secure of the final payment of the legacy bequeathed to the said Matilda, as well as that bequeathed to the said Sarah, and now belonging to the said daughter of the defendant Joseph B. Anderson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-5\">The defendants further say that, in the term of September, 1844, of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Mercer county, the complainant, as executor as aforesaid, presented an account for settle-men!, in which she only charges herself with interest on the said $3000 from the 27th of December, 1842, the day when the youngest daughter of said testator came of age ; to which account these defendants and others excepted, claiming that interest ought to be charged on each daughter\u2019s share of said sum from the time of the sale of the said farm <em>; </em>which exception was disallowed by the said court; whereupon the exceptants appealed \u25a0 to the Prerogative Court, and in the term of June, 1845, the said decree of the said Orphans\u2019 Court was reversed, and a decree made that said account should be re-stated by the register of said coart, charging the accountant with interest from the 11th of April, 1837, said interest to commence running, as to each daughter\u2019s share, as she was or became 18 at or after the said 11th of April | and that the said account was so re-stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-6\">That, by said account, it appears that the principal and interest of the share of the said Ann Eliza Anderson, the daughter and ward of the defendant Joseph B. Anderson, remaining in the hands of the complainant on the 26th of June, 1845, after deducting all charges for expenses and commissions allowed to the complainant, was $554.14 j and the principal and interest of the share of this defendant Matilda remaining in the hands of the complainant on the said day, after deducting all charges as aforesaid, was also $554.14 \u2022 and that the said two sums amounted to within about $25 of the whole amount of principal and interest due on the bond and mortgage given by the defendant Joseph 3B. Anderson to the said executors as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-7\">The defendant Anderson, answering for himself, says that he has repeatedly, since the said account has been settled in the Prerogative Court, called on the complainant and offered to pay her the principal and interest of the said bond and mortgage, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>she would pay over to him or satisfactorily secure the distributive shares so as aforesaid due to his said daughter and his wife; but that she has refused to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-5\">The defendants further say, that the complainant is upwards of 60 years old, and very infirm, and not capable, as they believe, to transact business with safety or satisfaction to herself or others; that she has never given any security for the estate in her hands; that this defendant Anderson, on the 5th of December, 1843, with his brother-in-law, J. E. Rose, became security for her on a note given by her to one Theophilus Hart or order, for $560.25, whiel} is still unpaid ; which note was given to secure an individual debt of her own, incurred for labor done for her on the homestead farm while she had the use of it under the will; and that these defendants are under serious apprehension, and believe that if the complainant should get the money due on the said bond and mortgage into her hands, it would be misappropriated, and not applied to the payment of the said distributive shares, and that the same would be thereby lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-6\">The defendants admit that, inasmuch as the money for which the said bond and mortgage were given was a part of the proceeds of the sale of the said Reed farm, and was placed and continued in the hands of the defendant Anderson as a security for the payment of the said distributive shares, the said shares ought to be charged as an equitable lien on the fund secured by the said mortgage; and that the said fund should be applied to the payment and satisfaction of the said sums so due to these defendants, according to their several rights under the will of the said testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-7\">The cause was heard on the pleadings and evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b598-8\">C. <em>S.

These special grounds on which the application to make the set-off is made, therefore, fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The question, then, is, can the distributive share due Anderson\u2019s daughter, of whose estate he is guardian, and the share due his present wife under this will, containing a provision giving tiie executors, or, the survivor of them, the discretion to convey her share to a trustee for her separate use, be set off against the amount due from Anderson to the complainant, on the mortgage given by him to the executors, or can either of these shares be so set off.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In reference to the share of Anderson\u2019s present wife, the discretion given by the will to the surviving executrix to vest it in a trustee for her separate use, is a sufficient reason for refusing to allow the set-off</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">As to the share due Anderson\u2019s ward, Anderson is not here as <em>guardian </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>the bill does not bring him here as such, nor is the ward a party to the suit.
