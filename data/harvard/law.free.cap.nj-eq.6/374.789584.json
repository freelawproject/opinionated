A. Stevens to the complainant, who was at that time secretary of the board of directors of the New Brunswick Co., with a request that he should enter the same in the minutes of the board and that he, the complainant, entered the same accordingly, supposing at the time that the same was correct; but he has since discovered that the said statement is entirely incorrect: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>and that the receipts of the Napoleon for 1836 were $25,116.85, and for 1837 $28,540.57, being for the said two years, $53,657.42, instead of $40,808.37; which, after deducting the disbursements for those years, as stated in said entry, and also the dividend of $40 a share on 200 shares, ordered to be paid on the 1st of February, 1838, would leave in the treasury on that day a balance of $18,095.32, instead of $5246.27, the balance, according to the erroneous statement, entered in said book of minutes by order of said E.

Stevens.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-8\">That the complainant believes that the others persons alluded to by Stevens in his said report made December 5th, 1835, were Robert L.

Stevens; that these persons, together with said James Neilson and Benjamin Fish, (one of the firm of Hill, Fish &amp; Abbe,) were all at the time directors either of the Camden and Amboy Railroad and Transportation Co., or of the Delaware and Raritan Canal Co., and controlled the concerns of said joint companies according to their own discretion; they either owning or controlling a majority of the stock of said joint companies, and electing such directors as they saw proper. And the complainant states, as a reason for his belief, that it appears by the books of the treasurer of the New Brunswick Co., previous to the year 1839, that Robert L. and E. A. Stevens were the owners of 50 shares of the stock of that company ; Robert F. Stockton of 22 shares; John Potter of 20 shares ; James Neilson of 12 shares; Benjamin Fish of 6 shares; John R\u201e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Thomson of 5 shares; John G.

Smith, president of the company, applied to him and told him that James Neilson wanted to borrow the book of minutes from the complainant; that the complainant, believing that Neilson wanted the boob for the said E. A. Stevens, replied that if they got the book, it would not be returned, and, so believing, he did not, at that time, deliver the book of minutes to said Smith. But, soon after said application to him, he, the complainant, bought a blank book, and copied into it the minutes of the proceedings of the company from the original book of minutes, and, after he had transcribed the whole of the minutes into the blank book, he delivered the said copy to the said Smith, who, as the complainant was informed \u25a0 and believes, handed it to Neilson, who delivered it to said E.

Stevens; but the complainant kept the original book of minutes, and still keeps the same in his possession, ready, &amp;o., and to which he refers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-7\">That the book he so delivered has never been returned to the complainant, and he has never been able to obtain possession of it, though, as such secretary, he was entitled to the custody of it, and though, as he believes, he is still the secretary of the company, and has no knowledge that he has ever been turned out of his said office, or that any other secretary has been appointed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-8\">The complainant believes and charges that Smith delivered the said book to Neilson, and that Neilson, shortly after, deliv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>fired it to E. A. Stevens; that, since that time, he has been able to procure but littl information in relation to the proceedings of the company, and that he has not been requested to attend, as secretary, any meeting from the time he delivered the said book of minutes to said Smith, and he believes the reason is because Stevens manages, controls, and directs the business of the company at his will and pleasure, and because he wishes to keep secret the proceedings of the company, and that when he calls in two other directors, it is only as matter of form, to ratify what he has already done, or determined to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-5\">The bill states that Stevens refuses to give the complainant any account or information as to the manner in which he conducts the aifairs of the company, and that he claims a right to conduct them in his own way, and not to give any account of his proceedings, under pretence that he represents the stock of a majority of the stockholders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-6\">That since Stevens has had the control of the company, he has expended, or caused to be expended, very large sums, some for the purposes of the company, and some for purposes wholly foreign to the objects of the company, and without rendering any account to the stockholders or to the board of directors of the company, and without causing the same to be entered in the minutes of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-7\">That he purchased with the funds of the company, and without the consent of the stockholders, four iron steamboats, for $42,703.63 \u2014 a larger sum than they were worth \u2014 which were bought, as the complainant is informed and believes, of Robert E.

Stevens held it in trust for the company; and that E. A. Stevens admitted .that statement to be correct, and then said that a trustee could not hold it for the company, and that -Horace Binncy had given such an opinion, and that the $43,000 was invested in property in Camden and drawing six per cent.

A. Stevens, and a violation of his duty as a director; and, the complainant believes and charges, that- the reason why the title of the Walnut street property was changed from the trustee of the New Brunswick Co., and the amount of money paid for it vested in property in Camden, was, because the Walnut street property had nearly doubled in value since it was purchased with the funds of the New Brunswick Co., and to enable E. A.

And the complainant shows, that Smith, the president of the company, made inquiry of Neilson and Stevens what the object of said meeting was ; and he was given to understand that its object was to take the business of transporting merchandise and other articles on the Camden and Amboy road from the New Brunswick Co., and give it to the Union Transportation Co., or some other company; and thereupon the said Smith refused to preside at said board, or take any part in the proceedings thereof. And then the said Stevens, Neilson and Thomson proceeded to elect, or pretended to elect, Richard Stockton as a director, in the place of his father, Robert F. Stockton. That the said pretended election was wholly illegal and void, there being no vacancy at the time, and there having been no notice given of a meeting of directors for the purpose of such election, and no notice given of any special election for directors according to the directions of the charter and the by-laws of the company. That after the said pretended election, the said Richard Stockton took his seat at the board, and Stevens, Neilson, Thomson and said Stockton passed, as the complainant has been informed and believes, some resolution to take away the business of transporting goods and merchandise on the Camden and Amboy Railroad from the New Brunswick Co., and give it to the Union Transportation Company.

A. Stevens nominated William Cook as chairman, and he was thereupon appointed chairman ; and Stevens then nominated Richard Stockton as secretary of the meeting, which was agreed to by the meeting. That Stevens nominated then the said William Cook, Richard Stockton and Isaac Eisher a committee to examine several genera! statements or schedules, in large sheets of paper, which had been previously laid on the table; that the complainant then inquired 'when it was expected the said committee should report; and it was thereupon stated by some one of the directors of the company, that the said committee could do no more than take a general search in the prepared schedule, comparing it with the books when necessary; that the said committee were thereupon appointed, and the meeting adjourned till after dinner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-11\">That at said meeting he saw lying on the table the copy of the book of original minutes which he had delivered to Smith in 1838; and that he opened it and found that various entries had been made in it since he had parted with it, and among others, an entry setting forth that a loan had been made by the directors of $27,123, to the Camden and Amboy Railroad and Transportation Co., on the 20th of May, 1839.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-12\">The complainant states that the said loan was entirely unknown to him until he discovered it as aforesaid; that the said loan was illegal, not only on the ground that the New Brunswick Co. have no authority, by their charter, to loan money, but because the Camden and Amboy Railroad and Transportation Co. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>have no authority to borrow money; and that the said loan is a violation of trust on the part of said Stevens, Janies Neilson and such other of the directors of the New Brunswick Co. as assented to it, and a violation of their duty as such directors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-5\">That he also discovered an entry made in said book, signed by John R.

Stockton, for the book, and ho replied that the complainant could not have it, that the gate was shut; and while the complainant was talking privately with the secretary, J. R. Thomson turned to him, and in an angry manner told him not to let the complainant question him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-8\">That said Thomson offered a resolution to the meeting, that the said company should go into liquidation. To this resolution some of the stockholders objected, and M. C.

This resolution was seconded by Mr. Laurence Fisher, one of the stockholders present. Upon this, E. A. Stevens rose, and in a rude and offensive manner said that Hager and his man, William Halsted, should not have the books; that while the resolution to go into liquidation was under consideration, the complainant offered, as an amendment to it, the following resolution, viz.: <em>\u201cResolved, </em>That the books be opened to every stockholder, and time be given for examination.\u201d This resolution the chairman refused to put to \u25a0 the meeting, or to allow any vote to be taken on it. The resolution offered by Thomson was then carried, Stevens, Thomson, J. Neilson, A. S. Neilson, R. Stockton, I. Fisher, William Cook, M. C.

Hoagland not voting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\">That Mr. Patterson then inquired\u2019 in what way the company would go on and wind up its affairs, as the Chancellor had already put an injunction on the directors, restraining them from disposing of the property of the company. To this question J. R. Thomson replied, in a low tone of voice, that the Chancellor had enjoined E. A. Stevens alone, and there would be no difficulty in getting rid of Stevens.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">That soon afterwards Stevens moved that I. Fisher, A. S, Neilson, B. Fish, Wm. McKnight and J. McKnight be empowered to act with the board of directors in the sale of the property of the company; that the complainant protested and voted against this resolution, but that the same' was passed by a majority of the stockholders then present, though the complainant believes and charges that the stockholders who voted for it were a minority of the whole number of the stockholders of the company, many of them not being present,, and some of those present not voting on the resolution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-7\">That on all the questions submitted to the said meeting, the vote was taken <em>viva vooe, </em>each stockholder giving one vote.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-8\">That the number who voted for the resolution to go into liquidation, and the resolution offered by Stevens, was not more than thirteen; that the whole number of stockholders does not, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the complainant believes and charges, exceed thirty-three. That of this number twelve were absent, and six of those present did not vote, and the complainant voted against said resolutions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-5\">The complainant insists that the whole property of the company ought not to be sold and the affairs of the company wound up, and the franchises of the stockholders taken from them without the consent of at least a majority of the whole number of stockholders, given at a special meeting called for the purpose, due notice of the object of the meeting being previously given to all the stockholders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-6\">The complainant believes and charges that the said meeting of stockholders was got up by Stevens and Thomson, for the purpose of enabling them to elude the injunction against Stevens, and to enable them to dispose of the property before the complainant could take further measures to restrain them <em>\u00a1 </em>and that the resolutions offered by Thomson and Stevens were concerted and contrived by them for the sole purpose of enabling Stevens to dispose of the property of the company, without the consent of all the stockholders, and in violation, virtually, if not literally, of the injunction issued in this cause j and that the stockholders who voted for the said resolutions offered by said Thomson and Stevens, were either directors, or agents, or engineers of the Camden and Amboy Railroad and Tranporlation Co., or of the Delaware and Raritan Cana!

And the complainant insists, that the duty of the directors extends only to the conducting and carrying on the business of the company, and not to the commission of any act which shall destroy the company, or the vested rights or franchises of any of the stockholders j and that any act on the part of the directors having for its object to dispose of all the property of the company, and to wind up its concerns, or, in the language of the resolution offered by said Thom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>son, to cause it to go into liquidation, is a breach of trust on the part of the directors who voted for said resolutions, and a violation of their duty as directors of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-5\">That since he gave to his solicitor and counsel instructions for preparing the original bill, he has acertained, from information on which he places reliance, and therefore charges that said Stevens, without the consent of the board or stockholders, purchased with the funds of the company, nine shares of the stock of said New Brunswick Co., for the sum of $10,361, or at the rate of $1150 a share for stock, the par value of which is only $250 a share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-6\">That at the time the complainant gave instructions for preparing the original bill, he was under the impression that said Stevens had purchased eight shares of the stock of James Bishop, for himself, and with his own funds, and so informed his solicitor and counsel; and that he derived that impression from a conversation with said Stevens, in which Stevens, conversing about the purchase of said stock of said Bishop, made use of these words, or words to this effect: \u201c If I choose to pay more for the stock than it is worth, it is no business of yours.\u201d That the complainant did not, until the original bill was filed, inform his solicitor and counsel that said stock had been bought by said Stevens with the money of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-7\">That the purchase of said stock was not necessary for the objects of the corporation, and that the company have no right to purchase or hold the stock of the company in any manner not expressly authorized by the act of incorporation ; and the complainant charges, that there is no express authority given in said act to purchase, hold or deal in stock ; and that the purchase of the said eight shares of Bishop by said, Stevens, with the funds of the company, and also the purchase of one share of the stock of the company of Frederick Richmond, by said Stevens, with the money of the company, was a breach of trust in Stevens, and a violation of his duty as a director.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-8\">That the complainant has learned, since the filing of his original bill, that the person to whom Stevens sold the thirteen barges, mentioned in the original bill, was Morris Buckman, who, the complainant charges, was the same person to whom said Ste<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>vens, or the directors of the company, sold ten barges, by resolution of December 30th, 1836, more fully set forth in the original bill. That Stevens well knew, at the time he sold said thirteen barges, that Buckman had never paid for the first ten barges he bought of the company in 1836, and that the company had lost upwards of $17,000 by him, and to which amount, and more, he was still indebted to the company, at the time the said last sale of barges was made. That if the last-mentioned sale to Buckman was a <em>bona fide </em>sale, it was made at a price much less than the real value of said thirteen barges, it being only, as complainant has been informed, for about $1400 apiece, whereas he charges that said barges, at the time of the sale, were worth $2000 apiece.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-4\">The complainant charges that said sale of the thirteen barges, for the consideration aforesaid, and while the said ten barges remained unpaid for, was a breach of trust in Stevens, and a violation of his duty as a director.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">The complainant states that, he believes that said I.

Stevens, and that besides the above named there were fifteen others to whom said sto'ck was sold and transferred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"197\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-5\">They admit that said R.. L. Stevens, R. F. Stockton, John Potter, J. R. Thomson and J. C. Stevens, together with James JSeilson and B. Fish, were at the time directors in one or the other of the two joint companies mentioned in the bill; but they deny that the said persons controlled the management or concerns of the said companies, or either owned or controlled a majority of the stock of said companies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"198\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-6\">They admit that prior to 1839, the stock of the said Transportation Co. was held and owned by the several persons named in Schedule 1, annexed to the bill, and that a considerable number of the shares of said stock not held by the persons above particularly named, were held by the agents, engineers, clerks, or persons interested in the joint companies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"199\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-7\">The defendants, Stevens and JSTeilson, of their own knowledge, and Thomson as before, say and admit that the complainant was appointed secretary as stated in the bill, and continued and acted as such until April, 1839, and was fully aware of all the proceedings of the stockholders and directors, and in no instance, as far as they know or have ever heard, made any complaint, or expressed or intimated any dissatisfaction or objection in relation thereto. But the complainant was not continued in that office after the annual election on the 6th of May, 1839, and did not act as such; but the board, from time to time, appointed a secretary <em>pro tern., </em>and afterwards appointed Abraham S. Neil-son secretary of the company, and he has been continued in that office by the said directors, and is now the secretary of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"200\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-8\">They admit that after the complainant ceased to be secretary, M.

A. Stevens, and deny that the same, or the alleged copy thereof, was ever delivered to said Stevens, or has ever been in his possession or custody; and they deny that the complainant is now, or has been since the first Monday in May, 1839, the secretary of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"201\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-5\">They admit that the complainant has not since that time been requested to attend any meeting of the board as secretary; but they deny that the reason therefor is, or that it is true, that E. A. Stevens manages, controls and directs, or ever has, the business of the company at his will and pleasure or otherwise, except so far as his office as a director required him to do, and so far as the superintendence and agency in assisting therein was entrusted to him by the stockholders and the board, and then at all times in strict subordination to them, as above stated; and they deny that when the directors or any of them are called together, it is only, or in any sense, a matter of form, or to ratify what he has done or determined to do, or because he wishes to keep secret the proceedings of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"202\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-6\">They say that the book delivered by the complainant to the president was by them believed to be the original book of minutes and treated as such, and the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders and directors have been entered therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"203\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-7\">, They deny that E.

E. Stockton, in the bill mentioned, were purchased by E. A. Stevens; but they admit and say that the board of directors purchased the same from R. E. Stockton, at the price in the bill named, which these defendants then believed and now believe to have been their fair value at that time ; and although it is true that said R. P. Stockton was at that time a director in the company, it is not true that he acted as such director, in any manner, in ordering, directing, or making such purchase. They say that said steamboats were built for the express purpose of being used as canal boats, to be propelled by steam, instead of horse power, and so that, after passing through the canal, they could continue to their destination without any addition or change of power; and that they were in good faith bought by the said directors to be used, and were used for the carrying on their said transportation business, through the Delaware and Raritan canal, to and from Philadelphia ; and the same were bought in good faith, and in the exercise of their best judgment, to carry on the legitimate and proper business of said company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-6\">They deny that either Stevens or the said directors have at any time, since the organization of the company, bought any schooners; and, denying that Stevens in any manner, independent of, or without the authority of the said directors, bought or built the canal boats next herein admitted, they admit that the board of directors built the steamboat Raritan, and built another iron canal boat, called the Mars, to be towed through the canal, but which was not a steamboat, and fifteen canal boats, and sixteen coal canal boats, (which canal boats are often called barges, as designated in the bill,) and at or about the prices in the bill named, and also bought the steamboat Hornet, as therein alleged; and they admit and say, that the three vessels called the Porpoise, Delaware, and Whale, were not purchased by E. A. Stevens, but were built by the said directors, at or about the price allege! in the bill; but they say that, when so built, .the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>three last-named vessels were and still are canal boats, and that after they had been for many years used as mere canal boats, without sails, the said directors caused sails and rigging to be added to them, for the purpose of enabling them, after they had been towed through the canal, to pursue their voyage without the expense of other propelling power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"206\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\">They admit, and say that, prior to April 1st, <em>1846, </em>the Delaware, Porpoise, and Whale were used during the winter, and while the canal navigation was interrupted, and, so far as they recollect, during that period only, in carrying freight between South Amboy and New York, by the authority and consent of said directors, of whom E. A. Stevens was one; and that since April 1st, 1846, two of said three canal boats last mentioned have been employed in carrying freight between South Amboy and New York, by the like consent and authority; but, in all cases, only when the navigation through the canal was obstructed as aforesaid, and that upon charter, and on full compensation therefor to the company. And they deny that <em>the </em>said three boats were bought or built to enable said Stevens to carry into effect any contract with the Camden and Amboy Railroad Co. in the bill mentioned or referred to, or any other contract with said railroad company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"207\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">They deny that said Stevens, or the said directors, or any of them, have caused the said iron steamboats, or any of them, to be employed in the transportation of goods or merchandise between Philadelphia and Hartford; but they admit that the said directors did, for a short time, authorize the said steamboats to be so employed between Philadelphia and Albany, in or about the summer of 1844; and they say that <em>the </em>said running of said boats was authorized in good faith, in aid of the general object of the charter, and not in violation thereof; and the same and the aforesaid employment of the Delaware, Porpoise, and Whale were well known to the complainant and the other stockholders, and no objection thereto made or intimated, as far as they have ever heard or known, until the filing of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"208\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-7\">They say that at or before the original subscription to the stock of the company, the complainant and his said associates making such subscription, or some of them, bought for the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>of the company, a sloop called the James Bennet, and invested a portion of the capital therein, and the same was, by the approbation of the complainant and the other stockholders, employed in the transportation business of the company for several years j and they say that neither the employment of the said three above-named canal boats fitted with sails, nor the addition of sails thereto, was, as they arc advised and believe, any breach of trust, or violation of the charier.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"209\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">They say it is not true that said E. A. Stevens bought or caused to be bought, with the funds of the said transportation company, any real estate in Philadelphia, and caused the title thereto to be vested in one of his brothers, or that he has been guilty of any breach of trust in relation to the Walnut street property, or any violation of his doty as a director of the companjp and they say, Stevens of his own knowledge, and Neilson and Thomson partly on their own knowledge, and partly on information they believe to be true, that the property in the bill called the Walnut street property, together with other valuable real estate in Philadelphia, adjacent thereto, was purchased in or about the year 1835, by E. A. Stevens and his brother Robert, for the use and benefit of the Camden and Philadelphia Steamboat Ferry Co., a corporation erected by or under the concurrent acts of the legislatures of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and not for the use and benefit or with the funds of the said New Brunswick Co., and which said ferry company were and now are largely solvent, and of large responsibility, fully adequate to render the advance made by the said transportation company, on account of the said real estate, secure ; and the said real estate was, at the time of the said purchase, conveyed to them, the said R. L. &amp; E. A. Stevens, and the title thereto has been held by them from that time to this ; and that the said ferry company then assumed and held the equitable ownership of the said real estate, subject to the payment to the said R. L. <em>&amp; </em>E. A. Stevens of the amount by them paid therefor, or secured to be paid by the bonds secured by mortgages on the said property <em>; </em>and that the said Robert L. <em>&amp; </em>E. A. Stevens had no private individual interest in the said real estate, except for the repayment aforesaid of the discharge of the said bond and mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>gages, and have never had any other private individual interest therein from that day to the present time, and have always been willing and ready to have the title, estate and interest in and to the said property applied to the benefit of either the Camden and Philadelphia Steamboat Ferry Co. or the said New Brunswick Co., as it ought in equity and good conscience to be applied; that after the said purchase the said Ferry Co. had and received the rents, income and use of the whole of said real estate, and repaid to the said R. L. &amp; E. A. Stevens the money paid by them, and assumed the payment of the said bonds and mortgages, and the said real estate continued to be so held, owned, used and enjoyed until 1839; that prior to that year it became necessary for the said transportation company to have the use of some stores and offices and water front in Philadelphia for the purposes of their above-mentioned transportation business; and thereupon, and in or about 1837, the said R. <em>L. </em>&amp; E. A. Stevens, by and with the concurrence of the said Ferry Co., permitted the said transportation' company to have the use of about one-third of the said real estate, (being the portion thereof which is denominated the Walnut street property,) at a rent of $2800 per annum ; and the said transportation company, by the authority of the directors thereof, took the possession and had the use thereof from that time, at the rent aforesaid, until the spring of 1839; that on the 20th of May, 1839, at a meeting of the directors of the said transportation company, held on that day, the said E. A. Stevens presented a map of the said portion of the said real estate then rented by the said company, and submitted to the said directors the propriety of purchasing the said property, consisting of two stores, a wharf and water lot, at a price not to exceed the capital of the then present rents, viz., $46,-666.66; and it was thereupon, at the same meeting, resolved by the said directors that the said E. A. Stevens be authorized to purchase the said property for the said transportation company, on the terms aforesaid, and that the sums paid from time to time be applied to the payment of the said mortgages on the said property, in which terms the said ferry company acquiesced, and the said sum was afterwards advanced by the said transportation company to effect the object of the said resolution ; and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>said transportation company continued in the use and enjoyment of the said property for the purposes of their said business and of the income and receipts arising therefrom; and thereupon, or shortly thereafter, the said R. L. <em>&amp; </em>E. A. Stevens caused the conveyances to be prepared to vest the legal title to the same in the said last-mentioned company; but before consummating the said contemplated purchase, eminent counsel in Philadelphia was consulted, and the said directors of the said company were advised, and as these defendants verily believe, truly advised, that the said company could not, under the laws of Pennsylvania, hold real estate within that state; in consequence of which advice and belief, the said deeds were never executed and delivered by the said R. L. <em>&amp; </em>E. A. Stevens, but the said amount of the said purchase money had, nevertheless, in good faith, and without any knowledge of the existence of any obstacle to the said purchase, and to secure the necessary and proper use and enjoyment of the said premises for the benefit and advantage of the said transportation company, been applied to the said mortgages thereon. By reason of all which the said transportation company became equitably entitled, either to have the said money refunded to them by the ferry company, or to have and receive the proceeds of the sale of said property whenever the same .should be sold; and their equitable rights in this respect were fully recognized by the said ferry company, who permitted them to continue in the use and enjoyment of the said property and of the receipts therefrom, and thereafter, in March, 1846, the agent and superintendent of the ferry company stated an account of the said transaction, by crediting the transportation company ihe amount of the said advance, with interest thereon, and all payments made by them on account of said property, with interest thereon, and charging them with the rent for the use of the said property and their receipts from the same and interest on such rents and receipts, by which statement it appeared that the balance due said transportation company, according to such statement, was $43,014.20, which sum is the amount in the bill untruly stated to be or to have been invested in property in Camden, ISTew Jersey. And the said transportation company have not, in fact, so far as these defendants have any knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>or information, any money whatever invested in any property in Camden.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"210\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\">They say that eminent counsel in the State of Pennsylvania did advise the said company that the said property could not be held in trust for the said company, and they say, as to all the statements in the bill in regard to said \"Walnut street property, and the said sum of $43,014.20, and in regard to the conversations or admissions of E. A. Stevens, so far as such statements in the bill are inconsistent with the truth of the foregoing allegations in respect thereto, they are false and untrue; and, on the best of their knowledge, information, and belief, they deny that the said property has yielded an annual income of 15 per cent, upon the sum. so as aforesaid advanced by the company, or anything near it, or that the said property has in any degree increased in value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"211\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-6\">The defendant Stevens says that E.

A. Stevens otherwise purchased the said property, although he acted, in procuring the conveyance, on the be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>half of the said company, and by the authority and with the concurrence of the directors; and they deny that there was any breach of trust or violation of duty in relation thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"214\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-5\">They deny that E. A. Stevens, as sole manager, or otherwise, as in the bill is stated, made the loan to himself, in the bill alleged, but they say it has been the practice of the company, from its first organization, to reserve a portion of their earnings or profits, from time to time, to provide for the building or purchase of boats, for the carrying on of their business, as they were required, and also to provide against the very heavy risks necessarily incident to the extensive business in which they were engaged, which, at times, involved the transportation of more than $100,000,000 worth of goods iu a year, and that, out of such reserved earnings, the directors of said company, in or about 1840, did lend to said R. L. <em>&amp; </em>E. A. Stevens, who are both of ample responsibility to render the same secure, the sum of $14,400.20, but not on their personal security alone. On the contrary, they say that the payment thereof, with interest, was secured by their note and the hypothecation of stock, worth, as these defendants believe, at least fifty per cent, more than the amount of such loan, and the same was regularly entered in the books of account of the treasurer df said company, the proper place for such entry; and they deny that said loan was any breach of trust or violation of duty on their part, or on the part of any of the directors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"215\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-6\">The defendants admit that other moneys have, in like manner, been loaned by .said directors of said company, to other individuals, amounting to $12,810.63, but they say that ample security has, at all times, been taken, and held for the re-payment thereof, with interest; and they deny all breach of trust or violation of duty in regard thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"216\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-7\">They deny that any agreement was entered into by any company or companies, or on their behalf, with the said transportation company, or with any person on the behalf of the said transportation company, that the said transportation company should pay an aggregate yearly sum for transportation on the said canal, as in the bill is stated, or that any similar agreement was made, or of any purport similar to that stated in the bill.

Freeman ; and they say that other books of account are kept on hoax\u2019d the steamboat running between New Brunswick and New Yox\u2019k, by the clerk thereof; and that, during the various years of the operations of the company, the other agents in New York and Philadelphia have kept their own proper books of account of all the business done in those cities by or with them as such agents, and returned an account of such business, with the bills and vouchers thereof, to be entered in the books of the company in-the hands of the said Anderson ; and that all other books of account are kept, and have been kept, by the treasurer, at his office-in New Brunswick; and all of the said company\u2019s books of account have been, from time to time, submitted to the dix\u2019ectors of the company, and have been, at all times, open to their inspection and examination. And they deny that the said book of minutes, in the bill mentioned, is now, or ever has been, in the possession, custody or keeping of the said E. A. Stevens.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"232\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-6\">As to theAmounts of the said earnings of the respective boats, vessels and lines conducting the business of said company, they cannot state whether they amount to the various sums in that behalf alleged in the bill, from the year 1836 to this time, but they admit that the amounts of such earnings have been great;. and they say they have all been du'ly accounted for and divided to and among the stockholders, invested, expended or reserved in manner above stated ; and that, over and above the current expenses of the company, there has been actually paid, since 1836, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>for dividends, the sum of $96,000, and the amount accumulated and now belonging to the company, invested in steamboats, canal boats, and other property purchased in good faith for the carrying on of their business, together with their aforesaid reserved or surplus fund, amounts to more than four times the capital of the said company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"233\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-4\">As to the alleged concealment of the aforesaid hooks of account of the business of the company, or any orders or directions to have the same concealed, or any efforts made by the stockholders, or any of them, to see or have an opportunity to examine said books, the defendants Neilson and Thomson have made do such concealment, nor given any such orders, nor received any such application, nor had the custody or keeping of such boobs of account, nor had any information of any such orders, concealment or directions; and the defendant Stevens, for himselfj says that he has never had the said books of account in his possession, keeping or custody,-the same being, at all times, in the hands of the proper agents, treasurer and other officers of said company; that he has never given any orders or directions to such agents, treasurer or other officers to conceal the said hooks, or to keep the same concealed from the stockholders, or from any of them; and that it is not true that he has been repeatedly called upon by the complainant, or by other stockholders, to permit them to see the books of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"234\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-5\">That, according to his best recollection, and as he verily believes, the only stockholder who has ever, prior to the 18'th of March, 1847, applied to him, or to any other agent or officer of the company, to see the books of the company, was James Bishop, senior, now deceased, about three or four years since, whose object, as understood by this defendant, E. A. Stevens, was to learn the value of his interest in said company as a stockholder, and in two conversations made such request; this defendant stated to said Bishop his opinion that it was important to the interest of the stockholders that the business of the company and the profits of the business should not be made public, and the interests of the stockholders be prejudiced by the competition which would thereby be attracted, and in good faith, and with the only desire to benefit the stockholders and promote their common interests, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>gave said Bishop his reasons for such opinion, which were as hereinafter more particularly stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"235\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-5\">That, though it is true that said Stevens did not exhibit to said Bishop the books of the company, or give any orders or directions to the clerks, agents, book-keepers or treasurer of the company to exhibit the same to him for his inspection, this defendant did not refuse to allow him to inspect or examine them, but gave to him such information and explanations that he declared himself perfectly satisfied, and, so far as he, Stevens, has ever known or heard, the said Bishop was perfectly satisfied, and so continued to the time of his death ; and as to any refusal by him, Stevens, to give the complainant any account or information as to the mode or manner in which the affairs of the company are or have been conducted, and as to any calls made upon him, or upon any other officer or agent of the company by the complainant, or any other stockholder or stockholders, to see and have an opportunity to examine the books of said company, either in the possession of said Anderson, or the said treasurer, or of any other agent or officer of the company, or the said book of minutes, none of which were or have been in the possession or custody of said Stevens.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"236\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-6\">Stevens says he has no knowledge, information or recollection, and does not believe that, prior to said March 18th, any such call or request was ever made on him or any other agent or officer, by the complainant or any other stockholder not being a director of the company, and that the only application or applications made to him by complainant, prior to the day last mentioned, for information in regard to the affairs of the company, were for this defendant\u2019s appraisal of the value of the property of the company, consisting of steamboats, iron propellers, canal boats, and other property of the company, and a statement founded upon such appraisal of all the assets and liabilities of the company, to enable the complainant to sell his stock in the company, as hereinafter stated, and under the circumstances following, viz.: at or about April 1st, 1846, James Bishop, Jr., a stockholder, called on the defendant E. A. Stevens, and stated to him that he, Bishop, wished to sell his stock in the said company, and with that object, and for that purpose, wished to learn from this de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>fendant what was its then value; and the defendant, from a desire to oblige Bishop, and aid him in making a just estimate, prepared in good faith, and according to the best information he possessed or could obtain, and according to his best judgment, this defendant\u2019s appraisal of the property of the company, and a statement founded thereon of the assets and liabilities of the oampany, so as to show the value of the stock; and this defendant is informed, and verily believes, that a similar appraisal, statement, and estimate was, without any concert or communication with this defendant, E. A. Stevens, prepared by M. C. Smith, the president, in connection with one or more of the stockholders, which said statements and estimates were found by said Bishop very nearly to agree in their results; and thereupon this defendant, E. A. Stevens, consented to purchase the stock of said Bishop, such purchase to be for the company, if the board of directors should deem it expedient and for the interest of the stockholders to take the samo, and if not, then for the private account of this defendant, and did purchase the same accordingly ; and the said appraisals and estimates so made, and the said sale, were communicated to the complainant, who, thereafter, saw this defendant, and requested him to buy his, the complainant\u2019s, stock, at the same price, which this defendant declined, and stated to him that it had been suggested that his aforesaid estimate and statement was, in some respects, inaccurate; upon which, the complainant requested this defendant to revise his aforesaid estimates and appraisals, and prepare a new statement for him; which this defendant consented to do as soon as his leisure would permit; aud thereafter, on or about March 12th, 1847, the complainant called on this defendant, at his private residence at Hoboken, before this defendant had been able to revise or re-examine the said statement, aud urged this defendant to buy his said stock at the price aforesaid ; and on several occasions the complainant saw this defendant, aud made the like request; and in one instance, in company with Laurence Fisher, another stockholder, who also expressed a desire to sell his stock. And, so far as this defendant then had any intimation, or believed, or now believes, the refusal of this defendant to buy the stock of the complainant was the only subject or occasion of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>satisfaction on the part of the complainant. And this defendant denies that said Bishop, junior, or the complainant, or the said Eisher, or any other of the stockholders, have made any request to see the said books of the company, or asked any other information of the affairs or business of the company, or of the manner in which the same were conducted, except as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"237\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-5\">The defendants admit and say, that said Stevens has frequently, in conversations with the stockholders, or some of them, and as they believe in his said conversations with said Bishop, senior, expressed his strong desire that the business of the company and the profits thereof should not be made public, and for the reasons then and often before and since given, that it would invite competition, and so prejudice the interests of the stockholders; and that, in the peculiar business in which they were engaged, it was especially important, and had been found essential to success in the \u2022business, by all steamboat and transportation companies; and such was in fact his opinion, in good xaith, without any concealment or deceit; and, so far as he ever knew or believed, until the filing of the bill, all the stockholders concurred; and he says that, otherwise than so far forth as he entertained and expressed the said opinion, he has never expressed any unwillingness to have any of the affairs of the company, or books of account, or proceedings examined by any person, or to give any person any information in relation thereto in his power. And he says that, so far as he has had any agency, management, or superintendence of the affairs of the company, the same has always been fully accounted for to the board of directors, and the business so done regularly entered in the books of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"238\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-6\">The defendants, in relation to the alleged call made on Stevens on the 18th of March, 1847, say it is not true that Stevens stated to the complainant that he, Stevens, managed the company as a close corporation, and should not give any statements of the earnings or profits of the company to the complainant. But, \u25a0on the contrary, Stevens, being in attendance at New Brunswick upon a meeting of the directors held that day, stated distinctly to the complainant, and to other stockholders then present, that .he would cause a meeting of all the stockholders of the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>to be called within a few days, and that at such meeting all the books of the company, and all the accounts of the business of the company, froin the first, would be laid before the stockholders for their examination, and thereupon, and without any notice of any application by the complainant to this court, or of any intention on the part of the complainant to make such application, a meeting of the stockholders of the company was called by the secretary of the company, by authority of the said directors, to be held at New Brunswick, on the 3d of April, 1847. And for the purpose of facilitating the full and satisfactory examination of the said books of the accounts of the business of the company, and the property thereof, and all the earnings, dividends and profits arising therefrom, the said directors, without any notice as aforesaid, caused full and accurate abstracts to be <em>made </em>up <em>from </em>the said books <em>of </em>the book-keepers in the employment of the company, showing the assets and property of the company, the state of their said accounts, and the business, earnings, profits, and dividends therefrom, and all and every the matters aforesaid, from tile first organization of the company, to be laid before the said stockholders to be examined, together with the said books, to be compared therewith, and investigated as the said stockholders might think proper. And in pursuance of such call, the said meeting of stockholders was convened, at the time and place aforesaid, and in pursuance of the assurance ho given to the company, the said other stockholders, by said E\u201e A. Stevens, and not for the purpose or with any intent to elude or evade any action or order of this court, or on account or in any manner by reason of any application to this court, but in good faith for the full satisfaction of all the stockholders, in accordance with such assurance, all the books of the said company and the said abstracts thereof, were laid before the said stockholders by the treasurer and board of directors, and a committee was thereupon appointed to examine the same, and report thereon, by whom, during an interval of adjournment allowed for that purpose, such investigation and examination was made, and reported, and as these defendants believe, to the entire satisfaction of all the said stockholders except the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"239\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-5\">The defendants say there is no provision in the charter of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>company requiring that the office of the directors be kept in New Jersey, but, nevertheless, they say that an office has always been kept in New Brunswick, by the treasurer of the company, in which the books of accounts of the treasurer are and always have been kept.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"240\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-5\">The defendants say that on or about March 18th, 1847, they were informed, and they believe it to be true, that the complainant was, in connection with sundry associates, about to commence the running of a steamboat from New Brunswick to New York, in opposition to the boat of the company, and they say he has admitted that such is his intention; and they believe that the whole object of the complainant, since he conceived such intention, and the object of filing his said bill, is to create difficulty in the company, expose its affairs and the private interests of the stockholders therein to the public, and, so far as in his power, to injure and break down the business of the company. And they say that since they received such information, E. A. Stevens has, as they admit, as one of the stockholders, having a very large interest in the company, and not otherwise, remonstrated and objected to subjecting the affairs of the company to such exposure, for the reasons above set forth, and for no other reason whatever, and with no purpose, object, or design than to promote the best interests of all the stockholders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"241\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-6\">The defendants say that the said board of directors, and not E. A. Stevens, in the exercise of their best discretion, and, as they then believed and now believe, for the best interest of the stockholders, sold sixteen coal barges, the property of the company; that they did not call a meeting of the stockholders to consult them in regard to such sale, that it has not been usual to call such meetings or consult the stockholders in regard to the details of the business of the company, from the first organization to the present time; these defendants believing that the purpose for which the directors of the company were appointed was the conduct and management of such details, in their discretion, as the interest of the stockholders might require; and they deny that Stevens, or any of the defendants, or the said board of directors, have any intention of selling the said sixteen freight barges in the bill mentioned, unless the company should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>go into liquidation and cause its affairs to be wound up and settled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"242\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-5\">The defendants, denying as before that Stevens has independently, and not in subordination to the board and with their authority, concurrence or approbation, done anything in the premises, say that the business of the said company has, by and with such consent, authority and approbation, been done, and the accounts thereof kept in and under various names used to discriminate the different branches of their business, and for greater convenience in keeping the accounts thereof and distinguishing the different interests of the various persons who have from time to time been interested with them in the business done by them or in the different branches thereof. And in so doing, although these defendants do not now recollect the use of all the names in that behalf alleged in the bill, they are willing, for (be purposes of this suit, to admit and do admit that all of the said names may have been used for the purposes aforesaid, during the period of the existence of the company ; but t hey utterly deny that such names have been used for the purpose of concealing or keeping secret the operations or business of said company from the public or the stockholders, or to prevent theta from obtaining any information in regard to the proceedings of the company, or for any unlawful or improper purpose, or from any other design or motive than to promote the convenient, safe and successful prosecution of the said business, and make the same profitable to the stockholders for their benefit and advantage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"243\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-6\">They admit and say that from the time when E. A. Stevens consented, on the application of the said associates who after-wards became stockholders in the year 1831, to unite his interest iu the transportation business with them, and became a stockholder as before stated, lie has given thereto his best endeavors and exertions, in good faith, to promote the success of the company, enlarge its business and increase its profits for the benefit of the stockholders therein; and that in so doing he has at ail times preserved a vigilant general superintendence of the affairs of the company and its various agents, and under the authority of tiie hoard of directors, and with their concurrence and appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>bat-ion and in subordination to the president and directors, has managed the affairs and business of the company with fidelity and skill and greatly to the advantage of the said stockholders, and in such wise that the board of directors have been able to declare and pay to the stockholders annual dividends of from 16 to 18 per cent, per annum, from 1831 to this time, over and above the current expenses of the company and the aforesaid accumulation of capital, by earnings and profits of the business of the company, invested and reserved as aforesaid, amounting to more than four times the amount of the capital paid in by the <em>stockholders; </em>and that in his said general superintendence, the said Stevens has, with the concurrence and approbation of the said board of directors, and with the full knowledge and acquaintance of all the stockholders, from the year 1831 to the filing of the bill, exercised broad discretionary powers, and that no complaint has ever been made by any stockholder in relation thereto, or the management of the affairs of the company; and in such management the said Stevens has always done what, in good faith and in his best discretion, he deemed for the interest of the stockholders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"244\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-5\">The defendants say that the conduct and management of the affairs of the company, so far as the same has devolved on said Stevens as above stated, has been, and as they believe, is now entirely satisfactory to every stockholder in the company, the complainant not excepted; and in confirmation of this they say that at the said meeting of the stockholders at New Brunswick, on the 3d of April, 1847, every share of stock was represented by the holder thereof in person or by proxy, except two shares in the name of A. Jenkins, deceased, in behalf of whose estate, however, his brother, M. Jenkins, was present and acted, (in what capacity the defendants are ignorant,) and except, also, one share in the name ofWilliam Gulick, who was absent. That at such meeting the said stockholders were informed that the complainant had given notice of an intention to apply to this court for the receivers prayed for in the bill, and thereupon the following resolution was unanimously passed by the stockholders, the complainant being present and voting for it, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"245\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-6\">\u201c <em>Resolved, </em>That the thanks of the stockholders are due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Edwin A.

An injunction, pursuant to the prayer of the bill, was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><em>A </em>supplemental bill was afterwards filed, stating other facts, and making other persons defendants, and praying the same relief against them, and praying that they and the defendants in the original bill may be restrained by injunction from disposing of any property of the company, and from winding up its a-fiairSp or causing it to go into liquidation, without the consent of the stockholders. An injunction, pursuant to the prayer of this bill, was also allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">A motion is now made, on the part of the complainant, for the appointment of a receiver, to take charge of certain real estate situated in Pennsylvania, on the Delaware river \u2014 one tract in Bristol and the other in Philadelphia (called the Walnut street property)- \u2014 alleged by the hill to have been purchased with the funds of the said \u201c The New Brunswick,\u201d &amp;c., the legal title to which tracts, respectively, is in the name of one or more individuals, without the recognition of any interest of \u201c The New Brunswick,\u201d &amp;c., therein; and also to take charge of certain moneys, alleged in the original bill to be the funds of \u201c The New Brunswick,\u201d &amp;c., in the hands of E. A. Stevens, the use of which, the bill alleges, he has improperly obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The answer of the defendants to the original and supplemental bill has been read in opposition to the motion; and, among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>other things, states that the said moneys were loaned to said Stevens by the board of directors of <em>\u201c </em>The- New Brunswick Steamboat and Canal Transportation Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">There is one ground on which, in view of the whole case as developed by the bill and answer, the motion for a receiver might, perhaps, be safely denied, without considering other objections to the allowance of it. From the allegations of the bill, it would seem to appear that the enormous accumulation of property by the New Brunswick Co., of which the property for which a receiver is asked is claimed to be a part, is the result of a fraud on the rights of others, not parties to this suit, nor parties to the arrangement between the New Brunswick Steamboat and Canal Transportation Co. and the united railroad and canal companies, set forth in the bill, which produced such accumulation. And this may turn out to be so, notwithstanding anything said in the answer. If this be true, this court would not become the instrument to distribute the spoils, on the application of one who has been a stockholder from the beginning in the New Brunswick Steamboat and Canal Transportation Co., and cognizant of the fraudulent arrangement and proceedings which produced such accumulation, which is the position of the complainant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">But the motion must be denied on other grounds. As to the Walnut street property, it was in the use of the New Brunswick Co. a number of years, and during that time the situation of it in reference to title was the same as it is now. While the arrangement with the said united companies existed, and the business charged by the complainant to be illegal and fraudulent, and from which the overgrown accumulation of property arose, was continued, the complainant, with full knowledge of the arrangement, was silent. But when the business was discontinued, the complainant filed his bill, alleging that this property is not necessary for the legitimate business of the New Brunswick Steamboat and Canal Transportation Co., and prays that it may be sold, and the proceeds of it distributed ; and asks that a receiver may at once, on the filing of his bill, be appointed to take charge of it. The complainant is in no more danger now in reference to the title of this property than he has been for years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>and no apprehension of danger is alleged as to the responsibility of the person in whom the title is. Delay is often fatal to an application for a receiver, and in this case an application by this complainant for the prompt action he asks of the court comes with ill grace. As to the real estate in Bristol, the title is in a director of the Sew Brunswick Co., whose responsibility is not questioned, and no danger of loss is suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">As to the money loaned to Stevens \u2014 when the object of a suit is to compel the payment of a sum of money, there seems to be no propriety in ordering it to be paid to a receiver on the filing of the bill. It may also be said, in reference to this money, that no danger or apprehension of loss is suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">It is unnecessary to consider the difficulty suggested on the argument of appointing a receiver to take charge of real estate situated in another state.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
