An examination of the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>discloses that there was substantial evidence considered in connection with such inferences as the jury may have reasonably drawn therefrom to sustain each and every material finding of fact upon which the judgment of guilty as to these counts was necessarily predicated. We, therefore, refrain from further discussion of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">As to the second count of the indictment a different situation obtains. The record is devoid of any evidence upon which to sustain a conviction of violating section 288 of the Penal Code as charged in this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The second proposition is likewise untenable. The law is settled in California that whether of not a child under the age of ten years is capable of (a) receiving just impressions of the facts respecting which the child is to be examined and (b) relating them truthfully (sec. 1880, subd. 2, Code Civ. Proc.) is a question, the determination of which rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge, and in the absence of a showing of abuse of this discretion by the trial judge his decision will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>People </em>v. <em>Valenti, 103 </em>Cal. App. 249, 251 [284 Pac. 485] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>24 Cal. App. (2d) 619, 621 [75 Pac. (2d) 640].)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">It is also settled that this court, in determining whether the trial judge has abused his discretion in permitting a child under ten years of age to testify, will review the entire record made by the witness and not confine the review of the question of the child\u2019s competency to the <em>voir dire </em>examination. (Peo<em>ple </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Applying the foregoing rules to the instant case, it appears from the entire testimony of the complaining witnesses that they were capable of receiving just impressions of the facts relative to which they testified and also of relating them truthfully. No useful purpose would be subserved by setting forth in this opinion the sordid details of the complaining witnesses\u2019 testimony, which we therefore omit.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">The third proposition is without merit. The law is settled that in a prosecution for violating section 288 of the Penal Code the fact that the child involved has made complaint of the outrage to another is admissible evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ferrari, </em>80 Cal. App. 182, 184 [251 Pac. 692].)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Defendant\u2019s final contention is invalid. A physician and surgeon was called as a witness, who testified as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>result of his examination of one of the complaining witnesses. His opinion was not asked upon any subject. He merely testified as to the physical facts which his examination disclosed. Therefore, neither section 1127b of the Penal Code nor <em>People </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>134 Cal. App. 775 [26 Pac. (2d) 681], was applicable to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">For the foregoing reasons the judgments as to counts I, III, and IV are affirmed and the judgment as to count II is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Crail, P. J., and Wood, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
