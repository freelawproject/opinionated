J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-z\">The respondent has moved to dismiss this appeal on the ground that no application wa\u00a1s filed by the appellant setting forth the grounds of the appeal, the points relied upon and designating what portions of the reporter\u2019s notes it was necessary to have transcribed in order to fairly present the points relied upon, as provided for in section 7 of rule II of the Rules for the Supreme Court and District Courts of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">No reporter\u2019s transcript has been filed.. It appears from the clerk\u2019s transcript that judgment was pronounced on July 1, 1938, and written notice of appeal was filed on July 2, 1938. The record before us contains no application for a reporter\u2019s transcript or statement of the grounds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>appeal or points relied upon. It is well settled that under these circumstances the appellate court is without jurisdiction to consider the appeal, and that a motion to dismiss should be granted. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>219 Cal. 410 [27 Pac.
