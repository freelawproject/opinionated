J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5n\">This is an original proceeding for a writ of <em>mandamus </em>to require the respondent court to assume jurisdiction of a motion for an injunction restraining one John Bell from disposing of his property for the purpose of defeating execution of a judgment against him in an action entitled <em>Passow </em>v. <em>Bell. </em> On the hearing on the return to the alternative writ issued herein it was conceded that the sole ground upon which a hearing of the motion was denied was that the superior court was without jurisdiction because the original case was pending on appeal. At the time this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>ruling was made, the order in the case of <em>Passow </em>v. <em>Bell </em>had been reversed by this court (27 Cal. App. (2d) 360 [81 Pac. (2d) 224]), and a petition for a transfer to the Supreme Court was pending. Thereafter such petition was denied, and the <em>remittitur </em>to the superior court went down from this court on August 29, 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">There is no further obstacle to the assumption of jurisdiction over the motion for an injunction, and the respondent court may now proceed to hear the motion on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Let a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>issue as prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Spence, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
