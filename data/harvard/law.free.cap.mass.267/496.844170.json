An agreed statement of facts in writing was introduced in evidence. The defendant moved that a finding of not guilty be directed by the court, and filed the following requests for rulings: (1) \u201cOn the facts as stated in the agreed statement of facts the defendant is not guilty of the offense charged\u201d; (2) \u201cThe facts stated in the agreed statement of facts do not constitute a violation of\u201d St. 1926, c. 340; and (3) \u201cThe act of the defendant in recognizing as surety for twenty-two' persons simultaneously on September 6, 1927,' constitutes but one single occasion within the meaning of\u201d St. 1926, c. 340. The motion for a directed finding and the requests for ruling were denied and the defendant excepted. The judge found the defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">St. 1926, c. 340, which amended G. L. c. 276 (see \u00a7 61B) and took effect September 1, 1926, provides that \u201cAny person proposing to become bail or surety in a criminal case for hire or reward, either received or to be received, and any person becoming bail or surety in a criminal case after having become bail or surety in criminal cases on more than three separate occasions in any twelve months\u2019 period, shall be deemed to be a professional bondsman and shall not be accepted as bail or surety until he shall have been approved and registered as a professional bondsman by the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>or by a justice thereof .... Any unregistered person receiving hire or reward for his services as bail or surety in any criminal case, and any unregistered person becoming bail or surety in any criminal case after having become bail or surety in criminal cases on more than three separate occasions in any twelve months\u2019 period, and any person herein defined as a professional bondsman violating any provision of the rules established hereunder for such bondsmen, shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The defendant\u00bbwas not, during the period in question \"approved and registered as a professional bondsman.\u201d On September 6, 1927, he \"did become bail or surety in a criminal case.\u201d The question for determination is whether he did so \"after having become bail or surety in criminal cases on more than three separate occasions in any twelve months\u2019 period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The manner in which the defendant became \"bail or surety\u201d was as follows: \"On September 6, 1927,twenty-two persons, all being acquaintances of this defendant, were arrested and charged with the offence of being present where gaming implements were found and were committed to the police station in Lowell; the clerk of the District Court of Lowell came to the police station for the purpose of admitting the prisoners to bail; this defendant told the said clerk that he desired to act as surety for the twenty-two persons arrested and the clerk caused to be prepared affidavits relative to the property owned by this defendant, and being satisfied as to the sufficiency of the same he had all of the arrested persons and this defendant stand in front of a desk and said, collectively, to all of the persons in custody and to this defendant, substantially as follows: \u2018You (naming the persons in custody) each recognize to the Commonwealth in the sum of $50, with John Tsouprakakis as your surety, for the appearance of you (naming the persons in custody) before the District Court of Lowell,\u2019 etc., and thereupon admitted them to bail, with said Tsouprakakis as their surety.\u201d Prior to these events, on January 9,1927, the defendant and eight others were arrested. He then gave cash bail for himself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>and recognized as surety for the other eight persons in the same manner as on September 6, 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\">The statute under which the defendant was indicted regulates persons who \u201cbecome bail or surety\u201d in criminal cases as a business or profession. It applies to persons who \u201cbecome bail or surety ... for hire or reward\u201d and to those who for any reason \u201cbecome bail or surety\u201d frequently. Such a person must be \u201capproved and registered as a professional bondsman.\u201d The statute recognizes, however, that any person is liable to be called upon to \u201cbecome bail or surety\u201d in a criminal case because of acquaintance, friendship, charity or some like reason, and excludes from its application any person who\u2018becomes \u201cbail or surety\u201d without \u201chire or reward\u201d provided he does not do so \u201cafter having become bail or surety ... on more than three separate occasions in any twelve months\u2019 period.\u201d In order to determine whether on the facts of the present case the statute applies to the defendant, the meaning of the words \u201cseparate occasions \u201d as used therein must be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The \u201cmore than three separate occasions\u201d which are referred to in the statute must be reckoned from the viewpoint of the \u201cbail or surety.\u201d They are \u201coccasions\u201d for \u201cbecoming bail or surety.\u201d The word \u201coccasion\u201d may mean only a particular time but usually, \u201caccording to the common and approved usage of the language\u201d (G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third), it has a broader significance. It carries the idea of opportunity, necessity or need or even cause in a limited sense. It is not essential to fix the exact shade of meaning of the word \u201coccasions\u201d as used in the statute. In any one of its more usual meanings the \u201coccasion\u201d for one person \u201cbecoming bail or surety\u201d is the presence of another person before a court or officer authorized to admit to bail with the alternative of giving bail or being committed to jail. Whenever this situation arises it furnishes an opportunity to \u201cbecome bail or surety,\u201d creates the necessity therefor and is a factor in bringing to pass that someone becomes \u201cbail or surety.\u201d Whatever joinder of defendants there may have been in alleged wrongdoing, in a complaint or indictment or in any procedural step the need of each defendant for bail must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>met separately. There can be no joinder of defendants in a recognizance. Each defendant\u2019s obligation is several. See G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 65. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Field, </em>9 Allen, 581. <em>Ferry </em>v. <em>Burchard, </em>21 Conn. 597. In the case of each defendant, therefore, there is a \u201cseparate occasion\u201d for giving bail and consequently a \u201cseparate occasion\u201d for a person becoming his \u201cbail or surety.\u201d Even if the same person at the same moment of time becomes \u201cbail or surety\u201d for more than one defendant, he becomes \u201cbail or surety\u201d on more than one \u201cseparate occasion.\u201d There is a separate opportunity, necessity and cause for that person to become \u201cbail or surety\u201d for each defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">If the Legislature had intended that the test of violation of the statute should be \u201cbecoming bail or surety\u201d after having done so in more than three separate cases or on more than three separate complaints or indictments or at more than three different times, irrespective of the number of defendants involved, it could have said so readily. It well may have thought that liability to prosecution for crime should not depend upon the immaterial circumstance that separate rather than joint complaints or indictments were used, or that the court or officer admitting to bail took recognizances successively rather than simultaneously. The language of the statute must be taken as having been used advisedly. There is no sufficient basis for the inference that the interpretation here given to it is more severe than was intended by the Legislature or that the Legislature intended to permit an \u201cunregistered person\u201d to \u201cbecome bail or surety\u201d for a large number of persons if because they had been engaged in a common criminal enterprise or for some other reason they happened to be prosecuted at the same time. No rule of strict construction of penal statutes requires that language be strained to reach a result favorable to the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boring, </em>8 Pick. 370. Nor does the construction here given to the statute bring it into conflict, as the defendant suggests, with art. 26 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution which provides that \u201cNo magistrate or court of law shall demand excessive bail or sureties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">On the facts of this case and the correct interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the words \"separate occasions\u201d in the statute the defendant became \"bail or surety\u201d on eight \"separate occasions\u201d on January 9,1927, and on twenty-two \"separate occasions\u201d on September 6, 1927, each occasion being in a criminal case. Each occasion on September 6, 1927, when the defendant became \"bail or surety in a criminal case\u201d was \"after\u201d he had \"become bail or surety in criminal cases on more than three separate occasions in any twelve months\u2019 period.\u201d There is nothing in the facts to indicate that the \"more than three separate occasions\u201d on January 9, 1927, did not arise in as many separate criminal cases. But it is not essential that they should have so arisen. The \"more than three separate occasions\u201d may arise in the same criminal case. The specific numerical requirement applies to \"separate occasions.\u201d The plural form \"criminal cases\u201d is used only as descriptive of a class of cases exclusive of civil cases, and is within the rule of statutory construction that \"words importing the plural number may include the singular.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Fourth.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\">The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed finding and his requests for rulings were denied properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
