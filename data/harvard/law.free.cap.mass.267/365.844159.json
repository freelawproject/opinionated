The testimony that it was \u201cvery fast,\u201d \u201cat a good rate,\u201d faster than the \u201cusual and customary rate of speed,\u201d furnishes no evidence that the speed was excessive, nor does it warrant a finding of negligence of the defendant in the operation of the train. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>193 Mass. 332, 335. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>220 Mass. 28, 30. <em>Selibedea </em>v. <em>Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>223 Mass. 76. <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>256 Mass. 17, 18. <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>261 Mass. 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The testimony that the train whistle \u201chollered and shrieked\u201d and as to other graphic descriptions of the sound\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>emitted therefrom, and that it was sounded for a long time, is insufficient to warrant a finding that the noise of the whistle was excessive and unreasonable. There was no evidence as to the circumstances existing as the train emerged from the tunnel and approached the station; it could not properly be found to be an act of negligence to give warning to other trains or to persons who might be crossing the tracks at the time of its approach. The testimony that as the train passed through the tunnel there was an \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>awful grating noise \u201d or sound would not warrant a finding that the brakes were defective or applied in an unusual or negligent manner. The fact that the train came to a stop at a point beyond the usual stopping place falls far short of showing negligence; there was no specific evidence as to the distance beyond the usual stopping place the train came to a stop. It may be regarded as common knowledge that trains do not always stop at precisely the same place at stations for passengers to board or alight from them. There was evidence that the train stopped a short distance from the water, about thirty feet therefrom; but an entire absence of evidence as to how far the water was from the usual stopping place. It does not appear that the train was not stopped at a place within its terminal provided for that purpose and suitable for passengers alighting from trains.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\">It follows that, as there was no evidence to warrant a finding of negligence on the part of the defendant, it is unnecessary to consider whether the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care in jumping from the train. The cases cited by the plaintiff are not pertinent to the evidence in the case at bar. The trial judge rightly directed a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
