The case was-tried before a judge of the Superior Court and a jury. The judge ruled as matter of law that the plaintiff could not recover, directed a verdict for the defendant, and reported the case \"upon the stipulation that if the ruling and direction\u201d were wrong \"a verdict [is] to be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $1500, plus the accrued interest and costs; otherwise judgment for the defendant on the verdict is to be entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">The jury would have been warranted in finding that on or about March 28, 1924, the defendant gave to the plaintiff an order in writing, in the form herein set forth, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>order so given was accepted by the plaintiff. The instrument was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-3\">date March 28,1924</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABG\">ordered of Specialty Trading Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\">547 Broadway,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">New York, N.

If, on the other hand, by this contract the defendant was bound to accept five thousand \u201cCamera-Phonographs,\u201d there was evidence of breach and the ruling and direction of a verdict were wrong. Thus the case turns on the construction of the written order.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-18\">Since the order was in writing, its construction was for the judge and not for the jury. <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Converse, </em>246 Mass. 185, 189. Clearly according to its terms only two hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>machines were ordered. The written instrument uses the words \u201cThis Order\u201d with reference to the preceding words \u201cquan. 200\u201d \u201citems Camera-Phonographs.\u201d This was the \u201cOrder\u201d which was given \u201cwith the understanding\u201d that the defendant was to be \u201cthe Exclusive Distributors ... in the New England States,\u201d and with the further understanding that the defendant\u2019s \u201callotments\u201d were to be \u201cFive Thousand Machines in the next year.\u201d Whatever may be the binding force upon the plaintiff of the provision for \u201callotments,\u201d that provision does not substitute for the defendant\u2019s unambiguous order for two hundred machines an order for five thousand machines. The defendant\u2019s order for two hundred machines was conditioned upon some assurance from the plaintiff as to the territory which the defendant should control for purposes of distribution, and some assurance also that its estimated needs for that territory would be supplied. The provisions for notice to the plaintiff of the defendant\u2019s weekly requirements, and for notice of the defendant\u2019s desire to \u201cdiscontinue\u201d which obviously refers to discontinuance of the defendant\u2019s exclusive New England agency, are consistent with the interpretation here given to this order. The construction of the written instrument as an order for five thousand machines for delivery throughout the year, with immediate delivery of two hundred, is not warranted by its language. In this respect the order is not like the order considered in <em>Fullam </em>v. <em>Wright &amp; Colton Wire Cloth Co. </em>196 Mass. 474, relied on by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\">There was evidence, introduced by the plaintiff, which tended to show that at the time the order was given and accepted the plaintiff\u2019s general manager, who acted for the plaintiff in the transaction, understood that it was an order for five thousand machines. Such evidence cannot vary the effect of the written contract. <em>Deutsch </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>149 Mass. 415, 420. There was also evidence of a course of conduct of the parties after the contract was made, including correspondence between them, from which the plaintiff argues that both parties treated the order as calling for five thousand machines. Even if it is assumed in favor of the plaintiff that the evidence warrants this conclusion, the written order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>which is plain upon its face cannot be contradicted in this way. <em>Stony Brook Railroad </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>260 Mass. 379, 386, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Since on the true construction of the defendant\u2019s order for \u201c Camera-Phonographs \u201d there was no evidence of breach of the defendant\u2019s contract, the trial judge was right in ruling that the plaintiff could not recover and in directing a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
