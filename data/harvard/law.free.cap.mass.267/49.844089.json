Thereupon the plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial setting forth in various forms the main ground that the damages awarded by the jury were utterly inadequate and unwarranted by the evidence. The defendant also filed a motion for a new trial on the main ground that the verdict was against the evidence and the weight of the evidence. After hearing the trial judge made an order on the plaintiff\u2019s motion of this tenor: \u201cIt appearing that the damages awarded the plaintiff were inadequate and that the jury erred in its verdict, it is ordered that the verdict be set aside and a new trial had upon the entire issue.\u201d On the same day he made this order on the defendant\u2019s motion: \u201cSee order on plaintiff\u2019s motion.\u201d When the case came on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>for a second trial the plaintiff moved that the \u201ctrial be limited to the issue of damages.\u201d This motion was denied subject to the exception of the plaintiff. The trial went forward and resulted in a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">As matter of interpretation the order made upon the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial by the judge who presided at the first trial means that the verdict was set aside and a new trial ordered upon every issue raised by the pleadings. While more apt words might have been used, we think that it is not a true exposition of the language employed to hold that the words \u201cthe entire issue\u201d confined the new trial to the question of damages. That judge had before him two motions to set aside the verdict; that of the defendant went to the validity of the verdict as a whole and was not founded on damages. The order upon the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, although not as clear as might be desired, means, as we interpret it, that he incorporated into that order all that was contained in the order made concerning the plaintiff\u2019s motion. It would have been more logical as well as in conformity to the statute for the judge in granting the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial to have said that the motion was granted because the damages were inadequate, and that, but for his action on the motion of the defendant, the new trial would be restricted to damages, and then to have dealt with the defendant\u2019s motion. His attempt to deal with both motions by one order wherein were set forth his grounds for decision cannot be pronounced nugatory. If he had intended to grant the plaintiff\u2019s motion alone, he would have denied the defendant\u2019s motion. His statement that the \u201cjury erred in its verdict,\u201d taken in conjunction with his order that the new trial be \u201chad upon the entire issue,\u201d is pertinent to the defendant\u2019s motion. This statement leaves much to be desired in lucidity of expression, but it is susceptible of interpretation. The words just quoted from the judge\u2019s order we interpret to mean that he determined that the verdict ought not to stand for the reasons set forth in the defendant\u2019s motion. It is required by G. L. c. 231\u00b0, \u00a7 127, that \u201ca verdict shall not be set aside except on written motion by a party to the cause, stating the reasons relied upon in its support.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>The further requirement of G. L. e. 231, \u00a7 128, that, whenever a verdict is set aside and a new trial granted under \u00a7 127, the judge \u201cgranting the motion for the new trial shall file a statement setting forth fully the grounds upon which the motion is granted,\u201d is satisfied by a reference to one or more of the \u201creasons\u201d set forth in the motion required under the preceding section. In this respect no greater particularity is demanded of the judge than of the party making the motion. The judge\u2019s action as an entirety seems to mean that both motions were granted. Thus applied, the order was a complete rejection of the verdict rendered with the necessary' result that the new trial was to cover a field as broad as permitted by the pleadings. This was within the power of the trial judge. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>210 Mass. 563, 568, 569. <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Willey, </em>218 Mass. 363. <em>Tildsley </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>224 Mass. 117. It is unnecessary to determine whether the order on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, standing alone and without reference to the order upon the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, could be supported. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 127, 128.</p>\n<p id=\"Ais\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
