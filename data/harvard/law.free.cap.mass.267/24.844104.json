She said her \u201casking price was $70,000.\u201d The plaintiff then asked her \u201cif $70,000 was her bottom figure,\u201d and she replied, \u201cWell, bring in a buyer and we will talk that later.\u201d The plaintiff also testified that he asked the defendant \u201cabout the cash,\u201d and she said the mortgages were $48,000, and it required $22,000 to do business. He said \u201cthat was a lot of money,\u201d and she answered, \u201cWell, you bring down a buyer who would be interested to buy and we can arrange terms then.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">It could have been found that this talk between the plaintiff and defendant took place on the first Saturday of January, 1924. The plaintiff interviewed one Luzackas, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>on the Sunday following the conversation with the defendant took him to see the property and introduced him to the defendant, and informed her that he brought him \u201cto look at the property as a buyer.\u201d The defendant showed the apartments to Luzackas who said he would think it over and see the plaintiff later. The defendant said to Luzackas according to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, \u201cMr. Boyle has a statement on it and he can give you the statement.\u201d The plaintiff gave Luzackas the statement showing the asking price, description, \u201camount of rentals and mortgages.\u201d He also brought another person to examine the property. The plaintiff was asked when he next saw the defendant and answered, \u201cI brought buyers there all the time but they were never interested enough to go to see her, it must have been six weeks.\u201d The plaintiff further testified that he saw Luzackas about three days after he looked over the property, and that he was \u201cfrequently at Mr. Luzackas\u2019 offices.\u201d In March, 1924, the plaintiff learned that Luzackas had bought the property. He then saw the defendant and she said, \u201cMy son and I have decided not to sell the property.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t sell it to him [Luzackas] when you had him here, my son called down later and sold it to him.\u201d The agreement of sale between the defendant and Luzackas was dated February 15, 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">At the first conversation of the plaintiff and defendant, she told him if he brought a person who was ready to purchase the property the plaintiff would be paid the regular commission. The evidence showed that the property was sold to Luzackas for $66,000; and he testified that the sale to him was brought about by the defendant\u2019s son. At the close of the evidence the defendant moved for a directed verdict. The motion was denied and the jury found for the plaintiff. It has frequently been decided that a broker earns his commission if he is hired to find a customer and he finds one who is ready, able and willing to buy according to the terms of the owner. <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>Gilson, </em>176 Mass. 477. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Schofield, </em>191 Mass. 1. The plaintiff must comply with the defendant\u2019s terms, and if her agreement was that the plaintiff was to procure a purchaser at the price of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>$70,000, the plaintiff did not earn his commission if the property was finally sold at a smaller price. <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Kazajian, </em>255 Mass. 459. <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>256 Mass. 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">But the jury could have found that the price was not limited to $70,000; that this was her asking price; that she left the price open for further negotiations. It could have been found that the defendant desired to sell for $70,000 if she could obtain it, but this was not final. Her conversation showed that she might sell for a less price, and in effect she told the plaintiff to bring a customer and \u201cwe can arrange terms then.\u201d The plaintiff secured the customer and later the defendant sold to him on terms which were mutually satisfactory. Considering all the evidence, in the opinion of a majority of the court, the jury could have found that the defendant\u2019s offer to the plaintiff was in effect a promise to pay him a commission if he brought to her one who finally became the buyer. It was a question of fact for the jury to decide what the terras of the offer were, and whether the plaintiff complied therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">It was also a question of fact for the jury whether the offer made by the defendant to the plaintiff was withdrawn. The jury could refuse to believe that the offer was withdrawn and they could find that the plaintiff\u2019s authority was not revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The declaration alleged that the plaintiff was to procure a purchaser \u201con the terms as offered by the defendant.\u201d The defendant contends that the plaintiff cannot recover on this declaration. No question of pleading was raised at the trial or called to the attention of the judge. Even if this question was raised \u00a1at the trial, a recovery could be had on the declaration on the ground that the declaration is only for procuring a customer, not for making a sale, and the terms offered could be found to be the price upon which the defendant might finally agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
