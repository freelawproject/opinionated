(\u201cBengals\u201d). Paragraph ten of the contract executed by these parties on April 22,1996, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u201cAny compensation paid to Player under this contract or under any collective bargaining agreement in existence during the term of this contract for a period during which he is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits by reason of temporary total, permanent total, temporary partial, or permanent partial disability will be deemed an advance payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits due Player, and Club will be entitled to be reimbursed the amount of such payment out of any award of workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">On August 23, 1996, appellant injured his right knee and missed the entire season. During those weeks, he was paid his full salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Appellant filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim that was promptly allowed. On March 9, 1998, after his player\u2019s contract expired, appellant applied for permanent partial disability compensation (\u201cPPD\u201d). A temporary order issued from the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation awarding appellant a twenty-four percent PPD. The Bengals objected to this order, disputing not the amount or existence of a PPD, but appellant\u2019s right to receive it under the provisions of R.C. 4123.56(C). That subsection reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">\u201cIn the event an employee of a professional sports franchise domiciled in this state is disabled as the result of an injury or occupational disease, the total amount of payments made under a contract of hire or collective bargaining agreement to the employee during the period of disability is deemed an advanced payment of compensation payable under sections 4123.56 to 4123.58 of the Revised Code. The employer shall be reimbursed the total amount of the advanced payments out of any award of compensation made pursuant to sections 4123.56 to 4123.58 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">A district hearing officer for appellee Industrial \u25a0 Commission overruled the Bengals\u2019s objection. However, upon reconsideration, a staff hearing officer for the commission sustained the Bengals\u2019s objection, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">\u201c[T]he offset provisions set out in Ohio Revised Code Section 4123.56(C) do apply to this award. The Staff Hearing Officer finds this award of permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>partial disability under [R.C.] 4123.57 is an \u2018advance payment of compensation payable under sections [R.C.] 4123.56 to 4123.58 of the Ohio Revised Code\u2019 as outlined under [R.C.] 4123.56(C). The Staff Hearing Officer finds that [the] offset provision of [R.C.] 4123.56(C) is applicable in this case based on Ohio Administrative Code 4123-3-ll(F)[.] <em>[Ladd v. Cincinnati Bengals, Inc. </em>(Mar. 27, 1998), Hamilton App. No. C-970522, unreported, 1998 WL 140093], <em>Walker v. Cincinnati Bengals, Inc. </em>[ (Mar. 21, 1997), Hamilton App. No. C-960653, unreported], <em>State ex rel. Cleveland Browns, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>[(Dec. 8, 1998), Franklin App. No. 97APD11-1474, unreported, 1998 WL 869549].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Further reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Appellant then filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. In the court of appeals, he did not allege that the twenty-four-percent award made by the bureau and commission was not an accurate assessment of his amount of disability. He instead sought a determination that his employment contract superseded the provisions of R.C. 4123.56(C) on the theory that his player\u2019s contract limited reimbursement to compensation paid during the contract term, and therefore provided \u201ccontractually improved\u201d benefits. Alternatively, appellant sought a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional. These contentions led the court of appeals to conclude that appellant had an adequate remedy of law by way of a declaratory judgment action. A writ was accordingly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Among the prerequisites to the issuance of a writ of mandamus is the unavailability of a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State ex rel. Berger v. McMonagle </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 28, 30, 6 OBR 50, 51-52, 451 N.E.2d 225, 227. A declaratory judgment action can constitute such a remedy. <em>Eudela v. Rogers </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 159, 161, 9 OBR 448, 449, 459 N.E.2d 539, 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">R.C. 2721.03 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">\u201c[A]ny person interested under a deed, will, written contract, or other writing constituting a contract or any person whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a constitutional provision, statute, rule as defined in section 119.01 of the Revised Code, municipal ordinance, township resolution, contract, or franchise may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under such instrument, constitutional provision, statute, rule, ordinance, resolution, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations under it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">In addition, we are unpersuaded that this controversy invokes \u201cextent of disability\u201d \u2014 subject matter that is specifically encompassed by mandamus. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>R.C. 4123.512(A). See, also, <em>Afrates v. Lorain </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 22, 584 N.E.2d 1175. This action does not challenge a determination concerning the numeric percentage of appellant\u2019s disability or a determination concerning the permanency of appellant\u2019s injury. To the contrary, none of the parties alleges that the award incorrectly reflects appellant\u2019s degree of disability. Instead, appellant seeks a determination of his rights under his contract of employment vis-\u00e1-vis R.C. 4123.56(C). Alternatively, he seeks a declaration of the statute\u2019s constitutionality or unconstitutionality. We agree with the court of appeals that these are issues that are well suited to an action in declaratory judgment.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AcM\"><em>Finkelmeier &amp; Farrell, William I.

Bolden v. Indus. Comm. </em>(Jan. 23, 1997), Franklin App. No. 95APD03-282, unreported, and <em>State ex rel. Cleveland Browns, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(Dec. 8, 1998), Franklin App. No. 97APD11-1474, unreported, 1998 WL 869549 \u2014 cases in which similar questions were addressed as to R.C. 4123.56(C) and player-employment contracts. In those decisions, however, the adequacy of declaratory relief was never raised by the parties and consequently was not addressed by the court of appeals. Upon being directly confronted with the issue here, we find that a declaratory judgment is indeed an adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
