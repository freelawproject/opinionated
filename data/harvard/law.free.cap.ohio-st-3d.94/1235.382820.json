Matthew McCullough.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Affiant makes three contentions in support of his claim that Judge Pontious should be disqualified from further proceedings in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">\u2022 Judge Pontious denied the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance of the September 18, 2001 trial date;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">\u2022 Judge Pontious commented that this was a \u201csimple case\u201d and that a defense psychologist recently retained by the defendant\u2019s counsel would not need additional time to prepare for trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-10\">\u2022 Judge Pontious received and read communications from members of the victim\u2019s family in which they objected to the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance and stated their views regarding the appropriate punishment in this case. The fact that Judge Pontious received these communications was not shared with the defendant until a pretrial conference on August 23, 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">Judge Pontious admits that he overruled the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance of the trial date, admits having received letters from the victim\u2019s family objecting to the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance, and denies having commented on the merits of the underlying case. He provides a copy of a journal entry, dated September 5, 2001, in which he found that his consideration of these letters was authorized by R.C. 2930.08. Attached to this journal entry are copies of the letters sent to Judge Pontious by the victim\u2019s family. These letters reflect the family members\u2019 objections to the continuance requested by the defendant and do not address the merits of the case or th\u00e9 potential punishment that should be imposed if the defendant is convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">A judge\u2019s decision to grant or deny a party\u2019s request for a continuance is within the sound discretion of the judge and is not, by itself, evidence of bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Spahr </em>(1987), 36 Ohio St.3d 603, 522 N.E.2d 457. In a criminal case, the judge\u2019s decision to grant or deny a continuance is governed, in part, by R.C. 2930.08, which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">\u201cIf a motion, request, or agreement between counsel is made in a case and the motion, request, or agreement might result in a substantial delay in the prosecution of the case, the prosecutor in the case, to the extent practicable and if the victim has requested notice pursuant to division (B) of section 2930.03 of the Revised Code, shall inform the victim that the motion, request, or agreement has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>been made and that it might result in a delay. If the victim objects to the delay, the prosecutor shall inform the court of the victim\u2019s objections, and the court shall consider the victim\u2019s objections in ruling on the motion, request, or agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">A trial judge cannot reasonably be expected to control what correspondence is sent to the judge by persons interested in a pending case, particularly by persons who are unrepresented family members of a crime victim. Although the better practice in this situation would have been for the judge to promptly notify the parties of the receipt of the letters and immediately provide them with copies, I cannot conclude that the judge\u2019s receipt and consideration of unsolicited letters that relate solely to the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance are evidence of bias or prejudice. This is especially true in view of the fact that the General Assembly has required that trial judges consider the objections of crime victims to a continuance request.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">For these reasons, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and is denied. The case shall proceed before Judge Pontious.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
