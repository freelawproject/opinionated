Akbar-El, an inmate, filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County for a writ of mandamus to compel appellee, Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, to vacate its judgment of conviction and sentence. Akbar-El claimed that the judgment was void. He did not attach the affidavit required by R.C. 2969.25(A) describing his previous civil actions and appeals. See, <em>e.g., Akbar-El v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab. &amp; Corr. </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 644, 711 N.E.2d 236. The common pleas court filed a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">In June 2001, the court of appeals granted the motion and dismissed the cause. This cause is now before the court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. Akbar-El failed to comply with the requirements of R.C. 2969.25 in commencing this action. <em>State ex rel. Sherrills v. Franklin Cty. Clerk of Courts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 402, 750 N.E.2d 594, 596.
