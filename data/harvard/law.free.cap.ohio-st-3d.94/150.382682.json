Siddique Abdullah Hasan, challenges the denial of his application to reopen his direct appeal under App.R. 26(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Sanders was sentenced to death for the aggravated murder of Correctional Officer Robert Vallandingham. The Court of Appeals for Hamilton County affirmed his convictions and sentences. <em>State v. Sanders </em>(May 1,1998), Hamilton Ap9//9876. No. C-960253, unreported, 1998 WL 212756. We affirmed the court of appeals\u2019 judgment. <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 750 N.E.2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">On July 24, 1998, Sanders filed his App.R. 26(B) application in the court of appeals. That court denied the application, holding that Sanders had failed to show the existence of a genuine issue as to whether he had been denied the effective assistance of counsel on appeal. <em>State v. Sanders </em>(Feb. 4, 1999), Hamilton App. No. C-960253, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">App.R. 26(B)(5) requires that the applicant show \u201ca genuine issue as to whether the applicant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d As the court of appeals recognized, <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, sets forth the standard for judging ineffective-assistance claims. \u201cWhen a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687-688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693. Furthermore, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698. See, also, <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraphs two and three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\"><em>Strickland </em>charges us to \u201c[apply] a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments,\u201d 466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695, and to \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694. Moreover, we must bear in mind that appellate counsel need not raise every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>possible issue in order to render constitutionally effective assistance. See <em>Jones v. Barnes </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 745, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Alj5\"><em>Mark C. Piepmeier, </em>Special Prosecuting Attorney, and <em>William E. Breyer, </em>Assistant Special Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AO\"><em>Patricia A. Millhoff, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Finally, we note that courts must \u201cjudge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The two-part <em>Strickland </em>test \u201cis the appropriate standard to assess a defense request for reopening under App.R. 26(B)(5).\u201d <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 24, 25, 701 N.E.2d 696, 697. Applying <em>Strickland, </em>we agree with the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that Sanders has failed to raise a genuine issue of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b268-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
