On December 23, 1997, when he received a check for $9,500 representing insurance settlement proceeds due his client, Margaret O\u2019Sullivan, he deposited the funds in his business checking account and immediately wrote a cheek to O\u2019Sullivan for her share of the proceeds. After taking his fee, respondent was to disburse the remainder, $3,452.60, to medical providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">Respondent did not pay O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s medical bills until informed in July 1999 by relator, Office of Disciplinary Counsel, that Shaker Square Medical Clinic had filed a grievance against him for failure to make O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s payment. Over the next few months, respondent paid O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s three remaining medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">Relator filed a complaint on October 9, 2000, alleging that respondent\u2019s conduct violated the Code of Professional Responsibility. Respondent answered, and the matter was referred to a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cboard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">Based on stipulations and evidence at a hearing, the panel found the facts as set forth above and concluded that respondent\u2019s deposit of his client\u2019s funds in his personal account and his failure to pay the medical bills promptly violated DR 9-102(A) (a lawyer shall not commingle funds of a client with personal funds) and 9-102(B)(3) (a lawyer shall maintain complete records of all funds coming into the lawyer\u2019s possession and render appropriate accounts thereof). The panel noted that respondent had no previous disciplinary problems, that he was suffering from depression and sleep deprivation, and that he was embarrassed by and apologetic about his failure to pay O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s bills. The panel recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six months with the entire six months stayed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ar\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><em>Jonathan E.
