Burns, counsel for the plaintiff, seeks the disqualification of Judge James P. Celebrezze from further proceedings regarding the above-captioned, case, <em>Daniel Dzina v. Nancy Dzina.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">In support of his claim of disqualification, affiant states that opposing counsel previously served as chair or treasurer of Judge Celebrezze\u2019s campaign committee. He asserts that this relationship has caused Judge Celebrezze to demonstrate bias in favor of the defendant and cites several rulings issued by the judge that are adverse to his client\u2019s interests. Previously, I have held that an attorney\u2019s prior participation in a judge\u2019s campaign committee is not grounds for disqualification of the judge from cases involving that attorney. See <em>In re Disqualification of Maloney </em>(2000), 91 Ohio St.3d 1204, 741 N.E.2d 133 (attorney was a member of a judge\u2019s campaign committee), and <em>In re Disqualification of Ney </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 1271, 657 N.E.2d 1367 (counsel personally solicited contributions on behalf of the judge\u2019s campaign committee in the preceding election). See, also, Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline Advisory Op. No. 92-9. Given the fact that defense counsel\u2019s involvement in Judge Celebrezze\u2019s campaign occurred twenty-three years ago, I cannot conclude that the relationship cited by affiant requires the judge\u2019s disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>The balance of affiant\u2019s claims relate to adverse legal rulings made by Judge Celebrezze. These rulings are subject to review on appeal and do not demonstrate bias or prejudice that warrants the judge\u2019s disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Murphy </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 605, 522 N.E.2d 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">For these reasons, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and is denied. The case shall proceed before Judge Celebrezze.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
