Robert C. Arnder, Sr.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">Affiant asserts that Judge O\u2019Farrell should be disqualified from further proceedings in the underlying case because he presided over a pretrial bail hearing pursuant to R.C. 2937.222. In support of this assertion, affiant relies on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>the case of <em>State v. Gillard </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 226, 533 N.E.2d 272, in which the Supreme Court held that a trial judge who presides over a Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(e) motion hearing cannot preside over a subsequent trial in the same case. Affiant claims that the testimony presented at the bail hearing in the underlying case was similar to the type of evidence at issue in <em>Gillard </em>and that Judge O\u2019Farrell\u2019s consideration of that testimony jeopardizes the appearance of impartiality in subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The record before me contains no evidence to support affiant\u2019s claim that the testimony heard by Judge O\u2019Farrell will adversely affect the perception of the judge\u2019s fairness and impartiality. Without a transcript of the bail hearing that includes the testimony considered by Judge O\u2019Farrell, I cannot conclude that the holding in <em>Gillard </em>should be applied to this proceeding or to R.C. 2937.222 bail hearings in general. Moreover, affiant\u2019s claims that the judge\u2019s consideration of this evidence will impair his ability to remain fair and impartial are speculative and more appropriately addressed on appeal of any conviction that may result from the impending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">For these reasons, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and is denied. The case shall proceed before Judge O\u2019Farrell.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
