I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to declare that jurisdiction in this case was improvidently allowed. Frederick E. Hook\u2019s claim for benefits that were allegedly owed him should not terminate because he died. See <em>State ex rel. Liposchak v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 276, 737 N.E.2d 519. If the Industrial Commission had allowed his claim before his death, Hook would have received benefits. Why then, if the Industrial Commission improperly denied benefits, should Hook\u2019s estate not be entitled to benefits through the day of his death? I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and allow the continuance of the action by the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Claimants already face significant structural delays because of the appeals process, and, as in this case, some of them die before the process is complete. Although no wrongdoing was alleged in this case, I am troubled that the Industrial Commission continues to have an incentive to engage in delaying tactics while waiting for a claimant to die. See <em>State ex rel. Johnston v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 463, 751 N.E.2d 974. I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b682-6\">Resnick, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
