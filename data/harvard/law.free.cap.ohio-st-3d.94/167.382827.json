Otte, challenges the denial of his App.R. 26(B) application.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">A three-judge panel of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court convicted Otte of the aggravated murders of Robert Wasikowski and Sharon Kostura and sentenced him to death for each murder. The Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County affirmed the convictions and sentences, <em>State v. Otte </em>(Oct. 27, 1994), Cuyahoga App. No. 64617, unreported, 1994 WL 590556, and we affirmed that judgment, <em>State v. Otte </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 555, 660 N.E.2d 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u2022 On October 18, 2000, Otte filed in the court of appeals his application for reopening under App.R. 26(B), which provides for the reopening of an appeal based on a claim of ineffective appellate assistance if the applicant can show \u201ca genuine issue as to whether the applicant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d App.R. 26(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Otte claimed that his jury waiver was never filed in the trial court, that this failure deprived that court of jurisdiction to hold a bench trial, and that his original appellate counsel should have raised this issue on appeal. The court of appeals denied the application, holding that Otte had \u201cfailed to meet his burden to demonstrate that \u2018there is a genuine issue as to whether the applicant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal,\u2019 \u201d quoting App.R. 26(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">Otte\u2019s claim is based on <em>State v. Pless </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 333, 658 N.E.2d 766, and <em>State ex rel. Jackson v. Dallman </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 261, 638 N.E.2d 563. In <em>Pless </em>and <em>Dallman, </em>we held that the mere <em>signing </em>of a jury waiver form \u2014 no matter how clear on the face of the record- \u2014 is insufficient to effect a valid waiver of a criminal defendant\u2019s jury trial right. Because strict compliance with R.C. 2945.05 is necessary to a valid jury waiver, a signed waiver form must be filed in the trial court and made part of the record in accordance with R.C. 2945.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">Although Otte admits that he actually <em>signed </em>a written waiver of jury trial, he claims that the signed waiver \u201cwas not filed with the trial court\u201d as required by R.C. 2945.05. Because of this omission, Otte contends, the three-judge panel never had jurisdiction to try his case; thus, his 'sentence and conviction are void. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>He further contends that his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise this issue in the court of appeals constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, entitling him to reopen his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\"><em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, sets forth a two-part test for judging ineffective-assistance claims: \u201cWhen a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687-688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693. Furthermore, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698. See, also, <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraphs two and three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Applying <em>Strickland, </em>we conclude that Otte has raised no genuine issue of ineffective assistance because there was no arguable <em>Pless </em>issue for his original appellate counsel to raise. Nowhere does Otte set forth any factual basis for his claim that the affidavit was not filed. He does attach a photocopy of a certified copy of the signed jury waiver as an exhibit to his brief. But nothing on the face of that exhibit indicates that the signed waiver was <em>not </em>filed in the trial court. At' most, it can be said that the waiver appears to lack a contemporaneous file stamp. Moreover, the exhibit shows a certification, dated September 6, 1996, that states:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\u201cI, Gera\u00edd E. Fuerst, clerk of the court of common pleas within and for said [Cuyahoga] county, hereby certify that the above and foregoing <em>is truly taken and copied from the original CR279973 now on file in my </em>office.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\"><em>State ex rel. Larkins v. Baker </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 658, 653 N.E.2d 701, presented a similar issue. There, the petitioner\u2019s signed jury waiver (like Otte\u2019s) was physically located in the case file but had not been file-stamped. We held that, despite Dallman\u2019s requirement of strict compliance with R.C. 2945.05, the trial court\u2019s failure to file-stamp the waiver was not a jurisdictional defect. <em>Id. </em>at 661, 653 N.E.2d at 703. When we later decided <em>Pless, </em>we distinguished <em>Larkins </em>in part because \u201cthe record before us contains no evidence that appellant\u2019s signed jury waiver form was ever included in the trial court\u2019s case file.\u201d <em>Pless, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 339, 658 N.E.2d at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">Thus, had Otte\u2019s appellate counsel raised the <em>Pless </em>issue, there is no reasonable probability that the result would have been different; Otte would have lost anyway. This being the case, Otte has failed to carry his burden of showing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>existence of \u201ca genuine issue as to whether [he] was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d App.R. 26(B)(5). We therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AB6\"><em>William D. Mason, </em>Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and <em>Sherry F.
