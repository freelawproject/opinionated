Claimant was assigned to Fixture Number 85, a pneumatic press that manufactured parts for automobile heating and air conditioning units.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">As described by an investigator:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">\u201cWhen the press is activated by activating dual sensors located on each side of the press, the ram comes down and severs the lightweight plastic tube into three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>pieces. One of the pieces is discarded and the other two (2) are used for the automotive part. The operator has to physically reach in with his (her) hand into the press to remove the parts. [On the date in question], the dual sensor start buttons were mounted below the surface of the presses\u2019s [sic] table in front of the operator. * * * The start buttons which activated the press are infrared and it is necessary to activate both simultaneously in order to cause the ram (platen) of the press to come down. The press is equipped with fixed barrier guards around the sides, rear, top, and a portion of the front. However there is an open space (as measured by this investigator) in front of the presses\u2019s [sic] point of operation of approximately twenty-two (22) inches [by] eighteen (18) inches. This space or area exposes the presses\u2019s [sic] point of operation to the operator\u2019s hands/body. * * * The start sensor buttons are required to be activated simultaneously by the operator to cause the ram of the press to come down. If the operator removes his (her) finger(s) from the buttons, the platen will return to [its] original or open position near the upper portion of the press.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Midway through claimant\u2019s shift, scrap began piling up in the press. She reached in to remove it when something \u2014 possibly her body or a loose shirt\u2014 apparently contacted the infrared light beams that activate the sensor, causing the ram to descend on her arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">After her workers\u2019 compensation claim was allowed, claimant applied to appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio for additional compensation, alleging that Lear had committed several violations of specific safety requirements (\u201cVSSR\u201d). A staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) denied the application:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\u201cIt is the finding of the [SHO] that the application * * * be denied for the reason that the injury occurred <em>after </em>the entire closing cycle of the press.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">\u201cClaimant\u2019s counsel narrowed the scope of the alleged violations at hearing to [Ohio Adm.Code] 4121:1-5-11. That code section identifies six (6) acceptable methods of guarding. The machine in question was pneumatically operated and utilized a two-hand control method of guarding. Therefore, the applicable specific section would be 4121.Y-5-ll(E)(3). That provision describes a two-hand control as \u2018an actuating device which requires the simultaneous use of both hands outside the danger zone DURING THE ENTIRE CLOSING CYCLE OF THE PRESS\u2019 (emphasis added). Claimant testified that the injury occurred at a point in time when she had finished making the car parts and was cleaning out flashing from the machine. (See p. 22 of transcript.) It was the employer\u2019s argument that because of this, the holding in <em>State ex rel. Aspinwall v. Industrial Commission </em>(1988), 40 [Ohio St.3d] 55 [531 N.E.2d 681] precludes finding a Violation of a Specific Safety Requirement. The Staff Hearing Officer agrees. That case reads in pertinent part, \u2018If the General Assembly intended the danger zone to be guarded at all times, there would have been no need for the limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>language \u201cduring the operating cycle.\u201d Moreover, a two-handed tripping device is specifically enumerated as an acceptable method of \u201coperating cycle\u201d protection.\u2019 <em>(Ibid., </em>at 57 [531 N.E.2d at 684].) The court went on to cite to a previous decision in <em>State ex rel. Gentzler Tool &amp; Die </em>[Corp.] <em>v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1985), 18 [Ohio St.3d] 103 at 105 [18 OBR 137, 139, 480 N.E.2d 397, 399] noting that the provision did \u2018not require that a power press operator\u2019s hands be guarded from ever entering the danger zone. Rather, it is only required that an operator\u2019s hands be guarded from entering the danger zone \u201cduring the [machine\u2019s] operating cycle.\u201d \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\u201cA reasonable reading of this case is that \u2018operating cycle\u2019 refers to that period where the operator activates the machine with the intent to make a part. Such is not the case in claimant\u2019s situation. It is uncontroverted that she had finished making all her car parts and then was cleaning out the press when the injury happened.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In denying rehearing, a second SHO added:</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">\u201cNo mistake of fact is found in this case for the reasons explained below.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">\u201cThe claimant alleged that the finding by the Hearing Officer that claimant\u2019s injury didn\u2019t occur during the <em>operating cycle </em>of the press was a factual mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">\u201cThe Hearing Officer explained that the claimant at the time of injury had finished making car parts and the press accidentally cycled when she was cleaning out flashing from the machine. He further stated that because this injury occurred when the claimant was cleaning out the press * * * the press was not in an operating cycle because the operating cycle refers to a period when the operator activates the machine with the intent to make a part, which was not the case when the injury occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">\u201cThe claimant, however, argued that the press was in operating cycle because when the press accidentally cycled while the claimant was cleaning it, a <em>new </em>operating cycle was initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">\u201cThe claimant\u2019s contention that a new operating cycle was initiated when the press was actually started is rejected. <em>State ex rel. Aspinwall v. Industrial Commission </em>(1988), 40 [Ohio St.3d] 55 [531 N.E.2d 681] specifically held that \u2018operating cycle\u2019 is confined to operator-intended press activation.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">\u201cWhen the press was activated causing the claimant\u2019s injury it was not [a] deliberately] intended activation as a review of the transcript clearly shows this activation was accidental in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">\u201cTherefore, because the activation of the press was not operator intended the Hearing Officer\u2019s determination that injury didn\u2019t occur during the operating cycle of the press was not a factual error.\u201d (Emphasis added in part.)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Claimant filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the commission abused its discretion in denying an award for violation of a specific safety regulation (\u201cVSSR\u201d). Agreeing that the accident did not happen during the operating cycle, the court of appeals denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-ll(E) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\u201cEvery hydraulic or pneumatic (air-powered) press shall be constructed, or shall be guarded, to prevent the hands or fingers of the operator from entering the danger zone during the operating cycle. Acceptable methods of guarding are:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\n<em>i(* * *</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">\u201c(3) \u2018Two-hand control\u2019 \u2014 an actuating device which requires the simultaneous use of both hands outside the danger zone during the entire closing cycle of the press.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">The phrase \u201cduring the operating cycle\u201d is central to our dispute. It is a term that, although undefined in the safety code, has been extensively analyzed by this court. These cases can be difficult because of the simple truth exemplified by the claim before us: the press obviously cycled when the claimant\u2019s arm was in the danger zone or claimant would not have been hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">The claimant\u2019s position reflects this reasoning. The hidden danger in this approach, however, is that, in effect, it declares that because there was an injury there was <em>by necessity </em>a <em>VSSR </em>\u2014 i.e., someone was injured; therefore, the safety device was inadequate. This violates two workers\u2019 compensation tenets: (1) the commission determines the presence or absence of a violation and (2) all reasonable doubts as to a specific safety requirement\u2019s applicability must be resolved in the employer\u2019s favor. <em>State ex rel. Burton v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 170, 172, 545 N.E.2d 1216, 1219. It also creates two practical problems, because it (1) renders the manufacturing process impossible by preventing claimant\u2019s hands from <em>ever </em>entering the danger zone and (2) conflicts with the safety code\u2019s enumeration of a \u201ctwo-hand control\u201d as an acceptable means of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">Our definitive discussion of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-ll(E) was in <em>State ex rel. Aspinwall v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 55, 531 N.E.2d 681. There, claimant was involved in a two-step manufacturing process. He first inserted a part into the press and covered it with a sleeve. He then activated the press. After the ram had cycled, he would reach in, replace the sleeve, reposition the part, and reactivate the press. Claimant was injured when the ram unexpectedly descended while he was repositioning the part.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>As here, a violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1 \u2014 5\u201411(E) was alleged. The employer contended that \u201coperating cycle\u201d \u201cmust be defined within the context of the machine, <em>ie., </em>the physical cycling of the machine, completed when the ram ascends to its resting position. [Claimant\u2019s] definition, on the other hand, encompasses the entire part production process \u2014 insertion of the piece through its final removal. [The employer\u2019s] contention is more persuasive.\u201d <em>Id., </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 56, 531 N.E.2d at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">We found in the employer\u2019s favor, rejecting the assertion that \u201cany required insertion of the hands into the danger zone falls within the \u2018operating cycle.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 57, 531 N.E.2d at 684. We wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\u2018We find this interpretation to be too broad. If part removal is included in the \u2018operating cycle,\u2019 it would follow that placement and midphase adjustment are included as well. As such, an employer would essentially be required to prevent hands from <em>ever </em>entering the danger zone. Such a result appears inconsistent with legislative intent. If the General Assembly intended the danger zone to be guarded at all times, there would have been no need for the limiting language \u2018during the operating cycle.\u2019 Moreover, a two-handed tripping device is specifically enumerated as an acceptable method of \u2018operating cycle\u2019 protection. That device, however, only provides protection during actual physical cycling of the ram. It would not have prevented the present accident.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 57, 531 N.E.2d at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The same reasoning applies here. The <em>Aspinwall </em>court also went on to explain that \u201coperating cycle\u201d is confined to operator-intended press activation, writing:</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\"><em>\u201cGentzler Tool </em>[18 Ohio St.3d at 105, 18 OBR at 139, 480 N.E.2d at 399] also supports this conclusion. In that case, the claimant was injured when a coworker manually activated the press, bypassing the pull-back safety guard and causing the ram to descend on the claimant\u2019s hand. We found no VSSR since there was no evidence indicating that the guards had been ineffective during the operating cycle of the power press. We reasoned that because the guards had never failed when activated by the operator, this kind of activation must be that contemplated by the definition of \u2018operating cycle.\u2019 \u201d 40 Ohio St.3d at 58, 531 N.E.2d at 684-685.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">This, too, makes sense in our case, particularly when dealing with the two-handed trip currently at issue. This protection is designed to work only when the employee <em>deliberately </em>removes his or her hands from the danger zone in order to press the two buttons. Since the code\u2019s authors deemed this to be an acceptable method of protection during the \u201coperating cycle,\u201d then \u201coperating cycle\u201d can mean only a cycle that is operator-intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">In our case, ram descent was not operator-intended. It also, per <em>Aspinwall, </em>did not occur within that portion of the manufacturing process deemed as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>\u201coperating cycle.\u201d These conclusions are supported by \u201csome evidence,\u201d negating any claim that the commission abused its discretion in denying the VSSR award.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AOH\"><em>Gallon &amp; Takacs Co., L.P.A., </em>and <em>Theodore A.
