I agree with the majority\u2019s implicit ruling that Kitts can be fired for refusing a drug test. Irrespective of his refusal to be tested, however, Kitts should not be disqualified from receiving an appropriate level of compensation for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">Kitts\u2019s dismissal, which is considered voluntary because he violated a company policy with knowledge that his conduct could result in discharge, precludes him from collecting compensation for temporary total disability. <em>State ex rel. McKnabb v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 559, 752 N.E.2d 254. However, Kitts should be eligible to pursue compensation for permanent total disability, if his injuries warrant it. See <em>State ex rel. Reliance Elec. Co. v. Wright </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 109, 111, 748 N.E.2d 1105, 1108 (voluntary abandonment of employment precludes permanent total disability award only when claimant abandons entire job market, <em>e.g., </em>by retiring). The work-related nature of the injury is not at issue; the self-insured employer was ordered to pay Kitts\u2019s medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">Manpower presented the following authorization statement to Kitts for his signature immediately prior to his scheduled drug test:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">\u201cI understand that if I fail to pass the drug screening test I will be terminated immediately. I also understand that I must submit to a substance abuse test upon claim to an injury or an accident, and that failure to submit to this test will result in immediate termination. A delay in submitting to this test, or tampering with the test, will also result in my immediate termination. If I fail to comply with this policy Manpower will not approve payment of my worker\u2019s compensation claim. If I fail to pass the drug screen, Manpower will not approve payment of my worker\u2019s compensation claim.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AGj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>Barkan &amp; Neff, L.P.A., </em>and <em>Robert E.

Presenting this misleading statement to Kitts for his signature was unscrupulous.
