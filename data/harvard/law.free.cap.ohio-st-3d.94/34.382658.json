His average weekly wage (\u201cAWW\u201d) was set, and compensation and benefits followed..</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">In 1998, claimant moved appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio to adjust his AWW to $265.27, claiming that wages that he had received from other jobs in the year prior to injury had not been included in the calculation. The commission granted the motion and raised claimant\u2019s AWW to $258.96.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">Pursuant to R.C. 4123.52, claimant\u2019s rate of compensation was readjusted back to December 31, 1996 \u2014 two years prior to. claimant\u2019s motion. Seeking readjustment back to the date of injury, claimant commenced a mandamus action in the Court of Appeals for Franklin \u25a0 County. The court of appeals denied the writ after finding that the commission had properly applied R.C. 4123.52\u2019s two-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">R.C. 4123.52 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-15\">\u201cThe jurisdiction of the industrial commission * * * over each case is continuing, and the commission may make such modification or change with respect to former findings or orders with respect thereto, as, in its opinion is justified. * * * [T]he commission shall not make any modification, change, finding, or award which shall award compensation for a back period in excess of two years prior to the date of filing application therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-16\">Claimant asserts that R.C. 4123.52 does not apply because retroactive adjustment does not constitute an \u201caward.\u201d Claimant alternatively proposes that if it does apply, R.C. 4123.95\u2019s liberal-construction mandate creates an exception for claimants with serious injuries. Both contentions fail.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AlM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>Kendis &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A., </em>and <em>Rachel B. Jaffy, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Amh\"><em>Hanna, Campbell &amp; Powell </em>and <em>Lori A. Fricke, </em>for appellee Dairy Mart, Inc.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AiV\"><em>Betty D. Montgomery, </em>Attorney General, and <em>Jacob Dobres, </em>Assistant Attorney General, for appellee Industrial Commission.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The first argument was conclusively rejected in <em>State ex rel. Cobble v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 22, 26, 748 N.E.2d 29, 33:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><em>\u201cAmicus </em>proposes that back payment does not result in an \u2018award\u2019 of compensation, but merely an \u2018adjustment\u2019 to compensation previously paid. <em>[State ex rel.] Welsh [v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 178, 712 N.E.2d 749] has, however, effectively dispensed with any semantics over whether a monetary disbursal is an \u2018award,\u2019 an \u2018enforcement,\u2019 an \u2018adjustment,\u2019 or a \u2018modification.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Claimant\u2019s second argument also lacks merit. Neither R.C. Chapter 4121 nor Chapter 4123 establishes a distinct and more generous statute of limitations for those more seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Claimant\u2019s injury, moreover, does not explain the twelve-and-one-half-year delay in seeking redress. Claimant indeed suffered a devastating injury, but counsel offers no evidence that the injury impeded the discovery of the additional wage information.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The lone case that claimant cites is <em>State ex rel. Welsh v. Indus. Comm. </em>Contrary to claimant\u2019s representation, <em>Welsh </em>does not say that there are exceptions to R.C. 4123.52\u2019s two-year statute of limitations. It says just the opposite: \u201c[A] claimant must act diligently to secure compensation by commission order. And R.C. 4123.52 explicitly states the penalty for a claimant\u2019s inaction \u2014 any award will be limited to the two years preceding his or her application for it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180, 712 N.E.2d at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b151-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AX\">Resnick and F.E.
