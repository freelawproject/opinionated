That attorney must sign the registration, certifying that the independent paralegal is qualified to perform the services and that the supervising attorney will supervise and be responsible for all services of the paralegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">On September 22, 1999, respondent, Dellwin Purnell, filed an independent paralegal registration in the probate court in connection with the personal injury claim of a minor, Kyle Petersen. The form was not signed by a supervising attorney. On September 24, 1999, respondent filed an \u201cApplication to Settle a Minor\u2019s Claim\u201d in the probate court, striking the words \u201cattorney\u201d and \u201cattorney\u2019s\u201d from the form language \u201creasonable attorney fee for the attorney\u2019s services\u201d and substituting therefor the phrase \u201creasonable paralegal fee for the services.\u201d The application indicated that the fee would be $3,500 and that a fee agreement between respondent and the minor\u2019s parent was attached to the application. In a letter to Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, dated October 16, 1998, respondent had indicated that he was engaged to \u201crepresent Kyle Petersen in a claim for personal injuries.\u201d On January 24, 2000, the probate judge found respondent in contempt for representing himself as a paralegal without a supervising attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">On September 13, 2000, relator, Columbus Bar Association, filed a complaint charging respondent with the unauthorized practice of law. Respondent failed to answer, and on December 4, 2000, relator filed a motion for default. The matter was referred to the Board of Commissioners on the Unauthorized Practice of Law (\u201cboard\u201d), which granted the motion. The board found the facts as stated and concluded that respondent\u2019s conduct constituted rendering legal services for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>another by a person not admitted to the practice of law in Ohio. The board recommended that respondent be prohibited from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law in the future.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"APx4\"><em>D. Allan Asbury, Mary Jo Cusack </em>and <em>Bruce A. Campbell, </em>for relator.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">On review of the record, we adopt the findings, conclusion, and recommendation of the board. A paralegal who, without the supervision of an attorney, advises and represents a claimant in a personal injury matter is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Cromwell </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 255, 695 N.E.2d 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Respondent is hereby enjoined from any further activities that might constitute the unauthorized practice of law. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b243-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
