Saumer </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 312, 715 N.E.2d 124. On December 4, 2000, relator, Office of Disciplinary Counsel, filed a complaint charging that respondent, by neglecting three other matters, again violated the Code of Professional Responsibility. Respondent failed to answer, and relator\u2019s motion for default was referred to Master Commissioner Harry W. White.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Based upon the allegations of the complaint and evidence submitted by relator, the master commissioner found that after respondent filed a personal injury suit for Luann Dobson in September 1998, he failed to obtain service, and the case was dismissed in April 1999. Nevertheless, respondent informed Dobson that the case had been filed and would probably settle. Respondent did not reply to the inquiries of successor counsel after Dobson terminated her relationship with respondent in December 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">The master commissioner also found that respondent neglected his duty with respect to the estate of his mother, Vivian L. Saumer, by failing to transfer certain real estate, failing to file a proper inventory, and failing to file a final account. As a result, respondent\u2019s sister was removed as the fiduciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">Similarly, respondent was cited by the probate court in May 1997 for failure to file an account in the estate of Kay Weber. As a result, the Cuyahoga County Probate Court removed the co-executors, and the Ohio Department of Taxation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>assessed a penalty against the estate for a nineteen-month delay in filing the estate tax return. The penalty was abated by the successor administrator.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJF\"><em>Jonathan E. </em>Coughlan,' Disciplinary Counsel, and <em>Gloria J. Sigman, </em>Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Finally, the master commissioner found that respondent failed to cooperate in the investigation of his conduct and failed to comply with the order of suspension we issued in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The master commissioner concluded that respondent\u2019s failures to act violated DR 1-102(A)(5) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), 1-102(A)(6) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct adversely reflecting on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), 6-101(A)(3) (a lawyer shall not neglect an entrusted legal matter), 7-101(A)(2) (a lawyer shall not fail to carry out a contract for professional employment), 9-102(B)(4) (a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client funds or property to which the client is entitled), and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (no attorney shall neglect or refuse to assist or testify in a disciplinary investigation or hearing). Based on respondent\u2019s prior neglect and these similar matters of neglect, the master commissioner recommended that respondent be disbarred from the practice of law in Ohio. The board adopted the findings and conclusions of the master commissioner but not his recommendation. The board concluded that respondent\u2019s conduct did not warrant a disbarment and recommended an indefinite suspension instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">We have reviewed the record and adopt the findings, conclusions, and recommendation of the board. Respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for an indefinite period. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b446-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

Because I would adopt the sanction recommended by the master commissioner, I respectfully dissent. I would disbar respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
