He was found guilty by a jury on two counts, sentenced to thirty-three months in prison, and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $205,000. On January 5, 2001, respondent was suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for an interim period pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(5)(A)(4). <em>In re Banks </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 1401, 740 N.E.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">On April 9, 2001, relator, Cincinnati Bar Association, filed a complaint charging that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(3) (engaging in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude), 1-102(A)(4) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and 1-102(A)(5) (engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice). Respondent was served the complaint, but did not answer, and relator moved for default pursuant to Gov.Bar R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>V(6)(F). The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court (\u201cboard\u201d) referred the matter to board member Jean M. McQuillan for disposition pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(6)(F)(2), and she submitted a report granting the motion and adopting the relator\u2019s recommendation of an indefinite suspension. Upon review, the board found respondent in violation of the cited Disciplinary Rules, but recommended that respondent be permanently disbarred from the practice of law in this state.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A_t\"><em>Edwin W. Patterson III, </em>for relator.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We concur in the board\u2019s findings of misconduct and its recommendation. In sentencing respondent for the theft of these computers, United States District Judge Jennifer B. Coffman calculated the amount of victim loss at over $500,000. She also cited four separate occasions during respondent\u2019s trial wherein he gave testimony that he knew to be materially false. Under circumstances such as these, we are compelled to impose our most severe penalty \u2014 disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Accordingly, we find that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(3), (4), and (5). We further order that respondent be permanently disbarred from the practice of' law in Ohio. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b545-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
