COHEN, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">Plaintiff Varsavia Weitz filed suit against her husband for bodily injuries allegedly caused by his negligent operation of a motor vehicle. She also sought a declaratory judgment requiring defendant Allstate Insurance Company (\u201cAllstate\u201d) to cover her husband under his excess liability (\u201cumbrella\u201d) policy for any damages awarded for her injuries in excess of his automobile insurance policy coverage. The Law Division below held that plaintiff could not recover under her husband\u2019s excess liability policy. She appealed; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">Mr. Weitz was the named insured under a personal umbrella policy issued by Allstate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under a section entitled \u201cGeneral Exclusions \u2014 When This Policy Does Not Apply\u201d the policy states \u201cthis policy will not apply ... to personal injury to an insured.\u201d (bold in original). In the policy\u2019s definition section, \u201cinsured\u201d is defined as including \u201crelatives living in your household.\u201d (bold in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>In a letter opinion accompanying the order dismissing plaintiffs complaint against Allstate, the judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">The terms and conditions are dearly articulated in the personal umbrella policy. The policy is written with many of the terms and topic headings in bold print to accentuate policy exclusions____ [lit is important to recognize the distinction between an automobile policy [and] an umbrella policy____ The former is mandated by and subject to strict statutory regulation____ [An] umbrella policy is not subject to such regulation. It is additional coverage not required for the purpose of auto insurance. While it is well established that automobile liability insurance is statutorily required and that any deviation therefrom would be in contravention with the public policy of New Jersey mandating auto insurance. Conversely, umbrella policies are not required. Any additions, exclusions, or other conditions of such policy does not contravene public policy in New Jersey____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Plaintiff contends that an ordinary insured would reasonably assume that the umbrella policy provided coverage against claims arising out of injuries to household members.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Not so. The policy states that coverage will not extend to a claim for personal injury to \u201can insured.\u201d The policy specifically and clearly defines \u201can insured\u201d as including members of Mr. Weitz\u2019s household. Plaintiff is a member of Mr. Weitz\u2019s household. We perceive nothing ambiguous about the policy\u2019s exclusion provision. Some authorities say that, if an insurance policy contains no genuine ambiguity, the courts may \u201cnot engage in a strained construction to support the imposition of liability,\u201d or \u201cwrite for the insured a better policy of insurance than the one purchased.\u201d <em>Longobardi v. Chubb Ins. Co. of New Jersey, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>530, 537, 581 A.2d 1257 (1990). <em>See also, State v. Signo Trading Intern., Inc., </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>51, 62, 612 A.2d 932 (1992). Others say that a policy, no matter how clearly worded, will not be interpreted in a way that would disappoint the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations. <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165, 175, 607 A.2d 1255 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>It is not easy to reconcile the two positions. They might agree, however, that satisfying the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations does not require a court to follow the notions of the least common insurance customer regarding the contents of an umbrella insurance policy. This is not a policy bought by everyone, like an auto or homeowners\u2019 policy. Instead, it provides added areas of insurance for the particularly cautious person. The policy should not be read as simply an endorsement to basic policies to raise their dollar limits. It provides coverages unavailable in auto and homeowners\u2019 policies, for example, for defamation, malicious prosecution, false arrest, invasion of privacy, and violation of civil rights. As its coverages depart from auto and homeowners\u2019 policies, it should not be a surprise that its exclusions are also different.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Plaintiff argues that the exclusion in Allstate\u2019s policy is ambiguous because it appears on page 9 of the policy and does not explicitly cross-reference to the policy\u2019s definition section, appearing on 2 of the policy, to clarify who is excluded from coverage. We disagree. The defined terms that appear in the exclusion provision are in bold print. Moreover, an exclusion is not rendered ambiguous merely because the definitions appear on one page and the exclusions appear on another. <em>See State Farm Gen. Ins. Co. v. Emerson, </em>102 Wash.2d 477, 687 P.2d 1139, 1144 (1984) (\u201cThe fact that a policy is long, and that pertinent language is not contained on a single page, does not, in itself, render the policy structurally ambiguous.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Plaintiff contends that because her husband\u2019s primary automobile insurance policy could not have excluded coverage for claims brought by members of his household, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-3 to -4, he would reasonably assume that his personal umbrella policy could not have contained such an exclusion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The Legislature has not required automobile insureds to purchase umbrella policies; and there is no legislation dictating the parameters of coverage contained in such policies. Unlike his underlying automobile policy whose scope is defined by statute, Mr. Weitz\u2019s umbrella policy is defined by the policy\u2019s plain lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>guage, unencumbered by the statutory requirements for automobile insurance. Plaintiff suggests no compelling reason to tack onto one form of insurance the statutory requirements governing another. <em>See Horesh v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>32, 37, 625 A.2d 541 (App.Div.1993) (\u201cIn the absence of any statutory or substantial public policy requirement to cover liability for an insured\u2019s injury, a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy may exclude such liability from coverage,\u201d even where such an exclusion could not be enforced if contained in an automobile liability insurance policy); <em>Stiefal v. Bayly, Martin and Fay, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>643, 577 A.2d 1303 (App.Div.1990) (no public policy or statute requires uninsured motorist coverage to be read into an umbrella policy as it could be read into the primary automobile insurance policy); <em>Foley v. Foley, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>256, 414 A.2d 34 (App.Div.1980) (homeowners policy cannot be equated with automobile policy to invalidate exclusion for intra-family torts). The unambiguous exclusion set forth in Allstate\u2019s umbrella policy must be. enforced as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-14\"> The parties agree that an automobile liability policy issued to Mr. Weitz by Allstate is available for the damage claims made against him by his wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-11\"> Plaintiff's claim is based solely on the words of the policy, and there is no assertion that Allstate\u2019s agents and employees violated a duty to inform or advise, or that plaintiff's family Would have purchased an auto policy with greater liability coverage if they knew of the intra-family tort exclusion in the umbrella policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
