Hurd, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>525, 432 A.2d 86 (1981), and the photographic arrays were unduly suggestive; that the sentence was excessive; and that the trial court erred in denying a change of venue or the empaneling of a foreign jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">On September 4, 1991, after granting defendant permission to file an overlength brief, the Supreme Court denied defendant\u2019s petition for certification.

The same public defender who represented defendant on the applications to the Supreme Court has represented him on the trial and appellate phases of the post-conviction relief petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Defendant on this appeal contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">POINT i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">THE NEW JERSEY COURT <em>RULES </em>DO NOT PRECLUDE DEFENDANT CLARENCE MOORE FROM POST-CONVICTION RELIEF IN THE MATTER AT BAR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">A.

We begin therefore by reviewing the pertinent State\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">On January 14, 1986, some time after 1:20 a.m., 25-year-old M.A. was viciously assaulted by a man in the bedroom of her cottage in Somers Point. M.A. went to bed that night only to be awakened by a male who grabbed her by the neck. The male demanded money, and M.A. removed $8 from her purse and gave it to him. When M.A. could produce no more money, the man became angry. He ordered her to undress. Despite the man\u2019s assurance she would not be hurt if she did as she was told, the man penetrated her anally after she complied with his directions to roll over on her stomach and then kneel on her hands and knees. The man then ordered her to roll over and he penetrated her vaginally. He then forced her to perform fellatio on him until he ejaculated. Still angered by lack of money, the man forced her to again perform oral sex until he achieved an erection. He then ordered her to kneel on the bed and \u201cshake\u201d her rear in the air while someone outside watched. He warned her if she did not do this \u201che would come back and do it again or kill\u201d her. M.A. remained in her bed for four hours fearful the man was still in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">Finally, she arranged to have the police called and, when the police arrived, M.A. described her attacker. She described him as a black male, about 5'8\" to 5T0\" tall, late twenties to early thirties, very muscular and strong. (There is no dispute by defendant that the description could apply to him.) She also said her attacker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>had been wearing blue jeans. Further, she described him as having some facial hair on the sides of his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">While the bedroom was dark, there was enough outside light \u201cto see a face.\u201d Also, although she was not wearing her contact lenses that corrected her nearsightedness, she stated the attacker was \u201cvery close\u201d to her, close enough for her to see him and his face. Defendant, on the original appeal, as he does now, suggests the victim\u2019s vision was impaired because she was not wearing her contact lenses. However, M.A. testified she could see without her contacts, that she had driven without them, and her vision did not prevent her from seeing things close to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">When M.A. could not give the police composite artist sufficient information to develop a composite sketch, she suggested hypnosis, thinking it \u201cmight help [her] remember, in more detail, his face.\u201d With the aid of hypnotically enhanced memory, she could vividly recall her attacker\u2019s facial features. She thereafter was able to positively identify defendant as her assailant both in court and on three occasions in out-of-court photographic arrays. She described the hypnotic enhancement as making her attacker\u2019s face \u201cmuch clearer\u201d with \u201cthe features ... more detailed.\u201d She also testified she initially could not positively recognize her assailant without the hypnosis. There is nothing in the record to suggest either the police or the doctor assisting the hypnosis in any way suggested what the assailant might look like.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">As a result of the hypnosis, M.A. also recalled her assailant wore a tan suede jacket with dirt around the pockets. A subsequently executed search warrant at defendant\u2019s residence turned up a tan suede sweater jacket with pockets along with several pairs of blue jeans.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">To paraphrase our original opinion, this evidence, if the jury found M.A, credible, was more than sufficient for the jury to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. As our case law has so often stated, the issue of credibility is for the jury. <em>State v. Ingenito, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>204, 211, 432 A.2d 912 (1981). It is pertinent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>note that defendant\u2019s disagreement with the jury\u2019s credibility finding does not make the State\u2019s evidence \u201cshockingly slight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Defendant postulates that the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim entitled him to a post-conviction evidentiary hearing that would demonstrate his judgment of conviction would be overturned. Arguing since the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim could not have been previously raised, the trial court erred when it denied him the opportunity to present the opinion of a legal expert \u2014 a lawyer with appellate experience \u2014 that original appellate counsel was not only deficient but that this court would probably have overturned his conviction had the deficiency not occurred. The predicate for the deficiency claim is appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise three categories of issues, all of which could have been raised and would be procedurally barred but for the constitutional attiring of the petition in ineffective assistance of counsel clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Ineffective assistance of counsel claims have found a niche in the post-conviction relief procedure. They have been found particularly suitable to the procedure because they often cannot reasonably be raised in prior proceedings. <em>See State v. Preciose, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>451, 460, 609 A.2d 1280 (1992). Their unsuitability for direct review is because they center on collateral issues involving allegations and evidence that lie outside the trial record. <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently, ineffective assistance of counsel claims, particularly ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, are congruous with the exceptions to the procedural bar of <em>R. </em>3:22-4 because they (1) implicate issues that could not have been reasonably raised in prior proceedings; (2) involve infringement of constitutional rights; or (3) present exceptional circumstances involving a showing of fundamental injustice. <em>See State v. Mitchell, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>565, 584, 601 A.2d 198 (1992). Defendant\u2019s petition argued only the first two circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Defendant\u2019s contention that he could not have raised the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel (a public defender pool attorney) issue before his petition is an apparent distortion. Upon affirmance of his conviction by this court, the public defender turned the case over to a Deputy Public Defender II. That attorney then filed an overlength brief in connection with defendant\u2019s petition for certification to the Supreme Court. One of the issues raised in that brief was the \u201cegregious pervasive prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d The brief did not raise the issue of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. Thus, it appears defendant, through counsel, chose for strategic reasons to challenge the \u201cpervasive\u201d prosecutorial misconduct that he now condemns appellate counsel for not raising but chose not to assert ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failure to raise that pervasiveness issue. That choice at least suggests the strategy was to preserve the ineffective assistance issue for a post-conviction relief petition in order to secure another review of prosecutorial misconduct allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In any event, in his petitions to the Supreme Court, defendant had the right to raise the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim. <em>R. </em>2:2-l(a). The Supreme Court could have considered, but did not have to consider, an ineffective assistance of appellate counsel issue when it denied certification. <em>See The Presbyterian Homes v. Division of Tax Appeals, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>275, 289, 261 A.2d 143 (1970). Consequently, although the issue was not raised before the Supreme Court, we do not accept defendant\u2019s contention that he did not have the opportunity to previously raise the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">That notwithstanding, defendant\u2019s claim of entitlement to an evidentiary hearing on his petition misconceives the decisional law of this State and the role of the trial court when considering a post-conviction relief petition where an ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim is made. Defendant relies on <em>State v. Preciose, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 462, 609 A.2d 1280, where the Court essentially found there \u201cmore likely\u201d was need for an evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>hearing in post-conviction relief cases where ineffective assistance of counsel is claimed because facts often lie outside the trial record and because in cases where the charge is against appellate counsel the attorney\u2019s testimony may be required to explain reasons for his or her inaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In this instance, there are no facts outside the record. All of defendant\u2019s grounds for his ineffective assistance of counsel claim relate to what transpired at trial. The only possible reason for a hearing in this case would have been for original appellate counsel to explain why she did not raise the issues defendant now finds so persuasive as grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Yet, defendant never proffered the testimony of original appellate counsel. Instead he offered an expert\u2019s opinion \u2014 an opinion by a lawyer who is experienced in appellate procedure \u2014 that original appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the contended persuasive issues was deficient and that, in absence of the deficiency, the conviction would probably have been reversed. The tenor of defendant\u2019s argument then is that he had the right to have his legal expert give the trial court legal advice so it could resolve the ultimate issue before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Expert testimony is admissible if it \u201cwill assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue.\u201d <em>Evid. R. </em>56(2) (now <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702). It must relate to a relevant subject beyond the ken of the fact trier. <em>See State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 208, 478 A.2d 364 (1984). The subject matter must be so esoteric that it is beyond common judgment and experience so the fact trier cannot form a valid judgment as to the fact in issue without such testimony. <em>Butler v. Acme Markets, Inc., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>270, 283, 445 A.2d 1141 (1982). The proposed testimony did not fall within these parameters for allowing expert testimony. There is no basis to conclude that a lawyer experienced in appellate practice has any knowledge of that practice that is beyond the ken of a trial court. Moreover, given the variety of viewpoints prevalent in the legal community today, we find it calumnious to suggest that a trial court must even consider such an expert\u2019s opinion on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the issue of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. Additionally, it is not an expert\u2019s opinion that is relevant but the reasoning of the attorney who handled the appeal. <em>See State v. Preciose, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 462, 609 A.2d 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">That all notwithstanding, defendant argues that his right to a fair trial was violated by various instances of prosecutorial misconduct. We are satisfied from our review of the record that, even had appellate counsel specifically raised those instances in addition to the instances she did raise, all of the alleged misconduct did not have the magnitude to require a reversal of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In the petition for post-conviction relief, defendant adds three categories to appellate counsel\u2019s list of prosecutorial improprieties: (1) improper references to matters .outside the evidence and statements regarding opinion as to the veracity of testimony and about defendant\u2019s guilt; (2) misstatement and dilution of the State\u2019s burden of proof by repeatedly telling the jury that guilt beyond a reasonable doubt meant that the \u201codds are\u201d defendant did it; (3) repeating disparaging remarks and ridicule of the defense and defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">To begin with, we conclude that, had the second issue been raised on appeal, it would have been found to be clearly without merit. <em>See R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). The complaints were not raised at trial and, consequently, would have been dealt with as plain error. <em>See State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 333, 273 A.2d 1 (1971). The trial court carefully, clearly, and correctly instructed the jury on the State\u2019s burden of proof. There is no basis for concluding the jury failed to follow that instruction and instead followed the prosecutor\u2019s \u201codds are\u201d remarks. <em>State v. Manley, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>259, 271, 255 A.2d 193 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">As to the remaining two categories, we are equally satisfied that, had all the recited instances of prosecutorial misconduct been raised in concert with what was raised, there is no basis for concluding, in light of the trial record, the trial process was so distorted by prosecutorial excess as to create real doubt the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>was diverted from a proper evaluation of the legitimate evidence. <em>See State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 322-23, 524 A.2d 188 (1987). To paraphrase the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Kelly, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 218, 478 A.2d 364, while we do not condone all aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct, we conclude that, in the context of the entire trial, the conduct did not cause defendant to be denied a fair trial. <em>See State v. Marshall, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>1, 153, 586 A.2d 85 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Defendant also contends he was denied effective assistance of counsel on direct appeal by counsel\u2019s failure to raise as error the trial court\u2019s refusal to entertain counsel\u2019s challenge to the racial composition of the petit jury panel. Once again, we find that had the issue been raised it would have been deemed clearly without merit. <em>See R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Defense counsel\u2019s challenge to the array was based on speculation. Even on this appeal defendant takes the \u201cposition that a study of the Atlantic County jury selection process <em>may </em>reveal that blacks are substantially underrepresented on the petit juries.\u201d (emphasis added) The record does not disclose a prima facie case of denial of equal protection by systematic exclusion of a constitutionally cognizable group. <em>State v. Ramseur, supra, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>at 215-16, 524 A.2d 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">In sum, our review of the record satisfies us that defendant has failed to establish appellate counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. Even assuming for the purposes of argument it was, defendant fails to demonstrate that but for that deficient performance this court would have overturned his conviction on the original appeal. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 694, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 698, <em>reh\u2019g. denied, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>1267, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>3562, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>864 (1984); <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 58, 519 A.2d 336 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
