In July of 1990, the Board voted to abolish appellant\u2019s position and to contract with the Educational Services Commission (ESC) of Monmouth County to provide speech correction services for the district\u2019s pupils during the 1990-91 school year. The Board agreed to pay the ESC $8,000 for speech correction services, compared to the slightly more than $20,000 salary it would have had to pay appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Appellant filed a petition of appeal with the Commissioner of Education, asserting that the Board\u2019s actions violated her tenure rights and seeking reinstatement. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concluded that a local board of education has the statutory authority to contract with an ESC to provide speech correction services and that the Board\u2019s sole motive in contracting with the Monmouth County ESC to provide these services, and in abolishing appellant\u2019s position, had been to save money. Consequently, the ALJ decided that the Board\u2019s actions did not violate appellant\u2019s tenure rights. The ALJ\u2019s initial decision was affirmed by the Commissioner of Education and the State Board of Education (the State Board).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">In reviewing the State Board\u2019s decision, the threshold question is whether a local board of education has the statutory authority to contract with an ESC to provide speech correction services for its pupils. Each board of education has a responsibility \u201cto provide suitable facilities and programs of education\u201d for all handicapped children, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:46-13, which includes children who are \u201ccommunication handicapped.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:46-1. A board of education may discharge its responsibility of providing special services for its handicapped pupils in a variety of ways, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">a. A special class or classes in the district, ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\">b. A special class in the public schools of another district in this State or any other state in the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>c. .Joint facilities ... to be provided by agreement between one or more school districts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">d. A jointure commission program;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">e. A State of New Jersey operated program;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">f. Instruction at school supplementary to the other programs in the school____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>18A:46-14a to -14f.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-9\"><em>See also </em>N.J.S.A 18A:46-5.1; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:46-19.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">An ESC is an agency comprised of at least five member school districts in one or more counties, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-52(a), one of the functions of which is to provide \u201cpublic school districts [with] such educational and administrative services as may be authorized pursuant to rules of the State Board of Education.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:6-51(a); see <em>Remedial Educ. &amp; Diagnostic Servs., Inc. v. Essex County Educ. Servs. Comm\u2019n, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>524, 526-28, 468 A.2d 253 (App.Div.1983), <em>certif. denied, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>601, 483 A.2d 139 (1984). One of the educational services which the State Board\u2019s rules specifically authorize an ESC to provide is a program for \u201cpupils with educational disabilities,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:28-7.1(a), who include the communication handicapped. See <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:28-1.3, defining a \u201cpupil with an educational disability\u201d to mean a pupil eligible for \u201cspecial education\u201d under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:28-3.5, and <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:28 \u2014 3.5(d)(4), indicating that pupils eligible for \u201cspecial education\u201d include the \u201ccommunication handicapped.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When an ESC decides to contract with a school district to provide a special education program, see <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-63(a), it may employ such teachers and other employees as are required to discharge this responsibility. <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:6-65. Therefore, we are satisfied that a facility or program of special education provided by an ESC, such as speech correctional services, is a \u201c[j]oint facility] ... provided by agreement between one or more school districts\u201d within the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:46-14(c), as well as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u201ceducational service\u201d authorized pursuant to rules of the State Board within the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-51(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"> Appellant argues that the Department of Education\u2019s rules governing special education preclude a local board of education from contracting with an ESC to provide such services. See <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:28-1.1 to -11.13. However, these rules expressly provide that a local board may discharge its responsibility of providing services for handicapped children, including the services of speech correctionists, through \u201cjoint agreements\u201d with other districts, <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:28 \u2014 1.1(f), administered in accordance with \u201ccontractual agreement[s] ... between district boards of education.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:28-1.1(g)(2). Moreover, as previously noted, the State Board\u2019s rules expressly authorize a local school district to contract with an ESC to provide educational services for communication handicapped pupils. <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:28-7.1(a). And even if there were reasonable doubt regarding the intent of the rules governing special services for handicapped pupils, we would defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of those rules. <em>See Simon v. Board of Trustees, Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirement Sys., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>186, 195, 558 A.2d 490 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>652, 569 A.2d 1348 (1989). In any event, since <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:46-14(c) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-51(a) provide the requisite authorization for a local board to contract with an ESC to provide services for its handicapped pupils, the Department could not adopt a rule or regulation withdrawing a power which the Legislature has conferred. <em>Cf. In re Uniform Admin. Procedure Rules, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>85, 94, 447 A.2d 151 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Appellant argues that even if the Board has the authority to contract with an ESC to provide educational services for its handicapped pupils, it violated her tenure rights under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:28-5 by contracting with the Monmouth County ESC to provide the speech correction services which she previously had performed. However, the Legislature has authorized the abolition of teaching positions for reasons of economy and efficiency. <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:28-9 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Nothing in this title or any other law relating to tenure of service shall he held to limit the right of any hoard of education to reduce the number of teaching staff members, employed in the district whenever, in the judgment of the board, it is advisable to abolish any such positions for reasons of economy or because of reduction in the number of pupils or of change in the administrative or supervisory organization of the district or for other good cause upon compliance with the provisions of this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The Board\u2019s decision to contract with an ESC to provide the speech correction services previously performed by appellant eliminated the need for the position of speech correctionist within the district. Moreover, appellant stipulated that the Board would save more than $12,000 per year by contracting with an ESC to provide these services. Therefore, we are satisfied that the Board properly abolished appellant\u2019s position of speech correctionist \u201cfor reasons of economy\u201d and thus did not violate her tenure rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Klinger v. Board of Educ. of Cranbury, </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>354, 357, 463 A.2d 948 (App.Div.1982) (\u201c[Reduction in force is entirely within the authority of the board if done for reasons of economy.\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>277, 460 A.2d 678 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The Board\u2019s decision to contract with an ESC to provide speech correction services is significantly different from the administrative action involved in <em>Viemeister v. Board of Educ. of Prospect Park, </em>5 <em>N.J.Super. </em>215, 68 A.2d 768 (App.Div.1949), in which a local board abolished the position of school principal, terminated the incumbent, and established a position of \u201cteaching principal\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>which it appointed one of the school\u2019s teachers to fill. In affirming the State Board\u2019s decision invalidating the abolition of the position of school principal, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">The fact that the formal resolutions adopted by the Board speak in terms of abolition of the position of principal and creation of a new position of \u201cteaching principal,\u201d which finds no recognition in the tenure statutes, does not appear to be significant. We look to the substance rather than the form and, in substance, the principalship was continued but transferred to [the newly appointed \u201cteaching principal\u201d].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 218, 68 A.2d 768.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Therefore, while <em>Viemeister </em>involved the re-titling of the position of principal in order to remove a tenured incumbent, this case involves a statutorily authorized administrative change in the method of providing an educational service for the sole purpose of saving money.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">In sum, a local board has the authority both to contract with an ESC to provide educational services for the handicapped and to abolish a teaching position \u201cfor reasons of economy.\u201d We are satisfied that the Board\u2019s decision to contract with the Monmouth County ESC to provide speech correction services and its consequent abolition of appellant\u2019s tenured position constituted a proper exercise of these statutory powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-11\">The parties stipulated that the State Board has authorized the Monmouth County ESC to provide special education services to public school districts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\"> The New Jersey Education Association has filed an <em>amicus curiae </em>brief which argues that appellant's tenure as a speech correctionist was statutorily transferred to the Monmouth County ESC, and hence that she is entitled to a tenured position with that agency. However, appellant did not present this claim to the Department of Education or to this court. Consequently, it is not properly before us on this appeal. <em>See Nieder </em>v. <em>Royal Indemn. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973). An <em>amicus curiae </em>must accept the case as presented by the parties. <em>Bethlehem Township Bd. of Educ. v. Bethlehem Township Educ. Ass'n, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>38, 48-49, 449 A.2d 1254 (1982). Moreover, the Monmouth County ESC, which would be a necessary party to an action involving a claim by appellant to tenure with that entity, <em>see Board of Directors of Ajax Electrothermic Corp. </em>v. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Princeton, </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>456, 463, 165 A.2d 513 (1960), was not named as a party either in the proceedings before the Department of Education or in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
