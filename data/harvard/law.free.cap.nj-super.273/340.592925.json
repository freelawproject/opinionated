Giri, M.D., a neurosurgeon, appeals from a judgment of dismissal in his malicious civil prosecution action against Rutgers Casualty Insurance Company (Rutgers), an automobile liability insurance carrier. Dr. Giri\u2019s suit was based on Rutgers\u2019 unsuccessful medical malpractice suit against him purportedly brought on behalf of its insured, Jean Ann Affrunti. The malpractice action, according to Dr. Giri, caused him to lose his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>malpractice insurance temporarily and required him to close his practice for a period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">At the conclusion of Dr. Giri\u2019s case, the judge ruled as a matter of law that his alleged damages \u2014 lapsed malpractice insurance, interruption of his surgical practice, and consequent loss of income \u2014 did not constitute a \u201cspecial grievance,\u201d a key element of his cause of action. We conclude that the judge erred and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">On August 5, 1985 Affrunti injured her lower back in an automobile accident. On September 4, 1985 Dr. Giri performed surgery on her. Affrunti called on Rutgers to pay Dr. Giri\u2019s fee ($2,900) per the Personal Injury Protection (PIP) feature of her auto policy. Rutgers refused and also refused to pay the $10,000 hospital bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">On May 28, 1986 Affrunti filed a complaint against Rutgers to recover her PIP benefits for Dr. Giri\u2019s surgery. On July 23,1986 Rutgers filed an answer and a third-party complaint against Dr. Giri. In its answer Rutgers claimed an obligation to pay only \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d medical expenses. Rutgers claimed, in its action against Dr. Giri, that he operated for a herniated disc at the level below the actual herniated disc. Rutgers\u2019 complaint accused Dr. Giri of \u201cnegligence, carelessness and/or recklessness\u201d in allegedly operating at the wrong level and demanded damages for \u201ccontribution and indemnity.\u201d Rutgers also claimed that Affrunti might \u201cin the future have to undergo surgery again to properly repair the herniated disc that was not properly operated on originally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Nonetheless, the patient\u2019s complaints cleared up quickly postoperatively and no new surgery was required. She had no postoperative complaints or disability according to her testimony at this malicious prosecution trial in July 1992. Dr. Giri\u2019s brief on appeal tells us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The operation which Dr. Giri performed was a left L5-S1 hemilaminectomy and foraminotomy. That operation was a complete success and all of the very serious symptoms which Ms. Affrunti was experiencing prior to the surgery disappeared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\">Due to the fact that Ms. Affrunti had a rare congenital condition whereby she had an extra vertebrae, the incision was at a level other than was intended. However, Dr. Giri was able to accomplish the decompression of the impinged nerve by removing the lamina rather than the disc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">When Dr. Giri was served with the malpractice complaint, he sent it to Medical Inter-Insurance Exchange (MIX), his malpractice carrier. MIX received the complaint on September 8, 1986. About a month later, MIX\u2019s underwriting committee voted to \u201cnon-renew\u201d Dr. Giri\u2019s coverage \u201cbased upon chronically adverse claim experience.\u201d On November 14, 1986 MIX notified Dr. Giri that on February 1, 1987 it would not renew his policy due to expire on January 31, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Meanwhile, in November 1986 Dr. Giri had moved successfully to dismiss Rutgers\u2019 third-party malpractice complaint against him for failure to state a claim under <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e). Rutgers did not appeal. On January 29, 1987 Dr. Giri sued MIX in the Chancery Division for wrongful refusal to renew his coverage and for damages. He claimed that MIX failed to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory provisions when refusing to renew him as of February 1, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">On February 18, 1987 the Chancery Division judge entered an interim order reinstating Dr. Giri\u2019s medical malpractice insurance pending further action by the court. Between February 1 and February 18, 1987, Dr. Giri was not insured and was unable to practice medicine. His contracts with the six hospitals where he performed surgery required him to carry insurance. Dr. Giri claimed that stopping his mostly surgical practice and then starting up again after reinstatement caused considerable economic loss, well beyond the magnitude of simply losing eighteen days operating privileges, due to scheduling and referral considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The Chancery Division judge conducted a trial on six dates between January 19 and June 14, 1988. On November 10, 1988 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the judge issued a written opinion holding that, because of various statutory and regulatory violations, MIX had erred in refusing to renew Dr. Giri\u2019s medical malpractice insurance on February 1, 1987. On November 30, 1988, the judge entered a permanent order reflecting this ruling. The order also transferred Dr. Giri\u2019s remaining claim for damages against MIX to the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">On December 29, 1989 Dr. Giri and MIX settled the damages claim. On January 4, 1990, having \u201camicably adjusted\u201d their differences on the \u201cremaining issues on damages,\u201d they filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice. This stipulation said that Dr. Giri \u201cmay make an application to the court for attorneys fees and costs.\u201d Dr. Giri made this application and, on July 13, 1990, the judge denied it. We affirmed that denial. <em>Giri v. Medical Inter-Insurance Exchange of New Jersey, </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>148, 597 A.2d 561 (App.Div.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">After the dismissal of Rutgers\u2019 third-party malpractice complaint against Dr. Giri on December 5, 1986, he filed this Law Division complaint against Rutgers for malicious civil prosecution on April 15, 1988. On June 24, 1988 Rutgers filed its answer. Recall that the Chancery Division trial of Dr. Giri\u2019s complaint against MIX began on April 18, 1988 and ended on June 14, 1988. Rutgers says it \u201cbecame aware of the pendency of ... [Dr. Giri\u2019s] suit against MIX at some time during the Spring of 1989----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">On July 26, 1990 an order was entered granting Rutgers leave to file a third-party complaint against MIX. As Rutgers notes, its third-party complaint against MIX was primarily \u201cfor the purpose of establishing a credit under the doctrine of Comparative Fault\u201d equal to the \u201cpercentage of wrongdoing attributable to the previously settling [MIX].\u201d Rutgers wanted a jury to determine, and to quantify, a \u201ccomparison\u201d of the alleged wrongdoing of Rutgers vis-a-vis the alleged wrongdoing of MIX, assuming that the wrongdoing of both proximately caused Dr. Giri\u2019s alleged damages resulting from MIX\u2019S temporary non-renewal of his malpractice insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>In its third-party complaint, Rutgers asserted that, if Dr. Giri\u2019s allegations against MIX were true, \u201cMIX\u2019s conduct was the sole proximate cause of ... [Dr. Giri\u2019s] non-renewal and the damages alleged to have been incurred\u201d as a result of MIX\u2019s \u201cdecision to non-renew Dr. Giri\u2019s malpractice policy effective February 1, 1987.\u201d Rutgers demanded either indemnification or contribution from MIX, with regard to Dr. Giri\u2019s claim for \u201cdamages as a result of the improper non-renewal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">On January 25, 1991 an order was entered granting MIX summary judgment dismissing Rutgers\u2019 third-party complaint because MIX had \u201calready settled\u201d all of Dr. Giri\u2019s claims against it. The motion judge stated that the trial judge should decide if the jury, nevertheless, should be asked to determine the percentage of wrongdoing of Rutgers, if any, compared to the percentage of wrongdoing of MIX, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">On July 28, 29 and 30, 1992 a jury trial was conducted on Dr. Giri\u2019s malicious prosecution complaint against Rutgers. On July 30, 1992, at the close of Dr. Giri\u2019s case, Rutgers moved for dismissal under <em>R. </em>4:40-1. For purposes of this motion, Dr. Giri stipulated \u201cthat the special grievance in this case is the cancellation or nonrenewal, discontinuance of [MIX\u2019s] medical malpractice insurance for ... Dr. Narni Giri and ... that this discontinuance prevented him from having admitting privileges in the hospitals ... [in which] he was operating,\u201d and \u201cthat there is no other special grievance that we can point to. ... \u201d Rutgers argued that such a nonrenewal of insurance and consequent loss of income from his practice was not a special grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The trial judge asked Dr. Giri\u2019s attorney whether he agreed that, if <em>any </em>patient treated by Dr. Giri had filed a complaint against him \u201con the same day as the day that Rutgers ... filed its claim against ... [Dr. Giri] alleging negligence or malpractice based on the [same] facts of this case,\u201d would the \u201cresult ... have still been the same?\u201d In other words, regardless of whether it was Rutgers, Affrunti, \u201cor Mrs. Joe Smith\u201d who filed the medical malpractice complaint against Dr. Giri on August 25, 1986, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>MIX have \u201cacted the same,\u201d leading to the \u201csame result,\u201d that is, to MIX\u2019s non-renewal of Dr. Giri\u2019s medical malpractice insurance policy on February 1, 1987? Dr. Giri\u2019s attorney agreed that \u201cany claim\u201d for medical malpractice filed on August 25, 1986, against Dr. Giri would have \u201caffected the insurability or renewability of Dr. Giri\u2019s policy\u201d by MIX in the same way as had Rutgers\u2019 third-party complaint against Dr. Giri for malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">For this reason, the judge concluded that there was no \u201cspecial grievance from the suit filed by Rutgers\u201d because, \u201cfi]f a ... patient [of Dr. Giri\u2019s| had sued him at that [same] time, the same thing would have resulted ... irrespective of what occurred by the filing of this suit [by Rutgers], this action | MIX\u2019s cancellation of Dr. Giri\u2019s medical malpractice insurance] would have occurred whether the [medical malpractice] suit was brought intentionally on the part of Rutgers or the same result would have occurred if the [medical malpractice] suit was brought by a client [a patient of Dr. Giri\u2019s | at that time.\u201d Judgment for Rutgers followed because Dr. Giri had \u201cfailed to prove a special grievance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Dr. Giri claims that \u201chis temporary loss of medical malpractice insurance\u201d and his \u201cconsequential inability to practice medicine\u201d and resultant loss of income, which were \u201ca direct result of the [tjhird [plarty [c]omplaint which Rutgers had previously filed against him,\u201d constituted \u201ca \u2018special grievance\u2019 as required to sustain a claim for malicious prosecution.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Actions for malicious prosecution are not favored causes of action. To succeed in an action for malicious prosecution of a civil suit, the plaintiff must establish that the original suit (1) was instituted without reasonable or probable cause; (2) was motivated by malice; (3) terminated favorably to the plaintiff in the malicious prosecution action; and (4) resulted in a \u201cspecial grievance\u201d to the plaintiff. <em>Mayflower Industries v. Thor Corp., </em>15 <em>N.J.Super. </em>139, 151-52, 83 A.2d 246 (Ch.Div.1951), <em>aff'd, </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>605, 89 A.2d 242 (1952). The absence of any one of these elements is fatal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>Penwag Property Co., Inc. v. </em>Landau, 76 <em>N.J. </em>595, 597-98, 388 A.2d 1265 (1978). <em>Accord Evans v. Prudential Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>652, 660, 559 A.2d 888 (Law Div.1989); <em>Paul v. National Educational </em>Ass\u2019n, 189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>265, 267, 459 A.2d 1213 (Law Div.1983), <em>aff'd, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 480 A.2d 213 (App.Div.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">In <em>Penwag, </em>the Supreme Court observed that \u201cspecial grievance consists of interference with one\u2019s liberty or property,\u201d 76 <em>N.J. </em>at 598, 388 A.2d 1265 (citing <em>Mayflower Industries v. Thor Corp., supra, </em>15 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 151-52, 83 A.2d 246.) Counsel fees and costs of defense of the malicious action are an element of damages in a successful malicious prosecution action. However, they are the routine inconveniences of litigation and \u201cdo not in themselves constitute a special grievance necessary to make out the cause of action.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The \u201cspecial grievance\u201d element is not a requirement in a majority of jurisdictions. But <em>Prosser </em>tells us that \u201ca very large minority protect the malicious litigant\u201d unless his victim can show a special grievance, \u201csuch as interference with his person or property by reason of litigation.\u201d <em>Prosser and Keeton on Torts </em>\u00a7 120 at 889 (5th ed. 1984). On what constitutes a \u201cspecial grievance,\u201d <em>Prosser </em>says that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">[E]ven the restrictive jurisdictions have recognized liability in a large group of exceptional cases in which special injury or grievance is found to exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">The most obvious exception is that of civil actions which are recognized as quasi-criminal in character, or which involve an interference with the person, as in the case of proceedings in lunacy, contempt, bastardy, juvenile delinquency, arrest under civil process, or binding over to keep the peace. But the extension of the remedy has gone even further, and has included proceedings in which there has been interference with property or business, or damage differing in kind from the ordinary burden of defending a lawsuit, such as attachment, garnishment, replevin, the search of premises under a warrant, injunctions, proceedings in bankruptcy, or for the dissolution of a partnership. Even proceedings before an administrative agency have been held to be sufficient, where they result in similar interference, as in the case of one for the suspension of an officer, or for the revocation of a license to do business. Several jurisdictions allow an action of malicious prosecution for any civil suit initiated a second time without ground, where they do not allow it for the first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 890-91 (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>Prosser </em>cites <em>Mayflower Industries, supra, </em>as an example of an injunction which puts a litigant, at least temporarily, out of business as a \u201cspecial grievance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 890 n. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\"><em>Mayflower Industries </em>states that: \u201cPlainly, an injunction which prevented Thor from conducting its business in a particular area and from using, enjoying and dealing with its property, constitutes a special grievance.\u201d <em>Mayflower Industries, supra, </em>15 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 152, 83 A.2d 246. Other examples from our jurisprudence include the appointment of a receiver, obtaining a writ of replevin, filing a <em>Us pendens, </em>or preferment of charges against a police officer which results in suspension. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Dr. Giri alleges that Rutgers\u2019 malicious and unfounded lawsuit put him out of economic action for a substantial period of time, not just for the eighteen days during which he could not operate, but also for the lead and lag time as well, and cost him thousands of dollars. We conclude this was beyond the routine \u201cdamages\u201d in the usual malpractice suit \u2014 the cost and time to defend and the possible blemish to a professional reputation. <em>See Ackerman v. Lagano, </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>468, 412 A.2d 1054 (Law Div.1979); <em>Fielder Agency v. Eldan Construction Comp., </em>152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>344, 351-53, 377 A.2d 1220 (Law Div.1977). We also distinguish the cases finding no special grievance where the malpractice suit only caused increased insurance premiums. <em>See Balthazar v. Dowling, </em>65 Ill.App.3d 824, 22 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>559, 382 N.E.2d 1257 (1978); <em>Butler v. Morgan, </em>590 S.W.2d 543 (Tex.Ct.App.1979). Where the malicious lawsuit actually puts the targeted defendant out of business for a period of time, this constitutes a \u201cspecial grievance,\u201d just the same as a maliciously-procured injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">We disagree with the trial judge\u2019s view that Dr. Giri has no \u201cspecial grievance\u201d here against Rutgers because a legitimate or well-grounded or even questionable malpractice suit would have caused him the same grief. A \u201cspecial grievance\u201d was, in fact, caused to Dr. Giri by this allegedly malicious lawsuit, if Dr. Giri is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>right. That is enough. If the suit against Dr. Giri was instituted without reasonable cause and motivated by malice, this action is maintainable because it drove him out of business, even temporarily-</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">[Sections IV and V of this opinion involving an appeal from sanctions and interlocutory cross-appeals have been redacted for publication purposes. <em>See R. </em>1:36-3.]</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Finally, we turn to Rutgers\u2019 claim that the jury should assess the comparative fault of MIX. On the first day of trial Rutgers asked that the judge permit the jury to assess the \u201ccomparative fault\u201d of Rutgers vis-a-vis MIX with regard to the temporary loss of Dr. Giri\u2019s medical malpractice insurance which resulted in his losing substantial income. Rutgers specifically asked that the jury be permitted to assess a \u201cpercentage of fault\u201d for Rutgers and a \u201cpercentage of fault\u201d for MIX, assuming that the jury concluded that both were a proximate cause of Dr. Giri\u2019s loss-of-income damages. Rutgers wanted its \u201ccredit\u201d for the percentage of fault, if any, attributable to MIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Because MIX had been \u201cremoved from the case by a motion for summary judgment,\u201d the judge said that MIX was \u201cno longer a party\u201d and, inaccurately, was \u201cnot a settling defendant in this case.\u201d The judge ruled: \u201c[T]he statute dealing with comparative negligence talks about the comparative negligence of parties---They\u2019re [MIX] not a party, therefore they are not going to be put on any verdict sheet with regard to liability or damages. That does not preclude you [Rutgers] from arguing proximate cause. If you can show that ... they [MIX] were the ones who proximately caused the damages that Dr. Giri suffered, that\u2019s fine and dandy, but ... they\u2019re not a party, [and] since they\u2019re not a party, I\u2019m not going to have a jury decide their liability in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Rutgers contends that it was entitled to litigate the issue of the \u201ccomparative fault of MIX\u201d for purposes of ascertaining Rutgers\u2019 \u201ccredit\u201d based upon the \u201cwrongdoing of MIX,\u201d if any. MIX <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>agrees that the judge erred in so concluding because, \u201c|u|nder New .Jersey law, juries routinely are permitted to assess the comparative fault of co-tortfeasors even though one or more of the tortfeasors has settled and is no longer a party in the case.\u201d Dr. Giri claims that <em>\u201cN.J.S.A. </em>2A: 15-5.1 1 the Comparative Negligence Act] is not applicable to the instant matter\u201d because, in terminating his medical malpractice insurance, MIX violated various statutes and administrative regulations and, the non-renewal of his insurance, \u201cthough proscribed by law, did not constitute a tort.\u201d Dr. Giri says: \u201cAlthough the applicability of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:lo-5.1 has, as correctly pointed out by Rutgers, been expanded by the courts, its applicability has not been expanded to the point where it would apply to the instant matter. Although the courts have, on occasion, used the term \u2018comparative fault\u2019 when discussing the applicability of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.1, it is clear from those discussions that what is actually meant is the comparative fault of various types of tortfeasors.... Rutgers has cited no cases which stand for the proposition that the alleged fault of a nontortfeasor is subject to comparison pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9p\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.2 does provide that, \u201c]i]n all negligence actions,\u201d the trier of fact shall find the \u201cpercentage of negligence of each party.\u201d We recently observed that the concept of \u201ccomparative negligence\u201d embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.1 and -5.2 extends \u201cbeyond the field of negligence,\u201d and includes the \u201cexpanded concept of comparative fault,\u201d and said that \u201cthe labels attached by the law to various types of conduct should not thwart the principle that it is the overall fault of the parties which is to be measured.\u201d <em>McCann v. Lester, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>601, 609-10, 571 A.2d 1349 (App.Div.1990). More recently, our Supreme Court said that, \u201c[pjursuant to the Comparative Negligence Act, the finder of fact must make an allocation of causative fault between settling and non-settling defendants so that the court can calculate the amount of the credit due the non-settler,\u201d and observed that it could \u201cconceive of no case in which a non-settling co-defendant would not want a credit that reflects the causative fault of a defendant who had settled.\u201d <em>Young v. Latta, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>584, 592, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>596, 589 A.2d 1020 (1991). The federal Court of Appeals has observed that N.J.S.A 2A:15-5.2 \u201cdoes not on its face apply to breach of warranty actions,\u201d and that it was \u201caware of no New Jersey case law applying the comparative negligence statute to breach of warranty actions.\u201d <em>In re Merritt Logan, Inc., </em>901 F.2d 349, 364-65 (3rd Cir.1990). But the Court of Appeals saw \u201cno reason on this record\u201d to disturb the jury\u2019s finding regarding \u201ccomparative fault,\u201d in which the jury found the first defendant 70% at fault \u201cbased on a breach of warranty theory,\u201d and the second defendant 30% at fault \u201cbased on a negligence theory.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cNew Jersey\u2019s law on comparative negligence\u201d notwithstanding, the Court of Appeals said that the jury\u2019s finding on comparative fault could be \u201capplied to a damage award based on both negligence and breach of warranty theories.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Much of this topic is crystallized in our recent opinion in <em>Dunn v. Praiss, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>311, 320-25, 638 A.2d 875 (App.Div.1994). We reverse and remand on this point for reconsideration in light of that case. We conclude that apportionment of fault or misconduct is appropriate for the jury\u2019s determination if Rutgers\u2019 malicious civil prosecution, if proved to a jury, combined with MIX\u2019S either breach of contract, or breach of a regulatory duty, or both, are found to have caused Dr. Giri\u2019s damage. Of course, the basic causation issue is for the jury, as is the percentage apportionment, if both contributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Reversed and remanded on the appeal; reversed in part and affirmed in part on the cross-appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
