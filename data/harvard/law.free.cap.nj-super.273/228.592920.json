(Trico) after the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. The sole issue presented to the Law Division judge was whether an attorney review clause was required in a contract for the sale of real estate sold pursuant to a private auction.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">After considering the parties\u2019 briefs and entertaining oral argument, Law Division Judge Travis L. Francis concluded in a written opinion that an attorney review clause was not required under these circumstances. <em>Bassford v. Trico Mortgage Co., Inc., </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>379, 641 A.2d 1132 (Law Div.1993). We affirm essentially for the reasons stated by Judge Francis in his opinion, but add the following comments in view of the issues presented by Bassford on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">The Law Division judge was correct in concluding that there was no genuine issue of fact presented by the certifications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>filed in the case. Bassford\u2019s failure to reply to the Trico representative\u2019s certification, stating that it was the Trico representative who supervised the completion of the form contract, can fairly be interpreted as a concession by Bassford that he had assumed incorrectly that a representative of the auction company was the one who performed that function. Thus, we are satisfied that the Sheldon Good &amp; Company representative, who must by definition be a licensed broker or a salesman, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:15-1 <em>et seq., </em>acted solely as an auctioneer and not a preparer of the contract as contemplated by <em>Calvert v. K. Hovnanian at Galloway IV, Inc., </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>518, 589 A.2d 1049 (App.Div.1991), <em>aff'd, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>37, 607 A.2d 156 (1992). Because the Trico representative who supervised Bassford\u2019s completion of the contract was not a licensed real estate broker or salesman, we need not decide whether licensed real estate brokers or salesmen acting as auctioneers are exempt from the provisions of <em>New Jersey State Bar Ass\u2019n v. New Jersey Ass\u2019n of Realtor Boards, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391, 452 A.2d 1323 (Ch.Div.1982), <em>aff'd as modified, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>470, 461 A.2d 1112 (1983), when they participate in the completion of a contract executed by a successful bidder at an auction sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">We reject Bassford\u2019s alternative argument, advanced in his reply brief, that we should come to the same result as the <em>Calvert </em>court did even though the Trico employee was not a licensed real estate salesperson because the \u201csame concerns\u201d exist under these circumstances as existed in <em>Calvert. </em>It must be remembered that the rationale that undergirded the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the <em>New Jersey State Bar Ass\u2019n </em>case was to regulate the unauthorized practice of law by real estate brokers and salespersons. <em>New Jersey State Bar Ass\u2019n v. New Jersey Ass\u2019n of Realtor Boards, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>470, 472-73, 461 A.2d 1112 (1983). Bassford cites no authority, and we can find none, for the proposition that a company employee, such as Trico\u2019s employee in this case, is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law simply by overseeing the completion of a form contract where the information to be inserted in the contract is for the most part dictated by the amount of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>successful bid, and where the terms for payment of the balance of the purchase price are selected by the bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
