The consequence of filing a joint state return is that plaintiffs\u2019 aggregate income is subject to a higher tax rate. The Tax Court judge, Judge Lario, granted summary judgment to the State, finding that the provisions of the statute at issue were reasonably related to a legitimate governmental purpose. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:8-3.1c, married persons filing a joint federal tax return must also file a joint New Jersey return. Effective January 1, 1991 (A. 1990, c. 61, \u00a7 12), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:2-la and b, provide for different tax rates applicable to \u201cmarried individuals filing a joint return\u201d (subsection a) and \u201cmarried individuals filing separately\u201d (subsection b).

After taking all \u201cproper deductions and exemptions,\u201d their New Jersey gross income tax liability under <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:2-la was $946.

Plaintiffs label as unconstitutional any scheme which measures, for income-tax purposes, one spouse\u2019s income by reference to the other spouse\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Federal equal protection analysis employs different tiers of review. <em>Drew Assocs. of NJ, LP v. Travisano, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>249, 258, 584 A.2d 807 (1991). When legislation regulates a fundamental right, or disparately treats a suspect class, it is subject to strict scrutiny. <em>Ibid. See also, State v. Bulu, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>331, 343, 560 A.2d 1250 (App.Div.1989). Legislation which regulates a semi-suspect classification or affects a fundamental right in an indirect manner is subject to intermediate scrutiny; it must be shown that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the legislation serves an important governmental objective and is substantially related to the achievement of that objective. <em>Craig v.

Berman, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>137, 145, 611 A.2d 1119 (App.Div.1992). The rational-basis standard demands that the legislative act be \u201cdevoid of unreasonableness and arbitrariness and that means selected for fulfillment of policy bear a \u2018real and substantial relation\u2019 to that end[.]\u201d <em>Drew Assocs., </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>at 259, 584 A.2d 807 (quoting <em>Katobimar Realty Co. v. Webster, </em>20 <em>N.J. </em>114, 123, 118 A.2d 824 (1955)). Stated differently, the question is whether there is any conceivable state of facts which would afford a rational basis for the classification. <em>McKenney v. Byrne, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>304, 316, 412 A.2d 1041 (1980). The \u201cequal protection safeguard is offended \u2018only if the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State\u2019s objective\u2019 \u201d. <em>New Jersey State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 146, 611 A.2d 1119 (quoting <em>McGowan v.

Also, the rational-basis standard \u201cis the functional equivalent of the due-process requirements of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.\u201d <em>Drew Assocs., </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>at 258, 584 A.2d 807. Thus, while the equal protection and due-process clauses protect against different evils, analysis under both clauses may overlap. <em>Id. </em>at 258-59, 584 A.2d 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Plaintiffs argue that the strict scrutiny test should be employed because married persons are a suspect class. We disagree. Government regulations affecting marriage are not subject to strict scrutiny simply because the right to marry is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>fundamental right. <em>Zablocki v. Redhail, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>374, 386-87, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>673, 681, 54 L.Ed.2d 618, 631 (1978); <em>Califano v. Jobst, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>47, 53-54, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>95, 99-100, 54 L.Ed.2d 228, 235 (1977). The government may impose a reasonable regulation on marriages so long as the regulation does not significantly interfere with decisions to marry. <em>Zablocki, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>at 386-87, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 681, 54 L.Ed.2d at 631. Only where the regulation presents a \u201cdirect\u201d obstacle to marriage will the court apply a strict scrutiny standard. <em>Mapes v. United States, </em>576 F.2d 896, 901, 217 <em>Ct.Cl. </em>115 (Ct.Cl.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 <em>U.S. </em>1046, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>722, 58 L.Ed.2d 705 (1978). <em>See also, Druker v.

At most, the provisions impose an indirect burden suffered not from marrying, but \u201cfrom marrying one in a particular income group.\u201d <em>Mapes, </em>576 <em>F.2d </em>at 901. And, while that direct burden may, to some extent, affect the choice whether to marry, it leaves the ultimate choice to the individual. <em>Druker, </em>697 F.2d at 50. We are, therefore, satisfied that the rational-basis, rather than the strict scrutiny standard, applies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">We agree with Judge Lario that the rational-basis test is satisfied here. The federal equal-protection clause does not require that government treat all persons identically; it requires that differences in treatment of persons similarly situated be justified by appropriate state interest. <em>Taxpayers Ass\u2019n of Weymouth Tp. v.

Const, </em>art. VIII, \u00a7 1, 117, a legitimate governmental goal. <em>See Domenick v. Director, Div. of Tax., </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>121, 130, 422 A.2d 443 (App.Div.1980). The legislative history of the 1990 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:2-1 establishes that the purpose of the two-rate schedules created by the amendment was to raise approximately $1.25 billion to \u201cfund programs which provide permanent property tax reform.\u201d <em>Assembly Appropriations Committee Statement for Assembly Bills </em>3607 and 3609, <em>L. </em>1990, c. 61. The act upon which the amendment was a part was intended as a broad revision of the tax laws, aimed at providing \u201cproperty tax relief to homeowners and residential tenants\u201d; it combined changes to the homestead rebate program, increased the tax rates, and provided for \u201cseparate rate schedules designated by filing status, in order to make that tax more consistent with taxpayers\u2019 ability to pay.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Clearly, the changes, individually and collectively, are reasonably related to the State\u2019s goal of reducing property tax burdens.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The question is whether the requirement that joint state returns be filed when federal joint returns are filed has a rational nexus with the goal the State seeks to achieve. Stated differently, the question is whether there is any conceivable state of facts which would afford a rational basis for the classification. <em>McKenney, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 316, 412 A.2d 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The State argues that the higher tax rates imposed on some married couples as a result of filing joint returns may be justified in terms of the reduced total costs associated with married couples <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>who typically share living expenses and thus have more disposable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">While the State\u2019s assertion may have merit, it is not necessary that we endorse it in order to sustain the statutory scheme. We have held that \u201csuch factors as the ability to pay, degree of benefit ... and <em>administrative convenience </em>may well\u201d be legitimate factors in making classifications and drawing lines under a taxation statute. <em>New Jersey State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 147, 611 A.2d 1119 (emphasis added). Hei'e, the \u201cadministrative convenience\u201d of having New Jersey taxpayers use the same filing status as they use when filing their federal tax returns would presumably increase uniformity in revenue-collecting procedures between the state and federal government. In fact, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:2-1 expressly states that, for income-tax purposes, New Jersey adopts the same measure of a \u201ctaxable year\u201d as utilized by the federal government. Further, the State advises us that the IRS and New Jersey\u2019s Division of Taxation share auditing information. Thus, if taxpayers are required to use the same filing status for federal and state income taxes, the auditing process for both taxing agencies is more effective. In our view, this administrative convenience alone justifies the Legislature\u2019s classification by marital status.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The fact that there may be an adverse tax consequence to some married couples arising from the marital-status classification does not render the tax scheme irrational. In the area of economics, a state does not violate equal protection \u201cmerely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect.\u201d <em>Dan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>dridge v.

So long as the law has a reasonable basis, it will not offend the federal constitution \u201csimply because the classification \u2018is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397 <em>U.S. </em>485, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1161, 25 L.Ed.2d at 501-02 (quoting <em>Lindsley v.

Kentucky, </em>309 <em>U.S. </em>83, 88, 60 <em>S.Ct. </em>406, 408, 84 <em>L.Ed. </em>590, 593 (1940):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">It has ... been pointed out that in taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification. Since the members of a legislature necessarily enjoy a familiarity with local conditions which this Court cannot have, the presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by the most explicit demonstration that a classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination against particular persons and classes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\"><em>See also, New Jersey State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 146-47, 611 A.2d 1119; <em>New Jersey State League of Municipalities v. State of New Jersey, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 518-20, 608 A.2d 965 (App.Div.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Consequently, the fact that a state\u2019s statutory classification may be \u201cimperfect and imprecise\u201d as applied to some married couples, does not justify its invalidation. <em>Mapes, </em>576 F.2d at 903. There simply cannot be a \u201cmarriage-neutral tax system,\u201d and thus tax discrepancies will no doubt exist no matter how the rates are structured or classifications drawn. <em>Id. </em>at 904. The judiciary is not equipped, nor should it be inclined to tinker with taxpayer classification or rate-fixing decisions, reposed exclusively in the legislative branch. <em>Druker, </em>697 <em>F.</em>2d at 50. For these reasons, other state courts have sustained tax provisions which resulted in enhanced tax liability to married couples. <em>See Klein v. Iowa Dep\u2019t of Revenue &amp; Finance, </em>451 <em>N.W. </em>2d 837, 842-43 (Iowa) (Iowa statute requiring spouses filing separate state returns to use standard deductions if either chooses to do so does not violate equal protection), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>852, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>145, 112 L.Ed.2d 111 (1990); <em>Roberts v.

Tax Comm\u2019n of Wisconsin, </em>284 <em>U.S. </em>206, 52 <em>S.Ct. </em>120, 76 <em>L.Ed. </em>248 (1931), for the proposition that a two tax-rate system which effectively measures one spouse\u2019s income by reference to the other spouse is a violation of federal due process and equal protection. In <em>Hoeper, </em>a married taxpayer challenged a Wisconsin law which required that a spouse\u2019s separate income be aggregated for income-tax purposes. 284 <em>U.S. </em>at 212-13, 52 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 121, 76 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 249-50. The combined incomes were taxed at a higher rate than the rate applicable to the spouses\u2019 income were they to file separately. <em>Ibid. </em>In striking down the law, a majority of the Court stated that \u201cany attempt by a state to measure the tax on one person\u2019s property or income by reference to the property or income of another is contrary to due process of law.\u201d 284 <em>U.S. </em>at 215, 52 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 122, 76 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 251. The Court noted its particular disapproval of Wisconsin\u2019s practice of taxing \u201cas a joint income that which under [Wisconsin\u2019s] law is owned separately\u201d in order to secure a higher income-tax revenue. 284 <em>U.S. </em>at 216, 52 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 122, 76 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The Court of Claims in <em>Mapes </em>questioned the continued viability of the majority opinion in <em>Hoeper. See </em>576 F.2d at 902. In any event, <em>Hoeper </em>may be distinguished. The Wisconsin law in <em>Hoe-per </em>provided no alternative to that of taxation combined income; in the New Jersey statutory scheme married taxpayers have a choice. If they choose to file separately for purposes of their federal tax return, they may file separately for state income-tax purposes and thus avail themselves of the potentially lower state tax rates. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:2-lb. However, if they choose to file a joint federal return, they presumably will receive some federal tax benefit, but must file a joint state return. The point is that it is their choice to make.
