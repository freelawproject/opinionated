Writ dated July 1, 1901.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-10\">At the trial in the Superior Court before <em>Hitchcock, </em>J., it appealed, that the property was delivered originally by the defendant to the plaintiff at No. 4 Alexander Street in that part of Boston called Dorchester, and afterwards was removed by the plaintiff to No. 123 Blue Hill Avenue in that part of Boston called Roxbury, without the knowledge or consent of the defendant before it was so removed. There was put in evidence an instrument purporting to be a copy of the lease-which was sent by the defendant to the plaintiff at the address 123 Blue Hill Avenue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-11\">The contract contained the provisions in regard to the removal of the property which are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-12\">The defendant requested the judge to rule as follows : <em>\u201c </em>If the plaintiff removed the property from No. 4 Alexander Street, Dorchester, without the consent of the defendant in writing he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>thereby forfeited all right to said goods, and to further use of the same, and to all moneys paid, and the defendant would have the right to enter into and upon any premises occupied by him, and remove the goods without notice or demand, and without being deemed guilty of any trespass or wrong, and without being liable for appropriating the property to its own use.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-3\">The judge refused to make this ruling and gave other instructions one of which is quoted in the opinion.

It does not seem to be in dispute that the defendant subsequently took the goods from the plaintiff for an alleged breach of one of the conditions contained in the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The lease provided for the payment of $15 down and a monthly payment of $8. thereafter ; that the articles were to be used at \u201cNo. 4 Alexander Street in Dorchester,\u201d and that the vendee should not remove them or any of them from that place without the written consent of the defendant; and, further, that if the vendee failed to pay the rent thereinbefore stipulated, or if he removed the articles from said place, or sold them, under-let them, or suffered them \u201c to be attached, mortgaged, damaged or injured, . . .\u201d he thereby forfeited all right to the goods and to any further use of them \u201c and to all moneys paid.\u201d The title in the goods was to remain in the vendor until the price was fully paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">One of the rulings made by the court was that \u201c The removal of the goods from No. 4 Alexander Street was at most a default by the plaintiff in the performance of the conditions of the lease, which the defendant could not take advantage of by retaking the goods under the lease, except after a demand in writing, in accordance with Chapter 198, \u00a7 13, of the Revised Laws, thirty days at least before so retaking the goods, anything to the contrary in the lease notwithstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">The main question is whether the statute provision that thirty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>days before taking possession a statement of the amount due shall be furnished, and a demand for the payment thereof made, by the vendor, applies where the breach relied on is the wrongful removal of the articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\">It seems to have been assumed at the trial that R. L. c. 198, \u00a7 13, was in force at the time of the taking, and hence the ruling refers to it. Inasmuch, however, as the writ is dated July 1, 1901, and the Revised Laws were not in force until January 1, 1902, it is plain that the judge really had reference to the statute which in substance was re-enacted in the section mentioned in the instruction given. The statute was St. 1898, c. 545, and we therefore consider the ruling as referring to that.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The legislation upon the subject is to be found in St. 1881, c. 222; Pub. Sts. c. 192, \u00a7 13; St. 1884, c. 313, \u00a7 2; St. 1892, c. 411; and St. 1898, c. 545. We do not deem it necessary to recite in detail these various statutes. A careful consideration of the language of St. 1898, c. 545, especially when considered in the light of the previous legislation, leads us to the conclusion that the provision for a thirty days\u2019 notice and demand applies only where the breach relied upon is default in the payment of money. The instruction therefore was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The judge rightly refused to give the instruction requested by the defendant. If the jury believed the evidence tending to show that after the goods were removed from Alexander Street to Blue Hill Avenue the defendant gave to the plaintiff an instrument purporting to be a copy of the lease, sending the same to him at his address at the latter place, they might well have found a waiver by the defendant of the condition of the original lease with reference to removal, so far at least as respected the removal to the latter place.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
