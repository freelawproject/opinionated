To have a suitable and respectable place of public worship with convenient <em>accomodation </em>for Bible and Sunday \u25a0School classes, and one or more tenements for the <em>accomodation </em>of the Minister and Sexton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-6\">\u201c The Minister to be employed to preach in said house or to be let at a reasonable rent towards keeping the premises insured \u25a0and in repair and supporting the Minister aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-7\">\u201c Second. To have a Minister whose religious views shall substantially harmonize with what are denominated to be Evangelical in their character who shall be endowed with respectable powers of intellect and be as <em>faith\\full, </em>pious and devoted <em>labourer </em>in the work of <em>teach </em>and preaching the word of God.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-8\">\u201c Third. It is my wish and intention by this bequest to form an important auxiliary in the missionary enterprise of preaching and <em>minintering to </em>the destitute in the city, and to those who do not feel sufficient interest in sacred things to attend upon the preaching of other ministers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-9\">\u201c The Trusts, therefore, upon which said estate is to be held by said devises and trustees are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-10\">\u2022\u201c In the first place, That they shall

Union Church as shall be designated by said church, and two deacons of the Mission Chapel Church recently organized, and their respective successors for the time being or of a major part of them, and shall allow said four deacons to obtain insurance upon said buildings in the name of said trustees and the said deacons, and to cause the same to be kept constantly insured to a reasonable amount, and in case of loss or damage by fire shall allow said deacons to recover said insurance money, and to apply the same according to their best discretion in repairing or rebuilding said building, as the case may be, in the name of said trustees, but without charge to them and permit said deacons from such insurance or other monies forever to keep and maintain upon said premises a house of public worship and tenements connected therewith as large and convenient as the same now standing thereon are.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-3\">\u201c In the next place, That said trustees shall forever suffer and permit that portion of said premises designed for the purposes of public worship to be occupied at all reasonable and proper times for public worship under the charge and ministration of a Minister of the Gospel who has been regularly ordained or set-apart according to the usages of the denomination of Christians with which he may be connected and whose religious sentiments and opinions shall substantially conform to those now <em>gennerally </em>known and understood as Evangelical.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-4\">\u201c And further that said trustees shall suffer and permit the parts of said building designed for the use and accommodation of the <em>sabbath </em>and Bible classes to be occupied

and permit the house to be occupied free from rent or charge by any decent and orderly person who may resort thither for the purpose of attending worship at all times under such reasonable regulations

the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>deacons shall be reasonably sufficient for his convenience so long as he shall be employed by them as such minister and upon such terms as-they shall judge expedient having proper reference to the use of such tenement as a means of support and encouragement of such minister.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-3\">\u201c And shall permit said deacons in the name of said trustees to let such other portions of the said estate as they may judge best upon reasonable rents and collect and apply the same in keeping the premises in repair in paying the contingent expenses in conducting and <em>manageing </em>the same and in causing the same to be insured and appropriate and apply the surplus if any towards the support of the minister.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-4\">\u201c And further shall suffer and permit said deacons in the name of said trustees to commence, and carry on to final judgment all necessary and proper suits or actions at law or in equity to enable them to manage and control said estate as hereinbefore expressed, to collect the rents thereof or remove the tenants thereof when the same shall be necessary and generally to do whatever acts or things may be necessary or proper to effect and carry out the true interest and meaning of the trusts aforesaid and accomplish the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-5\">\u201c And whenever the said deacons or a major part of them shall <em>shall </em>with the approbation of the Mission Chapel Church judge it expedient to terminate the engagement of any minister who may have been employed to officiate in said house of public worship it shall be competimf for them so to do and they may thereupon proceed to select another in his stead in <em>in </em>manner .aforesaid and if approved as aforesaid to employ him accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-6\">\"And I further give bequeath and devise unto said trustees the sum a twenty thousand dollars to be by said

upon personal notes or bonds secured by a first mortgage of real estate or full and ample value not exceeding one halfe of, its appraised value to render the loan thereon safe and undoubted in no case is any part of the money to be so loaned on personal notes or bonds if the first named class of securities can be obtained. The fund on no condition to be reduced below the amount devised.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>\u201c In the event of the necessity of loaning a part or the whole of said fund on real estate, the appraisal of the same shall be made by three disinterec? and competcmi judges of such estate of which value not more than one half shall consist of buildings thereon, the interest thereon and income thereof, shall be semiannually collected and applied by said trustee towards defraying the expenses of maintain a minister and public worship as hereinabove expressed or if it shall become necessary may apply the principal toward rebuilding said house if destroyed, nor are said trustees to be held responsa&amp;Ze for the loss of any part of said principie or interest provided the same shall be invested and applied by said trustees, nor are they to be subjected to any charge or cost on account of the same nor on account of any suit or action which may be necessary to bring to collect or recover said fund or the interest thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-3\">\u201c It is my further direction and devise that there should be kept and maintained in connection with the Mission Chapel aforesaid an Industrial School for children of poor parents in the City of Worcester who in the judgment of said trustees may be fit objects to share in the benefits thereof, said school to be taught on some day or days in the week and devoted to instruction in <em>kniting, </em>sewing <em>makeing </em>garments and such other domestic arts as in the judgment of those in charge of the school can be usefully and properly taught in such a school as well as to the inculcation of moral duties, the cultivation of good manners and the social intellectual and moral elevation of its pupil.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-4\">\u201c And to enable said trustees to provide a portion of the means for carrying on said school and furnishing if need be to deserving destitute children who may regularly attend said school some parts of their necessary clothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-5\">\u201c I direct that the sum of five thousand dollars in addition to what I have above given for the purpose of said Chapel be paid to be held and managed by the same persons, as are to hold and manage the trusts in respect to said chapel.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b559-6\"><em>J. S. Gf-duld, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b559-7\"><em>C. M. Thayer, (Q. A. Hamilton </em>with him,) for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Knowlton, C. J.</p>\n<p id=\"ASts\">The first question of importance between the plaintiff and the' defendants is whether the will gives the plaintiff, as trustee, a right to control the disposition and man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>agemenfc of the property of which it holds the title, or whether the deacons referred to in the will can act independently of the holder of the title in all matters involved in the care, custody and management of the property. Looking first to the real estate devised, we think it pretty plain that the deacons are to act independently in a relation of trust, in all the matters of which, under the will, they are to have the management. Although the first statement of the trust under which the plaintiff holds the property, requires the plaintiff to \u201c suffer and permit \u201d the estate \u201c to be under the care custody and management \u201d of the deacons designated, the language is imperative, and gives these deacons authority in the management of the trust estate, of which the corporation cannot deprive them. Their relation to the scheme of the testator is similar to that of the managers of the library in <em>Cary Library </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>151 Mass. 364, and the selectmen and ministers under the will of Dr. Franklin, as appears in the suit of <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>184 Mass. 373. As managers they stand in a relation of trust to the property whose legal title is held by another as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\">The legacy of $5,000 given for the support of an industrial school, is bythe express terms of the will, \u201c to be held and managed by the same persons, as are to hold and manage the trusts in respect to said chapel.\u201d The powers and duties of the deacons in regard to this legacy are similar to their powers and duties in regard to the chapel. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">There is more room for doubt about the legacy of $20,000 given to defray \u201cthe expenses of maintaining a minister and public worship,\u201d and if necessary to be applied \u201c toward rebuilding said house if destroyed.\u201d In making this gift the testator does not in terms refer to the deacons as managers; but this is one of the trusts in respect to the chapel, mentioned in a later clause, and in reference to the methods of management it is there put in the same clause with the devise of the real estate, and is spoken of as held and managed by the same persons. The close connection of this legacy with the devise of the real estate brings us to the conclusion that the testator intended the three gifts to be held and managed by the same persons. We are therefore of opinion that the first three propositions embodied in the order and decree of the Probate Court establishing the respective rights of the plaintiff and of the deacons in the three gifts are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Ifc is also plain that the directions in the will as to the investment of the fund of $20,000 should be literally followed by the trustees, as declared in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The fifth and sixth of the instructions stated in the decree, are also correct. The requirements there stated are just and equitable, and in accordance with the decisions of this court. <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>16 Mass. 361. <em>New England Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>140 Mass. 532, 534. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Littlefield, </em>151 Mass. 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The plaintiff objects to the finding stated in the decree as a preliminary to the substantive parts of the decree, that \u201cthe trusts were established for the benefit of Memorial Church and an industrial school to be maintained therewith,\u201d and' contends that they were established for the benefit of people in Worcester who would enjoy their privileges. Undoubtedly they were established for the benefit of the people; but as the church and the school are public charitable institutions which are acting as agencies in dispensing the charity, it is not incorrect to say that the trusts are for the benefit of these institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The plaintiff, in its bill, asked the court to give instructions as to whether the proper parties were joined in the suit. This is not a proper subject for instructions, but is proper for determination as a part of the procedure in the case. The finding, \u201cThat all necessary parties have been joined as respondents to the petition,\u201d stated as a preliminary in the decree, is unnecessary ; but as it appears before that which is ordered and decreed, it is not so irregular as to call for a change of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The objection to the fifth instruction is now waived as it is agreed that a loss has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">We perceive no such inconsistency between the present decree and the former decrees of the Probate Court in reference to this trust as should preclude the court from giving these instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
