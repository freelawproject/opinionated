The judge allowed the plaintiffs to amend their declaration by adding a second count upon an ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>count stated, alleging an accounting together on March 23,1903, and a balance of $500 then found due to the plaintiffs. It was agreed that the services rendered, which were declared upon in the first count, were the subject of the interview between the parties set forth in detail in the auditor\u2019s report, and the plaintiffs stated that the second count involved no other or different claim for services than the items contained in the first count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-5\">It was contended by the defendant that the plaintiffs having pleaded an account stated, for the same cause of action as the account annexed, and the defendant having admitted the account stated and having consented to judgment thereon, no judgment could be rendered upon the first count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-6\">It was agreed that the case should be submitted on the pleadings and the auditor\u2019s report, and that the judge might order a verdict for the amount of $527.17 or for the other amount of $2,317.97.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-7\">The judge thereupon ordered a verdict for the sum of $500 with interest from March 23,1903, amounting in all to $527.17; and, at the plaintiffs\u2019 request, reported the case for determination by this court.

It is difficult to see how either party could contradict what both had alleged in pleading. See <em>Snowling </em>v. <em>Plummer Granite Co. </em>108 Mass. 100, 101. There was no allegation in pleading on the part of the plaintiffs that this mutual settlement was void for fraud on the part of the defendant, nor does the report show that such a contention was made at the trial. The case was submitted on the pleadings and the auditor\u2019s report with the agreement that the presiding judge might order a verdict for the amount of the sum agreed between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>the parties on March 23, 1903, with interest, or for the amount of $2,317.97, which represented the whole demand sued for, with interest. The auditor\u2019s report set forth a detailed statement of the interview of March 23, 1903, which the auditor\u2019s report states as the testimony before him of one of the plaintiffs. That evidence tends 'to show that the parties agreed upon a settlement by the payment of the sum of $500 by the defendant to the plaintiffs and the passing of receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">When that sum was proposed the defendant said he would give a check on the spot, and there is no doubt that the plaintiffs expected him to make payment in that way when they acceded to a settlement for that sum. Because neither party had a blank check on the defendant\u2019s bank he did not give a check on the spot. But the evidence tended to show also that for a number of days thereafter the plaintiffs expected to receive the check and that the defendant made other promises to send it, and that four days before suing out the writ the plaintiffs notified the defendant that unless they received the check by a certain day they would sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Upon the terms of the report we think the verdict must stand unless as matter of law the presiding judge was bound to order a verdict for the larger sum, or unless, in other words, the evidence showed conclusively that the settlement was a conditional one, or that the defendant procured it by fraud. In our opinion it cannot be ruled upon the evidence, as matter of law, either that the settlement was conditional, or that the defendant procured it by a fraudulent promise to give a check on the spot.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
