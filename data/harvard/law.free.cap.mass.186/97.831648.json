At the close of the evidence the defendant requested the judge to direct a verdict for the defendant on the grounds that, as matter of law, the plaintiff\u2019s keeping his hand in the door jamb until it was crushed was not due care and legally contributed to causing the plaintiff\u2019s injury, and that there was no evidence to warrant a finding that the conductor knew, or ought to have known, that the plaintiff\u2019s thumb was in a place of danger and that therefore there was no sufficient evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-9\">The judge refused to rule as requested.

The plaintiff was a passenger on a surface car of the de* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>fendanfc railway, on a cold day in December. The glass of the windows was so coated with frost that a person on the inside could not see out through them. The plaintiff wished to stop at the street next beyond Joiner Street, and supposing that the car had passed Joiner Street he gave a signal to the conductor to stop at the next street. As the car came to a standstill he got up from his seat and walked back toward the door, which the conductor had opened. He then saw that the car had stopped at Joiner Street, and said to the conductor that he had made a mistake; that he did not want to get off there, but at the next stopping place, and he put out his hand against the jamb-of the doorway, about half way up, with his thumb in the \u201cslot in which the door slides,\u201d to support himself against a sudden starting up of the car as it had \u201c stopped unusually sudden.\u201d Thereupon the conductor, who was standing on the platform on the same level as the floor of the car, and who saw the plaintiff\u2019s thumb in the slot of the door, or, if he had exercised due care would have seen it there, \u201c got into a fit of rage,\u201d slammed the door on to the plaintiff\u2019s thumb with an oath, and caused the injury here complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The defendant\u2019s contention is that there was no need for the plaintiff\u2019s putting his thumb in the slot. But it is plain that a passenger, in the exercise of due care, can grasp something to' steady himself against being thrown back and forth by the car\u2019s starting forward suddenly. The jury were warranted in finding that this passenger had reason to suppose that this car might start forward suddenly, and that there was not anything else which gave this plaintiff a means of so steadying himself except grasping the slot.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The jury were warranted in finding that the conductor knew, or, if he had exercised due care would have known, that the plaintiff\u2019s thumb was in the slot. There was evidence that he was standing facing the plaintiff, not more than twelve inches away from him, and that the plaintiff\u2019s hand was about opposite his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The custom which exists in England of having the doors of railway carriages on steam railroads shut by the guard from the outside just before the train starts, makes the English cases relied on by the defendant of no value here.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
