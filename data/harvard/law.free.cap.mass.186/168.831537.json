L. c. 82, \u00a7 16, to prove constancy in that accusation on the part of the complainant.</headnotes>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AryW\"><em>J. P.

The question was in these words, \u201cIs he the father of this child?\u201d The objection to the question was not because it was leading but because it was incompetent. The defendant now contends that the question was incompetent because a witness can testify to the facts which go to prove a conclusion but not to the conclusion itself, citing <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>168 Mass. 45, and <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. Pollock, 170 Mass. 441, and further contending that the affirmative answer was not evidence of an accusation under R. L. c. 82, \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">In <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Atkins </em>the question excluded was a question of law as to the defendant\u2019s legal authority. In <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. Pollock, the questions excluded involved more matter of opinion and judgment than of fact. The question admitted in the case at bar does not fall very closely within either of these classes. However this may be the question and answer constituted when the answer was given an accusation of paternity, which Under R. L. c. 82, \u00a7 16, was competent to prove constancy in such accusation on the part of the complainant, and the bill of exceptions does not show that it was not admitted for that purpose. See <em>Burns </em>v. Donoghue, 185 Mass. 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
