There is no ambiguity as to the subject matter of the contract. By the sixth article of the contract the plaintiff was to receive \u201c as full compensation for any and all services to be performed by him \u201d a commission of twenty per cent of the purchase price of each of the defendant\u2019s vehicles or parts or equipment thereof sold by the defendant on orders secured by the plaintiff. It does not appear that the defendant sold anything upon orders procured by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The purpose of the offer of proof was to introduce into the contract a warranty that its machines should possess certain qualities of speed; capacity and desirability. There is no warranty to be found in the contract, and a warranty cannot be imported into a contract by parol evidence. <em>Lamb </em>v. Crafts, 12 Met. 353. <em>Frost </em>v.
