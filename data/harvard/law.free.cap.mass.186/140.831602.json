L. c. 102, \u00a7 53,) and if the mortgage is at a greater rate of interest than eighteen per cent per annum and does not comply with the requirements of that statute it is wholly void. <em>Whether </em>iu such a case the furniture in the rooms used by the boarders is \u201chousehold furniture \u201d within the meaning of the statute above cited as it would be for the purpose of exemption from taxation to the amount of $1,000 under R.

Writ in the Police Court of Lynn dated August 22, 1898.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-10\">The answer alleged that the instrument relied upon by the plaintiff was void because it was executed as a mortgage of household furniture made to secure a loan on which interest was charged at a rate exceeding eighteen per cent per annum and did not state with substantial accuracy either the rate of interest to be paid or the actual expense of making and securing the loan as required by St. 1892, c. 428, \u00a7 3.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-11\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Stevens, </em>J., without a jury. He found that the instrument in question was a mortgage of household furniture and was void because it was in violation of St. 1892, c. 428, \u00a7 3. He found for the defendants, assessed the damages in the sum of $1, and ordered that judgment be entered for a return of the goods. At the request of the plaintiff he reported the case for determination by this court. If his finding was correct, judgment was to be entered on the finding; otherwise-, judgment was to be entered for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-12\"><em>It.

L. c. 102, \u00a7 53. We are of opinion that the whole mortgage was made void by its being included in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">It is not necessary to consider whether the doctrine applied to the exemption from taxation of household furniture to the amount of |1,000 in <em>Day </em>v. Lawrence, 167 Mass. 371, applies to R. L. c. 102, \u00a7 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The only doubt we have had is whether the finding made by the presiding judge can be supported on the ground above stated or whether it must be taken to have been a finding that all the furniture was household furniture. <em>We </em>are of opinion that it may be construed to be the former, and that it need not be taken to be only the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">\n<em>Judgment on the finding.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
