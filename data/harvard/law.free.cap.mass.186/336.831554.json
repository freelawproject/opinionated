I give and bequeath to my nephew George Wilner and to my niece Clara Marsh (maiden name Wilner)' wife of William H. Marsh, all of the residue of my property, both real and personal and mixed after the within named legacies are paid. Should George Wilner die without issue, it is my will that his part of this last named legacy shall be divided equally among my heirs. Should my niece Clara Marsh die and her husband should survive her, then it is my will that her portion of the last named legacy shall go to her husband. After his decease to go to his children. If he should leave no children then it shall be divided equally among my heirs.\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>If no modification of the first sentence of this paragraph is made by the context, the words used import and are ample to give to each a fee simple as tenants in common.

Sts. c. 92, \u00a7 5. <em>Leland </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>9 Gray, 171. <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Lincoln, </em>107 Mass. 590. <em>Crossman </em>v. <em>Field, </em>119 Mass. 170. <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>140 Mass. 92, 100. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>183 Mass. 251. <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Dana, </em>185 Mass. 156, 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">But if the whole article is to be construed to give effect if possible to every part, the language used differs in its reference to each devisee, and a construction which disposes of one branch of the title may not be found sufficient to define the nature and extent of the other, and the first inquiry presented is to what extent the words \u201cshould George Wilner die without issue . . . his part of this . . . legacy shall be divided equally among my heirs,\u201d qualify and limit the estate given to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The primary object of the testator was to make provision for his unmarried nephew, and he may properly have considered that if he married and had issue they should take in succession and enjoy the benefit of this portion of his estate; and it is the contention of the plaintiff that if no children were' born to be benefited he then intended to make a full disposition of the estate himself, and thus gave a fee to the first taker limited upon his dying without lawful issue living at the time of his death, with a remainder in fee to the heirs of the testator, which wou\u00edd immediately vest if no children survived. Yet to adopt this where no language is used that affords the slightest modification of the phrase \u201c die without issue \u201d would entirely disregard the use of words which at the testator\u2019s death and unaffected by St. 1888, c. 273, now R. L. c. 134, \u00a7 5, had acquired by judicial determination a definite legal meaning, and by construction are said to have become a rule of property, and when employed by the testator must be treated as used by him in their technical sense. <em>Ide </em>v. <em>Ide, </em>5 Mass. 500, 501. <em>Wight </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>1 Gray, 284, 286. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Ashley School Fund, </em>102 Mass. 262, 264. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Addison Gilbert Hospital, </em>155 Mass. 323, 326. <em>Siders </em>v. <em>Siders, </em>169 Mass. 523, 525. 4 Kent Com. 278, n. 1, where many of the cases are collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">And when he provided that the estate should go over, this meant that if George Wilner left a-child or children surviving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>him such child or children should take the estate after their father as his heirs; and if the whole clause is construed, the estate in fee simple of the first devisee is cut down to an estate in fee tail, which is created by implication, as these words are equivalent to \u201c without leaving heirs of the body,\u201d and contemplate what is known as an indefinite failure of issue and it cannot take effect as an executory devise because void for remoteness. <em>Parker </em>v.

Rev. Sts. c. 59, \u00a7 3. Gen. Sts. c. 89, \u00a7 4. Pub. Sts. c. 120, \u00a7 15. R.

Slade, 155 Mass. 415, 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">By the words \u201c should my niece Clara Marsh die,\u201d his purpose was to prevent a lapse of the devise if she should not outlive him, in which event the other members of the class would take in the order of succession; and these words therefore may be construed as meaning that the estate was to vest if she survived the testator, and, having survived him, she took under the will an estate in fee. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>9 Allen, 516. <em>Crossman </em>v. <em>Field, </em>119 Mass. 170. <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>153 Mass. 481. <em>Seaver </em>v. <em>Griffing, </em>176 Mass. 59, 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">If, under any view, she took a fee in the first instance, subject to be divested upon the happening of subsequent events, the expectant estate of the heirs would then depend oq the failure of children, which event did not occur. As the son did not take unless he survived his father, so the latter acquired no title if he died before his' wife; and, as she survived him, the contingency upon which her estate would have been divested never arose, and she held the fee at her death. <em>Brightman </em>v. <em>Brightman, </em>100 Mass. 238. <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Tilton, </em>118 Mass. 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">. Or by the other construction, the estate given may be treated as limited to his niece for life, remainder for life to her husband, with a remainder in fee to such of their children as survived their father.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">If, instead of limiting the remainder after the life estates to the surviving children of his nephew, the testator had used the word \u201c heirs,\u201d it would be doubtful whether he did not ^intend that those who should take were to be ascertained as of the death of the second life tenant; but their son, and, as it ^eventually appeared, the only child of the marriage, was living at the testator\u2019s death, and comes within the description employed, and as he intended, to provide for him, the son took a remainder in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>fee subject to tbe contingency that it would go to the testator\u2019s heirs if he died before his father, and that his interest might be affected by the birth of brothers or sisters, who, if they also survived, would share the fee with him. But when he survived his father, the estate became absolute, subject to the life estate of his mother, and as he died intestate and unmarried in her lifetime, she took the fee upon his death as his heir. <em>Belcher </em>v. Burnett, 126 Mass. 230, 231. <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Story, </em>132 Mass. 205. <em>Butterfield </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>160 Mass. 361, 368. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Eckley, </em>169 Mass. 119. Pub. Sts. c. 125, \u00a7 1, cl. 4. See also <em>Gardiner </em>v. <em>Guild, </em>106 Mass. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">As the heirs at law never became seised, under the twenty-second article of his will, of any part of the real estate of the testator, the bill cannot be maintained, and must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\n<em>Bill dismissed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
