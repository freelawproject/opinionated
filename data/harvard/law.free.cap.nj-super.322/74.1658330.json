(\u201cPMV\u201d) alleged that it was induced by fraud to enter into an oral contract with defendants Bell Atlantic Network Services, Inc. (\u201cBANS\u201d), a subsidiary of Bell Atlantic Corporation (\u201cBell\u201d), and sought to recover compensatory damages consisting of $375,000 in consulting fees, as provided in the agreement, projected lost profits of approximately $400 million dollars in this entirely new business venture, and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>The case was tried twice. Before the first trial, on defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the judge decided that the lost profits claim was barred by the \u201cnew business rule,\u201d <em>Weiss v. Revenue Bldg. and Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>116 <em>N.J.L. </em>208, 182 <em>A. </em>891 (E. &amp; A.1936). He also found, apart from the rule, that the proofs offered by PMV were too speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The first jury found defendants liable in fraud and awarded PMV $375,000 in compensatory damages and $25 million in punitive damages. The judge denied defendants\u2019 motion for judgment n.o.v. or a new trial on the fraud claim but granted them a new trial on punitive damages, subject to PMV\u2019s right to accept a remittitur of $3,125,000. PMV declined, and the second jury awarded it $1 million in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">PMV appeals. With respect to the first trial, it contends the judge erred in disallowing the claim of approximately $400 million dollars in projected lost profits and in vacating the award of $25 million in punitive damages. Regarding the second trial, it contends the judge erred by permitting defendants to argue that they \u201chad not committed any fraud\u201d and by prohibiting the jury from considering the project\u00e9d lost profits in calculating punitive damages. In short, what PMV now seeks is a judgment leaving untouched the $375,000 award, reinstating the $25 million punitive damage award, and a new trial on its $400 million lost profits claim; or, in the alternative, should we agree with the remittitur decision, a new trial on punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The defendants cross-appeal. As to the first trial, they argue that the doctrine of judicial estoppel barred the fraud claim; that there was insufficient evidence to establish one of the elements of fraud, namely whether PMV reasonably relied on defendants\u2019 misrepresentations, thus warranting their request for judgment n.o.v.; and that PMVs display during summation of \u201chighly prejudicial graphic material\u201d mandated approval of defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial. With respect to both trials, defendants claim the evidence was insufficient, even if fraud was proved, to permit any consideration by the jury of punitive damages because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>their conduct was not egregious. They also argue that the corporate defendants should not have been assessed punitive damages because there was no evidence that any employee sufficiently high in authority participated in or ratified the conduct of defendant Anthony W. Capuano, the individual BANS employee with whom plaintiff negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">As a preliminary matter, we take note of our obligation \u201cto accept as true all evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict and to draw all reasonable inferences in its favor whenever reasonable minds could differ.\u201d <em>Harper-Lawrence, Inc. v. United Merchants and Mfrs., Inc., </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>554, 559, 619 A.2d 623 (App.Div.1993) (citing <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 5, 258 A.2d 706 (1969)). With that principle in mind, these are the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">A full appreciation of plaintiffs case requires some discussion of the evidence bearing on the 1982 break-up of AT &amp; T, the initial restrictions placed on regional Bell operating companies, and the lifting of those restrictions, a process begun in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">In 1982, AT &amp; T and the federal government entered into an agreement settling the government\u2019s long-running antitrust action against the Bell System. The agreement was the subject of a consent decree, which was itself an amendment of an earlier consent decree; hence, the amended consent decree and incorporated agreement are widely referred to as the \u201cModified Final Judgment\u201d or \u201cMFJ.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Under the terms of the MFJ, AT &amp; T was required to divest itself of its local telephone companies. This divestiture occurred in 1984, and it led to the formation of seven \u201cregional Bell operating companies,\u201d which are widely referred to as \u201cRBOCs\u201d or \u201cBaby Bells.\u201d Bell was one of the RBOCs formed in 1984. By 1996, Bell had \u201cabout a hundred or more wholly owned subsidiaries,\u201d employed \u201cin the neighborhood of 80 thousand\u201d workers, and had an estimated net worth of more than $32 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>The MFJ imposed certain operating restrictions upon the RBOCs. For purposes of this appeal, the most important restriction was that the RBOCs were prohibited from providing information services.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Information services involve the processing of information that moves over telephone lines, but it does not include the actual transport of that information. Thus, a conversation over a telephone line is not an information service because \u201cthe information that you put in at one end is the same information that you get out at the other\u201d end. However, if the conversation were recorded for later retrieval, that process would be an information service because it involves data processing and is \u201cnot just the carrying of information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The effect of the MFJ was to confine the RBOCs to the minimally expanding local telephone business and to prohibit them from directly entering the potentially lucrative data processing businesses that were rapidly developing in the mid-to-late 1980s. The MFJ precluded the RBOCS from providing to their customers home automation, meaning the centralized control of such functions as heating, air conditioning, lighting, and security by a computerized panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">In 1984, Congress enacted the Cable Communication Policy Act of 1984, <em>Pub.L. No. </em>98-549, 98 <em>Stat. </em>2779 (codified as amended at 47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 521-559), which restricted the RBOCs from providing video-on-demand services to their customers. Video-on-demand involves sending \u201cVCR quality video over existing telephone lines,\u201d rather than over a separate cable, as with cable television. With the video-on-demand service, the customer would have a wide choice of movies or recorded events to choose from and would be billed for each selection. The pay-per-view billing method currently employed by many cable companies is a \u201crudimentary form of video on demand,\u201d according to Capuano. Bell estimated in 1991 that if this statutory restriction could be lifted, video-on-demand services had a ten-year cumulative revenue potential of $8.2 billion. While the RBOCs apparently had a favor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>able court ruling on the restriction in 1993, the restriction was finally laid to rest in 1996 by a provision of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, <em>Pub.L. No. </em>104-104, 110 <em>Stat. </em>56 (codified in scattered sections of 47 <em>U.S.C.A.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">As a result of the MFJ and the statutory cable restriction, during the 1980s and into the 1990s, the RBOCs (including Bell) could only indirectly offer information services or video-on-demand services to their customers by entering into a business relationship as a subcontractor to an information-service or video-on-demand provider. In such a relationship, the RBOCs could only be compensated for performing the services they were legally allowed to perform and could not share in the revenues derived from the provision of information or video-on-demand services. Because the RBOCs wanted to enter those business lines, they were thus compelled to seek third-party business partners who could provide the restricted services.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">In January 1989, Bell announced that it had formed the PAL alliance with Teletimer International, Inc., and Square D Corporation. Honeywell Corporation soon joined the alliance. PAL was an acronym for \u201cPersonally Automated Lifestyles,\u201d and the object of the PAL alliance was to provide a variety of information services, especially those involving home automation, to the alliance\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">As envisioned by the alliance, the information services would actually be provided through a system of one national and seven regional \u201clicensed systems integrators,\u201d also referred to as \u201cLSIs,\u201d whose task would be the \u201ctying together [of] energy management, security, lighting and appliance control, [as well as] some form of in-house communications and some form of in-house distribution of audio and video signals\u201d for the alliance\u2019s customers. The seven regional LSIs were to be responsible for local sales, installation, and service, while the national LSI was to be responsible for creating and running the network.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">One of the persons working to accomplish the PAL alliance\u2019s vision was defendant Anthony W. Capuano, who was employed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>1989 as the Managing Director of Home Automation with BANS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell. Capuano\u2019s quest to identify possible contenders for the available LSI positions soon led him to PMV.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">PMV was formed, in 1982, by John Puma and Steve Meehan and was initially involved with servicing pay-TV accounts in Washington, D.C. It was an outgrowth of another corporation, PM Video Network, Inc., that Puma and Meehan had formed in 1980 to service pay-TV accounts in New England. To avoid the impression that PMV was merely \u201crenting video tapes,\u201d Puma and Meehan often operated PMV under the trade name of \u201cAVIUS,\u201d which was an acronym for automation voice and information unified systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">From 1983 to 1989, PMV worked under a contract with MCI to install, service, and train technicians concerning MCI\u2019s \u201cnetwork access auto dialers.\u201d PMVs service territory extended from Connecticut to New Jersey, and the work involved \u201csystems integration,\u201d whereby PMV would connect the customers\u2019 phone system into \u201cthe public network\u201d by way of an MCI device. The MCI contract provided PMV with $7,000,000 to $8,000,000 in revenue overall, and PMV employed \u201cabout a hundred subcontractors and about twenty to twenty-five in-house personnel\u201d during this period. Thus, PMV was a firm with a proven record of performance in systems integration. By 1989, Puma was apparently the sole owner of PMV.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">On January 21,1989, Puma attended the National Association of Home Builders convention in Atlanta, Georgia, where he saw the PAL alliance\u2019s exhibit and where he met George Cretecos of Teletimer, as well as Capuano and Capuano\u2019s subordinate Timothy Eggleston of BANS. Puma met with Capuano, Eggleston, and representatives from Square D, in March 1989, to make a presentation concerning the capabilities of PMV. He also met Capuano at a telecommunications conference in May 1989, where the two discussed the goals of the PAL alliance and dealer networks. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>According to Puma, Capuano told him \u201cvery clearly at that point in time that he wanted AVIUS [PMV] in the [PAL] program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">In July 1989, Eggleston and representatives from Square D visited PMV\u2019s offices in Fairfield, New Jersey. They observed PMV\u2019s performance of tasks under the MCI contract and went to several of the home sites that PMV had wired with home automation devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">On January 20 and 21, 1990, Puma attended another National Association of Home Builders convention in Atlanta and saw Capuano at a prearranged meeting. According to Puma, Capuano told him that PMV had been awarded one of the regional LSI positions and would have responsibility for sales, service, installation, and customer relations within that region. Puma testified that Capuano did not state that the award of the unspecified regional LSI to PMV was subject to conditions or contingencies, but he did indicate that the regional LSI would receive a \u201chundred million dollars\u201d a year in revenue over a ten-year period. Capuano also told him that PMV had to \u201cbeef up\u201d its marketing prowess to become eligible for the national LSI position. Capuano suggested that Puma hire a mutual business acquaintance, Eric Davidson of Smart House, Inc. Puma and Davidson had previously discussed joining together to pursue mutual business interests, including \u201ccontracts with Bell Atlantic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">On April 3, 1990, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a decision in an appeal by various RBOCs, including Bell, that remanded part of the 1984 divestiture MFJ to the district court and essentially directed the district court \u201cto approve getting rid of or dropping the information services line of business restriction\u201d on the RBOCs. See <em>United States v. Western Elec. Co., </em>900 F.2d 283 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>911, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>283, 112 L.Ed.2d 238 (1990). This court decision was widely reported and understood to mean that the RBOCs would soon be permitted to enter business fields involving information services from which they had earlier been excluded. Fifteen months later, on July 25, 1991, the federal district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>entered the anticipated order removing the restrictions on information services. <em>United States v. Western Elec. Co., </em>767 <em>F.Supp. </em>308 (D.D.C.1991), <em>aff'd, </em>993 F.2d 1572 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 <em>U.S. </em>984, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>487, 126 L.Ed.2d 438 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">On April 27, 1990, in reaction to the federal appeals court\u2019s decision of April 3, 1990, Bell\u2019s highest management met and reviewed plans for Bell\u2019s entry as a competitor <em>without partners </em>into the information services and home automation marketplace. Capuano participated in the preparation of materials for that meeting, and those materials plainly called for Bell itself to provide information services that had been earlier earmarked as tasks for the regional and national LSIs.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">On April 29, 1990, Capuano met with Puma and Davidson, and, according to Puma, told them that PMV had the national LSI position and the regional LSI position for the region serviced by the RBOC NYNEX. The contract awards were unconditional. Puma testified that he believed Capuano had the authority to make these agreements because Capuano \u201cwas the biggest guy in the industry at that point in time\u201d and the PAL alliance was \u201cthe most powerful group in the industry.\u201d Capuano made a diagram of the prospective business relationship. In the diagram, \u201cJohn [Puma] <em>&amp; </em>Eric [Davidson]\u201d were set out in a national LSI box above the \u201c7 Guys\u201d who were to be the regional LSIs, and the PAL alliance was also prominently displayed in the business schematic.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Capuano\u2019s version of what occurred at the meeting was substantially different from that of Puma. Essentially, Capuano testified that he outlined a three-phase business plan to Puma and Davidson, and that each phase was subject to conditions and to approval by his superiors at BANS and Bell. Capuano said that he never entered into contract negotiations with PMV concerning the national or regional LSI positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Capuano\u2019s testimony, however, conflicted with that of a businessman unrelated to PMV, Sean Walsh of Hometron, Inc., a competitor of PMV. He said that Capuano informed him that PMV <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>had been unconditionally awarded the national LSI position. Although Capuano testified that he told Walsh only that he was going to recommend PMV for the national LSI position, the jury was entitled to credit Puma and Walsh and reject the contrary recollections of Capuano.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">On May 3, 1990, Puma mailed a letter with attached documents to Capuano describing his understanding of the three-phase agreement between BANS and PMV. Capuano explained at trial that he interpreted the letter and its attachments as a consultancy agreement for the first phase of the agreement, not as a recitation of the existence of the entire three-phase agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">In late May 1990, after Capuano promised the national LSI position to PMV, Davidson resigned from his position at Smart House and began working for PMV. Over the following four months, Puma and Davidson spoke and met with Capuano and Eggleston often to discuss plans for the regional LSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">From June 1 to 3, 1990, Capuano attended a consumer electronics show in Chicago, which Puma and Davidson also attended. The three met and, according to Puma, \u201chammered out the deal that we still have today.\u201d Puma testified that the first phase of the agreement called for PMV\u2019s production of an outline of its national marketing plan for the PAL products. The outline would include PMV\u2019s \u201cproprietary information,\u201d which Puma testified \u201ctook me ten years to develop,\u201d and for which BANS agreed to make an initial payment of $25,000; but Puma reserved PMV\u2019s right to the proprietary information, refusing to convey those rights to BANS under the first phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Puma testified that the second phase of the agreement called for PMV\u2019s production of the final version of the national plan, PMV\u2019s active participation in the plan as a consultant, and PMV\u2019s conveyance of its proprietary information to BANS. PMV was to be paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>$350,000 for the proprietary information conveyed to BANS under the second phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">According to Puma, the third phase of the agreement entailed the implementation of the national plan, including the formation of the national LSI company with PMV as majority owner, as well as Bell\u2019s funding of that national company.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">On June 6, 1990, Puma and Davidson met with Capuano and executed nondisclosure documents. On June 16, PMV sent the initial \u201cNational Channel Development for Bell Atlantic\u201d document in fulfillment of Phase One of the agreement. On June 19, PMV forwarded additional financial information to Capuano, further explaining the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">On June 18, 1990, while PMV was working on the second phase of the agreement, Capuano wrote to his superior in the corporate hierarchy at BANS, Thomas Gorman. Discussing the role of PMV and another company who were viewed as \u201cconsultants\u201d by Capuano, he reported that \u201cwe will leverage the consultants\u2019 knowledge about Home Automation in technical and marketing related areas (task descriptions follow) to provide necessary experience for BAC [Bell] to carry out these tasks in the future.\u201d This letter reflects Capuano\u2019s awareness that Bell was not seeking partners at that time in its prospective marketing of information services. .</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">On July 10, 1990, Capuano and Puma spoke on the telephone. According to Puma, Capuano said that Bell had approved a ten-year, $118,000,000 investment in the national LSI company. Puma also testified that Capuano did not at that time indicate that there were any \u201csnags,\u201d \u201cproblems,\u201d or conditions to Bell\u2019s performance under the three-phase agreement. Subsequently, PMV received financial projections from Bell concerning the anticipated revenue and net income for the national LSI company and the regional LSIs.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">On July 13, 1990, PMV delivered to Capuano what amounted to the final report due under Phase Two of the three-phase agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>ment: \u201cThe National Channel Development for Bell Atlantic.\u201d The report evidently contained much of PMV\u2019s proprietary information. Puma and PMV continued to work on the consultancy portion of Phase Two after delivering the final report, responding to all inquiries by Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">On July 27, 1990, according to Capuano, his boss\u2019s superior, John Seazholtz vetoed the idea of Bell investing in small outside companies like PMV and decided that the national LSI would be run by Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">On August 2, 1990, according to Sean Walsh of Hometron, Capuano told him \u201con the QT\u201d that Bell would be the national LSI. Walsh also testified that Bell had reneged on a contract with him that Hometron would have an equity interest in the regional LSI position for which it had been chosen; instead, Bell would totally own all of the regional LSIs. Capuano, however, denied that he had made the comment to Walsh concerning the national LSI position.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Also, on August 2, Geoffrey Hart\u00f3n of BANS sent a standard Bell consultancy contract to Puma as a prelude to Bell\u2019s payment of PMV for its services. The contract contained $15,000 and $10,000 total-payment provisions and a \u201cDeveloped Information\u201d provision that Puma found confusing, baffling, and preposterous. Puma did not execute or return the contract to Hart\u00f3n but, instead, considered it a \u201cmix up\u201d after speaking to Hart\u00f3n about it. Puma then continued to do the Phase Two consultancy work pursuant to the three-phase agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">On September 6, 1990, Puma and Davidson travelled to Bell\u2019s offices in Silver Spring, Maryland, to confer with Capuano about some bills that Bell had not paid. At the meeting, Capuano informed the two that Bell would \u201cnot make an investment in an outside\u201d national LSI company, \u201cthat there was going to be no investment in AVIUS [PMV],\u201d and that \u201cBell Atlantic was going to do the job themselves.\u201d According to Capuano, he had already told Puma this on August 13. Puma testified that he was \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201cnauseous\u201d at this turn of events because he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>worked without any compensation for \u201cvirtually the entire summer, [and for] a great deal of time before that.\u201d Capuano did not cut PMV off completely, however. Instead, while \u201cBell Atlantic would b,e the national [LSI] and would execute the plan,\u201d Bell would provide PMV with the \u201cfunctional financial equivalent\u201d of the national LSI position. Puma decided that if Capuano\u2019s alternate proposal proved to be the monetary equivalent of the national LSI position, then \u201cit would be prudent for me to just go along\u201d with Capuano until the alternative proposal was made concrete. The meeting ended with many unresolved issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">On September 10, 1990, Capuano sent Puma a letter suggesting three \u201cmajor potential opportunity areas\u201d for PMV to work with the PAL alliance. These \u201careas\u201d were largely undefined in Capuano\u2019s letter, and, though Puma really did not know the parameters of these opportunities, he stated that he would have been willing to accept Bell\u2019s alternative. But, according to Puma, Capuano \u201cdidn\u2019t deliver anything\u201d on this supposed alternative to the original deal. Nevertheless, Puma took Capuano\u2019s \u201cletter as a positive step,\u201d and he resolved to enter into any favorable contracts with Bell that he could. Puma testified that he was \u201cvery, very nervous\u201d at this time because \u201cI had a company [PMV] to run, I had families to feed and I had no work, I had just spent the entire past six months working for him [Capuano], and not working for P.M. Video.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">On September 25, 1990, Puma and Davidson traveled to Bell\u2019s offices in Silver Spring, where they met with Capuano and Eggelston. Puma testified that his purpose in attending the meeting was \u201cto take that September 10th letter [from Capuano] and articulate it in as great detail as possible, create an agreement that would be executed spontaneously and get money for the work that I had done.\u201d As a result of their discussions, Capuano directed Puma \u201cto take the notes that we had taken at the meeting, reduce it into a formal letter and submit it to him.\u201d On October 18, 1990, Puma sent Capuano a letter detailing PMVs proposal for an alternative contract with Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Capuano testified that he considered Puma\u2019s letter to be an \u201cextortion letter,\u201d and he countered with a letter on October 29, 1990, \u201cto clarify our relationship to date and outline future possibilities.\u201d In that letter, Capuano stated that PMV had only been hired as a consultant under an oral contract to \u201cproduce a quick <em>preliminary </em>study\u201d for $25,000, and that the \u201cstudy was based almost entirely on Bell Atlantic proprietary information and concepts developed internally by Bell Atlantic which were provided to you under a non-disclosure agreement.\u201d Capuano offered to pay PMV the $25,000 that he said was owing if Puma executed a concurrence that Capuano\u2019s letter recited the true scope of the business relationship between PMV and Bell or, alternatively, if Puma signed the consulting contract that Harton of BANS had sent him on August 21, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Puma refused Capuano\u2019s offer and sought legal counsel. Puma testified that Capuano\u2019s offer was \u201cridiculous\u201d because \u201cthis was like having a gun to my head. I wasn\u2019t going to give them my work that took me ten years to develop for twenty-five thousand dollars. That\u2019s not what the deal was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">About a year later, on October 31, 1991, Capuano\u2019s superior at BANS, Gorman, sent a letter to his superior, John Seazholtz, discussing the various contracts entered into by the Home Automation Group headed by Capuano. Gorman wrote that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">[i]n all cases but one, we reviewed the proposed relationships beforehand with legal, contracting and, if necessary, with Bell Atlantic's senior management.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">The one exception to this rule was an oral contract which Mr. Capuano made with a company called Avius [PMV] to develop some data for our business development plan. This agreement is now the subject of litigation, and while the claims being made by Avius are regarded by our lawyers and outside counsel as completely unfounded, Mr. Capuano accepts full responsibility <em>for </em>stepping outside the rules in this instance in order to meet a presentation deadline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">Following the termination of its relations with PMV, Bell explored the possibility of entering the home automation market on a nationwide basis either in combination with the other RBOCs or alone. Bell\u2019s plan, \u201cProject Domotique,\u201d was estimated in November 1991 to be capable of producing approximately $523,000,000 in net operating revenue by the year 2000, but those revenues were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>never realized. Bell\u2019s entire home automation plan was \u201ckilled\u201d and Capuano\u2019s unit was disbanded in May 1992, when it came under the purview of a new senior manager at BANS.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">As for Bell\u2019s video-on-demand plan, there was no proof that it was anything other than an experimental program by the time of trial and no evidence that it ever achieved any profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">JUDICIAL ESTOPPEL</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">This lawsuit was preceded by an action PMV filed against Bell, and other defendants, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Based on the same circumstances, that action alleged breach of contract. It was quickly dismissed for lack of diversity jurisdiction because PMV and Bell were both Delaware corporations. Nonetheless, Bell sought an order in the Law Division prohibiting PMV \u201cfrom attempting to prove at trial any version of a three-phase agreement with the Bell Defendants other than that which it alleged in the [federal] complaint....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">In their appellate brief, defendants explain their position in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">[PMV] has played fast and loose with many facts central to this case. Perhaps most critically, [PMV] has taken inconsistent positions about when \u201cphase one\u201d ended and \u201cphase two\u201d began. In its verified federal complaint ... [PMV] claimed phase one ended and ... [it] delivered a phase one report on July 14, 1990. But thereafter, in [PMV\u201ds] New Jersey counterclaims ..., [it] claims phase one ended on June 16, 1990, and that it was the phase <em>two </em>report delivered on July 14.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-11\">It is a change of great consequence because only by claiming that it completed the phase two report can [PMV] argue that it deserves the $350,000 in compensatory damages for the phase two report, and that by completing phase two it thereby completed a necessary <em>condition precedent </em>to establishing liability for the enormous damages it claims for phase three.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-12\">[Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">Generally, the doctrine of judicial estoppel \u201cbar[s] a party to a legal proceeding from arguing a position inconsistent with one previously asserted.\u201d <em>N.M. v. J.G., </em>255 <em>N.J.Super. </em>423, 429; 605 A.2d 709 (App.Div.1992). It is most often applied when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>party takes inconsistent positions in different litigation; however, it is equally applicable where a party asserts inconsistent legal positions in different proceedings in the same litigation. <em>Cummings v. Bahr, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>374, 385, 685 A.2d 60 (App.Div.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">But the doctrine is only applicable when the party against whom it is to be applied \u201csuccessfully asserted\u201d the inconsistent position in the prior proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 387, 685 A.2d 60. A position has been \u201csuccessfully asserted\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgL\">if il has helped form the basis of a judicial determination. The judicial determination does not have to be in favor of the party making the assertion. If a court has based a final decision, even in part, on a party\u2019s assertion, that same party is thereafter precluded from asserting a contradictory position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 387-88, 685 A.2d 60.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">These principles demonstrate that the doctrine of judicial estoppel is inapplicable. PMV did not \u201csuccessfully assert\u201d its legal position concerning the disputed Phase One and Phase Two dates in the federal action because those disputed dates were not the basis of the judicial determination ending the litigation. Instead, the dismissal of the federal action turned solely on the lack of diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">DEFENDANTS\u2019 MOTION FOR JUDGMENT N.O.V.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">At the end of the first trial, defendants moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that one element of fraud, reasonable reliance, had not been proven. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\"> An action for common-law fraud requires proof of five elements: \u201c(1) a material misrepresentation of a presently existing or past fact; (2) knowledge or belief by the defendant of its falsity; (3) an intention that the other person rely on it; (4) reasonable reliance thereon by the other person; and (5) resulting damages.\u201d <em>Gennari, v. Weichert Co. Realtors, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>582, 610, 691 A.2d 350 (1997). Included within the first element are promises made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>without the intent to perform since they are \u201cmaterial misrepresentations of the promisor\u2019s state of mind at the time of the promise.\u201d <em>Dover Shopping Center, Inc. v. Cushman\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>63 <em>N.J.Super. </em>384, 391, 164 A.2d 785 (App.Div.1960); <em>accord Lipsit v. Leonard, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>276, 283, 315 A.2d 25 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Implicit in defendants\u2019 argument for judgment n.o.v. was the admission that all but one of the elements of common-law fraud were adequately supported by the evidence. In other words, at least for purposes of this argument, defendants must be understood as conceding that their promise was a material misrepresentation of a presently existing fact; that it was made with knowledge or belief in its falsity; that they intended that PMV rely on it; and that PMV was damaged as a result of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Given that understanding, defendants\u2019 argument, which is based on the contention that the initial promise was contingent on later Bell approvals, was properly rejected since, as the trial judge noted, there was credible evidence \u201c[t]hat before Mr. Puma [the president of PMV] did any work the [Bell] defendants <em>unconditionally </em>promised him a national business network in order to obtain his [PMVs] work product.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">DEFENDANTS\u2019 MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">During summation in the first trial, plaintiffs attorney displayed two drawings to the jury. The first depicted Bell\u2019s chairman in royal attire, including a crown. He, Capuano, Puma, and others were seated at a table laden with food. The second drawing showed the chairman alone at the table with all the food gathered before him. While \"displaying these drawings, plaintiffs attorney said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\">And we\u2019ve created our own graphics] and ... this is another one of our inventions to show you what we think about Bell.... This is Bell Atlantic\u2019s meal ticket. These are all the players on the right....all that food is being distributed equally. And if you\u2019ll turn the page, look what happens. Everybody is gone. All that food <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>is in front of Ray Smith [the chairman]. Tony Capuano is even gone. That\u2019s how we perceive what happened here with the use of a graph[ic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">Members of the jury, I want you to enjoy them but, you know, we\u2019re all serious, very serious about this case and the allegations. This was an agenda at the highest level on a project that involved billions of dollars, billions of revenues to Bell. A project that would allow them with relief, to do things on their own without partners, exactly what they\u2019re doing today. For Mr. Smith to suggest to <em>you </em>under oath that he knows very little about this, when the evidence shows to the contrary, it\u2019s an absurdity. It\u2019s an attack on your intelligence. And you should not accept it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">During trial, defendants neither objected to the comments nor to the display of the drawings. In fact, their first objection on this point \u201csurfaced\u201d in their brief in support of their motion for a new trial, and it was contained in one of eighty-six footnotes to that brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Since the presentation of this argument in the trial court was untimely, we must consider the issue under the plain error rule. <em>Nisivoccia, v. Ademhill Assocs., </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>419, 424, 669 A.2d 822 (App.Div.1996) (\u201cInasmuch as plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial expressed their first objection to the defense attorney\u2019s summation remarks, we will consider the present appeal under the plain error standard. See <em>R. </em>2:10-2.\u201d). With that in mind, we reject the argument. While the drawings may have had some potential for prejudice, they were only metaphors, and they were not clearly capable of producing an unjust result.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S PROJECTED LOST PROFITS CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">PMV alleged that as a result of the defendants\u2019 fraudulent conduct it suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in lost profits. Defendants responded with a motion for summary judgment, asserting the claim was barred by the \u201cnew business rule.\u201d <em>Weiss v. Revenue Bldg. and Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>116 <em>N.J.L. </em>208, 212, 182 A. 891 (E. &amp; A.1936). Alternatively, defendants argued that even if New Jersey no longer follows that rule, the damage claims were too speculative for consideration by a jury. The trial judge granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>defendants\u2019 motion, finding that the \u201cnew business rule\u201d was the law in this state, and that if it was not, the plaintiff\u2019s proofs were still too speculative. We agree with the judge on both rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">In <em>Weiss, </em>the Court of Errors and Appeals described the \u201cnew business rule\u201d in this manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">There is a well established distinction, in respect of the ascertainment of future probable profits, between a new business or venture and one in actual operation. In the first, the prospective profits are too remote, contingent and speculative to meet the legal standard of reasonable certainty; while in the second, the provable data furnished by actual experience provides the basis for an estimation of the <em>quantum </em>of such profits with a satisfactory degree of definiteness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">The \u201cnew business rule\u201d was rejected as a statement of the law of New Jersey by the Third Circuit in <em>In re Merritt Logan, Inc., </em>901 F.2d 349, 357 (3d Cir.1990). After noting the modern trend towards rejection of this once generally accepted rule, the court predicted that the New Jersey Supreme Court, given the chance, would \u201cno longer follow a <em>per se </em>rule precluding all new businesses from recovering any damages for lost profits.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AdV\">In <em>Perini Corp. v. Create Bay Hotel &amp; Casino, Inc., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>479, 610 A.2d 364 (1992), the Supreme Court reviewed an arbitration award for lost profits incurred by a new business. The three-justice plurality addressed the issue in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-12\">Permit, the general contractor,] argues that the renovation project amounted to a new business. In <em>Weiss v. Revenue Building and Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>116 <em>N.J.L. </em>208, 182 A.2d [A.] 891 (E. &amp; A.1936), the Court stated that lost profits for a new business are \u201ctoo remote, contingent and speculative to meet the legal standard of reasonable certainty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212, 182 A. 891. Sands], the casino,] questions that argument. It points out that the casino had a proven track record; the location and nature of the business never changed; and the management team never changed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-13\">However, even were we to consider profits from the 1984 season as those of a new business, the trend in recent eases has been to award lost profits for a new business when they can be proved with reasonable certainty. Robert L. Dunn, <em>Recovery of Damages for Lost Profits, </em>\u00a7 4.2 (3d ed.1987); <em>see also Seaman [v. United States Steel Corp.], supra, </em>166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>[467] at 474-75, 400 A.2d 90 [(1979)] (evidence of lost rental value from new operation incorrectly admitted at trial because, among other things, defendant failed to show that a profit would have been made). In <em>In re Merritt Logan, Inc., </em>901 F.2d 349 (3d Cir.1990), the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>predicted that this Court would follow that trend and allow lost profits for a new business if damages were proved with reasonable certainty. <em>Id. </em>at 358. That court also relied on comment 2 to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-708(2)(UCC), which states that \u201c[i]t is not necessary to a recovery of \u2018profit\u2019 to show a history of earnings, especially if a new venture is involved.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Given that recent trend, the arbitrators cannot be said to have acted in manifest disregard of the law. Thus, because the arbitrators were presented with enough evidence to decide that Sands had proved its lost profits damages with reasonable certainty, the damage award does not fall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 509-10, 610 A.2d 364.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">No other justice joined these remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">A year later, the Third Circuit, citing <em>Merritt Logan </em>and <em>Perini, </em>said, \u201cNew Jersey no longer adheres to its 'new business <em>rule....'\" Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d </em>1153, 1176 (3d Cir.1993). A decision of the Third Circuit is entitled to \u201cdue respect,\u201d but it is not binding on the state courts. <em>See Dewey v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>69, 79-80, 577 A.2d 1239 (1990). Furthermore, the court in <em>Lightning Lube </em>did not actually find that New Jersey had abandoned the \u201cnew business rule.\u201d As in <em>Merritt Logan</em>, the court was making a prediction of the course the New Jersey Supreme Court would follow if presented with the issue. The court said, \u201cWhile we recognize that <em>Perini </em>involved damages awarded in an arbitration,\u201d <em>we believe that the Supreme Count of New Jersey would apply its holding to trials in court as well. Lightning Lube, supra, </em>4 <em>F.3d </em>at 1176 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">The only exception to the rule that we are bound by decisions of the Supreme Court and the Court of Errors and Appeals is where \u201cmore recent decisions of the Supreme Court <em>clearly undermine </em>the authority of a prior decision, although not expressly overruling it.\u201d <em>Burrell v. Quaranta, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>243, 252, 612 A.2d 379 (App.Div.1992) (emphasis added). While the arguments for abandonment of the \u201cnew business rule\u201d appear to be persuasive, those arguments are not supported by a majority opinion of the Supreme Court; rather, they appear only in the plurality opinion in <em>Penini. </em>That is not a sufficient basis for us to say that <em>Perini, </em>which only involved arbitration and was itself overruled on other grounds in <em>Tretina Printing, Inc. v. Fitz</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>patrick &amp; Assocs., </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>349, 358-59, 640 A.2d 788 (1994), clearly undermined the authority of <em>Weiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Plaintiff also argues that the \u201cnew business rule\u201d is limited to contract actions and is inapplicable to fraud. But that is not so. <em>See, e.g., Kurtz v. Oremland, </em>33 <em>N.J.Super. </em>443, 451-53, 111 A.2d 100 (Ch.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>454, 109 A.2d 286 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In view of the possibility that our Supreme Court might overrule the \u201cnew business rule,\u201d the trial judge also considered whether PMV\u2019s lost profit claim was too speculative despite the opinions offered by its economic experts. In rejecting the claim on the ground that the evidence of lost profits could not be established with reasonable certainty, the trial judge emphasized the following points: (1) the substantial discrepancy between the projections of PMV\u2019s two experts, one putting the loss, as of 1995, at $410 million and the other putting the loss, as of the same date, at $288 million, a difference of $112 million; (2) the national LSI company never came into existence; (3) the national LSI concept was contingent on the development of a complex network of interlocking companies, none of which has been created; (4) the profitability of the national LSI would have depended on the formation of numerous collateral agreements with independent service providers and their agreement to accept PMV\u2019s demands for set percentages of each provider\u2019s revenue stream; (5) the business plan was unique and untested; (6) the products, home automation and video-on-demand, were new and both industries were \u201cstill in a very preliminary planning stage and [were] years away from the mass-marketing penetration that PM[V] envisioned]\u201d; and (7) PMV\u2019s experts had relied almost exclusively on projections made by Bell while ignoring the numerous caveats, contingencies, and assumptions contained in the Bell financial projections, which detailed the risk and uncertainty of the proposed business concept. The trial judge also concluded that \u201c[g]iven the substantial start-up costs associated with these projects, the future profitability of home automation products and related services is far from certain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Assuming the inapplicability of the \u201cnew business rule,\u201d PMV was still required to prove its alleged lost profits with \u201creasonable certainty.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Advent Sys. Ltd. v. Unisys Corp., </em>925 F.2d 670, 680-81 (3d Cir.1991) (explaining the standard under Pennsylvania law). None of the cases cited by plaintiff even approximate the degree of speculation involved in this case. Here, we are dealing with new, highly innovative products whose reception by the public was doubtful, to say the least. Adding to that consideration the enormous complexity of the multiple business relationships required for successful marketing, we are satisfied that the trial judge correctly relied on these views expressed by the Supreme Court of Texas in <em>Texas Instruments, Inc. v. Teletron Energy Management, Inc., </em>877 S.W.2d 276 (Tex.1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">Profits which are largely speculative, as from an activity dependent on uncertain or changing market conditions, or on chancy business opportunities, or on promotion of untested products or entry into unknown or unviable markets, or the success of a new and unproved enterprise, cannot be recovered. Factors like these and others which make a business venture risky in prospect preclude recovery of lost profits in retrospect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">The fact that a business is new is but one consideration in applying the \u201creasonable certainty\u201d test.... [But t]he mere hope for success of an untried enterprise, even when that hope is realistic, is not enough for recovery of lost profits. When there are firmer reasons to expect a business to yield a profit, the enterprise is not prohibited from recovering merely because it is new.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 279-80.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">Consequently, we see no basis for disturbing the trial judge\u2019s determination that plaintiffs proofs were too speculative to permit their consideration by a jury. <em>See generally </em>Roger I. Abrams, Donald Welsch, &amp; Bruce Jonas, <em>Stillborn Enterprises: Calculating Expectation Damages Using Forensic Economics, </em>57 <em>Ohio St.L.J. </em>809 (1996) (criticizing the \u201cnew business rule\u201d and indicating the proofs, not present here, that are needed to support this kind of claim). As those authors concluded, \u201cThe key judicial finding [is] the market viability of the stillborn enterprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 834. In essence, the trial judge found that plaintiff had failed to establish the \u201cmarket viability\u201d of the proposed business.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Under this heading, we consider these arguments: (1) defendants\u2019 contention that their conduct was not egregious enough to warrant punitive damages; (2) their related contention that there was insufficient involvement in the fraud by upper management to permit an award of punitive damages against the Bell corporations; (3) plaintiffs contention that the judge erred in vacating the $25 million punitive damage award given by the first jury; and (4) plaintiffs alternative arguments for a new trial on punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">A. Defendants\u2019 Argument that the Evidence did not Warrant Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">At the close of all the evidence in the first phase of the first trial, defendants moved, pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:40-1, for judgment dismissing the punitive damages claim. They argued that there was insufficient evidence of egregious conduct. The motion was denied. The jury found defendants liable for $375,000 in compensatory damages and for punitive damages in an amount to be set at the second phase. On April 12, 1996, the jury returned its verdict for $25 million in punitive damages. Subsequently, defendants moved for judgment n.o.v. on the punitive damage claim, again asserting that their conduct was not sufficiently egregious to warrant such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Defendants rely on the principle that \u201c[e]very fraud is reprehensible, but not every fraud ... warrants punitive damages.\u201d <em>Jugan v. Friedman, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>556, 572, 646 A.2d 1112 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>271, 649 A.2d 1291 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">In <em>Nappe v. Anschelewitz, Barr, Ansell &amp; Bonello, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>37, 477 A.2d 1224 (1984), the Supreme Court explained when punitive damages would be justified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">To warrant a punitive award, the defendant\u2019s conduct must have been wantonly reckless or malicious. There must be an intentional wrongdoing in the sense of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\u201cevil-minded act\u201d or an act accompanied by a wanton and wilful disregard of the rights of another. <em>DiGiovanni v.

But that argument ignores the evidence that Capuano, as a result of the April 27, 1990, executive meeting, knew that Bell intended to enter the home automation and information services businesses itself, to the exclusion of PMV, and yet thereafter persisted in representing to PMV that it would be the national LSI and a regional LSI. It also ignores the letter of June 18, 1990, from Capuano to his supervisor, which the jury could well have understood as reflecting defendants\u2019 consistent intent to unfairly benefit from PMVs proprietary information, despite that PMV only turned over the information on the understanding that it would have the LSI positions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Relying on <em>Fischer v.

To the contrary, it accepts the law of fraud and punitive damages as laid down in <em>Nappe. Id. </em>at 655, 673, 512 A.2d 466 (citing <em>Nappe, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 49-50, 477 A.2d 1224). Furthermore, in this case the misconduct was carried on by Capuano over a period of some five months, during which time he continued to obtain, on behalf of his employer, the benefit of PMV\u2019s efforts, while knowing that Bell had no intention of consummating the LSI deals. Thus, viewing the evidence from the plaintiffs point of view, as we must, there were repeated instances of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Even if we were to accept the proposition offered by Bell, that it did not act with an \u201cevil mind,\u201d which we do not, there was, nonetheless, more than sufficient evidence to show that the repeated acts of Capuano were accompanied by a wanton and willful disregard of PMV\u2019s right to profit from its propriety information and from the efforts of its employees. Therefore, punitive damages were warranted under <em>Nappe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">B. Defendants\u2019 Argument Against Corporate Liability for Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">We turn next to defendants\u2019 contention that the corporate defendants should not have been found liable for punitive damages because executives were not involved in the fraud and because the corporations did not ratify Capuano\u2019s fraudulent acts. This argument, raised for the first time in defendants\u2019 motion for judgment n.o.v., appears to be somewhat disingenuous since it is made by a law firm representing all defendants even though its success <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>would leave one defendant, Mr. Capuano, personally exposed to punitive damages in a retrial. In any case, the argument is without merit for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">First, the argument was raised too late to allow its consideration on appeal. Defendants concede, as they must, that they did not raise this corporate defense until they filed their post-judgment motions. Furthermore, they took a contrary position in the charge conference. Their attorney said, \u201cI think if they find fraud against Mr. Capuano and they decide whatever he did he did within the scope of his employment, that\u2019s what the law is, then the corporations are liable.\u201d Without objection before or after the charge, this case was submitted to the first jury on the theory that the corporations would be liable for all damages if Capuano had committed acts of fraud within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Thus, this aspect of the case is controlled by our decision in <em>Viviano v. CBS, Inc., </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>113, 597 A.2d 543 (App.Div.1991), wherein we made the following observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">In the present ease, the jury awarded punitive damages only against CBS and not against the individual defendants. Defendants contend that plaintiffs proofs did not warrant assessing punitive damages against the corporation. They argue that exemplary damages may be assessed against a corporation only if the wrongful acts were committed by employees so high in authority as to be fairly considered executive in character or by agents authorized to act in the particular manner deemed wrongful or if the corporation ratified the wrongful acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">We agree that the trial court did not charge the jury that awarding punitive damages required their finding that the employees responsible for the reprehensible conduct were executives or that the conduct was ratified by the corporation. However, the defendants did not request such a charge or object to the charge as given. We will therefore not reverse on the basis of that omission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 130, 597 A.2d 543 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">Defendants argue that <em>Viviano </em>is distinguishable because it \u201cholds only that such silence waives the right to appeal omission of a <em>charge, </em>not the lack of evidence.\u201d We disagree. If, as is the case under <em>Viviano, </em>a corporate defendant cannot complain of the court\u2019s failure to include a charge on corporate, as distinct from individual, liability, it is because that issue was not in the case as tried. In <em>Viviano, supra, </em>we arrived at that view by application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>the plain error rule. 251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 130, 597 A.2d 543. The same result obtains by application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel. <em>See supra </em>Section II. The doctrine bars defendants from now asserting a legal position inconsistent with that taken earlier. <em>Cummings, supra, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 385-88, 685 A.2d 60 (explaining that the doctrine attaches when \u201cthe party was allowed by the court to maintain the position\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Second, we would note, as did the trial judge, that there was evidence showing involvement of upper management in the fraud, including the April 27, 1990, meeting and the June 18, 1990, letter sent by Capuano to his supervisor, an assistant-vice-president with BANS.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Third, the corporations may be held liable for punitive damages because they ratified Capuano\u2019s conduct by instituting the declaratory judgment action and conducting a single defense with him to justify their, retention of plaintiff\u2019s proprietary information for what was a negligible compensation in the context of this case. <em>See, e.g., Cappiello v. Ragen Precision Indus., Inc., </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>523, 471 A.2d 432 (App.Div.1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">Also, since Ragen [the corporation] here has participated in a single defense with its executives in an effort to retain plaintiffs commissions, we can well find a specific ratification of [their] actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 531, 471 A.2d 432.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">C. Plaintiffs Argument that the Trial Judge Improperly Granted a New Trial on Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">On defendants\u2019 motion after the first trial, the judge determined that the $25 million punitive damage award was excessive and granted a new trial subject to an offer of remittitur, which plaintiff rejected. The standards governing our review of the judge\u2019s decision to grant a new trial were restated in the following manner in <em>Caldwell v. Haynes, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>422, 432, 643 A.2d 564 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">In reviewing a trial court's ruling on a motion for a new trial, an appellate court shall not reverse a trial court \u201cunless it clearly appears that there was a miscarriage of justice under the law.\u201d <em>B. </em>2:10-1. Accordingly, \u201cThe standard for appellate review of a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for a new trial is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>substantially the same as that controlling the trial court except that due deference should be made to its \u2018feel of the case,\u2019 including credibility.\u201d <em>Feldman v. Lederle Lab. [Laboratories], </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>429, 463, 479 A.2d 374 (1984) (quoting <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 6, 258 A.2d 706 (1969)). At the same time, a trial court\u2019s determination is \u201cnot entitled to any special deference where it rests upon a determination as to worth, plausibility, consistency or other tangible considerations apparent from the face of the record with respect to which he is no more peculiarly situated to decide than the appellate court.\u201d <em>Dolson, supra, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>at 7, 258 A.2d 706.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The trial judge\u2019s granting of the motion for a new trial did not rest on the worth or plausibility of evidence, the credibility of witnesses, or other intangible factors not revealed by the record. Consequently, we \u201cmay review for excessiveness the jury\u2019s award[ ] based on an independent review of the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, 643 A.2d 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Stated broadly, punitive damage awards should be vacated as excessive where the amount clearly supports the inference that the jury acted out of mistake, passion, prejudice, or partiality; where it is so disproportionate as to shock the conscience; or where it would result in a manifest denial of justice. <em>Leimgruber v. Claridge Assocs., </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>450, 459, 375 A.2d 652 (1977). Our review of a punitive damage award must occur \u201cwith an appreciation that at the core of punitive damages lurks a volatile dilemma: the same findings necessary for the award of punitive damages can incite a jury to act irrationally.\u201d <em>Herman v. Sunshine Chem. Specialties, Inc., </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>329, 337, 627 A.2d 1081 (1993). Although a jury should consider all of the circumstances surrounding the event, including the nature of the wrongdoing, the extent of injury, the intent and wealth of the wrongdoer, as well as any mitigating evidence, <em>Leimgruber, supra, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 456, 375 A.2d 652, ultimately the award of punitive damages \u201cmust bear some reasonable relation to the injury inflicted and the cause of the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457, 375 A.2d 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">In <em>Maiorino v. Schering-Plough Corp., </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>323, 357, 695 A.2d 353 (App.Div.), <em>certif denied, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>189, 704 A.2d 19 (1997), the court vacated as shocking to the judicial conscience an $8 million punitive damage award where the compensatory dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>ages were set by the jury at $435,000. And in <em>Continental Trend Resources, Inc. v. OXY USA Inc., </em>101 F.3d 634 (10th Cir.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>1241, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>1846, 137 L.Ed.2d 1049 (1997), the court held as unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution a punitive damage award of $30 million in a commercial litigation involving actual damages of about $1 million. <em>Id. </em>at 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">On the other hand, in <em>Almog v. Israel Travel Advisory Service, Inc., </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>145, 149, 161, 689 A.2d 158 (App.Div.1997), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>361, 704 A.2d 1297 (1998), the court indicated in <em>dictum </em>that punitive damage awards of $4,500,000, where the compensatory damages were $1,324,000, and $1,000,000, where the compensatory damages were $40,000, represented acceptable ratios between compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s case law also provides guidance. In <em>Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Haslip, </em>499 <em>U.S. </em>1, 23-24, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1032, 1046, 113 L.Ed.2d 1, 23 (1991), the Supreme Court indicated that a punitive damage award that was four times the amount of the compensatory damages might be \u201cclose to the line ... of constitutional impropriety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In <em>TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>443, 460-62, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2711, 2721-23, 125 L.Ed.2d 366, 381-82 (1993), the Supreme Court sustained as constitutional a punitive damage award of $10 million, although the compensatory damages were only $19,000. But, the Court emphasized that in sustaining this judgment it was taking into account the \u201cmagnitude of the <em>potential harm </em>that the defendant\u2019s conduct would have caused to its intended victim if the wrongful plan had succeeded, as well as the possible harm to other victims that might have resulted if similar future behavior were not deterred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2721-22, 125 L.Ed.2d at 381. The Court explained that in referring to potential harm as a basis for allowing a high ratio, it meant harm that was <em>\u201clikely to result\u201d </em>from the defendant\u2019s tortious act. <em>Ibid. </em>(internal quotations omitted). In <em>TXO, </em>the victim was able to prove that its likely damages, in a well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>established business involving oil and gas drilling, were at least $1 million. <em>Id. </em>at 461-62, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2722, 125 L.Ed.2d at 381-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In <em>BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, </em>517 <em>U.S. </em>559, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996), the Court noted that it had permitted a 10:1 ratio in the <em>TXO </em>case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">Thus, in upholding the $10 million award in TXO, we relied on the difference between that figure and the harm to the victim that would have ensued if the tortious plan had succeeded. That difference suggested that the relevant ratio was not more than 10 to 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 581, 116 S.Ct at 1602, 134 L.Ed.2d at 830.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Although the <em>BMW </em>Court noted that it had consistently rejected the notion that the constitutional line is \u201cmarked by a simple mathematical formula,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 582, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1602, 134 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 830, it went on to make these pertinent remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">Indeed, low awards of compensatory damages may properly support a higher ratio than high compensatory awards, if, for example, a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages. A higher ratio may also be justified in cases in which the injury is hard to detect or the monetary value of non-economic harm might have been difficult to determine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 582, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1602, <em>134 L.Ed.2d </em>at 831.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">We are satisfied that in this case we are not dealing with a particularly egregious act, only one sufficiently egregious to allow punitive damages. Moreover, the injury was not difficult to detect, and the reasonably likely economic harm, the value of the second phase, was not difficult to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">Although plaintiff claims that the jury should have been permitted to consider the loss of the third-phase damages, the $400 million dollars in alleged lost profits, those damages were not likely to result from defendants\u2019 conduct. They were, as the trial judge properly determined, too speculative for consideration by a jury. If they were too speculative to be considered under the heading of compensatory damages, in our view they cannot be the reference point for a punitive damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">In reaching the conclusion that the trial judge did not err in vacating the punitive damage award, we need not, and expressly do not, reach the constitutional issue. Although we have referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>to the federal cases for guidance, our determination is based on New Jersey law and its rule that punitive damages with no reasonable relationship to the harm incurred may not be permitted to stand. <em>See Maiorino, supra, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 357, 695 A.2d 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In sum, considering the nature of the case, a claim for purely economic injury; the informality of the parties\u2019 dealings; the amount of actual harm inflicted; and the implausibility of plaintiffs claim that it was likely to suffer some $400 million in lost profits, we are satisfied, despite Bell\u2019s great wealth, that the $25 million punitive damage award was the result of mistake, passion, prejudice, or partiality and was so disproportionate to the harm done as to shock the court\u2019s conscience. Consequently, we cannot say, as would be necessary for plaintiff to prevail on this point, that the trial judge\u2019s decision to grant a new trial clearly caused \u201ca miscarriage of justice under the law.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">D. Plaintiff\u2019s Argument for a New Trial on Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">This argument is directed at the second trial, which resulted in a $1 million punitive damage award against defendants. Although defendants have offered arguments indicating that this second trial was unfair to them in certain respects, they do not contend, as part of their cross-appeal, that this judgment should be reversed. On the other hand, plaintiff strenuously argues that it is entitled to a new trial on punitive damages. However, that argument is based on the assumption that a new trial would somehow be limited to the amount of damages. We disagree with that assumption. Consequently, although we are satisfied that plaintiff is entitled to a new trial on the subject of its entitlement to punitive damages, in light of the lack of a cross-appeal, we will permit plaintiff to opt for retention of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The overarching problem that rendered the second trial unfair was confusion about what was to be tried. More specifically, the plaintiff, and the trial judge at times, treated the case as if the only issue was the amount of damages to be awarded. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>defendants, on the other hand, tried the case, with the indulgence of the judge, and over the objection of plaintiff, on the theory that plaintiff was required to prove fraud and that defendants\u2019 conduct was sufficiently egregious to warrant punitive damages. They were also permitted to argue that corporate liability for fraud had not been shown. That last argument was improper in the context of this trial in light of the position taken by defendants during the first phase of the first trial. <em>See Cummings, supra, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 385-88, 685 A.2d 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The problem arose from a misunderstanding of the law regarding retrial of a punitive damage claim. The judge and plaintiff assumed that a retrial on the punitive damage claim could be limited to consideration of the amount of damages. Apparently, they viewed a punitive damage retrial as similar to a retrial of compensatory damages where no error has occurred regarding the liability issues. <em>See, e.g., Caldwell v. Haynes, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>422, 643 A.2d 564 (1994); <em>Taweel v. Starn\u2019s Shoprite Supermarket, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>227, 276 A.2d 861 (1971). But that view is unsound; they are not similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The governing principal is that the limitation of a new trial to the ascertainment of the amount of damages can only be ordered where that issue is \u201centirely distinct and separable from the issue of liability; otherwise, such procedure would work a denial of a fundamental right.\u201d <em>Juliano v. Abeles, </em>114 <em>N.J.L. </em>510, 512, 177 A. 666 (N.J.Sup.1935). More recently, in <em>Ahn v. Kim, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>423, 678 A.2d 1073 (1996), the Court, after holding \u201cthat the issues of negligence and causation are so interrelated that both issues must be retried,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 434, 678 A.2d 1073, observed that \u201c[w]hether issues are sufficiently separable to warrant a partial retrial ultimately depends on the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434-35, 678 A.2d 1073.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">In <em>Abbamont v. Piscataway Township Board of Education, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>11, 634 A.2d 538 (App.Div.1993), <em>aff'd </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>405, 650 A.2d 958 (1994), an action arising under the Conscientious Employee Protection Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-1 to -8, plaintiff sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>compensatory and punitive damages. After the jury found liability and awarded compensatory damages, the trial judge dismissed the complaint. 269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 15, 634 A.2d 538. We reinstated the compensatory damage award and remanded for a trial \u201csolely on punitive damages.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">On remand, we leave it to the court to determine what facts are necessary for the plaintiff to hold the defendant liable for punitive damages, following the standard for liability for punitive damages set forth in <em>Lehmann [v. Toys R\u2019 Us, Inc., </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>587,] 624-25, 626 A.2d 445 [(1993)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">[Id. at 31, 634 A.2d 538.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Although plaintiff reads <em>Abbamont </em>as supporting the proposition that a new trial on punitive damages may be limited to an assessment of the amount of damages, the <em>Abbamont </em>jury never reached the issue of plaintiffs right to punitive damages. <em>Id. </em>at 20, 634 A.2d 538. Thus, it is obvious that the court was remanding for a full trial on punitive damages, including the question whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was sufficiently malicious or wanton to justify such an award. The court\u2019s citation of <em>Lehmann </em>confirms this point. Nonetheless, <em>Abbamont </em>supports the view that there are circumstances in which the right and amount of punitive damages may be retried without upsetting a jury\u2019s verdicts on liability for compensatory damages and the amount thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The validity of this view finds further support in <em>Ripa v. Owens-Coming Fiberglas Corp., </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>373, 660 A.2d 521 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>518, 665 A.2d 1111 (1995). This was a wrongful death, products liability ease, arising from exposure to asbestos. The jury awarded the plaintiff approximately $380,000 in compensatory damages and $5.5 million in punitive damages. <em>Id. </em>at 378, 660 A.2d 521. While sustaining the compensatory award but remanding for a new trial on the issues of plaintiffs right to punitive damages and the amount thereof, we said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">Where punitive damages are concerned, the nature of defendant\u2019s conduct and the probability that defendant\u2019s conduct caused the injuries are prime considerations. Since this matter is to be remanded for a retrial only on punitive damages, we recognize that, of necessity, there must be some recapitulation for the jury of the basis for both the compensatory and punitive damage awards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>[Id. </em>at 394, 660 A.2d 521.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In both <em>Abbamont </em>and <em>Ripa </em>the punitive damage issues could be tried separately before another jury precisely because the issue of plaintiffs right to punitive damages was not so interwoven with that of liability as to cause the kind of confusion and uncertainty that would give rise to an unfair trial. In <em>Abbamont, supra, </em>plaintiff was wrongly fired and received damages for back pay. 269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 15, 634 A.2d 538. Plaintiffs right to punitive damages depended on the entirely distinct issue of his ability to prove that upper management was involved. <em>Id. </em>at 31, 634 A.2d 538. In <em>Ripa, supra, </em>defendant\u2019s liability required only that plaintiff prove the minimal elements of a products liability case. To obtain punitive damages, plaintiff had the additional burden under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-5a<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of proving that defendant\u2019s acts or omissions were motivated by \u201cactual malice or accompanied by a wanton and willful disregard of the safety of product users, consumers, or others who foreseeably might be harmed by the product.\u201d <em>See </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 403, 660 A.2d 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">We see no difference in substance between the circumstances in <em>Abbamont </em>and <em>Ripa </em>and those present here. The right to punitive damages in this case turns on proof of elements that are distinct from the elements of fraud. Although much of the evidence that was presented in the fraud trial will no doubt be repeated in a retrial of punitive damages, it will be addressed to what is, in essence, a different cause of action, namely whether the defendant\u2019s conduct justified punitive damages under the principles of <em>Nappe, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">In reaching our conclusion that a separate trial may be had on the issue of plaintiffs right to punitive damages after a judge has vacated a punitive damage award as excessive, we recognize that a number of federal courts have come to the opposite view in cases involving fraud. <em>See, e.g., Mason v. Texaco, </em>948 F.2d 1546, 1561 (10th Cir.1991) <em>cert. denied, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>910, 112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>S.Ct. </em>1941, 118 L.Ed.2d 547 (1992); <em>Aldrich v. Thomson McKinnon Secs., Inc., </em>756 F.2d 243, 249 (2d Cir.1985); <em>Malandris v. Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, </em>703 F.2d 1152 (10th Cir.1981) <em>cert. denied, </em>464 <em>U.S. </em>824, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>92, 78 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>99 (1983); <em>Slater v. KFC Corp., </em>621 F.2d 932 (8th Cir.1980); and <em>Smyth Sales v. Petroleum Heat &amp; Power Co., </em>141 F.2d 41 (3rd Cir.1944). But we find more persuasive the contrary and more recent opinion expressed in <em>Atlas Food Systems and Services, Inc. v. Crane National Vendors, </em>99 F.3d 587 (4th Cir.1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">A district court\u2019s decision to order a new tidal falls within the district court\u2019s discretion, and the propriety of granting a new tidal on fewer than all of the issues in a ease hinges on whether the issues to be retried are sufficiently \u201cdistinct and separable from the others that a trial of [those issues] alone may be had without injustice.\u201d <em>Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refining Co., </em>283 <em>U.S. </em>494, 500, 51 <em>S.Ct. </em>513, 515, 75 <em>L.Ed. </em>1188 (1931). Considerations of economy, fairness, and repose may provide justification for preserving a jury\u2019s liability determination that has been fairly and fully made and ordering only a new trial on damages \u201cwhere there is no substantial indication that the liability and damage issues are inextricably interwoven, or that the first jury verdict was the result of a compromise of the liability and damage question.\u201d <em>Great Coastal Express, Inc. v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>511 F.2d 839, 846-47 (4th Cir.1975). We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant a partial new tidal for abuse of discretion. <em>See Swentek v. USAIR, Inc., </em>830 A.2d 552, 560 (4th Cir.1987); <em>Great Coastal Express, 511 </em>F.2d at 847.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">In this case, we find no indication in the record to support National Vendors\u2019 suggestion that the district court\u2019s decision to set aside the first jury\u2019s punitive damage award necessitated a full retrial on all issues because the jury\u2019s \u201cprejudice\u201d may have infected its rulings on Atlas\u2019 substantive claims. A jury\u2019s reasonable findings of liability and compensatory damages are not rendered unreasonable simply on the basis that it awarded an excessive amount of punitive damages. Moreover, in this ease, the district court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s liability and compensatory damage findings, and National Vendors has not appealed any of those rulings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">We also conclude that the district court\u2019s decision to limit the second tidal to punitive damage issues was not an abuse of discretion based on the interrelationship of punitive damage issues with other issues in the case. All of the evidence relating to National Vendors\u2019 willful or wanton conduct was before the second jury, enabling it to render a proper verdict on both the liability for and amount of punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 599-600 (alteration in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Although we have indicated our belief that plaintiff is entitled to a new trial, we have not as yet explained why in detail. We turn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>to that subject now. We will begin by describing the events leading up to the confusion that undercut the fairness of the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In the first trial, the judge erred by having the jury decide in the first phase the issues of liability, compensatory damages, <em>and </em>plaintiffs right to punitive damages. That course was inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Herman v. Sunshine Chemical Specialties, Inc., </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>329, 627 A.2d 1081 (1993). In that case, the Court held that the following provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-1 to -7, which deals with products liability actions, shall apply to \u201call claims for punitive damages, even those that arise outside the act.\u201d <em>Herman, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 346, 627 A.2d 1081.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">The trier of fact shall first determine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded. Evidence relevant only to punitive damages shall not be admissible in that proceeding. <em>After such determination has been made, the trier of fact shall, in a separate proceeding, determine whether punitive damages are to be awarded.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-5b (emphasis added).]<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The Court also explained that the amount of damages would be decided, as well, in the second proceeding. <em>Herman, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 342-343, 627 A.2d 1081.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">There was no objection to the trial judge\u2019s procedural approach, and in the context of the first trial the error caused no harm because the same jury decided all issues and no evidence bearing only on punitive damages was admitted in the first phase. But it would appear that resolution by the first jury of plaintiffs right to punitive damages in the first phase may have planted the seed that grew to undercut the fairness of the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">In his written opinion of December 5, 1996, vacating the $25 million award, the judge concluded by stating, \u201cIn the event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>plaintiffs do not accept remittitur, a retrial as to damages is ordered.\u201d In the ensuing order, he wrote that \u201cA TRIAL AS TO DAMAGES <em>ONLY </em>IS ORDERED .... [emphasis added].\u201d On December 19, 1996, the judge wrote to counsel for the purpose of \u201cclarifying] the remittitur Order.\u201d He added, \u201cPlease note that [the] provision in the Order relating to a retrial is limited to punitive damages.\u201d On December 20, 1996, plaintiff filed a pleading rejecting the remittitur and electing a new trial as to \u201cpunitive damages only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">On February 28, 1997, the judge had a hearing on defendants\u2019 \u201cmotion in limine concerning the scope of retrial.\u201d Defendants argued there had to be a retrial of the entire case if plaintiff rejected the remittitur. Plaintiff took the position that the issue of its entitlement to punitive damages was settled by the jury\u2019s verdict in the first phase of the first trial, which declared its entitlement to punitives. The judge agreed with plaintiff, stating \u201cthat the sole issue on retrial is the <em>quantum </em>of punitive damages.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">But shortly before the trial, at a hearing on April 28, 1997, the defendants\u2019 attorney claimed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">I may argue to this jury you may find he [Capuano] didn\u2019t do anything wrong, return zero, you may find he did something wrong and return less than 375, or you may decide he did something terribly wrong and return more than 375, but you\u2019ve got to base it on the facts in this courtroom yourselves.... Nobody can be bound by what that jury actually found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">Plaintiffs counsel replied</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-10\">He cannot say to this jury Mr. Capuano didn\u2019t do anything wrong ... because there\u2019s been a finding that they did commit fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">The Court replied, saying</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5-\">I believe they can, I believe he can take that position----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">At trial, the confusion began with plaintiff objecting when defense counsel repeatedly argued in his opening statement that the jury could find that no fraud had been committed, but the judge overruled the objections, even though he also said the second jury \u201cwill not change what the first jury decided.\u201d At the conclusion of defendants\u2019 summation, .plaintiff also objected to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>argument made therein that the evidence showed that defendants had done nothing wrong. The objection was overruled. Furthermore, the confusion was aggravated by defendants\u2019 summation, which began and ended with the argument that the first verdict was unjust. Defense counsel said at the beginning of his summation, \u201cI\u2019m trying to do my best because I represent a man [Capuano] who I think the facts show has been dealt an injustice. I\u2019m trying to deal with that injustice in the context of this case.\u201d At the end of his summation, he said of Capuano, \u201cThis guy \u2014 a wrong has been done to him and he has on his shoulder for the rest of his life this fraud verdict and don\u2019t pile on him, just don\u2019t pile on him, be fair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In charging the jury, the confusion continued when the judge failed to explain that the plaintiff was not automatically entitled to punitive damages simply because fraud had occurred. That is, he did not charge that punitive damages can only be awarded if the defendants\u2019 conduct was malicious or in wanton and willful disregard of plaintiffs rights. <em>Nappe, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 49, 477 A.2d 1224. Indeed, he did the opposite; he told the jury that it was bound by the first jury\u2019s determination that punitive damages were warranted. Nor for that matter did he charge that plaintiff had a burden of proof with respect to the issue submitted to the jury, namely the amount of damages based on consideration of the factors set forth in <em>Herman, supra, </em>the nature of the wrongdoing, the extent of harm, the defendants\u2019 intent, the defendants\u2019 financial condition, and the effect the judgment would have on the defendants. 133 <em>N.J. </em>at 337-38, 345, 627 A.2d 1081.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Plaintiff did not object to the charge. And, if, as we believe, plaintiff had the burden of proving the <em>Nappe </em>elements, the charge can be seen as unfairly beneficial to plaintiff. Clearly, the judge did not charge the <em>Nappe </em>elements because he viewed the entitlement to punitive damages to have been settled by the first jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Although plaintiff did not object to the charge, the errors in the charge are not the focus of its argument. Rather, plaintiffs point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>is that it was denied a fair trial because the judge permitted defendants to argue, as they did, that they had not committed fraud and even to argue that the first verdict was unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The defendants were doubtless frustrated by the failure of the judge to recognize the impropriety of a new trial limited to the amount of punitive damages. However, the recourse they chose, trying the case as if the judge had ruled in their favor, is indefensible, even though the judge did not prevent them from making their improper arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The result was utter confusion. And even though the jury awarded plaintiff punitive damages, we have no confidence in the proposition that the amount of damages was not adversely affected by defendants\u2019 strategy, as described above. Therefore, plaintiff is entitled to a new trial, if it so chooses; but that trial will have to address plaintiff\u2019s right to punitive damages under the principle set forth in <em>Nappe, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">In the second trial, plaintiff again argued that the jury should be allowed to consider evidence of \u201cpotential harm\u201d to plaintiff in assessing punitive damages. As before, plaintiff\u2019s reference here is to the $400 million claim for lost profits. As noted above, we agree with the judge\u2019s determination that this claim for compensatory damages was too speculative for consideration by a jury. Although that vast sum of money might be described as reflecting the potential harm- to the plaintiff, it is not a harm that occurred and it is not a harm that was likely to result from the fraud. Therefore, the judge was correct in refusing to allow the jury to determine punitive damages in relation to it. <em>BMW of North America v. Gore, </em>517 <em>U.S. </em>559, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>1589, 1601, 134 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d 809 (1996); <em>Pulla v.
