The trial court declared Section 3-9.3.2 of the Township\u2019s Ordinance No. 1325 to be invalid because pre-empted by State law insofar as it established different hours of solid waste collection than were provided in plaintiffs tariff approved by the Department of Environmental Protection. The matter was decided on cross-motions for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">The ordinance section under review provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-17\">Loading, unloading, opening, dosing or other handling of doors, boxes, crates, containers, building materials, liquids, garbage cans, refuse or similar objects, or the pneumatic or pumped loading or unloading of bulk materials in liquid, gaseous, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>powder or pellet form, or the compacting of refuse by persons engaged in the business of scavenging or garbage collection, whether private or municipal, shall not be allowed between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. in the B-1 Village Business, B-2 Neighborhood Business, B-3 Historic Business and B-4 Liberty Corner Business zones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">In deciding the matter, Judge Arnold rendered an oral opinion in which he summarized the background:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">Back in October 1994, the DEP approved the Uniform Tariff Application of Carmine Forgione &amp; Sons, which is a New Jersey licensed solid waste hauler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">In its application, Forgione &amp; Sons indicated that it provides garbage collection services in eight counties: Hunterdon, Middlesex, Moms, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex, Union and Warren.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">[The tariff provides for the pick-up of] waste between the hours of 5:30 a.m. and four p.m. There\u2019s no specification for individual hours of operation for individual municipalities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">... [F]our year\u2019s later, Bernards Township passes an ordinance number 1325. * <em>% </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">Basically, what they do is they knock off garbage collection time in the neighborhood business, [village] business, historic [business] and Liberty Corner business zones. It\u2019s allegedly done on the basis of a noise problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-12\">More specifically, you can\u2019t start collecting the garbage until seven o\u2019clock in the morning, as opposed to 5:30. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-13\">The question is, can they do that? The cases that I know about, and the cases that have been cited to me have all supported the general proposition that this is a State regulated business from start to finish. <em>C.I.C. [Corp. v. Township of East Brunswick, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 628 A.2d 753 (App.Div.1993), <em>aff'd o.b. </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>121, 638 A.2d 812 (1994) ] says here are the five factors to consider when evaluating a municipal ordinance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-14\">First, whether the ordinance conflicts with State law, either because of conflicting policies, or operational effect. Respectfully, I conclude that it does. This is a State-regulated industry for a whole variety of reasons expressed with respect to the various Statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-15\">Two, the State will intend to be exclusive in the field. Every case I\u2019ve looked at so indicates. Three, does the subject matter indicate something uniform? It seems to this Court that it does. Bernards Township doesn\u2019t want the garbage hauler collecting between 5:30 in the morning and seven o\u2019clock. Maybe the next township doesn\u2019t like another time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-16\">How this affects operation at dumps is a matter of speculation. I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s certainly not inconceivable that various municipalities would like their garbage collected at various times during the day. Don\u2019t do it during rush horn-, there\u2019s too much traffic anyway. We haven\u2019t built any roads in 40 years, the citizens don\u2019t care to build roads in our township. Bring the garbage through between ten and eleven in the morning, and et cetera.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>And the next factor, whether the State\u2019s scheme is so pervasive or comprehensive that it precludes coexistence of municipal regulation. I think it does. This is a highly regulated industry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">And whether the ordinance stands as an obstacle for the accomplishment of full purposes and objectives of the Legislature, respectfully, I think it does. This Court holds that the Bernards Township Ordinance fails all of these tests. It conflicts with the specific operational approval granted to Forgione &amp; Sons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">State law governs in this area, among other things. The Solid Waste Management Act was intended to provide a comprehensive regulatory scheme. There\u2019s a need for uniformity. The ordinance is an obstacle to it, and it\u2019s an obstacle to the specific grant of authority granted to the hauler, and to the intent of the Solid Waste Management Act to centralize control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">... [T]here\u2019s not ... one [case cited], respectfully, that gives this Court the slightest inkling that this ordinance is valid, in light of all these factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">I recognize it\u2019s a narrowly drawn ordinance, it just knocks an hour-and-a-half of garbage collection time off in the morning. And the basic ai\u2019gument of Bernards Township is: Judge, it\u2019s only an hour-and-a-half, you know, it\u2019s no big deal. Thai\u2019s what their papers say generally. It\u2019s not like the other cases where municipalities try to do a good deal more with respect to the operations of the hauler. And that\u2019s purely a matter of speculation. I think the hauler\u2019s arguments that these matters do not have minimal impact, is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">Therefore, Bernards Township\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied. Plaintiff, Carmine Forgione &amp; Sons\u2019 cross motion for summary judgment is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">We are in substantial agreement with Judge Arnold\u2019s reasoning. His understanding of principles of state pre-emption was correct, <em>see Overlook Terrace Mgmt. Corp. v. Rent Control Bd., </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>451, 461-62, 366 A.2d 321 (1976), and his judgment in applying those concepts to the facts of this case was impeccable. The State agency with authority to administer the field has spoken with respect to the hours of solid waste collection. The Township may not impose a conflicting rule. <em>See C.I.C. Corp. v. Township of East Brunswick, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 6-8, 628 A.2d 753 (App.Div.1993), aff<em>'d o.b., </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>121, 638 A.2d 812 (1994); <em>Mannie\u2019s Cigarette Service, Inc. v. Town of West New York, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>343, 348, 613 A.2d 494 (App.Div.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">This is not to deprecate the significance of the Township\u2019s interest in noise control and the quality of life within its borders. As important and legitimate as those concerns are as bases for invoking municipal police powers, however, they may not be promoted at the cost of interfering with plenary and uniform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>control of a field of activity which, in the public interest, has been committed by law to the regulatory authority of the State. <em>Chester Twp. v. Panicucci, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>94, 99-100, 299 A.2d 385 (1973); <em>State v. Ulesky, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>26, 29, 252 A.2d 720 (1969); <em>Summer v. Teaneck Twp., </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>548, 552-55, 251 A.2d 761 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Nothing prevents the Township, alone or in combination with other municipalities having a common interest, from seeking authority from the Legislature to regulate the hours of solid waste collection, at least to some extent; and we are aware of no impediment to the Township\u2019s right to be heard on the issue when the terms governing plaintiffs activities,- <em>i.e., </em>its tariff, are next considered! We hold only that the Township is not empowered unilaterally to substitute its judgment on matters of day-to-day operation for that of the State agency to whose authority and control the Legislature has delegated this highly regulated subject matter area.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
