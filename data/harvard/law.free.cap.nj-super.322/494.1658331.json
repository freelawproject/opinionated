By leave granted, plaintiff and NJNG appeal a post-verdict order granting a new trial as to liability. Rossi appeals from the denial of his motion for a new trial as to damages. The new trial order permits Rossi to argue plaintiffs comparative negligence by introducing evidence of her failure to heed NJNG\u2019s employee safety manual by not taking due care in attempting to read Rossi\u2019s meter when warned that a \u201cbad dog\u201d may be present. The order also permits Rossi to pursue a third-party claim against NJNG based on NJNG\u2019s negligence in failing to train plaintiff properly to avoid danger when confronted by a \u201cbad dog.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">We reverse. Under the so-called \u201cdog bite\u201d statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:19-16, Rossi was strictly liable for plaintiffs injuries. There was no evidence adduced during trial supporting a finding that plaintiff incited Rossi\u2019s dog or voluntarily and unreasonably exposed herself to a known risk. There is therefore no basis in law to submit the issue of plaintiffs negligence to the jury. We also reverse the order submitting NJNG\u2019s negligence to the jury. Because NJNG is plaintiffs employer, it is not subject to the Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-1 to -5. Therefore, Rossi may not seek contribution from NJNG. Finally, we reverse the order denying Rossi\u2019s motion for a new trial as to damages. The trial court erred in admitting into evidence the fact that Rossi\u2019s dog had bitten three other persons, including Rossi himself, prior to the dog bite suffered by plaintiff. The evidence was therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>irrelevant and had the clear capacity to inflame the jury in its deliberation on the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Plaintiff Ellen Pingaro filed a complaint against defendant Joseph Rossi alleging that she had been bitten by Rossi\u2019s dog on June 27, 1996, during the course of her employment as a meter reader for NJNG.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rossi answered and filed a third-party complaint against NJNG alleging that NJNG breached an agreement with him that meter readers would not enter his backyard unless someone was home to secure his dogs. He requested indemnification for any judgment awarded to plaintiff. Prior to trial the trial court ruled that Rossi was strictly liable under the \u201cdog bite\u201d statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:19-16. It also ruled that Rossi would not be permitted to introduce evidence of plaintiffs comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">During trial plaintiff testified that on June 27, 1996, while performing her meter reading duties for NJNG, she was assigned a route in Beachwood, Ocean County. When she arrived at Rossi\u2019s house, her data cap, a hand-held computer, \u201cbeeped\u201d a message: \u201c[b]ad dog, knock.\u201d The data cap provides the meter reader with the name of the street and location of the meter and at times displays specialized messages pertaining to the customer, such as whether a \u201cbad dog\u201d may be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">According to plaintiff, she had never been to Rossi\u2019s home before. She knocked on Rossi\u2019s door but received no answer. She proceeded to the fenced-in backyard, rattled the gate and her keys and yelled \u201cgas company.\u201d There was no response. She looked around the backyard for dogs or other animals. After satisfying herself that the yard was clear, she unhooked the gate and walked towards the meter. Immediately upon entering the back yard two dogs approached her. One dog, a large German Shepard, jumped up, knocked her down and bit her on both arms, legs and head. She subdued the dog by hitting it with her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>flashlight, exited the yard and called for help. A nearby construction worker summoned an ambulance which took her to Community Medical Center where she received numerous stitches and was released later that afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Plaintiff was out of work for approximately six weeks. She was unable to engage in her normal activities for about one month. She treated with both a chiropractor and a physical therapist following the attack, the former for about six to eight months, and the latter for approximately four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The attack did not result in any long term physical disabilities, outside of some permanent scarring on her arms and one scar on her leg. However, plaintiff has suffered anxiety, fear and depression related to the incident. She saw a therapist on one occasion. Plaintiff filed for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits for her disability arising from her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Rossi testified that the dog which attacked plaintiff was kept fenced in his backyard. The only gate to the backyard was the gate utilized by plaintiff in entering the yard. He stated that a large \u201cBeware of Dog\u201d sign was posted on the gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">According to Rossi, over the course of ten years he had spoken with several meter readers about his dog and told them they should not enter his yard if no one was home. The meter readers responded that they would comply with his request. Rossi noted that this arrangement had worked for over ten years, and when he was not at home the meter readers would estimate his bill, leave a card for him to mail in or come back at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Counsel for NJNG questioned Rossi about whether he had ever told NJNG that his dog had bitten people in the past. Rossi\u2019s counsel objected, arguing that the question was irrelevant because Rossi\u2019s liability had been established as a matter of law. Counsel for NJNG argued that the question was probative of the existence of the purported agreement between Rossi and NJNG. After the objection was overruled, Rossi admitted that his dog had previously bitten his sister-in-law, nephew and himself. He also admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>that he had not notified anyone at NJNG about the prior bites. After the dog\u2019s bite history was elicited by counsel for NJNG, plaintiffs counsel questioned Rossi extensively about the three previous occasions his dog had bitten people.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Thomas Waldron, an NJNG meter reader who had serviced Rossi\u2019s residence prior to plaintiffs injuries, confirmed that he had -spoken with Rossi about his dog, and had accommodated his request that he not enter the yard if no one was home. However, he denied that he had entered into a formal agreement with Rossi. According to Waldron, while reading Rossi\u2019s meter on one occasion, Rossi\u2019s dog chased him and \u201c[i]t appeared that the dog wanted to kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $300,000, and $2,000 to her husband on his per quod claim. It also found that Rossi had sustained his burden of proving that NJNG \u201cis responsible, in whole or in part, for the incident on the basis of a contractual obligation.\u201d The jury apportioned fault sixty-five percent and thirty-five percent against Rossi and NJNG respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Rossi filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or alternatively for a new trial. The trial court denied Rossi\u2019s request for a new trial as to damages, but granted a new trial as to liability. It concluded that Rossi should have been permitted to introduce evidence of plaintiffs comparative negligence. The court further ruled that a new trial was necessary to assess the comparative negligence of NJNG based on its negligent failure to train or instruct plaintiff on how to respond when confronted by a \u201cbad dog.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in granting a new trial as to liability for the jury to consider plaintiffs conduct as a basis for comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The so-called \u201cdog bite\u201d statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:19-16, reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">The owner of any dog which shall bite a person while such person is on or in a public place, or lawfully on or in a private place, including the property of the owner of the dog, shall be liable for such damages as may be suffered by the person bitten, regardless of the former vieiousness of such dog or the owner\u2019s knowledge of such viciousness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">There is no question that plaintiff fulfilled the three elements necessary to establish Rossi\u2019s liability under the statute. Rossi was the owner of the dog, the dog bit plaintiff and the bite occurred while plaintiff was lawfully on Rossi\u2019s property. <em>DeRobertis v. Randazzo, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>144, 151, 462 A.2d 1260 (1983). Satisfaction of the elements of the statute imposes strict liability upon Rossi for damages sustained by plaintiff. <em>Jannuzzelli v. Wilkens, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>36, 39, 385 A.2d 322 (App.Div.1978); <em>Tanga v. Tanga, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>5, 12, 226 A.2d 723 (App.Div.1967). The trial court made a pretrial ruling that plaintiffs comparative negligence was not an issue. The court therefore excluded any evidence concerning plaintiffs conduct prior to and at the time of the dog bite. However, as noted, the court reversed itself after trial, concluding that a new trial on liability was necessary in order to permit Rossi to produce evidence of plaintiffs alleged deviation from NJNG\u2019s safety policies and procedures by attempting to read the meter knowing that a \u201cbad dog\u201d may be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Even before adoption of the comparative negligence statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.1 to -5.3, we held that contributory negligence may bar recovery under the \u201cdog bite\u201d statute. <em>Foy v. Dayko, </em>82 <em>N.J.Super. </em>8, 13, 196 A.2d 535 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>602, 198 A.2d 446 (1964). In <em>Foy, </em>we observed that \u201cwe are not persuaded that the Legislature intended ... to make an owner liable for injuries by dog bite where the injured person\u2019s <em>own careless or provocative conduct was a contributory causal factor in the mischance.\u201d Ibid. </em>(emphasis added). In <em>Foy, </em>plaintiff was prevented from entering a tavern with his own dog. He confronted the tavern owner\u2019s dog and began making \u201cgrr, grr, grr\u201d sounds and aggravated the dog by making motions. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 196 A.2d 535. When the two dogs began fighting, plaintiff attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>to separate them and he was scratched in the process. <em>Ibid. </em>We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">[T]he patent indefensibility of allowing a person who provokes an animal into attacking him from recovery of damages from its owner has led practically all courts which have considered the question to allow such a defense as against a statutory cause of action not expressly mentioning it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 13, 196 A.2d 535.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Aside from provocation, the \u201ccareless\u201d conduct found by the court justifying consideration of the contributory negligence issue was plaintiffs voluntary exposure to a known risk by getting between the two fighting dogs resulting in his injury. <em>Id. </em>at 14, 196 A.2d 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The Court in <em>DeRobertis, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 144, 462 A.2d 1260, held that, in the context of absolute liability (where the owner has knowledge of the vicious propensity of his dog), plaintiffs contributory negligence is available to the dog owner under the Comparative Negligence Act. <em>Id. </em>at 156, 462 A.2d 1260. The Court adopted the rationale of the strict product liability cases which hold that to establish that plaintiffs contributory negligence is a contributing proximate cause of his injury, \u201cdefendant must show that the plaintiff with actual acknowledge of the danger posed by the defective product voluntarily and unreasonably encountered that risk.\u201d <em>Cartel Capital Corp. v. Fireco of New Jersey, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>548, 562-63, 410 A.2d 674 (1980); <em>Cf. Cepeda v. Cumberland Eng\u2019g Co., Inc., </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>152, 185, 386 A.2d 816 (1978) (holding that \u201ccontributory negligence in the sense of mere carelessness or inadvertence\u201d is not a defense in strict liability cases), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, Suter v. San Angelo Foundry &amp; Mach. Co., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>150, 177, 406 A.2d 140 (1979). In <em>Budai v. Teague, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>522, 525, 515 A.2d 822 (Law Div.1986), the Law Division held that the <em>DeRobertis </em>rule, although addressing \u201cabsolute liability\u201d cases, should apply as well to strict liability claims under the \u201cdog-bite\u201d statute. The court held that for contributory negligence to be presented to the jury, defendant must show that \u201cplaintiff knew the dog had a propensity to bite either because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the dog\u2019s known viciousness or because of the plaintiffs deliberate acts intended to incite the animal.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The <em>DeRoberbis </em>rationale is consistent with Dean Prosser\u2019s treatment of contributory negligence in the dog-bite setting. He states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">Thus, a plaintiff who is injured by the defendant\u2019s dangerous animal is not barred from recovery by his own lack of ordinary care in failing to discover its presence, or in inadvertently coming in contact with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">[Prosser <em>&amp; Keeton on Torts </em>\u00a7 79 at 565 (5th ed.1984).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">However:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">a plaintiff who voluntarily and unreasonably comes within reach of an animal which he knows to be dangerous, or intentionally irritates or provokes it, has no cause of action when it attacks him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-10\">[Id. at 566.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">In our view, application of this comparative negligence model to the \u201cdog-bite\u201d statute is compatible with its application in other strict liability settings and underscores the purpose of the statute: that \u201cowners should as the social price of keeping [dogs] compensate those innocently sustaining injury in that fashion.\u201d <em>Tanga, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 14, 226 A.2d 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">Here, it is conceded that plaintiff did not provoke Rossi\u2019s dog. Further, plaintiff hardly entered the yard knowing that the \u201cbad dog\u201d was present and voluntarily exposed herself to the danger of being attacked by it. She did not deliberately and unreasonably encounter the dog, knowing that it was dangerous. Although she had been alerted that a \u201cbad dog\u201d may be present, when she arrived at the Rossi residence she saw no signs of the dog. She knocked on the door, rattled the gate and her keys and shouted \u201cgas company.\u201d Only when there was no evidence of the presence of the \u201cbad dog\u201d did she enter the yard where she was suddenly attacked by it. That \u201cencounter\u201d was hardly deliberate or voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">The trial court was of the view that plaintiffs failure to heed NJNG\u2019s safety manual and policies pertaining to meter readers\u2019 exposure to dogs justified the presentation of plaintiffs negligence to the jury on retrial. According to Rossi, he was prepared to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>demonstrate that NJNG\u2019s manual warned meter readers to look for signs that an animal is present and \u201cdon\u2019t go into yards ... until you\u2019re sure all pets have been properly restrained.\u201d Further, an NJNG\u2019s supervisor had testified in deposition that, in the presence of a \u201cBeware of Dog\u201d sign on the gate and plaintiffs knowledge of the presence of a \u201cbad dog,\u201d her entry into the yard was not a \u201csafe procedure.\u201d However, even assuming a violation of NJNG\u2019s safety policies, that violation would constitute a \u201clack of ordinary care in failing to discover\u201d the presence of the dog, <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts, supra, </em>at \u00a7 79 at 565, rather than a voluntary exposure to a known risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Rossi argues that the trial court\u2019s error in admitting into evidence prior incidents involving the dog \u201cprejudiced the jury so as to taint the [damage] verdict.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">As noted, the trial court permitted evidence that prior to plaintiffs injuries, Rossi\u2019s dog had bitten Rossi\u2019s sister-in-law, nephew, and had even bitten Rossi himself, requiring twenty- - seven stitches to the arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">In order for plaintiff to prevail under the \u201cdog-bite\u201d statute, she need not prove scienter; that is, that Rossi knew of the dog\u2019s dangerous propensities. <em>See DeRobertis, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 151, 462 A.2d 1260 (holding that under the dog-bite statute, \u201ceven owners without scienter\u201d become liable upon satisfaction of the statutory elements); <em>see also Nicholes v. Lorenz, </em>396 <em>Mich. </em>53, 237 N.W.2d 468, 472 (1976) (holding that one who brings action under a \u201cdog-bite\u201d statute is not required to establish dog\u2019s past conduct or owners knowledge thereof). Therefore, evidence of the dog bites suffered by three other persons was entirely irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The trial court admitted the evidence on the basis that it was relevant to the purported agreement between Rossi and NJNG that meter readers would not enter the premises if Rossi was not at home. The court reasoned that Rossi\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>report these prior incidents to NJNG cast doubt upon the existence of such an agreement. However, the relevance of the three prior dog bites suffered by individuals unrelated to NJNG was marginal at best, and its questionable probative value was substantially outweighed by the risk of prejudice to Rossi. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403(a). Under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403, the \u201cmore attenuated and the less probative the evidence, the more appropriate it is for a judge to exclude it....\u201d <em>State v. Medina, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>565, 580, 493 A.2d 623 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>298, 508 A.2d 185 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The prejudice to Rossi was substantial. After the jury was told about the three prior bites, plaintiffs counsel on cross-examination focused on the evidence and asked Rossi whether his dog was \u201ctrained to attack.\u201d He also asked whether, when the dog bit Rossi\u2019s sister-in-law, she was \u201csimply walking in the backyard\u201d and whether he had told NJNG that his ten-year old nephew had been \u201cattacked\u201d by the dog, or that defendant\u2019s own injuries from his bite required \u201ctwenty-seven stitches.\u201d The prejudice to Rossi was enhanced by plaintiffs counsel\u2019s summation, when he argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">An apology? <em>Maybe you should have apologized when your sister-in-law Christine got attacked by this dog in 1986. </em>And maybe you should have then made an arrangement with New Jersey Natural Gas Company to move the meter. But, I can understand. <em>That\u2019s [one, one] attack. Then 7 months later when a 10 year old boy gets attacked walking in the backyard, </em>you might want to do something else. You certainly might want to then contact New Jersey Natural Gas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">But maybe, you know, use your common sense. That\u2019s probably not on your mind when someone gets attacked by a dog. \u201cWell, let me go call the gas company and the Bell Atlantic and, and the electric company in case they come.\u201d No. <em>But when Tom Waldron of the gas company gets attacked, and as he said, \u201cBoy, I almost got killed. If that dog had gotten between me and the gate </em>(whiff sound). It\u2019s over for me.\u201d When that happens and he clearly discussed that with Mr. Rossi, that\u2019s the time. \u201cBoy, okay. We\u2019ve got to end it now. A 10 year old person. My sister-in-law and you? Okay. Let\u2019s do something. Let\u2019s move the meter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-11\">What more could he have done? How about that? <em>Then when you get bit yourself and you take 27 stitches, well, it maybe time to do something with the dog. </em>Ellen had no idea when she walked into that gate what was going to confront her. The dog had a habit of laying in wait. Not making a sound until you got in. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>fortunately for Tom Waldron he got out. Unfortunately for Ellen Pingaro, she didn\u2019t. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In our view, this argument was intended to submerge the issues of liability and focus on punishing Rossi for the dog\u2019s prior conduct. The evidence and argument had the clear capacity to inflame the jury\u2019s emotions based on Rossi\u2019s inaction in the face of the dog\u2019s dangerous propensities in its deliberation of the damage issue. The harm of prejudice was accentuated by virtue of the fact that the trial court failed to give any limiting instruction on the manner by which the jury should use the evidence of the dog\u2019s prior conduct. <em>DeMary v. Rieker, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>208, 218, 695 A.2d 294 (App.Div.1997). We therefore reverse the order denying Rossi\u2019s motion for a new trial on damages and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Rossi argues that the trial court improperly submitted his demand for indemnification against NJNG to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The trial court submitted to the jury the question whether Rossi \u201csustained the burden of proving that [NJNG] was responsible in whole or in part for the incident on the basis of a contractual obligation.\u201d The \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d was Rossi\u2019s claim that NJNG agreed not to permit meter readers on his premises when he was not at home. The jury found in favor of Rossi on this point and, as noted, apportioned fault against Rossi and NJNG in the amount of sixty-five percent and thirty-five percent respectively. The court set aside this aspect of the verdict, concluding that \u201cnotice from [Rossi to NJNG] did not rise to the level of indemnification for this action. I\u2019m ruling that as a matter of law that the fact that [Rossi] notified the company [of the danger of his dog] does not make [NJNG] insurers for [Rossi].\u201d Nevertheless, the court resubmitted the liability of NJNG to the jury as part of the new trial because of evidence that NJNG may have been negligent in failing to train plaintiff as to the means of preventing injury to herself when confronted with a \u201cbad dog.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Rossi now argues that his demand for indemnification should have been decided by the trial court \u201cas an all or nothing proposition\u201d and, in any event, since the jury found that NJNG breached the agreement, he should be fully indemnified by NJNG for the jury verdict. NJNG argues that its comparative fault should not have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Before we address Rossi\u2019s argument, we reverse the new trial order submitting the question of NJNG\u2019s \u201cnegligence\u201d to the jury.' Plaintiff is an employee of NJNG and was injured while in the course of that employment. She recovered workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the injury. Therefore, her rights and the rights and duties of NJNG and Rossi as \u201ca third-party tortfeasor, are governed by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-1 to-127.\u201d <em>Ramos v. Browning Ferris Indus. of South Jersey, Inc., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>177, 183, 510 A.2d 1152 (1986). Rossi, as a third-party tortfeasor, may not obtain contribution from NJNG no matter what may be its comparative negligence, because NJNG cannot be a joint tortfeasor under New Jersey\u2019s Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-1 to -5. <em>Accord Stephenson v. R.A. Jones &amp; Co., Inc., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>194, 199, 510 A.2d 1161 (1986); <em>Ruvolo v. United States Steel Corp., </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>578, 583, 354 A.2d 685 (Law Div.1976). Since NJNG is not a joint tortfeasor, it is not subject to contributory liability under the Comparative Negligence Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-1 to -5.8. <em>See Stephenson, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 199, 510 A.2d 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Rossi seeks 100% recovery against NJNG based on implied or express indemnification derived from his so-called agreement with NJNG. Generally, a third party \u201cmay recover on a theory of implied indemnity from an employer only when a special legal relationship exists between the employer and the third party, and the liability of the third party is vicarious.\u201d <em>Ramos, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 188-89, 510 A.2d 1152 (citing <em>Arcell v. Ashland Chem. Co., Inc., </em>152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 488-89, 378 A.2d 53 (Law Div.1977)). Examples of such a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d include that of principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>and agent, bailor and bailee, and lessor and lessee. <em>Ramos, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 189, 510 A.2d 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">No special relationship existed between Rossi and NJNG. At most, some of NJNG\u2019s meter readers had agreed not to read Rossi\u2019s meter when he was not home because of the danger posed by Rossi\u2019s dog. Also, Rossi\u2019s liability was not vicarious. He was found strictly liable for plaintiffs injuries because his dog bit plaintiff who was lawfully on his premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Further, as a general rule, a party who is at fault cannot obtain indemnification for its own acts. <em>Cartel Capital Corp., supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 566, 410 A.2d 674. The jury found that Rossi was sixty-five percent at fault. However, a party \u201cwho in good faith and at the direction of another commits a tort is allowed indemnity against the person who caused him to act.\u201d <em>Ramos, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 190, 510 A.2d 1152. This exception is inapplicable because, when Rossi\u2019s dog bit plaintiff, he was not following NJNG\u2019s directions. In short, Rossi has no claim based on a theory of implied indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not bar an employer from assuming a contractual duty to indemnify a third party through an express agreement. <em>Ramos, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 191, 510 A.2d 1152. Such an express indemnification contract \u201c \u2018is to be construed in accordance with the rules for the construction of contracts generally....\u2019\u201d <em>Mautz v. J.P. Patti Co., </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 19, 688 A.2d 1088 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>472, 700 A.2d 883 (1997) (quoting <em>Doloughty v. Blanchard Const. Co., </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>110, 116, 352 A.2d 613 (Law Div.1976)). In ascertaining the intention of the parties, we must consider the \u201c \u2018surrounding circumstances and the objects sought to be attained by the parties under their agreement.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Further, when the agreement is ambiguous, it is to be strictly construed against the indemnitee. <em>Ramos, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 191, 510 A.2d 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Rossi fails to demonstrate that NJNG had a duty to indemnify as a result of an express agreement. Initially, we note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>that nothing in the record even suggests that NJNG, a public utility having the power to enter a customer\u2019s yard for the purpose of reading meters,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> gave past meter readers actual authority to bind the utility to an agreement that all NJNG meter readers would provide such an accommodation in the future. <em>See Sears Mortgage Corp. v. Rose, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>326, 337, 634 A.2d 74 (1993). Nor can it be said that the past meter readers had the apparent authority to bind NJNG to such an agreement. <em>See Lampley v. Davis Mach. Corp., </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>540, 548, 530 A.2d 1254 (App.Div.1987) (stating that \u201c[ajpparent authority arises when a principal acts in such a manner as to convey the impression to a third party that the agent has certain power which he may or may not possess\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In any event, the \u201cobject[] sought to be attained,\u201d <em>Mautz, supra, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 19, 688 A.2d 1088, was hardly an expression by NJNG to make itself an insurer of Rossi for injuries sustained by persons lawfully on his premises as a result of attacks by his dog. The meter readers\u2019 purported promise not to read the meter if Rossi was not at home was to accommodate him, not an agreement to hold him harmless in the event his dog bit an NJNG employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial on damages.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\"> Plaintiff Ronald Pingaro asserts a <em>per quod </em>claim. For ease of reference we will refer to plaintiff, Ellen Pingaro, as plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\"> According to NJNG\u2019s counsel, NJNG's tariff provides that meter readers \u201cshall have free access to the Customer\u2019s premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of reading meters</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
