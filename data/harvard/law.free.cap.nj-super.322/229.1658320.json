The thrust of their ensuing lawsuit is that Enclave rejected Murray as a tenant because of his race. Enclave settled with Murray and obtained summary judgment as to Berner (hereinafter referred to as plaintiff) on the grounds of his lack of standing, as he is Caucasian and not the individual discriminated against. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Plaintiff was an owner of a unit in a condominium building which Enclave administers and manages. It is conceded that the leasing of the unit must be approved by Enclave. In November 1995, plaintiff executed a lease of his unit to Murray. It seems fairly clear that Enclave would not approve Murray as a tenant. The reasons therefor are disputed. In support of its motion for summary judgment, Enclave stated as a material fact, which plaintiff admitted, see <em>R. </em>4:46-2(a),(b), that Enclave had expressed a concern that the prospective tenant\u2019s \u201cmonthly income was not sufficient to pay the rental amount.\u201d On the other hand, in their joint arbitration memorandum, incorporated by reference in the reply to the statement of material facts, plaintiffs asserted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">On December 15, 1995 Mr. Murray arrived at The Enclave. He had with him an executed lease, registration statement, occupancy permit receipt, telephone deposit receipt and Grace Knupp Realty receipts for the first month\u2019s rent and security deposit. Mr. Murray was greeted by Ernest Jackson a security guard working at The Enclave. Mr. Murray displayed his lease to Mr. Jackson as an explanation of his need to gain access to the building. Mr. Murray was referred to the Condominium Manager, John Loucks. Mr. Murray told Mr. Loucks that he was there to pick up the key to unit 1107 for the purposes of taking occupancy. He handed Mr. Loucks his lease, registration statement and occupancy permit receipt, his receipt for the first month\u2019s rent and security deposit. Mr. Loucks took all of these documents into a back room. Mr. Loucks returned shortly and returned the originals to Mr. Murray. Mr. Loucks then made several phone calls. He called Grace Knupp Realty and Melvin Berner. He also had a conference call between Grace Knupp Realty and Melvin Berner to confirm Mr. Murray\u2019s tenancy. Finally, he called Samuel Davis, President of the condominium association and the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>member of the condominium\u2019s rental committee. Mr. Davis was advised that a tenant who had not yet been interviewed was there to take occupancy of unit 1107. Mr. Loueks asked Mr. Davis if he should allow Mr. Murray to move in that day. Mr. Davis told Mr. Loueks \u201clet him upstairs, I\u2019ll talk to him tomorrow.\u201d (John Loueks Deposition, p. 90). Mr. Davis then asked Mr. Loueks what Mr. Murray was like. Mr. Loueks told Mr. Davis that \u201cHe\u2019s a young black gentleman. He has everything he needs.\u201d (John Loueks Deposition, p. 90). Mr. Davis then told Mr. Loueks \u201clet him [Mr. Murray] come back tomorrow morning and I\u2019ll meet with him and straighten it out then.\u201d (John Loueks Deposition, p. 90). Mr. Loueks gave Mr. Murray with [sic] the rules and regulations of The Enclave Condominium. Mr. Murray signed a receipt acknowledging having read and received The Enclave\u2019s rules. Mr. Loueks retained the signature page of the rules and regulations for Mr. Murray\u2019s tenant file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">Mr. Murray left The Enclave Condominium and rented a room at the Econo Lodge for the night of December 15, 1995. The next morning Mr. Murray went to The Enclave along with his friend Darrell Kelly. Upon them arrival Mr. Murray was met by Rob Raynore the Assistant Condominium Manager. According to Mr. Raynore, Mr. Murray had supplied all of the necessary paperwork and that \u201che was okay to move-in.\u201d (Robert Raynore deposition, p. 88). Mr. Murray was told that Mr. Davis was expecting him. Mr. Murray then waited for Mr. Davis in the lobby from approximately 9:00 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. During those hours he asked several times when Mr. Davis would be available to conduct the interview. Each time Mr. Murray was advised that he was in a meeting and would be available to meet with him \u201cshortly\u201d. The Condominium meeting did not start until 10 a.m. which was after Mr. Murray had arrived and was waiting. (Julie Essey Deposition). Mr. Murray and Mr. Kelly continued to wait in the lobby for Mr. Davis. At approximately 1:00 p.m. Mr. Raynore delivered a message to Mr. Davis that Mr. Murray had been waiting since 9:00 a.m. At 2:15 p.m., three board members, Defendants Mr. Davis, Mr. Nick Gomez (deceased and complaint dismissed), and Mr. Howard Ozeroff arrived in the lobby together. Mr. Raynore gave the Murray tenant file to the Defendant board members, who then interviewed Mr. Murray.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">... The interview lasted approximately 20 minutes. During the interview Mr. Murray was interrogated about his occupation and his finances, although the financial ability to pay the monthly rent was only relevant to the unit owner, not the Board. (Deposition of Howard Ozeroff). Nevertheless, Mr. Murray explained that he had just started a new job at the Tramp Taj Mahal Casino, assured the Board members that he could afford the rent and informed them he had already placed the utilities in his name. He displayed his lease and receipts to the three men, who passed the documents amongst themselves. He then displayed his bank statement, which showed he had over $40,000 in liquid assets. He then assured the defendant board members that he had more than enough finances to keep the rent current for the year and even had the ability to pay the entire year\u2019s rent in advance. Defendant board members asked how Mr. Murray had received these funds and he explained that it was the result of a lawsuit from an accident when he was very young. Also, during the interrogation the three men told Mr. Murray that he could not walk in bare feet in the braiding, he would have to pay an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>additional amount for a access chip and that he would not be allowed to have more than one guest at a time in his unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">The three men examined Mr. Murray\u2019s lease and all other documents in his file and those that he had provided and they told him that he would be happier living elsewhere and that it would be financially better for him to obtain housing which was less expensive in another building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">At the conclusion of the interrogation, the defendants told Mr. Murray that he would be contacted by a member of the Condominium Association in the next couple of days at which time they would let him know whether or not he had been accepted as a tenant. At no time during the interview did Mr. Davis, Mr. Ozeroff or Mr. Gomez ask Mr. Murray for a phone number or address to contact him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The tenant was never thereafter contacted by Enclave and never given a key to the unit. The clear implication of this, of course, is the type of invidious discrimination the Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -49, was designed to eradicate. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-3; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12h. <em>See generally Fuchilla v. Layman, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>319, 334, 537 A.2d 652, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>826, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>75, 102 L.Ed.2d 51 (1988).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">In granting Enclave summary judgment as to plaintiff, the motion judge, focusing upon <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-3 and our decision in <em>Catalane v. Gilian Instrument Corp., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 638 A.2d 1341 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>298, 642 A.2d 1006 (1994), said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">I\u2019m satisfied that the reading of 10:5-3 is consistent with the interpretation by <em>Catalane. </em>The plain reading of the statute says, \u201cThe Legislature declares its opposition to such practices of discrimination when directed against any person.\u201d That\u2019s what it talks about. It talks about the discrimination being directed against any person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-11\">And that\u2019s the language that <em>Catalane </em>cited. They cited that verbatim. Cause of action for any person and they got that right from 10:5-3, the second paragraph. Then that paragraph goes on to give the reasons for the discrimination and among those reasons are because of a person\u2019s spouse, business associates, et cetera. <em>I don\u2019t believe that it says that those list of persons in the second half of that paragraph have standing to file a suit unless they themselves are the direct object of discrimination. </em>I believe that\u2019s what is necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-12\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">Viewing plaintiff an unaffected third-party, the motion judge concluded he lacked standing to pursue the LAD complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>We disagree. Plaintiff was directly affected by Enclave\u2019s actions, having lost his lease to Murray.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was no more or less the object of Enclave\u2019s conduct than was Murray. We need not, therefore, grapple with the more complex issue of incidental third-party standing in the context of civil rights lawsuits. <em>Compare for example, Hotel St. George Associates v. Morgenstern, </em>819 <em>F.Supp. </em>310 (S.D.N.Y.1993), <em>with Puglisi v. Underhill Park Taxpayer Ass\u2019n, </em>947 <em>F.Supp. </em>673 (S.D.N.Y.1996), <em>aff'd, </em>125 F.3d 844 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Moreover, to the extent our statement in <em>Catalane </em>that LAD \u201cdid not intend to establish a cause of action for any person other than the individual against whom the discrimination was directed,\u201d 271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 500, 638 A.2d 1341, might be construed as requiring that a LAD plaintiff need be a member of a protected group, such construction is unwarranted. That was not the issue before us in <em>Catalane. </em>We there were focused upon a discriminated spouse\u2019s right to recover <em>per quod </em>damages under the Act. Simply stated, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-3 in its \u201ccareful recitation of the damages ... intended to [be] allow[ed],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 500, 638 A.2d 1341, does not include <em>per quod </em>damages. <em>And see Hurley v. Atlantic City Police Dept., </em>174 <em>F.</em>3d 95, 130 (3rd Cir.1999). But more importantly, and consistent with our liberal standing rules, we have not so narrowly viewed the scope of those individuals who might have standing to assert a LAD cause of action. <em>See Craig v. Suburban Cablevision, Inc., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>623, 629-31, 660 A.2d 505 (1995); <em>O\u2019Lone v. New Jersey Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 255, 712 A.2d 1177 (App.Div.1998); <em>Dunn v. State, Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>321, 711 A.2d 944 (App.Div.1998); <em>Kessler Inst. for Rehabilitation, Inc. v. Mayor and Council of Borough of Essex Fells, </em>876 <em>F.Supp. </em>641 (D.N.J.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">As we said in <em>O\u2019Lone, </em>where the object of the alleged discrimination was plaintiff Caucasian\u2019s African-American girlfriend, \u201c[r]e<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>gardless of the race of this plaintiff, he suffered the same injury as a minority when he was discharged for allegedly associating with a member of a protected group....that is the functional equivalent of being a member of the protected group.\u201d <em>O\u2019Lone, supra, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 255, 712 A.2d 1177. In this respect, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-13 provides that \u201c[a]ny person claiming to be aggrieved by ... unlawful discrimination\u201d may file a LAD complaint. Plaintiff is such an aggrieved person. <em>Cf. Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>409 <em>U.S. </em>205, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>364, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">In addition to his LAD cause of action, plaintiff, in an amended complaint, asserted a federal Fair Housing Act claim. The amendment was filed beyond the applicable two-year federal statute of limitations and, for that reason, was dismissed by the motion judge. Plaintiff argues before us that the amendment should have related back to the timely filed original complaint pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:9-3. In a supplemental statement of reasons filed pursuant to <em>R. </em>2:5-6(c), the motion judge has stated that the parties did not raise that issue before him, that he did not consider it, and that he would reconsider his determination if asked to do so. In light of this, since we are reversing the LAD dismissal, we also reverse and remand for reconsideration the dismissal of the federal Fair Housing claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Reversed and remanded for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-14\"> Following the arbitration, Enclave settled with Murray for $141,528.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\"> Plaintiff was not able to find another tenant until February 1996 and, thus, lost three months\u2019 rent as a result of Enclave's actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
