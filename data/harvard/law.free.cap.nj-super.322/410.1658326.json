Plaintiff sustained injuries while a passenger in a tow truck which was transporting his disabled vehicle. The trial court concluded that, although plaintiff was not in the insured vehicle when the accident occurred, he was nevertheless entitled to PIP coverage because he was involved in an accident resulting from the \u201cuse\u201d of the insured vehicle. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The pertinent facts are undisputed. On August 9, 1996, plaintiffs vehicle broke down on the Garden State Parkway. A tow truck responded and retrieved the disabled vehicle. While the tow truck was transporting the vehicle, it struck a concrete barrier at the Toms River Toll Plaza. Plaintiff, a passenger in the truck, sustained personal injuries as a result of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">NCI, plaintiffs automobile insurer, made payments on behalf of plaintiff up to the $10,000 limit of medical payments coverage available under his policy. However, NCI denied plaintiffs request for PIP benefits. Plaintiff filed a complaint and order to show cause demanding PIP benefits. The trial court entered judgment in plaintiffs favor, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">[T]he determination of P.I.P. coverage does not depend on the ownership, maintenance, or use of the automobile but rather on whether the injuries resulted from an accident involving an automobile. In the present case, although the plaintiff was not in the automobile covered by the insurance policy in question, he was involved in an automobile accident that resulted during the towing of the insured vehicle. Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to P.I.P. coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">NCI contends that plaintiff is not entitled to PIP benefits because plaintiffs injuries did not arise out of the \u201cuse\u201d of plaintiffs vehicle, in that his \u201cuse\u201d had concluded when the vehicle became disabled and it was merely being carried on the flat bed tow truck at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>New Jersey\u2019s Automobile Reparation Reform Act (No-Fault Law) requires insurers to provide PIP benefits to their policyholders or families for injuries sustained \u201cas a result of an accident while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4. Our courts have consistently held that a PIP insured\u2019s injury need not be \u201cdirectly or proximately caused by the automobile itself or by its motion or operation.\u201d <em>Smaul v. Irvington Gen. Hosp., </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>592, 595, 508 A.2d 1147 (App.Div.1986), <em>aff'd </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>474, 530 A.2d 1251 (1987). Instead, \u201c[t]here need only be a substantial nexus between the injury and the use of the car.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because \u201ccausal connection\u201d in a narrow sense is not the appropriate test, our courts have, on several occasions, found insureds entitled to PIP benefits where it cannot be said that the use of an automobile \u201ccaused\u201d their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">For example, in <em>Smaul, supra, </em>the plaintiff sustained injuries after he stopped his automobile to ask for directions and was assaulted by two men. While plaintiff was seated in his vehicle, one of the men pulled him out of the vehicle, whereupon both assailants robbed and stabbed him. <em>Id. </em>at 594, 508 A.2d 1147. We sustained a trial court order awarding plaintiff benefits while acknowledging that if a more restrictive view of causation were employed, plaintiffs injuries could not \u201cbe said to have resulted from an accident within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595, 508 A.2d 1147. Nevertheless, we found the statutory test satisfied under the prevailing \u201csubstantial nexus test.\u201d In finding the nexus, we noted that plaintiffs injury, was foreseeable: \u201c[i]t is an unfortunate truth that in these times the sort of attack to which plaintiff was subjected is not uncommon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596, 508 A.2d 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The Supreme Court affirmed our decision, adding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">[T]here was direct involvement of the automobile in the accident: plaintiff sought directions so that he could drive his car to his destination, he was sitting in his ear when the assault occurred, and a purpose of the assailants \u2014 not emphasized by either court below but acknowledged in Allstate\u2019s Statement of Facts \u2014 was to steal the ear after yanking plaintiff out of the driver\u2019s seat.... Surely the automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>was not merely coincidental to the critical events or a mere \u201cattending circumstance\u201d: its role was central to the incident. We see no reason rooted in either public policy or statutory interpretation why the fact that a criminal act was involved in the accident should deprive the plaintiff of PIP benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">[108 <em>N.J. </em>at 478-479, 530 A.2d 1251.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In a similar vein, the Supreme Court concluded that a plaintiff who sustained serious injuries in a drive-by shooting was entitled to ,PIP benefits under his father\u2019s automobile insurance policy. <em>Lindstrom v. Hanover Ins. Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>242, 246, 649 A.2d 1272 (1994). In determining whether the facts revealed a substantial nexus between the accident and the use of an automobile, the Court applied the following test earlier developed in the liability-coverage context in <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29, 312 A.2d 664 (App.Div.1973), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>152, 319 A.2d 732 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">[T]he inquiry should be whether the negligent act which caused the injury, although not foreseen or expected, was in the contemplation of the parties to the insurance contract a natural and reasonable incident or consequence of the use of the automobile, and thus a risk against which they might reason-ably expect those insured under the policy would be protected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">[126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 38, 312 A.2d 664.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The Court concluded that there was a demonstrable nexus between plaintiffs injuries and the use of the automobile:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">In our view the automobile did more than provide a setting or an enhanced opportunity for the assault. In addition to allowing the assailant to be at the place of the attack, it furnished the assailant with what he must have assumed would be both anonymity and a means of escape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\"><em>[Lindstrom, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 252, 649 A.2d 1272.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">The Court further noted that the plaintiffs injuries were foreseeable, given the unfortunate reality that drive-by shootings had become an increasingly common part of American life. <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, the Court ordered defendant to provide PIP benefits to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">We most recently applied these principles in <em>Stevenson v. State Farm Indem. Co., </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 709 A.2d 1359 (App.Div. 1998). There, we upheld the plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to PIP benefits where the claimants sustained serious injuries in separate carjacking incidents. <em>Id. </em>at 375-78, 709 A.2d 1359. In both cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the claimants were shot while inside their vehicles, by a passenger during an attempted carjacking. <em>Id. </em>at 370, 709 A.2d 1359. We noted that car-jacking, like drive-by shootings, has become increasingly common. <em>Id. </em>at 375, 709 A.2d 1359. Because the claimants injuries were foreseeable, we concluded that they \u201creasonably could have expected to receive PIP benefits,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and that the vehicular \u201cnexus\u201d was both demonstrable and undeniable. <em>Id. </em>at 377-78, 709 A.2d 1359.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The substantial nexus test is not without limits. \u201cAccidents that do not arise out of the use of an automobile or are not of the type that are within the contemplation of the parties do not fulfill the test\u2019s requirements.\u201d <em>Lindstrom, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 251, 649 A.2d 1272. For example, in <em>Uzcatequi-Gaymon v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>71, 75, 472 A.2d 163 (App.Div.1984), we held that the fact that the shooters of a man using a public telephone intended to steal his vehicle was an insufficient nexus to support PIP coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Similarly, we denied PIP benefits to the estate of a passenger of a vehicle who was stabbed to death in an altercation with occupants of a second vehicle, <em>Vasil v. Zullo, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>572, 570 A.2d 464 (App.Div.1990), concluding that the stabbing did not occur while the decedent was \u201coccupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577, 570 A.2d 464. Instead, we found that the accident occurred after the decedent voluntarily exited the driver\u2019s vehicle for a purpose unrelated to the use of his vehicle. <em>Ibid. </em>We distinguished the circumstances surrounding the plaintiffs case to those situations where a non-occupant could be entitled to PIP coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">A non-occupant of a vehicle may be found to have been \u201cusing\u201d the vehicle in which he was riding or driving while examining the damage sustained in an accident or while pushing the vehicle from the roadway to the shoulder. Such conduct constitutes normal use of an automobile which has been involved in an accident or has broken down. In contrast, a verbal or physical confrontation with the occupants of another vehicle is not pail of the normal use of an automobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">[<em>Ibid. </em>(citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>See also Morgan v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>638, 641, 577 A.2d 1300 (App.Div.) (finding no legal nexus between the shooting of the insured by her estranged husband and her use of her vehicle), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>370, 585 A.2d 377 (1990); <em>Kordell v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>505, 509, 554 A.2d 1 (App.Div.) (\u201c[a] death from coronary infarction fortuitously occurring in an insured vehicle is not a natural or reasonable incident or consequence of the use of the vehicle, and is therefore not an occasion for PIP benefits\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>43, 563 A.2d 813 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Here, plaintiffs injuries are compensable because the potential for a vehicular breakdown and need for tow service is a foreseeable consequence of the use of an automobile. Indeed, the Law Division in <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>335, 400 A.2d 862 (Law Div.1979), held that the towing of a vehicle constituted a \u201cuse\u201d of the towed vehicle so as to afford liability coverage to the tow truck operator under the policy on the towed vehicle. The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">The towing of a vehicle is neither a rare nor unforeseeable event. Quite to the contrary, the prospect of vehicular\u2019 breakdowns occurring from a multitude of causes requiring the need for towing is entirely within the realm of reasonable foreseeability by owners and operators of vehicles on our roadways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 344, 400 <em>A.2d </em>862.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">NCI would have us deny plaintiff PIP benefits solely because plaintiff was not physically in his vehicle at the time of the accident. This restrictive view is clearly at odds with the Legislature\u2019s intent to ensure \u201cthe broadest coverage possible so long as an automobile was involved in that which happened.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Estate of Miller, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>183, 187, 447 A.2d 1344 (App.Div.1982). Plaintiffs automobile was not merely coincidental to the critical events; it was directly involved in the circumstances which resulted in his injuries. <em>Smaul, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 479, 530 A.2d 1251. For these reasons, the circumstances giving rise to plaintiffs injuries can fairly be said to have been in the contemplation of both plaintiff and defendant when they entered into the insurance contract. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>Hartford, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 344, 400 A.2d 862 (\u201cthe towing of a vehicle is an employment of that vehicle in a manner clearly within the contemplation of the parties to an insurance contract\u201d). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect, that the risk which caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries is one which his policy would protect him against. <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 38, 312 A.2d 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b440-10\"> The order appealed from is interlocutory, since the issue of the amount of benefits owed to plaintiff has not been decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
