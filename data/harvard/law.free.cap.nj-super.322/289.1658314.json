Timothy\u2019s parents, plaintiffs William Mancuso and Jaequlyn Mancuso, individually and as his guardians ad litem, brought suit against the Kloses and Mr. and Mrs. Fred E. Allgeyer, the owners of the Mancuso house. The matter proceeded to trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the jury returned a verdict finding that the Kloses were eighty-five percent negligent and the Allgeyers were fifteen percent negligent. The jury awarded plaintiffs a total recovery of $195,000, which the trial judge molded to $165,750, representing the reduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>tion for the Allgeyers\u2019 fifteen percent negligence. Defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">On appeal, the Kloses contend that the motion judge erred in denying their motions for summary judgment and involuntary dismissal based on (1) the application of the Landowner\u2019s Liability Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42A-2 to -10 (the Act), asserting that Timothy\u2019s activity on their property brought them within the protection of the Act; (2) the application of the Act, because of the nature and character of the area; and (3) the failure of plaintiffs to prove the elements of the infant-trespasser exception of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 339(c) (1965). We conclude that the Act does not apply under the facts presented here, and that there was a jury question, decided in plaintiffs favor, as to the infant-trespasser exception. We finally conclude that the trial judge did not err in refusing to charge the provisions of the Act to the jury. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">These are the facts adduced during discovery and ultimately at trial. In June 1994, Timothy lived with his parents in a house in Port Republic which they rented from the Allgeyers. They had lived there for approximately six months. Timothy described Port Republic as \u201ca real rural area,\u201d with \u201ca lot of woods, forestry, shrubs, [and] plants.\u201d It was \u201cpretty far between neighbors,\u201d was \u201cnot like the city,\u201d and there were no sidewalks or street lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The Kloses lived next door to plaintiffs. A fence separated the two properties. Timothy described the fence as being in \u201c[p]retty poor\u201d condition. It was an older wire fence, similar to a chicken fence, which was rusted and down in some parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">On June 16, 1994, Timothy received a telephone call from Jared Young, his best friend in the fifth grade, who lived on the side of the Kloses\u2019 property. Jared invited Timothy to come over \u201cquick\u201d because \u201ca bunch of boys from fifth and sixth grade[s] were getting together to play a big game of tag,\u201d and it was about to start. Although there were other routes to Jared\u2019s house, Timothy normally used a path which led from his side yard, through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the Kloses\u2019 yard, and to the Youngs\u2019 yard. He took that path about twice per day. Although disputed by the Kloses, Timothy stated neither Mr. nor Mrs. Klose had told him that he was not permitted on their property. There was a pile of debris on the Kloses\u2019 property which Timothy had noticed prior to the date of the accident, but he had never been warned that he should not walk near the debris pile.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">After receiving the call from Jared, Timothy \u201ctook off out the door running.\u201d He explained what happened next as he ran over a downed portion of the fence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">I \u2014 the normal thing, ran down the steps to the side yard and was going across the fence, and my foot got caught in the end. So I, real fast, put my hands up like this, right over left, to cover my face if I was going to fall, and I hit the glass, and it broke. I turned over and looked at my hand, it was \u2014 it was weird. It just \u2014 all of sudden I couldn\u2019t feel it anymore, and there was just blood everywhere. So I ran back to the house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Timothy described the area in which he fell as \u201ckind of like a big dump pile\u201d with paint cans, an old door, glass, mirrors, wheelbarrows, and wood debris. He cut his hand on glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Although he was aware that there was glass in the area, Timothy took the path every day and never thought anything about the possibility of injuring himself. As an eleven-year-old child, he claimed that he did not understand the risk involved in using the path.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">We start our analysis by a review of the Act. The Act provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">An owner, lessee or occupant of premises, whether or not posted as provided in section 23:7-7 of the Revised Statutes, and whether or not improved or maintained in a natural condition, or used as part of a commercial enterprise, <em>owes no duty to keep the premises safe for entry or use by others for sport and recreational activities, </em>or to give warning of any hazardous condition of the land or in connection with the use of any structure or by reason of any activity on such premises to persons entering for such purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42A-3(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">The Act defines \u201csport and recreational activities\u201d to include \u201chunting, fishing, trapping, horseback riding, training of dogs, hiking, camping, picnicking, swimming, skating, skiing, sledding, tobogganing, operating or riding snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>or dirt bikes, and any other outdoor sport, game and recreational activity including practice and instruction in any thereof.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42A-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Immunity under the Act does not extend to owners or occupants of land located \u201cin residential and populated neighborhoods,\u201d <em>Harrison v. Middlesex Water Co., </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>391, 397, 403 A.2d 910 (1979), but was intended to provide immunity for \u201cundeveloped, open and expansive rural and semi-rural properties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400, 403 A.2d 910; <em>see also Labree v. Millville Mfg., Inc., </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>575, 581, 481 A.2d 286 (App.Div.1984) (reiterating the principles set forth in <em>Harrison).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The Kloses contend that the Act applied and that they were entitled to immunity because (1) Timothy\u2019s running on their land was using the property for \u201crecreational activities;\u201d and (2) the property was located in a semi-rural area. The judge denied defendants\u2019 application for summary judgment explaining that he did not think sport and recreational activities within the purview of the Act \u201cinclude[d] a couple of 11-year-old kids playing tag.\u201d Furthermore, citing <em>Labree, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 581, 481 A.2d 286, he concluded that immunity under the Act did not extend to landowners such as defendants whose property is located in residential and populated neighborhoods even if those neighborhoods were part of a larger undeveloped, open, and expansive rural and semi-rural areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Defendants argue that the Act covers any \u201coutdoor sport, game and recreational activity including practice and instruction,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42A-2. Citing <em>Tallaksen v. Ross, </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 400 A.2d 485 (App.Div.1979), defendants assert that we have held that the act of running is a recreational activity within the Act. In <em>Tallaksen, </em>however, the child was \u201cice skating and engaging in horseplay\u201d on a frozen swamp on the landowner\u2019s property when she fell and injured herself. Because the child was engaged in recreational activities on the property and the land was undeveloped, the property owner was immune from liability under the Act. In describing the scene, we noted that \u201cseveral other children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>were playing in the area, engaging in various forms of recreational activity such as running, jumping, ice skating and sleigh riding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3, 400 A.2d 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Here, Timothy was simply passing through the Kloses\u2019 yard to get to another property where he planned to play tag. Any running that he may have done while traversing the Kloses\u2019 property was not part of the game he intended to play once he arrived at his friend\u2019s house. The \u201crecreational activity\u201d was to occur on his friend\u2019s property, not on the Kloses\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Defendants also contend that the motion judge erred in finding that their property was not semi-rural within the purview of the Act. They assert that the Act does not require that the property \u201cbe completely isolated from civilization,\u201d <em>Labree, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 581-82, 481 A.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In 1991, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42A-3 was amended to provide immunity for premises \u201cwhether or not improved or maintained in a natural condition.\u201d <em>L. </em>1991, c. 496 \u00a7 2. Defendants argue that the 1991 amendment and provision that the Act is to be liberally construed, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42A-5.1, were in response to the overly restrictive interpretation of \u201cpremises\u201d set forth in <em>Whitney v. Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co., </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>420, 573 A.2d 509 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>376, 585 A.2d 381 (1990), as primarily undeveloped, open and expansive rural and semi-rural land. We recently rejected this argument in <em>Toogood v. St. Andrews at Valley Brook Condominium Ass\u2019n, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>418, 423-26, 712 A.2d 1262 (App.Div.1998). In <em>Toogood, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\"><em>Whitney </em>was a case which unnecessarily restricted the immunity afforded to landowners of rural and semi-rural or open tracts of land by focusing on the activity and the presence or absence of improvements on the rural or semi-rural land. The 1991 amendments to the Act are clearly designed to focus the inquiry on the dominant character of the land and to account for the evolving types of activities considered recreational pursuits. Nothing in the language of the Act or its legislative history suggests these amendments were intended to radically alter the law of premises liability by extending immunity to suburban or urban landowners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 425-26, 712 A.2d 1262.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>See also Benjamin v. Corcoran, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>517, 634 A.2d 108 (App.Div.1993) (holding that the New Jersey Firemen\u2019s Home was not immune from liability under the Act for injuries sustained by a child who had been sledding on the grounds of the Home that consisted of an improved tract of land in a suburban area, and the property was surrounded by residential lots and contained two buildings, two homes, and a barn).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Defendants argue that the motion judge erred in interpreting the nature and character of their property. They assert that even the judge observed that Port Republic is a rural area and they further argue that their property is situated on one acre and contains a wishing well and a pond.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">While the motion judge did acknowledge that Port Republic was a large rural area, he found that there were residential neighborhoods within it. The motion judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">[T]his is absolutely a neighborhood area with houses in close proximity to the point where fences are put up to close off the houses, and the fence was down, the glass was there, and the plaintiff was traversing between houses to get to a third house, and this is where the incident occurred. I don\u2019t think the Landowner\u2019s Liability [Act] comes into play.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">He therefore found that the subject neighborhood was a classic residential neighborhood where children traversed through backyards. There was no factual disputes as to the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">A judge must grant summary judgment \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c). Here, defendants\u2019 motion was based on their claim of entitlement to a judgment of immunity from suit under the Act. They did not dispute the facts, only the legal conclusion to be drawn therefrom. The judge concluded, as a matter of law, that the Act did not apply, a conclusion amply supported by the record before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Defendants contend that the motion judge erred in denying their motion for summary judgment, finding that a genuine issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>of material fact existed concerning whether Timothy, at age eleven, appreciated the risk of injury, and therefore, satisfied the infant-trespasser exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Traditionally, landowners owed \u201cno duty of care other than to refrain from willful and wanton injury toward trespassers.\u201d <em>Diglio v. Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>39 <em>N.J.Super. </em>140, 144, 120 A.2d 650 (App.Div.1956). However, the broad immunities which protected landowners from tort liability were weakened over time by reformulations and modifications of the principles which applied to the relationships between landowners and those who entered their property. <em>Vega by Muniz v. Piedilato, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>496, 501-02, 713 A.2d 442 (1998). For example, as industrial society developed, there were heightened concerns about children being harmed from dangerous conditions of property. <em>Id. </em>at 502, 713 A.2d 442. That concern led to the formulation of section 339 of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>which imposed liability on landowners for physical injury sustained by an infant-trespasser. <em>Id. </em>at 503, 713 A.2d 442. In <em>Strang v. South Jersey Broadcasting Co., </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>38, 45, 86 A.2d 777 (1952), New Jersey joined the growing number of states to follow section 339. <em>Vega, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 503, 713 A.2d 442. That section now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">A possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm to children trespassing thereon caused by an artificial condition upon the land if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">(a) the place where the condition exists is one upon which the possessor knows or has reason to know that children are likely to trespass, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">(b) the condition is one of which the possessor knows or has reason to know and which he realizes or should realize will involve an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm to such children, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">(e) the children because of then- youth do not discover the condition or realize the risk involved in intermeddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">(d) the utility to the possessor of maintaining the condition and the burden of eliminating the danger are slight as compared with the risk to children involved, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\">(e) the possessor fails to exercise reasonable care to eliminate the danger or otherwise to protect the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-11\"><em>[Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 339 (1965).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>To prove a prima facie case under the infant-trespasser doctrine, plaintiff must establish each of those five elements. <em>Vega, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 503, 713 A.2d 442. Courts should not apply section 339 mechanically; rather, they \u201cmust consider the unique factual setting of each case in deciding whether plaintiff has made a sufficient showing to raise a jury question for each of the five elements.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>Blackburn v. Broad St. Baptist Church, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>541, 547, 702 A.2d 1331 (App.Div.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Defendants argue that plaintiffs failed to make a sufficient showing to raise a jury question under \u00a7 339(c) because Timothy had acknowledged that he knew that the piece of fence was down and that he could be cut by glass. In response, plaintiffs argue that although Timothy knew that the fence was down, he did not appreciate the risk that by running through it, he could fall and hurt himself. They further argue that the maturity of the child, the obviousness of the hazard, and whether Timothy was capable of understanding the risk of running were issues of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 position is correct. As the motion judge explained when referring to subsection (c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">I think you have to look at several factors: [t]he age, the conditions of the premises, how many times the kid went through ii, the fact that 11-year-old kids run everywhere, the fact that they really don\u2019t appreciate risks the way adults would. I think they\u2019re all factors that go into the equation. And if you can\u2019t say that they did not discover or realize the risk, at least I think you say there\u2019s a fact issue on that for the trier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">The judge concluded that while the conditions of the other subsections were satisfied, there were factual issues for the trier of fact on subsection (c), dealing with the age of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">New Jersey does not have a \u201cper se rule that a child above a certain age should be deemed to be aware of the risk.\u201d <em>Vega, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 504, 713 A.2d 442. The <em>Vega </em>Court quoted a passage from our decision in <em>Hoff v. Natural Refining Products Co., </em>38 <em>N.J.Super. </em>222, 118 A.2d 714 (App.Div.1955), wherein we explained the rationale for not arbitrarily fixing an age at which there is a duty to exercise some care:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>[T]here is no place for the assumption in law that any particular child, in the absence of conclusive evidence thereof, has shed his immaturity at any particular age. In this domain the law may wisely find its guide in the general sense of mankind. Nor should there intrude the notion that at any given age the child \u201cshould know better.\u201d We are here necessarily dealing in pragmatics, not theories of improvement of child behavior. Close curtailment of liability by law will not dull the instinct of the child for carefree play. But the fair application of the rule of liability on a realistic basis will encourage the adoption of safety measures by industrial and other land occupiers and subserve the intent of the rule that the risk of foreseeable injuries to children be borne by those best able on the whole to prevent them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\"><em>[Vega, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 504, 713 A.2d 442.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">We have recognized that there is no precise age at which liability under section 339 no longer applies to a minor. <em>Ibid.; McColley v. Edison Corp. Ctr., </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>420, 427, 697 A.2d 149 (App.Div.1997). Age \u201cis but one factor, along with the nature and obviousness of the risk and the likelihood that the risk would be appreciated by a [child that age] under similar circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427-28, 697 A.2d 149. A child\u2019s appreciation of the risk is a matter of subjective analysis. <em>Vega, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 507, 713 A.2d 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Defendants suggest that the undisputed facts demonstrated Timothy\u2019s appreciation of the risk of injury. They argue that no factfinder could have resolved the issue in plaintiffs\u2019 favor. Defendants point to 'Timothy\u2019s deposition testimony: (1) this was the normal path that he took when he went to Jared\u2019s house; (2) he had seen glass on the Klose property before the accident; (3) he was running when he crossed over the downed part of the fence; (4) he had seen glass in that vicinity prior to the accident; and (5) when his foot got caught and he knew he was going to fall, he saw the glass, so he covered his face with both hands \u201cso it didn\u2019t shatter on [his] face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Although in some jurisdictions the court alone determines whether under subsection (c) the child\u2019s appreciation of the risk eliminated any duty on the part of the landowner, in New Jersey that consideration is rarely a question of law. <em>Vega, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 503-04, 713 A.2d 442. New Jersey views it as a jury question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Realization of the risk involved means something more than mere awareness that \u201cyou could get hurt.\u201d It connotes appreciation of the danger involved rather than mere knowledge of the existence of the condition itself.... [I]f it is fairly debatable whether the child, considering his age and degree of immaturity, really comprehended the extent of the danger to which he was exposing himself, a jury question as to realization is presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 504, 713 A.2d 442 (quoting <em>Haase v. North Hudson Scrap Iron Corp., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>263, 266, 300 A.2d 561 (1973)) (citing <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts </em>\u00a7 59 (4th ed.1971)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Defendants argue that the availability of Timothy\u2019s deposition testimony made it possible for the motion judge to conduct a subjective analysis of the facts so as to enable him to determine whether Timothy appreciated the risk within the contemplation of subsection (c). They rely on <em>Coughlin v. U.S. Tool Co., </em>52 <em>N.J.Super. </em>341, 145 A.2d 482 (App.Div.1958), <em>certif. denied, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>527, 147 A.2d 305 (1959). That reliance is improper since in <em>Coughlin, </em>when the judge determined that no jury could have found that the child had not realized the risk of his conduct, the judge was ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion for involuntary dismissal after having considered the child\u2019s <em>trial </em>testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 343, 348, 145 A.2d 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The motion judge properly denied defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. There was a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether Timothy, at age eleven, appreciated the risk of injury, and therefore, satisfied the infant-trespasser doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">At the conclusion of plaintiffs\u2019 case, defendants made a motion for involuntary dismissal on the basis that plaintiffs had again failed to establish sufficient proof under subsection (c). In denying the motion, Judge Himmelberger explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">In plain English, I suppose that [the language in subsection (c) 1 means that the plaintiff has to show that he doesn\u2019t, or didn\u2019t at the time anyway, understand the significance of the condition in terms of its capacity to injure him, not simply recognize the bare existence of the condition but to recognize that it had the potential to injure him under certain circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-11\">Timothy Mancuso when he testified said that at age 11 when this happened, he didn\u2019t appreciate the danger that confronted him in doing what he was doing. The jury might believe that; the jury might not believe that, but that\u2019s not for me to say at this point to think that they can\u2019t believe that. So the motion for judgment on that ground is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Relying on rule enumerated in <em>Vega, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 504, 713 A.2d 442, he properly denied the motion. Defendants\u2019 parsing of individual facts regarding Timothy\u2019s knowledge of the potential dangers of running and glass cutting him does not change the result. The establishment of these facts does not change the underlying conclusion that reasonable minds could differ as to whether Timothy appreciated the risk.
