Subsequently, the trial court affirmed the denial of defendant\u2019s application for admission into the county\u2019s Pretrial Intervention (PTI) program. However, it dismissed the indictment on grounds the provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-1w(1) listing \u201cM1 carbine type\u201d as an assault weapon was unconstitutionally vague, both facially and as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">The State appeals from the order dismissing the indictment. Defendant cross-appeals from the order affirming denial of his PTI application. We reverse the former order and affirm the latter order.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">The events giving rise to defendant\u2019s indictment began when the police received a 911 domestic violence telephone call from defendant\u2019s wife. She alleged defendant had pointed a shotgun at her and had \u201cracked\u201d the gun. After some ambivalence, apparently in part attributable to her fear of retribution by defendant, the wife filed a formal domestic violence complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">The ensuing temporary restraining order led to authorization for the police to remove defendant\u2019s firearms from the marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>residence. When the police arrived at the Warriner home, defendant turned over the weapons he had in his possession. Defendant possessed twenty-four weapons. Twenty-three of those weapons, the State concedes, were legally possessed. Those twenty-three weapons were kept in a central location. The twenty-fourth was secreted in the cellar. As to that weapon, which is the subject of the indictment, defendant informed an officer, after turning over the other twenty-three weapons, that he had one \u201cassault rifle\u201d which might be illegal. The information corroborates a statement defendant\u2019s wife had earlier given the police as to the belief the weapon was illegal. The assault rifle, with a barrel labeled \u201cUniversal Ml Autoloading Carbine\u201d and an attached telescopic sight, was \u201chidden behind a pile of miscellaneous items and covered with a piece of insulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The trial court found <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-1w(1), which lists an \u201cMl carbine type\u201d as an assault weapon, to be vague both facially and as applied. We find no vagueness in either respect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-1 defines terms applicable to weapons possession crimes and weapons possession licensing provisions of the Criminal Code. It defines the term assault firearm by creating essentially five categories. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-1w(1)-(5). The first category contains specific brand names, such as \u201cAustralian Automatic Arms SAR\u201d; specific types, such as \u201cMl carbine type\u201d or \u201cUZI type semi-automatic firearms\u201d; and specific series, such as \u201cColt AR-15 series and CAR-15 series.\u201d In this instance, we are concerned only with the \u201cM1 carbine type\u201d classification. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-1w(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The constitutional ban on vague law is designed to invalidate statutory enactments \u201cthat fail to provide adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>notice of their scope and sufficient guidance to their application.\u201d <em>State v. Cameron, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>586, 591, 498 A.2d 1217 (1985). \u201cThe requirement of statutory clarity \u2018is essentially a procedural due process concept grounded in notions of fair play.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Lashinsky, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7, 404 A.2d 1121 (1979)). A statute is facially vague only if it is \u201c \u2018impermissibly vague in all interpretations.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Saunders, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 520, 695 A.2d 722 (App.Div.1997) (quoting <em>Village of Hoffman Estates, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>489, 494-95, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>1186, 1191, 71 <em>L.</em>Ed.2d 362, 369 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The issue of facial vagueness of the \u201cMl carbine type\u201d category was recently addressed in <em>Coalition of NJ Sportsmen, Inc. v. Whitman, </em>44 F.Supp.2d 666 (D.N.J. 1999). The Federal District Court rejected the facial vagueness claim. <em>Id. </em>at 670-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">In <em>Benjamin v. Bailey, </em>234 <em>Conn. </em>455, 662 A.2d 1226, 1228 (1995), similar provisions of Connecticut\u2019s firearms statute withstood a challenge of facial vagueness. In particular, the Connecticut Court found phrases \u201cAK-47 type,\u201d \u201cMAC-10,\u201d \u201cMAC-11,\u201d and \u201cMAC-11 Carbine type\u201d were sufficiently clear to satisfy due process. <em>Id. </em>at 1241-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">While neither decision is binding on this court, we find them persuasive. \u201cMl carbine\u201d has an essential meaning. It is a basic design of a weapon. Type simply gives notice that a firearm with that basic design qualifies as an assault weapon. As such, it gives adequate notice. To conclude otherwise would improperly require a \u201c \u2018linguistic analysis conducted in a vacuum\u2019 \u201d as to what is a proscribed weapon. <em>See State v. Saunders, supra, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 521, 695 A.2d 722 (quoting <em>In re Suspension of DeMarco, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>25, 37, 414 A.2d 1339 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">A statute is vague as applied if \u201cthe law does not with sufficient clarity prohibit the conduct against which it sought to be enforced.\u201d <em>State v. Cameron, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 593, 498 A.2d 1217. The conventional test to determine vagueness in this context is whether \u201ca person of ordinary intelligence may reasonably determine what conduct is prohibited so that he or she may act in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>conformity with the law.\u201d <em>State v. Saunders, supra, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 520-21, 695 A.2d 722. Again, the test does not allow \u201c \u2018linguistic analysis conducted in a vacuum\u2019 \u201d but one conducted in \u201cthe reality in which the [statutory] provision is to be applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521, 695 A.2d 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Viewed in the context of these principles, we are satisfied the \u201cMl carbine type\u201d provision is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the defendant in this instance. The statute identified an \u201cMl carbine type\u201d weapon as an assault weapon. The weapon defendant owned had a barrel stamp that read \u201cUniversal' M1 Autoloading Carbine.\u201d That stamp gave notice the gun had the basic design of the proscribed weapon-an Ml carbine. Any person of reasonable intelligence would have been alerted to the fact that the weapon at issue was an illegal weapon. In fact, by secreting the weapon in his cellar, as defendant did, he evidenced an awareness that the gun was a proscribed assault weapon. We find it ingenuous to suggest, as defendant does, that he had no way of knowing that the weapon at issue was an \u201cM1 carbine type\u201d when the weapon was stamped with an almost identical designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Simply put, the statute at issue is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. The statute is entitled to a presumption of validity that cannot be lightly disregarded. <em>See Hutton Park Gardens v. Town Council of W. Orange, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>543, 564-65, 350 A.2d 1 (1975); <em>State v. Saunders, supra, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 517, 695 A.2d 722. The record before us and the arguments raised fail to persuasively establish the unconstitutionality claimed. Consequently, we reverse the order dismissing the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">\n<em>III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Defendant\u2019s cross-appeal contends the trial court erred when it refused to overrule the decisions of the PTI program director and prosecutor denying his admission to the program. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>The final notice of rejection by the program director and the prosecutor relied upon PTI Guideline 3(i)(3). The notice concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">What seems apparent is that your client is an avid gun collector who possessed a legal firearm\u2019s I.D. card. He had secured all but the illegal rifle in one location in his home. It seems that he went to some extent to hide what he apparently knew to be an illegal weapon. This possession was seemingly not held under a misunderstanding of the law but rather in defiance of it. This behavior, which appears to have been calculated and deliberate, suggests a behavior pattern that may not be significantly altered or deterred through diversionary measures. Taken in context with the underlying domestic violence filing[,] his behavior certainly seems to be wrought with the potential for violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The notice, while acknowledging that defendant is \u201ca 34-year-old, gainfully employed, father of two children\u201d with no additional arrest record, recognized those circumstances did not outweigh the \u201cconcerns\u201d expressed in its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Judicial review of prosecutorial decisions on diversion of a defendant into PTI is \u201cavailable to check only the most egregious examples of injustice and unfairness.\u201d <em>State v. Leonardis, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>360, 384, 375 A.2d 607 (1977). Rarely are prosecutorial decisions to reject overturned. <em>See State v. Baynes, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>434, 443, 690 A.2d 594 (1997). To overcome a prosecutor\u2019s veto of his or her PTI application, a defendant must clearly and convincingly show the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to sanction admission into the program was based on \u201ca patent and gross abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Leonardis, supra, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 382, 375 A.2d 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\"><em>State v. Bender, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>84, 93, 402 A.2d 217 (1979), defined \u201cpatent and gross abuse of discretion.\u201d Abuse of discretion is demonstrated if defendant can show the prosecutor\u2019s veto (1) was not premised on consideration of all relevant factors; (2) was based on consideration of irrelevant or inappropriate factors; or (3) amounted to a clear error in judgment. <em>Ibid. </em>There is a presumption the prosecutor considered all relevant factors. <em>Id. </em>at 94, 402 A.2d 217. For a veto to be \u201cpatent and gross,\u201d defendant must show a clear subversion of the goals underlying PTI.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Defendant failed to meet his burden to overcome the veto of his application for admission into the Atlantic County PTI program. The conclusory paragraph of the final notice of rejection discloses the consideration of relevant factors. There is no demonstration it considered irrelevant or inappropriate factors. There is also no evidence that the veto amounted to a clear error in judgment. Accordingly, the order denying defendant\u2019s motion to compel admission is consequently affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Reversed in part; affirmed in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-9\">The order under appeal conflicts with the trial court's oral decision. We address the grounds contained in the court's oral decision. <em>See State v. Pohlabel, </em>40 <em>N.J.Super. </em>416, 423, 123 A.2d 391 (App.Div.1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
