On August 26, 1998, a Law Division judge vacated another Law Division judge\u2019s order that had temporarily committed J.G. to the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital after his release from the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center (Avenel) on grounds that the statutory procedures for such commitment had not been followed. The judge found that the prosecutor from the county that had originally committed J.G., the Cape May County Prosecutor, was required to seek such commitment after making an independent assessment of J.G.\u2019s mental fitness and not the Middlesex County Prosecutor who represents the county where Avenel is located. The Cape May County Prosecutor filed an emergent application to stay the order discharging J.G. and to seek leave to appeal, both of which we granted on August 28, 1998. The Attorney General then joined the appeal. We reverse because we conclude that the relevant statutes did not prohibit the Middlesex County Prosecutor from initiating temporary involuntary commitment proceedings for J.G. upon his release from Avenel or the transfer of the proceedings to Cape May County for a final commitment hearing and disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">In January 1992, J.G. was charged under a Cape May County indictment with first degree aggravated sexual assault in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a; second degree sexual assault in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2c; and third and fourth degree endangering the welfare of a child in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a. In April 1992, J.G. entered a guilty plea to aggravated sexual assault and was sentenced to a ten-year term of imprisonment with a five-year period of parole ineligibility. J.G. was directed to serve his sentence at Avenel.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">In February 1998, the Commissioner of Corrections\u2019 designee sent a letter to notify the Cape May County Prosecutor\u2019s Office of J.G.\u2019s scheduled release on June 26, 1998, because J.G. was about to complete his term of incarceration. The letter contained an \u201cinformation package\u201d that included, among other information about J.G., \u201c[r]ecent psychological and psychiatric evaluations\u201d as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-82.4d and 2C:47-5d. The letter also indicated \u201cit is believed that civil commitment is necessary and commitment proceedings are being initiated.\u201d The letter concluded, \u2018You will be advised by subsequent memorandum of this inmate\u2019s transfer to the State Psychiatric Complex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Thereafter, approximately ten days prior to the date J.G. was scheduled to complete his maximum sentence, he was examined by two Avenel psychiatrists. They each certified that J.G. suffers from bipolar disorder, pedophilia, and mild mental retardation, concluding that he \u201ccontinues to have pedophilic fantasies about young boys\u201d and would be a danger to himself and others if released into the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">On June 17, 1998, the Middlesex County Prosecutor, filed an application in the Law Division seeking an order of involuntary commitment of J.G. The application was supported by the two clinical certificates from the Avenel staff psychiatrists pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10c and <em>R. </em>4:74-7(b). After reviewing the certificates, a Law Division judge determined there was probable cause to believe J.G. was \u201cin need of involuntary commitment,\u201d <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.2m, and entered a temporary order committing J.G. to the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital in Trenton pending a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>review hearing on July 8, 1998. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10g and h; <em>see also R. </em>4:74-7(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">On June 18, 1998, the Commissioner\u2019s designee sent a letter to the Cape May County Prosecutor\u2019s Office advising that J.G. \u201chas been civilly committed and transferred to the State Psychiatric Complex.\u201d The letter concluded that J.G.\u2019s sentence would expire during his hospital confinement (on June 26, 1998) and enclosed a new \u201cSex Offender Registration Card\u201d because J.G. had changed his intended address. Thereafter, on July 15, 1998, after noting that J.G. had \u201clegal settlement\u201d in Cape May County, a different Law Division judge ordered further proceedings transferred to Cape May County.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">On July 10, 1998, the adjourned date for review of J.G.\u2019s \u201ccontinuing need for involuntary commitment,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.12, J.G. informally applied for an order declaring his commitment illegal, dismissing the commitment proceedings and discharging him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A Law Division judge assigned to review involuntary commitments, sitting in Burlington County, adjourned the review hearing for J.G. twice until August 26, 1998 in order to consider J.G.\u2019s application. On that date, the judge heard oral argument. J.G. argued that the commitment was illegal because only the Attorney General or \u201cthe prosecutor of the county from which the person was committed\u201d is statutorily empowered to initiate commitment proceedings. He argued that because only the Attorney General or the county prosecutor who committed J.G. was authorized to receive notification and the information necessary to determine whether J.G. was \u201cin need of involuntary commitment,\u201d <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-82.4b to d; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-5d, a prosecutor who did not have such notice and information could not perform an independent assessment of J.G.\u2019s mental status or level of rehabilitation and, therefore, could not properly seek his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>commitment. Accordingly, he maintained the commitment was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The Cape May County Prosecutor countered essentially that the plain language of the statute and common sense demanded that the court reject J.G.\u2019s argument, asserting, among other things, that the civil commitment statute does not expressly restrict the authority of county prosecutors to initiate involuntary commitment of inmates from their own county and that, in fact, the Middlesex County Prosecutor had agreed to handle the initial proceedings for temporary involuntary commitments of inmates scheduled for release from Avenel whose commitments originated from other counties. In support thereof, the assistant prosecutor who was arguing the case for Cape May County certified that on February 11, 1998, she attended a Megan\u2019s Law meeting in Trenton at which \u201cAssistant Prosecutors assigned to handle Megan\u2019s Law cases were present.\u201d She further certified that an assistant prosecutor from Middlesex County \u201cindicated he would be filing the temporary application for civil commitment in appropriate cases of inmates at Avenel,\u201d after which the matters would be transferred to the county of commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">After oral argument, the judge granted J.G.\u2019s motion, concluding that J.G.\u2019s due process rights had been violated. The judge held that the civil commitment statute requires an independent psychiatric evaluation of the inmate to be conducted \u201cto get some fresh blood in the case\u201d in determining whether the person is \u201cstill mentally ill, or whether he [is] still dangerous\u201d before the person can be involuntarily committed on a temporary basis. The judge also expressed concern that Middlesex County should not have to bear the costs and expenses associated with initiating such proceedings simply because Avenel was situated in the county. Accordingly, the judge declared J.G.\u2019s commitment illegal and, on August 26, 1998, entered an order directing that J.G. be discharged. The judge, however, temporarily stayed the order to permit the Cape May County Prosecutor to seek leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>As previously noted, on August 28, 1998, this court stayed the order discharging J.G., pending appeal, directed that the Attorney General receive notification of the appeal so he could participate in the proceedings, and ordered the Law Division to retain jurisdiction for purposes of conducting periodic reviews of J.G.\u2019s status.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">In 1987, the Legislature passed a comprehensive civil commitment statute. <em>L. </em>1987, c. 116 (codified at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.1 to - 27.23, among other sections, as amended). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10 \u201cidentifies and implements two methods of commencing an action for an involuntary civil commitment: screening service referral or independent applications that require two clinical certificates, one from a psychiatrist, recommending involuntary commitment.\u201d <em>In the Matter of D.C., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>31, 42, 679 A.2d 634 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Specifically, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">a. A short term care or psychiatric facility or a special psychiatric hospital shall initiate court proceedings for involuntary commitment by submitting to the court a clinical certificate completed by a psychiatrist on the patient\u2019s treatment team and the screening certificate which authorized admission of the patient to the facility; provided, however, that both certificates shall not be signed by the same psychiatrist unless the psychiatrist has made a reasonable but unsuccessful attempt to have another psychiatrist conduct the evaluation and execute the certificate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">b. Court proceedings for the involuntary commitment of any person not referred by a screening service may be initiated by the submission to the court of two clinical certificates, at least one of which is prepared by a psychiatrist. The person shall not be involuntarily committed before the court issues a temporary court order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">The statute also provides that if the court upon review of the certificates determines that a person is \u201cin need of involuntary commitment,\u201d <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.2m, it shall issue a temporary order authorizing the admission to or retention of the person in custody, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10g. The order is renewable by the court within twenty days of the person\u2019s admission. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.12a; <em>see also R. </em>4:74-7(c)1. The order must also provide for the appointment of counsel for the committee. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.12d; <em>see also R. </em>4:74-7(c)2.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>The procedures enacted by the Legislature in 1987, and the rules adopted by the Supreme Court pursuant thereto, were intended \u201cto correct a long standing history of procedural abuses in the civil commitment process and to ensure that no person may be involuntarily committed to a psychiatric institution without having been afforded full procedural due process.\u201d <em>Matter of D.C., supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 43, 679 A.2d 634 (quoting Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 1 on <em>R. </em>4:74-7 (1995)). The legislative findings and declarations explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\">Because involuntary commitment entails certain deprivations of liberty, it is necessary that State law balance the basic value of liberty with the need for safety and treatment, a balance that is difficult to effect because of the limited ability to predict behavior; and, therefore, it is necessary that State law provide clear standards and procedural safeguards that ensure that only those persons who are dangerous to themselves, to others or to property, are involuntarily committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.1b.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In 1994, the Legislature enacted Megan\u2019s Law, which included, among other new legislation, amendments to the civil commitment statute. <em>See L. </em>1994, c. 134. These amendments revised the civil commitment procedures to insure the protection of the public against certain inmates scheduled for release from custody who have completed their maximum terms of incarceration but who are believed to be mentally ill and constitute threats to the public safety. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-82.4 (Historical and Statutory Notes).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The Megan\u2019s Law amendments consist, in relevant part, of supplements to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10c, d, e, g and h, and a completely new section, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-82.4, entitled \u201cProcedures for inmates in need of \u2018involuntary commitment.\u2019 \u201d They also include <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-5d.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Revised subsection c of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10 expressly authorizes the \u201cAttorney General\u201d or \u201ccounty prosecutor\u201d to initiate involuntary commitment proceedings. It provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">A court proceeding for involuntary commitment of an inmate who is scheduled for release upon expiration of a maximum term of incarceration shall be initiated by the Attorney General or <em>county prosecutor </em>by submission to the court of two clinical certificates, at least one of which is prepared by a psychiatrist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10c (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Subsection a of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-82.4 requires \u201cthe Attorney General\u201d and \u201ccounty prosecutors\u201d to follow certain procedures \u201c[i]n order to ensure that adult and juvenile inmates who are dangerous to themselves or others because of mental illness ... are not released without appropriate supervision and treatment.\u201d One such procedure requires the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections (the Commissioner) or the Juvenile Justice Commission, no less than ninety days before the date on which an inmate\u2019s maximum term is scheduled to expire, to notify and furnish all relevant information about the inmate to \u201cthe Attorney General and <em>the prosecutor of the county from which the person was committed\u201d </em>in cases where the inmate has been convicted of a sexual offense and the court imposing sentence found that the inmate\u2019s conduct was characterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior, or where the inmate may otherwise be \u201cin need of involuntary commitment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-82.4b to d (emphasis added). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-5d contains a similar provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">J.G. contends this restrictive language was intended to authorize only the prosecutor from the county where the inmate was first committed to initiate temporary involuntary commitment proceedings upon receiving notice of the inmate\u2019s pending release.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">In construing a statute, a court\u2019s primary task is to \u201ceffectuate the legislative intent in light of the language used and the objectives sought to be achieved.\u201d <em>Reuben H. Donnelley Corp. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>218, 227, 607 A.2d 1281 (1992) (quoting <em>Merin v. Maglaki, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>430, 435, 599 A.2d 1256 (1992)). We are satisfied that the Legislature did not intend that an Avenel inmate should be released to the community simply because the prosecutor who initiated the commitment proceedings was not the prosecutor who originally received the notice and information required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-82.4 from the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>The legislative findings and declaration accompanying <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-82.4 clearly explain that the new procedural amendments to the civil commitment statute were designed \u201c[t]o ensure [that] the public is not denied the protection that the Legislature intended to provide in enacting a law that calls for the involuntary civil commitment of the dangerous mentally ill.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-82.4 (Historical and Statutory Notes). Additional legislative history confirms that purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">Assembly Bill No. 86 of 1994 revises procedures governing the release and involuntary commitment of inmates convicted of certain sexual offenses to ensure that protection of the public is given due consideration....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">The bill authorizes the Attorney General or <em>the county prosecutors, </em>at their discretion, to initiate civil commitment of inmates determined to be mentally ill and dangerous to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">[Fiscal Estimate to Assembly Bill No. 86, at 1 (Sept. 26, 1994) (emphasis added) [hereinafter Fiscal Estimate]; <em>see also Matter of D.C., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>31, 53, 679 A.2d 634 (1996).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">This purpose was reiterated by the Supreme Court in <em>Matter of D.C., supra. </em>In that case, the Court observed that an Avenel inmate was released into the community without monitoring or supervision because the existing civil commitment statute had no \u201cclear and effective means of confining dangerous individuals who are not mentally ill.\u201d <em>Matter of D.C., supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 54, 679 A.2d 634 (citation and internal punctuation omitted). To prevent this occurrence in the future, the <em>D.C. </em>Court stated that by the 1994 amendments to the civil commitment statute \u201cthe Legislature intended to enact remedial legislation to effectuate its purpose to confine persons who are found to be dangerous by virtue of mental illness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55, 679 A.2d 634. The Court further noted that the amendments were intended \u201c \u2018to correct [a] flaw' in the civil commitment statute.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting Claudine M. Leone, Note, <em>New Jersey Assembly Bill 155 </em>\u2014 A <em>Bill Allowing the Civil Commitment of Violent Sex Offenders After the Completion of a Criminal Sentence, </em>18 <em>Seton Hall Legis. J. </em>890, 896 (1994)). The Court also stated that the amendments</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">were designed to protect the public against a particular class of potentially dangerous people: convicted sex offenders. <em>The overall effect of the 1991 amendments to the involuntary civil commitment statute, N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.1 to 27.10, <em>is </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>to \u201crevis[e] procedures governing the release and involuntary commitment of inmates convicted of certain sexual offenses\u201d in order to ensure public safety </em>\u2014 The legislative history demonstrates that the Legislature pointedly intended the amendments to address eases such as D.C.\u2019s. In fact, D.C.\u2019s release in 1992 was the primary motivating factor behind the Legislature\u2019s enactment of these amendments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\"><em>[Matter of D.C., supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 54-55, 679 A.2d 634 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">J.G.\u2019s interpretation of the new amendments to require only the prosecutor of the county that \u201ccommitted\u201d the inmate to initiate the proceedings for an involuntary commitment is inconsistent with the purpose and intent of the new legislation. These amendments were designed to assure the public there would be more, not less, protection from unrehabilitated \u201csexual predators.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 54 n. 1, 679 A.2d 634; <em>see also </em>Leone, <em>supra, </em>at 894-97. It is unreasonable to believe that in enacting the Megan\u2019s Law amendments to the civil commitment statute the Legislature intended to limit the persons authorized to initiate a civil commitment of a dangerous sex offender in the hyper-technical manner urged by J.G. and endorsed by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">In enacting the notice provisions contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-82.4 and 2C:47-5d, it is apparent that the legislative goal was to assure that the most interested law enforcement agencies would have sufficient information and time to prepare an application for involuntary commitment <em>before </em>the inmate is released into the community, not <em>after. </em>As noted, \u201cD.C.\u2019s release in 1992 was the primary motivating factor behind the Legislature\u2019s enactment of these amendments.\u201d <em>Matter of D.C., supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 54-55, 679 A.2d 634. Thus, the legislative history envisions that the county prosecutor who originated an inmate\u2019s commitment would be provided with notice and all relevant information to independently determine whether the inmate is \u201cin need of involuntary commitment\u201d before the inmate\u2019s release. It is clear that such notice and information was intended to enable the county prosecutor who is familiar with the facts of the case and charged with ensuring the public\u2019s safety to make a separate assessment of an institution\u2019s decision to release an inmate and to \u201cby-pass the faulty opinion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the institutional psychiatrists,\u201d if necessary. <em>In the Matter of D.C., </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>102, 122, 656 A.2d 861 (App.Div.1995) (Shebell, P.J.A.D., dissenting), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>31, 679 A.2d 634 (1996). Notably, J.G. has not produced any legislative history that suggests a contrary legislative purpose, namely that the required notice and information in respect of an inmate\u2019s scheduled release is to assure protection of the inmate\u2019s rights, nor could he. That is because the primary thrust of the Megan\u2019s Law amendments was to assure the safety of the public, not the due process rights of the inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In addition to the clear legislative intent of the amendments, their plain language negates J.G.\u2019s interpretation of those aspects of the civil commitment statute upon which he relies. Initially, we note J.G.\u2019s reliance on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.12c as support for its contention that only the county counsel or county adjuster may initiate temporary involuntary commitment. That interpretation is clearly erroneous. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.12c deals specifically with procedures for hearings on \u201cthe <em>continuing </em>need for involuntary commitment,\u201d not the initiation of such proceedings (emphasis added). Indeed, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.12c(2) specifically references the authority of a county prosecutor, without restriction, to initiate such proceedings: \u201c[U]pon notice to the county adjuster ... [t]he county prosecutor may supersede the county counsel or county adjuster and assume responsibility for presenting any ease for involuntary commitment <em>initiated by the county prosecutor </em>pursuant to subsection c of section 10 of <em>P.L. </em>1987, c. 116 <em>([N.J.S.A.] </em>30:4-27.10)....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10c. Consequently, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.12c does not advance J.G.\u2019s contention that only the Cape May County Prosecutor could initiate involuntary commitment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Further, while <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-82.4e contains a procedure by which ordinarily the Commissioner, <em>upon request of the county prosecutor, </em>would obtain the clinical certificates necessary for an inmate\u2019s commitment, the statute does not mandate such a request. Here, where the Commissioner wrote to the Cape May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>County Prosecutor on February 23, 1998 \u201cthat civil commitment is necessary and commitment proceedings are being initiated,\u201d a further request by the county prosecutor for a separate psychiatric assessment would have been superfluous. The Commissioner had already determined to commit J.G. and so advised the Cape May County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. Hence, no further participation by the Cape May County Prosecutor was required, at least not at the initiation stage. Thereafter, the Middlesex County Prosecutor made the application <em>for </em>temporary commitment <em>of </em>J.G., supported by the required certificates under the statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10b and c, and in accordance with the informal arrangements made at the Megan\u2019s Law meeting in Trenton in February 1997. Pursuant thereto, the Law Division judge in Middlesex County concluded there was probable cause to commit J.G. and ordered his commitment and transfer to the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10h. At no time were the merits of this decision challenged; nor are we aware of any appeals from the more recent orders continuing J.G.\u2019s commitment which we expect were entered after the review hearings we required in our order staying the Law Division\u2019s order discharging J.G.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Moreover, prior to the enactment of the Megan\u2019s Law amendments, the civil commitment statute did not by its express terms limit the persons permitted to initiate involuntary commitment proceedings. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10b. Hence, we are satisfied that even without the new Megan\u2019s Law amendments any county prosecutor, indeed any interested party, could have initiated an involuntary commitment proceeding if they were armed with the required clinical certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Accordingly, J.G.\u2019s interpretation of the Megan\u2019s Law amendments and related court rules as limiting the authority of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>county prosecutor to initiate temporary involuntary commitment to only those prosecutors who originally committed the inmate is a strained, if not absurd, interpretation. <em>See Innes v. Innes, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>496, 509, 569 A.2d 770 (1990). That reading of the amendments requires us to ignore the specific provision in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10e which authorizes the <em>county prosecutor, </em>without any restriction, to initiate an involuntary commitment of an inmate scheduled for release by submission to the court of two clinical certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Further, generally, statutory language should be construed as written, no broader than the language justifies, <em>Lynch v. Borough of Edgewater, 8 N.J. </em>279, 285, 85 A.2d 191 (1951), and not according to some unexpressed intention. <em>In re Closing of Jamesburg High Sch., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>540, 548, 416 A.2d 896 (1980). We are mindful of the admonition that a \u201ccourt is not at liberty to indulge in a presumption that the Legislature intended something more than what it actually wrote in the law.\u201d <em>Graham v. City of Asbury Park, </em>64 <em>N.J.Super. </em>385, 394, 165 A.2d 864 (Law Div. 1960), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>69 <em>N.J.Super. </em>256, 174 A.2d 244 (App.Div.1961), <em>aff'd, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>166, 179 A.2d 520 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The order entered on August 26, 1998 declaring the temporary involuntary commitment of J.G. invalid and directing his release is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-10\"> Megan\u2019s Law collectively refers to a group of eleven bills enacted on October 31, 1994. <em>L. </em>1994, <em>c. </em>127-137.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-11\"> Chapter 134 is entitled \"An act concerning procedures for civil commitment of mentally ill and dangerous sexual offenders and other offenders and revising various parts of the statutoiy law.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\"> On July 28, 1998, J.G.'s then attorney filed a letter brief.
