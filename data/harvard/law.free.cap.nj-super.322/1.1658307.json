New Jersey courts have previously addressed the procedural rights of expelled students at public high schools and at private universities, and the rights of expelled members of private associations. Until now, no court in this State has considered, in a reported decision, the procedural rights of an expelled student at a private high school. We now hold that a private high school, when dismissing a student for misconduct, must follow its own established procedures for expulsion, and in so doing must follow a procedure that is fundamentally fair. Because we are satisfied that Don Bosco followed a fundamentally fair procedure when it expelled Marc, we reverse the order denying Don Bosco\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Plaintiff Marc Hernandez was a student at Don Bosco, a private Roman Catholic boys school in Ramsey, New Jersey. Plaintiff began his schooling at Don Bosco as a freshman in 1991. Plaintiff was an average student and a member of the wrestling team. During his freshman and sophomore years, he received a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>minor disciplinary detentions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During his junior year, he received five detentions for misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">During the summer of 1994 following Marc\u2019s junior year, the Assistant Principal, Charles O\u2019Sullivan, sent a letter dated July 12, 1994, to Marc and his parents, Peter and Emily Hernandez. The letter informed the Hernandez family that, as a result of Marc\u2019s detentions during his junior year, Don Boseo was placing Marc on disciplinary probation for the fall semester of his senior year. The letter noted that \u201c[a] continuance of minor incidents would mean that he may not be allowed to return to Don Boseo for the following school year.\u201d Marc and his parents signed the letter and sent a signed copy back to the school. Although not required, Marc\u2019s parents met with O\u2019Sullivan after receiving the letter of probation, at which time O\u2019Sullivan reviewed the list of detentions, but assured the Hernandez family that they should not worry.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">During the fall semester of Mare\u2019s senior year, while on probation, Marc was involved in an argument on a school bus with a freshman, James Hopper. After the incident, O\u2019Sullivan called Mrs. Hernandez for a meeting. Thereafter, Marc was suspended for one day as a result of the argument with Hopper.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">In February of Marc\u2019s senior year, after the probationary period ended, O\u2019Sullivan summoned Marc from class on several occasions to question him about the \u201ctrashing\u201d of a teacher\u2019s house, the slashing of that teacher\u2019s automobile tires, and about prank phone calls made to the same teacher. Defendant contends that fellow students reported to O\u2019Sullivan that Marc was bragging about prank calling the teacher. Plaintiff initially denied any involvement in either the prank calls or the trashing of the teacher\u2019s home. Thereafter, Marc told O\u2019Sullivan that another student, Brad Levy, had called Marc and the teacher on a conference call, but did not inform Marc what he was doing. Marc received an in-school suspension on February 16, 1995, as punishment for his involvement in the conference call. O\u2019Sullivan called Mr. Hernandez to inform him of Marc\u2019s in-sehool suspension, and requested a meeting with Marc\u2019s parents. On February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>27, 1995, Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez met with O\u2019Sullivan. They presented a phone bill indicating that Marc had been on a long-distance phone call with his girlfriend on the night the teacher\u2019s home and car were trashed. They also brought to the conference Marc\u2019s Swiss army knife under the belief that such evidence would prove that Marc was not involved in the tire slashing, as the perpetrator\u2019s knife had been confiscated by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">During this same time period, Brad Levey \u2014 the student who had called Marc and the teacher on a conference call \u2014 reported to O\u2019Sullivan that Marc was using and selling illegal steroids to other students on school grounds. Brad Levy also reported that Marc had been bragging about urinating in students\u2019 lockers. Another student, Mike Sack, corroborated Brad Levy\u2019s report about Marc\u2019s use and distribution of steroids. As a result of this information, O\u2019Sullivan called a meeting with Marc and his parents on March 2, 1995. Defendant contends that during the March 2 meeting, Mike Sack was present and described the incident when Marc offered to sell him steroids. Plaintiff argues that he and his parents were not informed as to the nature of this meeting, and were \u201cambushed\u201d at this meeting with accusations of steroid use and distribution. During the meeting, Mrs. Hernandez admitted that she had found steroids in Marc\u2019s bedroom prior to the meeting. Marc told O\u2019Sullivan that the bottle of legal steroids that his mother found in his bedroom were purchased at a health food store by Marc\u2019s friend who had mistakenly left the bottle in Marc\u2019s room. At the end of the meeting on March 2, O\u2019Sullivan told the Hernandez family that Marc was being placed on indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Thereafter, O\u2019Sullivan met with the Disciplinary Committee and reviewed Marc\u2019s disciplinary history. O\u2019Sullivan recommended to the Committee that Marc be dismissed; the Committee agreed. O\u2019Sullivan also met with Father Grinsell, the Director of Don Bosco, who also agreed that Marc should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Meanwhile, Marc wrote a letter of appeal to Father Grinsell dated March 6, 1995. Marc also took a polygraph test and drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>test, which indicated that Mare was telling the truth and was drug free.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">On March 9, 1995, O\u2019Sullivan and James Scanlon, the Principal at Don Bosco, met with Marc and his parents. O\u2019Sullivan and Scanlon asked Marc to withdraw from Don Bosco. Plaintiff contends that he requested a hearing to determine the nature of the charges against him and the grounds for dismissal; his request was denied. Thereafter, plaintiff wrote letters of appeal to Father Timothy Ploch, the Provincial Director, and again to Father Grinsell. Father Grinsell met again with O\u2019Sullivan and met with Principal Scanlon, and agreed that Marc should withdraw. Father Grinsell denied Marc\u2019s appeal. Marc\u2019s attorney allegedly sent a letter, received on March 10, threatening legal action if Don Bosco failed to reinstate Marc.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Marc did not withdraw from Don Bosco. As a result, Principal Scanlon wrote a letter dated March 16, 1995, informing the Hernandez family that Marc was dismissed from Don Bosco. The letter indicated that after the meeting with the Hernandez family on March 9, when Marc was asked to withdraw, Principal Scanlon personally consulted with Father Grinsell and decided to dismiss Marc. The letter reviewed Marc\u2019s disciplinary history: the probation during the fall term of Marc\u2019s senior year; the incident on the bus with James Hopper which led to a suspension; the allegations of prank calls to the teacher which also resulted in a suspension; the report of steroid use and distribution; and the report of urinating in students\u2019 lockers. The letter also reviewed the meetings in March preceding the decision to dismiss Mare. The letter noted that Marc had sent letters to Father Grinsell, who denied his appeal. The letter concluded that \u201cMarc had been given more than a fair opportunity to conform his conduct to the requirements of our school. Marc had fair notice of these requirements, both from the Parent/Student Handbook and from the numerous warnings and lesser punishments he has received.\u201d The letter cited relevant portions of the Student &amp; Parent Handbook. The letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>concluded that for all the reasons stated in the letter, Principal Scanlon \u201creached the decision to dismiss Marc.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Don Bosco prepares a Student &amp; Parent Handbook for each academic year. The students and the parents are required to read the handbook and sign the \u201ccontractual agreement\u201d at the commencement of the school year. The handbook for the academic year 1994-95 (Marc\u2019s senior year) includes a provision for discipline, in which Don Bosco reserves the right:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">to suspend and, when circumstances warrant, to dismiss students whose behavior is disrespectful, recalcitrant, disruptive, immoral, illegal or which is at odds with promoting our school environment or is detrimental to the reputation of the school with regard to behavior occurring inside or outside of the school.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Additionally, students who are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-9\">disruptive in class, uncivil in the cafeteria or rude and insulting at athletic contests are in serious violation of the proper code of conduct, and depending on the gravity and frequency of the offense the student will be detained after school, suspended for a suitable period, or, at the discretion of the Principal, dismissed from Don Bosco Preparatory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">The Principal may place a student on disciplinary probation<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for committing a \u201cserious infraction,\u201d but only after hearing the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. The terms of probation are presented to the parents, and the parents and the student must sign the agreement. While on probation, if the student is involved in another major infraction, the student may be dismissed at once.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Dismissal at Don Bosco is reserved for a \u201cserious offense against Christian morality at school or school event,\u201d or for a violation of disciplinary probation. The Principal must consult with the Director of the Don Bosco School Board. The student may appeal in writing to the Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The Discipline Committee\u2019s purpose is \u201cto consider and suggest the most appropriate course of action to be taken regarding a student who has committed a grave offense against the civil or moral law in school or at a school function.\u201d The Committee consists of the Assistant Principal (O\u2019Sullivan), the Class Dean, and the student\u2019s Guidance Counselor in an advisory, non-voting capacity. The Principal (Scanlon), though not a member of the Committee, may be present during the meeting. The Committee must meet before any student is dismissed for disciplinary reasons. The Committee makes a recommendation to the Principal, who in turn makes the final decision as to the student\u2019s dismissal after consulting with the Director (Father Grinsell).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The handbook specifically prohibits harassment in any form. The handbook also, states that \u201cpossession, use, sale, or distribution of alcohol or drugs, whether legal or illegal, before, during, or after the school day or at or before any school function will be handled by the Ramsey Police Department and is grounds for dismissal from Don Bosco Preparatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging improper dismissal that prevented him from securing scholarships and admission to certain colleges. At the oral argument for Don Bosco\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the motion judge stated that he could not find in his \u201creview of the ease law any finite position taken by the courts of this State that says conclusively that a private school is immune from providing procedural due process, and I refuse to take that position.\u201d The motion judge concluded that both constitutional due process and basic fairness require a hearing and notice of charges. The judge further concluded that the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>alleged required a jury to determine whether the school followed its own procedure that it had set forth in the handbook. The judge also determined that neither party had demonstrated facts to warrant summary judgment. The judge noted plaintiffs argument that the school should have called the Ramsey police but failed to do so, but that the judge did not \u201cknow what the evidence is going to be with respect to that.\u201d Accordingly, the court denied Don Bosco\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">On appeal, Don Bosco argues that plaintiffs entire case was appropriate for summary judgment, that its actions as a private school did not implicate the New Jersey or United States Constitution, and that Don Bosco complied with sufficient procedure in dismissing Marc. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">A. CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Plaintiff alleged violations of due process, which would include a claim for the violation of due process under the United States Constitution and the New Jersey Constitution. The United States Constitution provides that no state may deprive a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. The New Jersey Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">All persons are by nature free and independent and have certain natural and unalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and of pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-11\"><em>[N.J. Const </em>art. 1, \u00b6 1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">We first address plaintiffs federal constitutional argument. Plaintiff must demonstrate that Don Bosco functioned as state action to invoke federal constitutional protection. Private schools are only bound to the constitutional requirements of due process if the private school has substantial involvement with the state. Courts have recognized that \u201c[c]onduct that is formally \u2018private\u2019 may become so entwined with governmental policies or so impregnated with a governmental character as to become subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>to the constitutional limitations placed upon state action.\u201d <em>Evans v. Newton, </em>382 <em>U.S. </em>296, 299, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>486, 488, 15 L.Ed.2d 373, 376 (1966); <em>see also Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth., </em>365 <em>U.S. </em>715, 726, 81 <em>S.Ct. </em>856, 862, 6 L.Ed.2d 45, 52-53 (1961) (finding state action for Equal Protection claims in a restaurant which leased the building from a State).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">New Jersey courts have addressed the issue of state action in private universities. <em>State v. Schmid, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>535, 423 A.2d 615 (1980), <em>app. dismissed, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>100, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>867, 70 L.Ed.2d 855 (1982), addressed the First Amendment in private schools:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">A private college or university, however, stands upon a different footing in relationship to the state. Such an institution is not the creature or instrument of state government. Even though such an institution may conduct itself identically to its state-operated counterparts and, in terms of educational purposes and activities, may be virtually indistinguishable from a public institution, <em>see </em>McKay, \u201cThe Student As Private Citizen,\u201d 45 <em>Denver L.J. </em>558, 560 (1968), a private college or university does not thereby either operate under or exercise the authority of state government. Hence, the state nexus requirement that triggers the application of the First Amendment is not readily met in the ease of a private educational institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 543, 423 A.2d 615.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Further, the Court in <em>Schmid </em>stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-9\">Among the factors most often marshaled to show state action [for First Amendment purposes] are that the institution received government funds, that the institution was performing a governmental function by providing education, that it was state-accredited or state-chartered or was otherwise highly regulated by the state, that the college derived economic benefit from tax exemptions, that it indirectly enforced governmental laws, or, in some instances, that the college had been built on formerly public lands.... For the most part, however, such challenges have failed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-12\">[Id. at 545-46, 423 A.2d 615 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-13\">Thus, in <em>Schmid, </em>the Court determined that despite the nexus between the State of New Jersey and Princeton University, i.e., state accreditation, participation in state programs, tax-exempt status, and some state funds, the university was wholly private and its actions did not rise to the level of state action for First Amendment purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 547-48, 423 A.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-14\">Here, both parties cite <em>Napolitano v. Princeton Univ. Trustees, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>548, 453 A.2d 263 (App.Div.1982), where we noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>that courts \u201chave been virtually unanimous in rejecting students\u2019 claims for due process in the constitutional sense where academic suspensions or dismissal are involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567, 453 A.2d 263 (citations omitted); <em>see also Huff v. Notre Dame High School, </em>456 <em>F.Supp. </em>1145, 1148 (D.Conn.1978) (noting that the federal judiciary is \u201cnearly unanimous in holding that financial assistance to a private university or professional school, without more, does not render the actions of the educational institution state action for purposes of [a claim under \u00a7 1983]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Plaintiff relies on <em>Ryan v. Hofstra Univ., </em>67 <em>Misc.2d </em>651, 324 N.Y.S.2d 964 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1971). There, the plaintiff was a college student at Hofstra University, a private college in New York. Plaintiff was expelled from the university after a student protest during which he threw rocks. The trial judge determined that the state was significantly involved in Hofstra University so as to render the school an agent of the state. <em>Id. </em>at 983. The judge held that plaintiff was deprived of due process in his expulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">However, in a subsequent opinion by another New York trial court, the judge declined to apply the holding in <em>Ryan </em>to a private high school. <em>Oefelein v. Monsignor Farrell High School, </em>77 <em>Misc.2d </em>417, 353 N.Y.S.2d 674 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1974). In <em>Oefelein, </em>the plaintiff was a private high school student and was expelled without a hearing. The opinion does not disclose the reason for the expulsion. The plaintiff there listed the nexus between the high school and the state: state charter, state regents exams, tax-exempt status, secular books supplied by the state, and attendance requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 675. The plaintiff in <em>Oefelein </em>also relied on <em>Ryan, supra, </em>67 <em>Misc.2d </em>651, 324 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>964. However, the court distinguished the facts in <em>Oefelein </em>from those in <em>Ryan. </em>First, the court determined that the nexus that the high school had with the state was substantially less than Hofstra University. Second, the rights of a high school student are different than those of a college student. \u201cA high school student has immediate access to the public schools to complete his [or her] education. A college student may not be able to transfer so easily.\u201d <em>Oefelein, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>353 <em>N.Y.S.</em>2d at 675. Accordingly, the expulsion was not a state action, and thus the student had no constitutional rights of due process. The issue of whether the school dealt fairly with the student was not before that court. <em>Id. </em>at 676; <em>see also Wisch v. Sanford School, </em>420 <em>F.Supp. </em>1310, 1313-14 (D.Del.1976) (finding that a private high school\u2019s tax-exempt status and state funds for student transportation and for driver\u2019s education was insufficient state involvement to invoke constitutional due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Don Bosco was clearly acting as a private organization, not as a state agency. Plaintiff alleges only that the State of New Jersey funds and aids in the operation of the school through accreditation. Such a negligible connection with the State is plainly insufficient to render the school\u2019s dismissal \u201cstate action\u201d under the require1 ments of the United States Constitution. Thus, federal due process was not warranted for Marc\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Although plaintiffs claim for violations of due process fails under the United States Constitution for lack of state action, plaintiff also includes a due process claim under the New Jersey Constitution. \u201cThe New Jersey Supreme Court has continued to consider interpretations of the state constitutional rights provisions that are broader, or more protective of citizens, than the decisions of the United States Supreme Court interpreting the federal Constitution.\u201d Robert F. Williams, <em>The New Jersey State Constitution: A Reference Guide </em>xix (1997). For example, in <em>Schmid, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 560, 423 A.2d 615 the Court dismissed plaintiffs First Amendment claim but granted relief under the New Jersey Constitution. <em>See, e.g., State v. Mollica, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>329, 352, 554 A.2d 1315 (1989) (giving greater protection of privacy interest in toll records for telephone use); <em>State v. Novembrino, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>95, 519 A.2d 820 (1987) (allowing more protection from unreasonable searches and seizures); <em>Right to Choose v. Byrne, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>287, 310, 450 A.2d 925 (1982) (giving a greater right to abortions under Medicaid than the opinion in <em>Harris v. McRae, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>297, 316, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2671, 2687-88, 65 L.Ed.2d 784, 804 (1980)); <em>State v. Baker, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>99, 405 A.2d 368 (1979) (holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>that a municipality may not pass a zoning ordinance limiting the number of non-related individuals living in a single household unit); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>349, 346 A.2d 66 (1975) (giving more rights to a person being searched in New Jersey than required by the decision in <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 <em>U.S. </em>218, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973)). <em>See generally </em>Williams, <em>supra, The New Jersey State Constitution: A Reference Guide </em>at 27-28; William J. Brennan, Jr., \u201cState Constitutions and the Protection of Individual Rights,\u201d 90 <em>Harv. L.Rev. </em>489 (1977). We refused to read article one, paragraph one of the New Jersey Constitution as granting greater rights than the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution in <em>Ferraro v. Long Branch, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>268, 286, 714 A.2d 945 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>541, 724 A.2d 801 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Although the New Jersey Constitution does, in certain situations, grant greater protection to individual rights than the United States Constitution, we can not conclude that our State Constitution grants greater protections in the area of procedural due process for expulsion from a private school. Accordingly, because of the absence of state action, neither the United States Constitution nor the New Jersey Constitution protect plaintiffs procedural rights. We therefore dismiss plaintiffs constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">B. FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Although plaintiff can not show state action to invoke the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment or article I of the New Jersey Constitution, we now consider what procedural protections a private high school must afford its students upon disciplinary expulsion. In our analysis, we consider public schools and universities, private associations, private universities, and private primary and secondary schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Public high school students enjoy the greatest procedural rights when expelled because of procedural due process protection. The United States Supreme Court has held that, in the public school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>arena, \u201cthe State is constrained to recognize a student\u2019s legitimate entitlement to a public education as a property interest which is protected by the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 <em>U.S. </em>565, 574, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>729, 736, 42 L.Ed.2d 725, 734 (1975). The minimum requirements for temporary suspension for misconduct include \u201coral or written notice of the charges against [the student] and, if he [or she] denies them, an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his [or her] side of the story.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 740, 42 L.Ed.2d at 739. The school need not give notice of the charges in advance of the hearing, so long as the student is informed of \u201cwhat he [or she] is accused of doing and what the basis of the accusation is.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 740, 42 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 739. The Court declined to hold that the student has the right to obtain counsel, to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, or to call witnesses in defense. <em>Id. </em>at 583, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 740, 42 L.Ed.2d at 740. However, the Court noted that permanent expulsion may require a more formal procedure. <em>Id. </em>at 584, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 741, 42 L.Ed.2d at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In New Jersey, authority to expel a student from a public school is granted by statute. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>18A:37-1 and -2. In <em>Tibbs v. Board of Educ. of Franklin Tp., </em>114 <em>N.J.Super. </em>287, 276 A.2d 165 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>506, 284 A.2d 179 (1971), our Supreme Court held that, when facing expulsion, a public school student has the right to discover the names of witnesses against him or her, and to obtain copies of statements or affidavits of the adverse witnesses. In addition, the student has the right to have the witnesses appear in person for questioning; if the witness fails to appear for questioning, then their statements may not be relied on as a basis for suspension or expulsion for misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 300, 276 A.2d 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Public high schools may immediately and temporarily suspend a student for a short period if school officials have reason to believe that the student is a danger to himself, others, or school property, pending a full hearing complete with procedural due process. <em>R.R. v. Board of Educ., Shore Regional High School, </em>109 <em>N.J.Su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>per. </em>337, 347-48, 263 A.2d 180 (Ch.Div.1970). However, the school must first give the student a preliminary hearing for the temporary suspension, either prior to the temporary suspension or at a reasonable time thereafter. The preliminary hearing may be informal, but the \u201cstudent should be given the opportunity to persuade the authority that there is a case of mistaken identity or that there is some other compelling reason why he [or she] should not be suspended pending a full hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348, 263 A.2d 180. The nature of the subsequent full hearing, if one is held, \u201cclearly depends upon the circumstances of the particular case.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">In <em>G.F. v. Board of Educ., Washington Tp., </em>1 <em>N.J.A.R. </em>55 (1979), an Administrative Law Judge determined that when a public school student faces expulsion or long-term suspension, the school board must advise the student, in writing, of: the charges; the list of witnesses to be called to support each charge; the right to cross-examine the witnesses; the right to enter their own defense; and the right to counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 65. However, the right to counsel is only a \u201cright to employ counsel\u201d; the student \u201cneed not be represented by counsel.\u201d <em>R.R., supra, </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 349, 263 A.2d 180; <em>see also J.A. v. South Orange Board of Educ., </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>512, 524, 723 A.2d 1270 (App.Div.1999) (extending due process protections to prospective public school students).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Public universities afford constitutional due process in disciplining students; however, when the student requests protections from the law of contracts rather than the law of procedural due process, New Jersey courts have declined to characterize the relationship between student and university as contractual. In <em>Mittra v. University of Medicine, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 719 A.2d 693 (App.Div.1998), plaintiff was a student who was dismissed from a state university for academic reasons. Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging the student handbook formed contractual obligations which the school breached. We cited <em>Napolitano, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>548, 453 A.2d 263, rejecting the \u201crigid application of contractual principles to university-student conflicts involving aca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>demic performance,\u201d and instead limited the \u201cscope of review to a determination whether the procedures followed were in accordance with the institution\u2019s rules and regulations.\u201d <em>Mittra, supra, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 90, 719 A.2d 693. Thus, we found that the public university fairly followed its own regulations in expelling the plaintiff for academic reasons. <em>Id. </em>at 92, 719 A.2d 693. We also noted that the student was protected by due process. <em>Id. </em>at 91-92, 719 A.2d 693; <em>see also Sill v. Pennsylvania State Univ., </em>462 F.2d 463 (3d Cir.1972) (holding that disciplinary infractions at a state university required adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard; this was satisfied when the board of trustees appointed a disciplinary panel to make findings of facts and disciplinary recommendations to the president when notice and a hearing were also supplied to the student).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">A private primary or secondary school is generally considered a private association rather than a function of the state. The procedural rights inherent in membership with a private association, and the termination of that membership, are substantially less than those of a public school or public university student. Membership in a private organization attaches somewhat different rights than \u201cmembership\u201d in a private university. We find, however, that membership in a private high school is distinguishable from membership in other private associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Membership in a private organization receives the least procedural protection in our judiciary. The court must first balance the conflicting interests of the association\u2019s autonomy and the member\u2019s interest in the association; then, the court will only interfere when the association unfairly neglects to follow its established procedures for discipline. In <em>Rutledge v. Gulian, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>113, 459 A.2d 680 (1983), the plaintiff was disciplined by the Society of Free and Accepted Masons of New Jersey of which he was a member. The Court faced the issue of whether membership in a private organization warrants judicial protection. The Court first determined that membership in a fraternal organization warrants \u201cprotection from unreasonable discomfiture\u201d by virtue of the status it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>confers on its members. <em>Id. </em>at 119, 459 A.2d 680. The Court then concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">[i]n determining whether a private.organization is bound by its established procedures, we would again balance the organization\u2019s interest in autonomy and its reason for straying from its rules against the magnitude of interference with the member\u2019s interest in the organization and the likelihood that the established procedures would safeguard that interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 123, 459 A.2d 680.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The Court further noted that \u201ca private organization has a great interest in controlling its own affairs.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, \u201cjudicial intrusion should be confined to procedures that are fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124, 459 A.2d 680. The Court found no reason to intervene with the Mason\u2019s decision to discipline plaintiff. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">The judiciary may similarly intervene in a church\u2019s decision to expel its members so long as the review does not require the court to interpret religious doctrine. <em>Baugh v. Thomas, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>203, 265 A.2d 675 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Private university students enjoy greater procedural rights because of the unique relationship between the university and its students. As such, a private university may expel a student only upon a showing of sufficient evidence. In <em>Napolitano, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>548, 453 A.2d 263, plaintiff was charged by Princeton, a private university, with plagiarism, tried in front of the Committee on Discipline, and found guilty. Thus, Princeton withheld the student\u2019s diploma for one year as punishment. On appeal, we determined first that the issue was the propriety of discipline involving academic fraud, rather than general misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 563, 453 A.2d 263; <em>see also Board of Curators, Univ. of Mo. v. Horowitz, </em>435 <em>U.S. </em>78, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>948, 55 L.Ed.2d 124 (1978) (distinguishing academic dismissal from dismissal for misconduct). We declined to apply the law of private associations to a private university setting, as the relationship between a student and a private university is unique, not purely contractual or associational. <em>Napolitano, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 565-66, 453 A.2d 263. We concluded that the trial court properly reviewed the Committee decision and determined that the \u201cevidence presented was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>sufficient to support the charge of plagiarism.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 453 A.2d 263; <em>see also Clayton v. Princeton Univ., </em>608 <em>F.Supp. </em>413, 438 (D.N.J.1985) (interpreting New Jersey law and holding that when a private university has adopted a regulation establishing the procedure for expulsion for misconduct, then the university must follow that procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Although no court in New Jersey has addressed the procedural requirements of a private high school for disciplinary expulsion, other state courts have addressed this issue. In <em>Flint v. St. Augustine High School, </em>323 <em>So.2d </em>229 (La.Ct.App.1975), <em>writ refused, </em>325 So.2d 271 (La.1976), two students were expelled from St. Augustine High, a private Catholic high school, for smoking, a violation of the code of conduct delineated in the handbook. In discussing due process claims, the appellate court held that constitutional due process was not invoked by a private high school. The court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">private institutions like St. Augustine High School have a near absolute right and power to control their own internal disciplinary procedure which, by its very nature, includes the right and power to dismiss students. That is not to say that due process safeguards can be cavalierly ignored or disregarded. But, if there is color of due process \u2014 that is enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 234.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The appellate court determined that the school provided sufficient notice to the student to satisfy the \u201ccolor of due process\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">We agree that \u201cdue process safeguards can [not] be cavalierly ignored or disregarded.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, we decline to hold that the rights of a private high school student are the same as those of a private university student, because we find a distinction between the two institutions. A student at a private university, if expelled during the semester for misconduct, loses academic credit for the entire semester. Further, the university student must complete applications for admission to another university in order to complete the expected degree. An expelled student in a private high school, on the other hand, may transfer immediately to the local public high school. The high school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>student will not lose credit for the semester; rather, the student may complete the semester at the public school, and receive a high school diploma from the public school. <em>See Oefelein, supra, </em>353 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>at 675 (\u201cA high school student has immediate access to the public schools to complete his [or her] education. A college student may not be able to transfer so easily.\u201d). As such, the procedural rights of a private university student will be more aggressively protected by the courts when compared to the procedural rights of an expelled student at a private high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">We hold that a private high school, when expelling a student for misconduct, must follow a two-prong process. First, the private high school must adhere to its own established procedures for dismissal. Second, in executing the dismissal, the school must follow a procedure that is fundamentally fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Here, Don Bosco\u2019s student handbook set forth the procedure for expulsion. The Discipline Committee must meet; then the Committee must make a recommendation to the Principal regarding dismissal; afterwards, the Principal consults with the Director. The student may appeal the decision to the Director. The evidence in the record on appeal clearly shows that Don Bosco followed this procedure before dismissing plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Plaintiff argues that Don Bosco failed to follow its own procedure by failing to notify the Ramsey police of his alleged sale and distribution of steroids. The student handbook states that the investigation of use, sale, or distribution of legal or illegal drugs \u201cwill be handled by the Ramsey Police Department.\u201d Although Don Bosco alerted its students that it would involve the Ramsey police in instances involving the \u201cuse, sale, or distribution of alcohol or drugs, whether legal or illegal,\u201d we do not consider its failure to do so as depriving a student of a procedural right. In fact, plaintiff derived a benefit from Don Bosco\u2019s failure to contact the police because he avoided interrogation and possible criminal or juvenile charges if the steroids were in fact illegal. Plaintiff can not now claim that the failure to contact the police violated his procedural rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Whether the procedure is fundamentally fair will depend on the circumstances of the expulsion. Here, plaintiff was notified of the charges of trashing the teacher\u2019s home and prank calling the same teacher. He was notified of the charges of steroid use and distribution at the meeting with O\u2019Sullivan at which time he was suspended indefinitely. Plaintiff took the opportunity to appeal to Father Grinsell, the Director. Additionally, plaintiff had the opportunity to defend the charges, and did so by taking a polygraph test and a drug test. His appeal to Father Grinsell was denied, and the test results did not affect the decision to expel plaintiff. We consider this procedure to be fundamentally fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the order denying Don Bosco\u2019s summary judgment, see <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 523, 666 A.2d 146 (1995), and dismiss the complaint against Don Bosco with prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-15\"> This opinion will refer only to defendant Don Bosco and to plaintiff Marcus Hernandez.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b33-9\"> Plaintiffs complaint alleged that defendants: breached their legal and contractual obligation to provide plaintiff with a thorough and proper high school education (counts one and three); violated due process by dismissing plaintiff from defendant school without notice and an opportunity to be heard (counts two, four, six, and seven); committed \"improper actions and violations of right\" which caused financial, educational, physical and emotional damage, pain, and suffering (count five); and committed slander (count eight). The complaint sought punitive and compensatory damages for damage to his educational future and opportunities.
