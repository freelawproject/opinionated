At that time, he was seventy years of age, and his wife was sixty-seven. He had no children or issue living ; neither had he any near relatives living except his brother Daniel, and his said brother\u2019s eight children. Of these six were sons, and two were daughters. One of the sons, James S., died unmarried and intestate before the testator. When the will was made, one of the daughters was married and one was single. The single daughter subsequently married and died after the testator\u2019s death, leaving a husband and an infant daughter. The ages of these nieces and nephews, at the time the will was made, ranged from forty-six to twenty-two years. The testator died in April, 1870, childless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-5\">In the first clause of his will he directed the payment of his just debts.

In the third clause he gave to his wife, outright, the half of a lot of land, the other half of which was owned by her sister, and he also directed that whatever stood to his wife\u2019s credit on his ledger should be paid to her. In the fifth clause of his will the testator made a specific legacy to his cousin Seraphine E. Noyes of certain indebtedness. In the sixth clause he gave to Martha C. Foster, a <em>quasi ward </em>of his, who had for years resided in his family, the income of fifty-five shares of stock in the Providence and Worcester R. R. Co. during her life, and after her death, the stock to Robert Rogers Howard. In the eighth clause the testator gave to said Robert R. Howard all indebtedness due from him to the testator. In the ninth and tenth clauses the testator gave to certain cousins of his of the Noyes family certain indebtedness due him from them. In the eleventh clause he gave to Wm. Henry Mosher, a former ship-master of his, the income for life of fifty shares of Webster Bank stock, and at said Mosher\u2019s death the stock to Robert R. Howard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">The fourth, seventh, twelfth, and thirteenth clauses of the will are as follows : \u2014\u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-7\"><em>'\u2022'\u25a0Fourthly. </em>I do give and bequeath to my executors hereafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>named, in trust for the use and improvement of my wife Maria Rogers, during her natural life (the income or dividends on which only are to be applied and appropriated to her use and benefit), and in lieu of all claims of dower on any part of my estate, viz.: two hundred full shares of the stock in the Bank of Commerce in the city of New Yoi'k; one hundred shares of the stock of the Bank of the State of New York in the citjr of New York; one hundred shares of the stock in the Hartford and New Haven Railroad Company ; one hundred and twenty shares of the stock of the New York and New Haven Railroad Company ; one hundred and seventeen shares of the stock in the Boston and Providence Railroad Corporation ; one hundred and forty-two shares in the Old Colony and Fall River Railroad Corporation ; all of which stocks, at their par value, amount to seventy-seven thousand and nine hundred dollars; and after my wife\u2019s decease it is my will that fifteen hundred dollars per year of the income or dividends of the stocks aforesaid be paid to Charlotte D\u2019Wolf, her sister, during the term of her natural life, and that the remainder of said income or dividends be divided equally among the children of my brother Daniel Rogers, or their legal heirs-at-law, until the decease of the said Charlotte D\u2019Wolf; and that after that event the said stocks be equally divided among the children of my brother Daniel Rogers, or their legal heirs-at-law, or held in trust by my said brother, with power of naming substitutes at his option, and I do bequeath the same accordingly.

And where a testator creates a prior estate, and then goes on to dispose of the ulterior interest expressly, on an event which will determine the prior estate, the words descriptive of such event occurring in the latter devise will be construed as referring merely to the period of the determination of the possession or enjoyment under tbe prior gift, and not as designed to postpone the vesting. 1 Jarman on Wills, 727; Williams on Executors, 1083; 1 Roper on Legacies, 557.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-9\">The first rule of construction is this: That a bequest to a person, <em>payable </em>or <em>to be </em>paid, at or when he shall attain the age of twenty-one, or at the end of any other certain determinate term, confers on him a vested interest immediately on the testator\u2019s death, as <em>debitum in prcesenti solvendum in </em>futuro, and transmissible to his executors or administrators: for the words \u201c payable \u201d or \u201c to be paid \u201d are supposed to disannex time from the gift of the legacy, so as to leave the gift immediate, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>same manner as if the bequest stood singly and contained no mention of time.

Holme, 1 Bro. O. C. 298. See also <em>Barnes </em>v. Allen, 1 Bro. O. O. 181; <em>May </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>3 Bro. C. C. 473.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-6\">Where the words of a will are in the present tense, but the direction for the payment is in the future, the fair import of the language Is, that there is a present gift to be paid hereafter. A direction in a will for the division of the estate among several persons by the executor, is equivalent to a direction for the payment to the legatees of the irrespective shares; in such a case, the interest is vested and transmissible.

The principal of these exceptions, and the only one now necessary to consider, is this: That the rule itself is always subservient to the intention of the testator; and if, therefore, on construing the whole will, it clearly appears that the testator meant the time of payment to be the time when the legacy should vest, no interest will be transmissible to the executors or administrators, if the legatee dies b,efore the period of payment, although the words \u201c payable at,\u201d or \u201c to be paid,\u201d or other terms of immediate gift be employed in the will. 1 Roper on Legacies, 558 <em>et seq.; </em>Williams on Executors, 1083. It is to be remarked that it is a rule controlling this exception, that the intention of the testator to postpone the vesting must be clearly expressed, and with certainty and precision, or the general rule will operate ; and that intention to postpone cannot be derived from ambiguous words. <em>Corbin </em>v. Wilson, 2 Ashm. 178; <em>JEldredge </em>v. JEldredge, 9 Cush. 516 ; <em>Bowher </em>v. Bowher, 9 Cush. 519 ; <em>Watson </em>v. Woods, 3 R. I. 226; <em>Getford </em>v. Thorn, 1 Stock. N.

Barker, 9 Hare, 744.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-5\">It must be inferred, where the time fixed for the payment of a legacy <em>is </em>certain, the testator merely postponed the payment of the legacy. Williams on Executors, 1083; 1 Roper on Legacies, 561, 562.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-6\">In the case at bar, the division must be made on' the death of the widow; an event absolutely certain to happen at no great distance of time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An\">\u201c The construction which reads words that are seemingly creative of a future interest, as referring merely to the futurity of possession occasioned by the carving out of a prior interest, and as pointing to the determination of that interest, and not as designed to postpone the vesting, has obtained, in some instances, where the terms, in which the posterior gift is framed, import contingency, and would, unconnected with and unexplained by the prior gift, clearly postpone the vesting. Thus, where a testator devises lands to trustees until A. shall attain the age of twenty-one years, and if, or when, he shall attain that age, then to him in fee, this is construed as conferring on A. a vested estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>in fee simple subject to the prior chattel interest given to the trustees, and consequently, on A.\u2019s death under the prescribed age, the property descends to his heir-at-law; though it is quite clear that a devise to A., if, or when, he shall attain the age of twenty-one years, standing isolated and detached from the context, would confer a contingent interest only.\u201d 1 Jarman on Wills, 734; <em>Borastoris case, </em>3 Rep. 19; <em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>Bryard, </em>1 Eq.

The <em>corpus </em>of the residue being thus held by said trustee, during the time limited, for the benefit of said parties, the interest of the latter in the whole property, both income and capital, must be held to have vested immediately on the death of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-6\">The second rule of construction adopted by courts for their government, in ascertaining the intention of the testator in cases where a future time is defined for the payment of the legacy, is this: That if the words \u201c payable \u201d or \u201ctobe paid\u201d are omitted, and the legacies given <em>at </em>twenty-one, or <em>if, when, in case, </em>or provided, the legatees attain twenty-one, or any other definite period, these expressions annex time to the substance of the legacy, and make the legatee\u2019s right to it depend on his being alive at the time fixed for its payment; consequently, if the legatee happens to die before that period arrives, his personal representatives will not be entitled to the legacy. Williams on Executors, 5th Am. ed. 1083; 1 Roper on Legacies, 566.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-7\">There is, however, an important exception to the second rule of construction, which is embodied in the words of this second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>point. In cases where the legacy is given at some period, and in the interim interest is to be paid by trustees, who hold the property, to the legatee, or held for his benefit, words which may import a condition precedent to the vesting of the legacy will not be permitted to have that effect; on the contrary, they will be considered as merely descriptive of the <em>time </em>when the legatee was to be let into the possession of the fund, and then, according to the first rule of construction, the legacy will vest at the death of the testator, and if the legatee dies before the time limited, his personal representative will be entitled to the legacy. And this applies equally to cases where the income of property is given for the support and maintenance of legatees, and where it is given for their benefit generally.

Dividends and income are undoubtedly the objects of distinct gifts, wholly independent of the capital. But in such cases, the intent of the testator so to separate them must be clear and distinct, and the language expressing that intent must be unambiguous and free from all doubt. <em>Batsford </em>v. <em>Kebbell, </em>3 Yes.

For in each of those cases, an immediate particular gift of the dividends alone is first made, and <em>then </em>the gift of the fund is made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>to depend on an expressed contingencji-, the intent being to bring the object of the second gift within the operation of the second rule of construction. But in the case at bar, not only are the words \u201cto divide \u201d used so as to bring it clearly within the operation of the first rule of construction;, but the whole rest, residue, and remainder, is given immediately in express terms in the present tense, to the legatees and their heirs, through a trustee, who holds it for a time for the benefit of said legatees, with a positive direction to divide the property among them on an event which must soon happen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-5\">If we are to give to plain words their plain signification, the interest of the parties named in the twelfth clause of this will, in both income and capital, must be held to have vested on the death of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-6\">The twelfth clause of the will of Robert Rogers disposes of the residue of the testator\u2019s estate, and being the gift of a residue, the interest therein of the parties named in said clause must be held to have vested on the death of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-7\">It is an unquestioned rule in the construction of wills, that a bequest of the residue of an estate will always be construed to be vested, for the -purpose of preventing an intestacy. <em>-Booth </em>v.

The intention of the testator is the first and great object of inquiry, and to this object technical rules are, to a certain extent, made subservient. 4 Kent\u2019s Comm. 534.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-9\">It may be remarked in this connection, however, that.the intention of the testator to postpone the vesting must be clearly expressed, and with certainty and precision, or the general rule of construction as to vesting will operate, and that intention cannot be derived from ambiguous words.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-10\">The intention of the testator, in the case at bar, as gathered from the four corners of the will itself, is: that not only is the interest of the children of Daniel Rogers in the' residue of the testator\u2019s estate a vested interest, but the enjoyment of both principal and interest is immediate, excepting only as to so much as will produce' the annual sum of $3,000, to guarantee the payment of that amount to the testator\u2019s widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-11\">Upon reading the will, three objects of the testator\u2019s bounty appear specially prominent: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number><em>First. </em>That in addition to the legacies given outright to his widow, he intended that she should have at least $3,000 a year. To this end, he gives her the income of a fund which the bill states, and the answers admit, has produced $7,000 a year, and never less than $6,000 a year, and which income it is grossly improbable will ever fall below the sum of $3,000 per annum. In case, however, it should fall below said last named sum, the deficit only is to be paid out of the residue of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-5\"><em>Second. </em>That he meant to provide liberally for Robert Rogers Howard, of Michigan, and his issue, as shown by the sixth, seventh, eighth, and eleventh clauses of his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-6\">The reason for this generous bounty as given by the testator, was that Howard \u201c was named by my \u201d (the testator\u2019s) \u201c late honored mother, with a request that I \u201d (the testator) \u201c would liberally provide for him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-7\"><em>Third. </em>That the testator intended that his own blood relatives, viz., the children of his only brother, should be chiefly benefited by his estate. This is abundantly apparent throughout the whole length and breadth of the will. In the fourth clause he gives them, after his wife\u2019s death, the whole income of the fund that produces his wife\u2019s annuity, except so much thereof as would produce the annual sum of $1,500, and after his wife\u2019s sister\u2019s death, he gives them the whole principal of that fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-8\">It again appears in the seventh clause, where he gives them the large fund set apart for R. R. Howard and his issue, in case the said Howard should die without issue. And, finally, it appears most prominently in the twelfth clause, where he gives them all the residuum, charged only with the empty burden of paying any deficiency in the annual sum of $3,000 to his widow, mentioned in the fourth clause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-9\">It is plain that, after making what he deemed a sufficient provision for his wife, who was far advanced in years, the ties of blood were stronger with him than all others. It is hardly consistent with this manifest purpose displayed throughout that he intended that his nieces and nephews, who seem so near and dear to him, should be barred from any enjoyment of his bounty till after his widow\u2019s death, as some of those very nieces and nephews were far along in life, being now over fifty years of age, and being then near fifty, some of them having families of chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>dren, and one of them, at least, now, having grandchildren. Especially does this seem improbable, as there is no reasonably useful purpose to be subserved by such delay, for it can hardly seem reasonable to any one that an estate of over a million of dollars should be tied up to guarantee the sufficiency of a fund to pay $3,000 a year, which fund has been for a long time, is now, and probably will ever be able to pay an annual sum of twice that amount. Again, it seems highly improbable that the testator meant to defer for years the enjoyment of his bounty by the cardinal objects of that bounty,.when he munificently endows, <em>in </em>prcesenti, a stranger, whose only tie upon him was through his love for his own mother, that stranger having been named by the testator\u2019s mother, with the request that the testator would liberally provide for him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-4\">3.

In this section Daniel Rogers, the testator\u2019s brother, whose name had been used several times in the preceding section, appears as devisee in trust of the entire residuary estate, with certain powers and duties as trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-8\"><em>First. </em>The proposed new trust is a mere instrument for the. collection of the income and its payment over to the married <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>women themselves, upon their own receipt. In this respect nothing is added to the directions of the previous clause, of which the clause now under consideration must be considered as a mere continuation, confined to the shares of the married women. Nothing is said about the effect of the trust upon the body of the estate, either during the coverture or the life of a married daughter. That remains as under the trust first declared, by which we have seen that the daughters as well as the sons of Daniel Rogers took vested interests in their respective shares. In the second place, this income is to be paid to each married daughter after it shall have accrued. This provision applies only to the duty of the trustee. The beneficiary may, of course, contract debts, with the expectation of paying them out of the accruing income, and the income may in this way be enjoyed and spent before it is due, as effectually as if it had been advanced by the trustee. The use of the word \u201c creditor \u201d is entirely unwarranted, as no trust could protect her property from her own creditors for debts lawfully contracted. <em>Tillinghast </em>v. Bradford, 5 R. I. 205. There is no restraint upon her as to the alienation of the trust estate during her lifetime, or from disposing of it by will after her decease. Ibid. What is said of the body of the estate is in relation to its inheritance from the married daughter by her own children, or in default of children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-5\">It seems to us a conclusive objection to the making of such a settlement as seems to have been contemplated by the testator, that it would be wholly useless and unnecessary as a protection to the property, or to the married woman\u2019s interest in it in her lifetime. The body of the estate being vested in her by force of the operative words of the devise, whether her estate be legal or equitable, it is taken by her, and is to be held and enjoyed according to the law of her domicil. And with regard to Mrs. Case\u2019s interest, it is of no importance whether the domicil be considered to be that of the testator or of her husband, as the laws concerning the property of married women are substantially the same in the State of Rhode Island and in the District of Columbia, where her domicil, and that of her husband, are described to be in the pleadings. See General Statutes of Rhode Island, 1872, pp. 329, 330, and U. S. Statutes at Large, vol. 16, p. 45, Act of April 10,1869, regulating the rights of property of married women in the District of Columbia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>Second. </em>It is not clear wbat trusts the testator intended should be declared in any future settlement, nor how they should be declared. We have already shown how imperfect, as well as useless, are the directions for the trusts in the lifetime of the married women. These directions are more vague and indefinite, as to what should be declared as the purposes of the trusts after their decease. In their lifetime the proposed trust relates to the income alone. The body of the estate is only spoken of with regard to the disposition of it after their decease. Here, as in other parts of the will, it is manifest that tbe testator did not take into consideration the possible contingencies, with regard to survivor-ship, among the members of his brother\u2019s family, and made his suggestions in regard to one state of events, which was, indeed, probable, but by no means certain. Thus, he does not take into consideration the contingency of the husband\u2019s surviving the wife, or of his brother\u2019s surviving any of his children. The latter is more remarkable, inasmuch as one of the brother\u2019s children deceased in the testator\u2019s lifetime. He seems, also, to have been ignorant of tbe effect of the statute law upon the interests given to his brother\u2019s children in either contingency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-5\">The phrases used in the latter part of the twelfth section of the will being thus vague, indefinite, and imperfect, are not a sufficient declaration of an executory trust, either in the character of the trust to be declared, the estate which is to be the subject of it, or the persons to be benefited by it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-6\">Thus far, we have considered the twelfth section as if the only operative words of devise were those with which it commences, and as if each and all of the succeeding clauses drew their vitality from these opening words. But the testator has added to the clauses which we have already been considering upon the view just stated the words, \u201c <em>and I do hereby devise and bequeath the same accordingly.'\u2019'\u2019 </em>There has been suggested a theory for the reading of this section, by which the initial phrase of devise to Daniel Rogers in trust shall be considered as having spent its force in the first half, ending at the words, \u201c <em>when this bequest takes effect; </em>\u201d and that by the use of this closing phrase containing also operative words of devise, the testator may have intended, in the language of some of the cases, \u201c to become his own conveyancer,\u201d and by causing these words to cover the clauses which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>speak of future trusts, to actually create and declare the trust he had in his mind, in the language which he had already used, as a guide for those who might be called upon to settle the terms of the trust after his decease. These words are added for some purpose, and being operative words of devise, it is necessary to consider their effect upon the preceding language. It must be conceded that the repetition of operative words of devise, after a devise to a trustee, and a direction to him to divide the trust estate at a future time, may have the effect of turning into a present devise or vested interest that which might otherwise have been future and contingent.

These are mere precatory phrases, which the daughters of Daniel Rogers can give effect to if they choose, by will, in the happening of the particular contingencies indicated, but which neither thejr nor the court are obliged to adopt and carry into effect under all the contingencies that may happen to the family or the estate. The absolute gifts to the eight children of Daniel Rogers are not cut down to lesser estates by the clauses which follow the language of devise and bequest. As language of present devise, creating executed trusts, nothing is added to the trusts declared in the first half of the section.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-6\">The defect in the provision for any other trust than that actually created by the will, that is, the trusteeship of Daniel Rogers, is shown by what has actually happened in the case of Mrs. Williams. When the will was executed in 1862, Mrs. Williams was unmarried and childless, and the word \u201c childreq,\u201d used in connection with any gift to her, must be construed as a word of limitation. <em>Wild\u2019s ease, </em>6 Rep. 17. Subsequent to the execution of the will she married the defendant, Jonas Williams, and died in less than two months after the testator, leaving an only child, the complainant, Maria B. R. Williams, a little girl now under ten years of age. The will says nothing about \u201c trusteeing \u201d the property of the children of either of the daughters, but limits what is said about a future trust to the shares which would fall to the daughters themselves on the final division by the trustee. Mrs. Williams\u2019s interest in the real estate would, of course, descend to her daughter. Her interest in the personal estate as a vested interest would be disposed of by the laws of New York (of which state her husband was a citizen), regulating the disposition of the personal property of married women. If any power is given to the original trustee to create a new trust, its exercise is contemplated only in the lifetime of a married niece, and it expires with her life. It is not to be exercised in the lifetime of Mrs. Rogers, the widow, and not till the final division of the residue of the testator\u2019s estate. In this interval, while the power, if any be given, remains dormant, the descent is cast, and all occasion for the exercise of such a power ceases. <em>Lancashire </em>v. <em>Lancashire, 2 </em>Phillips, 657.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Lord Romilly, M.

Jun. 561, shows that a testator may give to his executors an arbitrary power of determining to whom a fund may go, and that if he does so, this arbitrary discretion can be exercised only by the persons to whom it is given; even the court cannot exercise it. The testator may also say that the discretion shall be exercised at a particular time ,\u2022 and I think he does so here by fixing the time when the fund becomes divisible. Again, you must consider who are the objects of the discretion ; they must be persons in existence at the time when the discretion is exercised ,\u2022 the discretion cannot be exercised for the benefit of a dead person.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-5\">Many of the decisions, both in England and in this country, consider a trust as executory if anything, even a formal conveyance, remains to be done by the trustee; but this doctrine has been effectually extinguished in the cases just mentioned. Lord St. Leonards, in his opinion in <em>Bgerton </em>v. <em>Bari Brownlow, </em>4 H. L. 1, 204, has cleared up the English law upon this subject, and given us also most sensible rules of construction^ as applied to the contingencies which a will is framed to provide for. He says (p. 217) : \u201c You are not to look at the case as it stands at the moment you are deciding it, and pick out that particular case, and say, because this event has happened, such a construction is to be put upon it. The true mode of construing men\u2019s wills is this: Take the whole instrument, and ask what were the probable cases that might arise at the time the will was made, what were the probable events which were contemplated by the testator and provided for.\u201d And, with regard to trusts, he says (p. 210) :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-7\">\u201c All trusts are, in a sense, executory, because a trust cannot be executed except by conveyance, and therefore there is something always to be done. But that is not the sense which a court of equity puts upon the term \u2018 executory trust.\u2019 A court of equity'considers an executory trust as distinguished from a trust executing itself, and distinguishes the two in this manner: Has the testator been what is called, and very properly called, his own conveyancer ? Has he left it to the court to make out, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>from general expressions, what his intention is ? or has he so defined that intention that yon have nothing to do but to take the limitations he has given to you and to convert them into legal estates ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-5\">We have followed the opinion of this court in the case of <em>Tillinghast </em>v. Qoggeshall, 7 R. I. 393, which is sustained by the decision of the House of Lords, in <em>Bgerton </em>v. <em>Bari Brownlow, </em>4 H.

S. 211.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-6\">5. The devise to the eight children of Daniel Rogers is a devise to the children of Daniel Rogers as a class, and only those take who survive the testator. Each of the seven surviving children takes one seventh of the residuary estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-7\">Hitherto the construction of the will has been considered as if all the children of Daniel Rogers had survived Robert Rogers, the testator. The will provides for a division of the residuum among the eight children of Daniel Rogers. At the death of the testator there were but seven children of Daniel Rogers living, one, James S. Rogers, having died after the execution of the will, childless, unmarried, and intestate. When the will was executed, the testator included James among the objects of his bounty, for he used the words \u201c eight children now living.\u201d He also contemplated the possibility of the decease of one or more of these children before his bequest \u2018should take effect, for he bestows the share of each child upon that child's legal heirs in case of the decease of any child in the interim referred to. It is to be observed that the phrase \u201c through their father\u2019s blood \u201d is not connected with the phrase <em>'\u25a0'\u2022per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita </em>\u201d added to the phrase \u201c legal heirs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-8\">The question arises who is entitled to the share that was intended for James ? Did he ever have any heritable interest in the testator\u2019s property by virtue of this will, so that the persons who would be his \u201clegal heirs\u201d can be ascertained; and also so that the time when they are to be ascertained is definite, and would those persons take, if they take at all, by virtue of being his legal heirs, or as immediate devisees, or in other words, as purchasers ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-9\">That is, do the words \u201clegal heirs \u201d mean the person or persons who, at the decease of the testator, shall answer the descrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>tion of the legal heirs of the deceased child, and can such person or persons take under the phrase as \u201c <em>desoriptio personarum ? </em>\u201d Or, has the gift to him lapsed, and if so, is it disposed of by the will ? Or, has the testator bequeathed his property to the children of his brother as a class, and do those who are within that class take directly from the will to the exclusion of all others ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-5\">The correct view seems to us to be that the devise is to the brother\u2019s children as a class, and that those who answer the description of that class at the time when, in the language of the will, \u201c the bequest takes effect,\u201d are entitled to the whole of the residuary estate as immediate devisees and legatees. The direction to the trustee to postpone the division till the death of the widow is, as we have seen (Point 1), merely a suspension of the enjoyment of the testator\u2019s bounty, not a suspension of the vesting of the estate bestowed. No estate for life or years is carved out of the residuary property; the trust merely stands as security for a life interest charged upon the specific property of the testator, more than ample to respond to the charge. The time when \u201c the bequest takes effect \u201d is therefore the date of the death of the testator, and the persons then living, answering the description of children of Daniel Rogers, are the devisees or legatees of the residuary estate of Robert Rogers under his will. It is not necessary to consider whether the word \u201c children,\u201d as here first used in this twelfth section, would or would not include grandchildren, as seven out of the eight children were then in full life. The word \u201c eight \u201d in this view means no more than the word \u201c all,\u201d as there were no more than eight children in all. Nor is it necessary to consider whether the use of the word \u201c eight \u201d would have excluded children born after the date of the execution of the will, as there have been no such children, and when the will was executed there was no probability of there being any such children. It is not necessary to consider whether, if James had left children living at the death of the testator, they would at the common law have taken his share <em>by substitution, </em>as no such case has arisen. It is clear that no other persons could take by substitution as his heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-6\">The English cases in which the heirs of a deceased devisee have been held to take, by way of substitution, are cases in which the \u201c heirs \u201d were the lineal descendants of a devisee who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>died after the testator. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>G-irdlestone, </em>2 Sim. 295; <em>Price </em>v. <em>Lockley, </em>9 Beav. 180 ; <em>Deeming </em>v. <em>Sherratt, </em>2 Hare, 28; <em>Git-tings </em>v.

The principle on which they rest is, that other parties are in express words <em>directed to be substituted, </em>as in <em>Deeming </em>v. <em>Sherratt, </em>and the substitution must be confined to those so directed to be substituted; for, and this is most important, by the language of the will, according to the settled rules of construction, <em>no estate vested in the ancestor.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-6\">It is clear that the testator did nob intend that the words \u201c legal heirs \u201d should be construed as \u201c <em>deseriptio </em>personarum,\u201d so that the persons answering the description of the legal heirs of James at the death of the testator should take the share of the residuary estate. For he goes on to limit the effect of the phrase \u201c legal heirs \u201d by the use of the words <em>'\u25a0'\u2022per stirpes, </em>and not <em>per </em>capitaIt is clear that by the use of this phrase he limits the persons who are to take, to the children either of a child that may die before the time of distribution, or to the other children of Daniel Rogers who may be living at the time of distribution, or to the children of deceased children of Daniel Rogers, whether their demise occurs before or after that of the testator. This phrase is not applicable to the father, Daniel Rogers, as heir, and yet he was the legal heir of his son James at the time of the decease of the testator. Besides, the direction to the trustee, Daniel Rogers, is to <em>divide </em>the estate among his children or their legal heirs <em>per stirpes, </em>&amp;c., and the use of this language directing a division among others excludes the idea that the testator, ever intended that Daniel Rogers was ever to take any part of this residuary estate by inheritance or otherwise.

But the ground of this decision was that the final devise, although residuary in form, was actually a specific devise of an aliquot share to each of four persons, and consequently neither could take more by the will than this aliquot share, and the lapsed share was consequently excluded from the division. The following oases were similarly decided, and for the same reason: <em>Craighead </em>v. <em>Given, </em>10 S. &amp; R. 351; <em>Bagwell </em>v. <em>Dry, </em>1 P.

Tlie devise of the residue carries the income of the residue. It is to be observed that, in the direct devise to the trustee for the benefit of his children, there is no mention made of the income of the estate in his hands before the period of final distribution of the residuum. But the devise of a residue carries the income, the immediate produce of such residue. 2 Jarman on Wills, 85. The distribution of this income is not postponed, and, therefore, becomes immediately divisible to the parties entitled, the children of the trustee living at the decease of the testator. 2 Redfield on Wills, 107; <em>KopJcins </em>v. <em>KopJcins, </em>Oas.

In the next clause, however, there is a direct bequest of the income, through a trust which we have shown to be superfluous.

By the laws of Rhode Island, her husband would have been entitled to administration upon the whole of the personalty, including the income, without account. But by the laws of New York, of which state he was a resident and a citizen, he is entitled to administer, but to retain no more of his wife\u2019s personal estate, after the payment of her debts, she leaving descendants, than she would have been entitled to claim and receive of her husband\u2019s personal estate, he dying intestate, under like circumstances. This would give him one third of her personal estate, while the remainder would be inherited by her daughter, the complainant, Maria B. R. Williams.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number><em>1. </em>Ns <em>to the share of Mrs. Gase. </em>As this is a suit for the recovery of property accruing to a wife by devise, after marriage, to which the husband is a necessary party, either as complainant or defendant, it clearly falls within the class of cases in which the Court of Equity, whose aid is invoked, may interpose and decree a settlement of the property, for the benefit of the wife and her children, under that .special head of equity jurisprudence which protects \u201cthe wife\u2019s equity.\u201d But this also is a creature of a Court of Equity, and was called into existence to secure to the wife the protection which she could not receive at the common law. It always was a purely personal right of the wife, which she could claim or waive at her pleasure. 2 Story Eq. Jur. \u00a7\u00a7 1408-20. But the statute law has now given her greater protection for her property than was ever granted to her by the decrees of an Equity Court. There is no necessity in this case for the exercise of this special power of the court, unless it is personally invoked by the wife. She has, by her next friend, prayed that her share of the property might be conveyed directly to her, and she has not authorized any counsel to represent her individually, and to request the court to decree a settlement, in trust, for her benefit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-5\">In some cases of special delicacy the court has directed interrogatories to be framed to the wife, to ascertain her personal wishes with regard to a settlement, and for greater caution, that course might be taken in this cause. But it is obvious that no greater security could be derived from a settlement in trust than that which is now afforded by the statute law, so far as the rights of the wife are concerned. The children of the marriage might be better provided for in such a settlement, in the case of the husband\u2019s surviving the wife. But the children are not before the court, and cannot be brought here during the lifetime of their mother, and their right to such protection depends entirely upon her, and can be granted only at her request, and through her.

This is the usual case of a gift to children generally, without more, or to a specified number, different from the true number, which, as we have seen, has, <em>ex necessitate, </em>to prevent a failure of the gift from uncertainty, received the same construction. The testator has in mind all the children as a class, not the individuals who compose it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-7\">This distinction, it is believed, will be found to run through all the cases, and to reconcile many which, on a cursory examination, are apparently conflicting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-8\">The case apparently at first reading most in conflict with this view is that of <em>Leigh </em>v. <em>Leigh, </em>17 Beav. 605, where, under a bequest to A. B. for life, and after his death \u201cto <em>all the present horn children </em>of A. B. equally,\u201d it was held that the gift was to a class, and that therefore the share of one of the children who died in the testator\u2019s lifetime did not lapse. But there, it is to be observed, the number of the children was not named, nor any language used pointing to the individuals, \u2014 for example, distinguishing between the sons and the daughters, \u2014 but simply a reference to <em>dll </em>the present born children generally. Clearly, therefore, the case is not at all analogous to the case at bar, even if it be not so far in conflict with many other cases as to render its authority very doubtful.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-9\">And this principle it is submitted is decisive of the case at bar. The language of the twelfth clause is very precise. There is no indication here that the testator had in mind a class liable to fluctuation; directly' the contrary, for he directs the trustee, at the death of his wife, \u201c <em>to divide </em>all the remainder of the property <em>equally between his eight children now living.\" </em>More spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>cific language of severance could scarcely have been used ; for he not only identifies them as the eight now living, but directs that the property be equally divided between them, \u2014 language of itself indicating a severance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-5\">\u201c Equally to be divided goes to the quality of the estate and not to its limitations. <em>The words create a tenancy in common.\u201d Jackson </em>v. <em>Laquere, </em>5 Cow. 221.

As said by Lord Langdale, in <em>Dick </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>8 Beav. 214, per <em>stirpes </em>\u201c <em>means distribution of some sort or other f </em>and \u201c <em>not only imports distribution but also imports succession, or some sort of succession.\u201d </em>It is plain, in this case, that Daniel Rogers cannot, in any sense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>trace through his children, <em>\u201cper </em>stirpes,\u201d much less answer the description of heir of his children <em>through </em>his own blood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-5\">Other parts of the will indicate that by \u201c <em>legal heirs </em>\u201d the testator meant children. Thus, in the fourth clause, the surplus income is to be divided by the executors (Daniel Rogers himself being one) \u201c equally among the children of my brother, Daniel Rogers, or <em>their legal </em>heirs-at-law, until the decease of the said Charlotte D\u2019Wolf, and that after that event, the said stocks be equally divided among the children of my brother, Daniel Rogers, <em>or their legal heirs-at-law, or held in trust by my said brother, </em>with power of naming substitutes at his option, and I do bequeath the same accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-6\">And in the seventh clause, \u201c But in case said Robert Rogers Howard dies without lawful issue, then all said stocks are to be divided equally among the children of my brother, Daniel Rogers, <em>now living, and their legal heirs through their father\u2019s blood, per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita, </em>and I do give and bequeath the same accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-7\">That the word \u201c heirs \u201d may be so construed when the context or evident intention requires it: See <em>Bond\u2019s Appeal, </em>31 Conn. 183 <em>; Bowers </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>4 Pick. 198 ; <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>22 Me. 257 ; <em>King </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>15 Ohio, 559; <em>Braden </em>v. <em>Qannon, </em>1 Grant\u2019s Cases, 60 ; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Essex Bridge, </em>2 Pick. 243 ; <em>Heard </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>1 Denio, 165 ; <em>Vcmnorsdale </em>v. <em>Van Deventer, </em>51 Barb.

And, if these are held to be substituted gifts, this brings us to the question, whether the proper construction of this twelfth clause, as also of the fourth clause, does not require that the vesting of the gifts in remainder be postponed till the death of Mrs. Rogers; or rather, which for the purposes of this bill comes to the same thing, that, if technically vested, they are so only contingently, subject to be divested in favor of the children as purchasers, in case of intermediate decease, and therefore cannot be now distributed. <em>Hervey </em>v. <em>McLoughlin, </em>1 Price, 264; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Crirdlestone, </em>2 Sim. 225 ; <em>Salisbury </em>v. <em>Petty, </em>3 Hare, 86; <em>Price </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>y. <em>Lockley, </em>6 Beav. 180 ; <em>Burrell </em>v. <em>Baskerfield, </em>11 Beav. 525 ; <em>Edwards </em>y. <em>Edwards, </em>15 Beav. 364; <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>16 Beav. 557 ; re <em>Philps Will, </em>L.

Naii, 37 Me. 363.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-5\">Unless, indeed, in the mean time the event happens which fixes the final vesting of the gift beyond further question, as would seem to be the case here as to the share of Mrs. Williams; for it seems settled that the substituted legatees are to be ascertained at the decease of the primary legatee, where such decease occurs after that of the testator, and before the period of distribution. <em>In re Philps Will, </em>L. R. 7 Eq. 151; <em>Hobgen </em>v. <em>Neale, </em>L. R. 11 Eq. 48.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-6\">If it be said, that to hold the gifts to vest at the death of Mrs. Rogers would cause the lapse of the share of any one of the nephews or nieces who may die in Mrs. Rogers\u2019s lifetime without issue, it may well be conceived that, if the testator contemplated the contingency at all, he would have preferred and intended this result rather than the other \u2014 that he would much more likely prefer that his widow or his brother should share in his property than that an entire stranger both in blood and in fact, like an unknown and future husband or wife of either of his nieces or nephews, should do so to the exclusion even of their children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-7\">And cases of a direct gift in remainder <em>without any substituted </em>gift\u2014 of which <em>Poor </em>v. <em>Qonsidine, </em>6 Wall. 458, is one of the most recent and striking examples \u2014 throw no light whatever upon this question. Had there been in that case a substituted gift in case of the decease of Mary Jane Barr, pending the life estates of her father or mother, can it be doubted that a different construction must have prevailed ? Such was also the case of <em>Staples </em>v. <em>N Wolf, </em>8 R. I. 74. The court there found, in view of other portions of the will relating to the same bequests, that the testator by the particular clause in question could not have intended to create a substituted legacy, pp. 122, 123. And in this connection it is not to be overlooked that the only gift here in remainder is in the <em>direction to divide, </em>which of itself fixes the vesting at the time of distribution. For it is submitted that to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>connect the concluding words of gift in this clause with this distribution is to force them out of their natural, as well as out of their actual connection, where they are evidently used to give effect to the power of appointment of new trustees of the daughters\u2019 shares conferred upon Daniel Rogers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-5\">IV. But one other question remains to be considered,\u2014 James\u2019s one eighth of the estate at least, if not the other sons\u2019 five eighths, having lapsed and become intestate, to whom is it to be distributed ? For whether or not the other shares can be now divided out and the trusts respecting them now determined, it is evident that no such question arises as to these shares if regarded as intestate. The bill as to them, all parties interested being before the court, becomes an ordinary administration bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-6\">To whom then do these shares pass ? Aside from the provision in the fourth clause of the will made for the widow, \u201c in lieu of all claims of dower on any part of my estate,\u201d the answer is simple : the real estate to the testator\u2019s brother, Daniel Rogers, as sole heir-at-law \u2014 subject to the widow\u2019s dower; and the personal estate equally to the brother and to the widow, one half to each \u2014 as next of kin and distributees under the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-7\">Nor does the provision in the will <em>in lieu of dower </em>at all change this. True, Jarman, Vol. I. p. *407, and Redfield, Vol. II. pp. 747, 748, both state that in such case the widow cannot claim dower in the intestate real estate, as the provision is, they say, for the benefit of the estate. But neither cites a case adjudicating the question. Redfield cites Jarman, and Jarman only cites <em>Pieicering </em>v. <em>Lord </em>Stamford, 3 Ves. Jun. 332, in which the Master of the Rolls (Lord Alvanley) merely expresses himself doubtfully upon this point. But it is submitted that the testator in disposing, as he supposes, of his whole estate, makes the provision in favor not of the estate as such, but of the other devisees under his will. And it is these only he has in his mind, and it is against these only that the widow is put to her election. The very doctrine of lapse rests upon the entire absence of intention on the part of the testator as to the lapsed portions of his estate. To say, therefore, that the provisions in the will in lieu of dower apply to these portions, when no other portions of the will do, is to force language to infer an intent where none is expressed ; in effect to make a partial will upon a matter where otherwise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>and as to the <em>corpus </em>of such portions of the estate itself, the testator confessedly is entirely silent. Had the testator made ample provision for his widow, but not expressed to be in lieu of dower, it would not as a general principle be intended that he meant to exclude her dower or put her to her election, but she would, even as against the devisee, take her dower in addition. Shall it, on the other hand, be intended that he meant to exclude her dower <em>in favor of the heir </em>in a part of his estate, which, in the contingency that has happened, he has left entirely undisposed of? To do so would be to reverse the usual rule and to discriminate against the widow in favor of the heir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-5\">But however this may be as to the real estate, it is entirely settled that it is not so as to the personal. The widow is entitled to her half of this absolutely, and would be, even had the provision in the will been expressed to be \u201c in lieu of dower and thirds.\u201d <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Lord </em>Stamford, 3 Ves.

In the first place and before any other claims on this fund are satisfied to pay any deficiency each and every year it occurs on the three thousand dollars per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>year given to my wife Maria Rogers under the fourth bequest of this will. In the second place to divide all the remainder of the property hereby devised and bequeathed after the decease of my wife Maria Rogers and before his own decease (if he so chooses to do) equally between his eight children now living or their legal heirs <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita </em>if any of them be dead when this bequest takes effect and to trustee all or any part of the property so divided among his eight children or their heirs-at-law through his blood by placing it safely in the hands of two or more honest and competent persons to hold and pay the income thereof to his eight children or their heirs-at-law through his blood <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita </em>as it is received and that part of it which may belong to his daughters married or single to be so trusteed as that the income thereof shall be paid to them or either of them on their own receipt and after the same shall have accrued and without the intervention of any creditor or husband and all the property so trusteed on the said daughters\u2019 decease to descend to their own children or in default thereof to their heirs-at-law through their father\u2019s blood <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita </em>and I do hereby devise and bequeath the same accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Robert Rogers died in 1870. His widow is seventy-eight years old. Her income under the fourth clause has not been less than $6,000 per annum, and is not likely ever to fall short of $3,000 per annum. She is offered ample security against loss in case it should happen to fall short of that amount. She has no wish to have the trusts of the twelfth clause kept alive for her benefit. It therefore seems unnecessary to await her decease before dividing the property bequeathed by that clause if it can be previously divided without prejudice or the possibility of prejudice to the right of any other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Very clearly the division cannot be now made with a certainty that no other person will be prejudiced by it, unless the estates and interests created by the twelfth clause are vested; for if they are contingent, it cannot be known with certainty, until the happening of the contingency, who are the persons who will be entitled to share in the division. Are they vested ? It is argued that they are, and that the provision of the twelfth clause, which postpones the time of division, does not postpone the vesting until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>divisi\u00f3n, but simply postpones until then the full enjoyment of the property. We will consider first whether this is the correct construction of the twelfth clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The cardinal rule, in this as in other points of construction, is that the intention of the testator must govern if it can be ascertained. But the law favors vesting, and, if the intention be doubtful, a legacy will, if possible, be held to be vested rather than contingent. Mr. Redfield, in his Treatise on the Law of Wills (vol. 2, p. 627), says the more recent English cases establish the proposition \u201c that no estate will be held contingent unless very decisive terms of contingency are used in the will, or it is necessary to hold the same contingent to carry out the other provisions and implications of the will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The questions then are, Did the testator intend, or has he used language clearly denoting contingency? or, Does the will contain any provision or implication which requires that the estates shall be contingent ? If not, then the estates are to be construed as vested.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The leading purpose of the twelfth clause is to provide for a division of the residue of the testator\u2019s estate among the children of his brother Daniel, or, in case of the decease of any of them before the taking effect of the bequest, among the children then living, and the heirs-at-law, so called, through the brother\u2019s blood, of the children then deceased. The testator seeks to effect this purpose through the medium of a trust, which is also first to serve another purpose, namely, the guaranteeing to his wife an income of not less than $3,000 per annum. And apparently in view of this contingent trust in favor of his wife, the division is deferred until the decease of his wife. But beyond this he appears to have wished that his brother Daniel should have a certain control over the property, for the purpose of securing it the more exclusively to his children and their descendants. He therefore gives him a twofold discretion: first, to postpone the division during his own life; and, second, to trustee all or any part of the property when divided, so trusteeing the shares of the daughters as to protect it from husbands and creditors and secure its descent, after the decease of the daughters, to their own children or heirs-at-law through the father\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">There are three features of the twelfth clause which deserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>special consideration: first, the delay in the division; second, the fact that the persons who are to share in the division are to be determined by reference to the time \u201c when the bequest takes effect; \u201d and third, the powers which are conferred upon Daniel Rogers, in making the division, to trustee the property divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">1. Is the fact that the division was not designed by the testator to be made until after the death of his wife, a fact from which we ought to infer that the devise or bequest was intended to be contingent until her death ? The bequest is a bequest of the residue to Daniel Rogers in trust, to divide it among his children, <em>&amp;o., </em>after the decease of the widow and before his own decease if he chooses. If it had been a bequest to him in trust for his children, &amp;c., to be divided among them after the decease of the widow, there is no doubt upon the authorities that it would be construed as conferring vested interests, in the absence of other language importing a different intent. The bequest, where such language is used, is present and absolute; the division only is suspended until a future time. Is the language which has been used to be construed in the same way ? It has been held that, where the bequest is made in the form of a direction to pay or divide at a future time, the vesting will be postponed till then, for the reason that, inasmuch as the bequest consists in the direction to pay at a future time, it is in effect a bequest <em>at </em>that time, not an immediate bequest. The case at bar appears, at first blush, to fall within this rule. But this rule was designed to be used simply as a key to the intention, and will not be applied to contravene the intention of the testator, when it is otherwise disclosed. Thus the rule is not applied where the direction to pay at a future time is coupled with a direction to pay interest in the mean time. The testator, by allowing the legatee to have the interest, is supposed to recognize him as the owner of the principal. In <em>Leeming </em>v. <em>Sherratt, </em>2 Hare, 14, the rule is considered by Vice-Chancellor Wigram, and the limited effect which it is entitled to have, as a rule of construction, is luminously explained. If the future time is fixed not for the purpose of making the legacy dependent on its arrival, but simply to defer the day of payment, then the legacy vests immediately, to be paid or delivered when the time arrives. And in order to ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>tain in what view the future time is appointed, we are not to confine our attention to any single point, or any isolated expression, but to seek the intention of the testator from the four corners of his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">In <em>In re </em>Bartholomew, 1 Mac. <em>&amp; </em>G. 354, the bequest was in the form of a direction to pay \u00a32,000 to the children of the testator\u2019s daughter after her decease, as and when they should severally attain the age of twenty-one years, and closed with the words \u201cto whom I give and bequeath the same accordingly.\u201d Lord Cottenham and Sir Lancelot Shadwell held that the legacies were vested, upon the ground that there was a gift to the legatees, independently of the direction to pay, in the words, \u201c to whom I give and bequeath the same accordingly.\u201d In <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>L. R. 4 Eq. 372, 380, however, Malins. V. C., while he confesses that he should feel bound by this decision, says he cannot see the distinction which Lord Cottenham drew from the words \u201c to whom,\u201d &amp;c., and that to him the words appear to be a mere redundancy. In the case at bar the twelfth clause closes with the words, \u201c and I do hereby devise and bequeath'the same accordingly.\u201d The words have been pressed on our attention, and doubtless are not to be overlooked in view of the opinion of Lord Cottenham, though we do not clearty perceive that they do more than express what would be implied without them.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The bequest under consideration is residuary, and, in some cases of doubt, the fact that the bequest was residuary has been deemed a reason for construing it to be vested. <em>Staples Pearce </em>v. N\u2019 <em>Wolf, </em>8 R. I. 74, 120 ; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Mackilwain, </em>1 Russ. 220 ; <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>4 Ves. Jun. 400 ; <em>Leake </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>2 Mer. 363, 386 ; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Busk, </em>14 Beav. 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">So when the delay is for the sake of some object independent of the legacy, it is not considered incompatible with the vesting of the legacy. In <em>Packham </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>4 Hare, 396, where the bequest was in the form of a direction to pay and divide within six months after the death of the person beneficially entitled for life, the interests were held to have vested. \u201c The time,\u201d it was said, \u201c was allowed for the discretion of the trustees and the convenience of the estate, and for those purposes only.\u201d And in that case, Wigram, Y. C., remarks, that if, upon the whole will, it appears that the future gift is only postponed to let in some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>other interest or for the benefit of the estate, the delay does not suspend the vesting, but only postpones the enjoyment. In the case at bar the division is delayed apparently for the security of the widow, and not with a view to make the gift conditional upon the arrival of the time for the division. It is true the division may be delayed, in the discretion of the trustee, even after the death of the widow; but evidently the testator intended by this no more than by the provision for a new trust, namely, not contingency, but the more effectual promotion of the purposes of the bequest. And see <em>Poor </em>v. Considine, 6 Wall. 458 ; <em>Eldridge </em>v. Eldridge, 9 Cush. 516. When it is in doubt, says Chief Justice Shaw, in the case last cited, whether' the words of contingency or condition apply to the gift itself, or to the time of payment, courts are inclined to construe them rather as applying to the time of payment, and to hold the gift rather as vested than contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The first purpose to be served by the trust created by the twelfth clause is thus expressed : \u201cIn the first place, and <em>before any other claims on this fund are </em>satisfied, to pay any deficiency <em>each </em>and <em>every year </em>it occurs on the three thousand dollars per year given to my wife, Maria Rogers, under the fourth bequest of this will.\u201d The language imports that the testator supposed that the trust fund would be subject <em>each and every year </em>to claims other than the contingent claim of his wife, and that he for that reason gives her claim a priority. But no other person has any claim upon the trust fund during the life of the wife, unless by implication or inference from this and other expressions in the will,the other beneficiaries of the trust are to have the income of the fund; and if they are to have the income, the fact that they are to have it favors, if it does not necessitate, the construction that they take vested interests in the fund previous to the division.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Again, in the provision for dividing and trusteeing the residue, the testator uses the expression, \u201c that part of it which may belong to his daughters,\u201d as if he recognized an ownership in them. The indication, however, is slight and equivocal, for he is speaking with reference to the time of division, when they would become owners, if they were not such already.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">If we look beyond the twelfth clause to other parts of the will, we find nothing to favor the supposition that the testator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>intended to exclude the persons designated to take under the twelfth clause from any benefit from the bounty there bestowed until such time after the death of his wife as the trustee might choose to divide it, or to make their right of property in it dependent upon their surviving that time. On the contrary, it does appear, that after his wife, they were the principal objects of his testamentary beneficence, and, they being of age and some of them quite advanced in years, he had no reason except the security of his wife for delaying the time when they should reap the benefit of it. The thirteenth clause gives to executors and trustees power to sell and reinvest the property, but not without \u201c the assent of the party enjoying the income thereof.\u201d This language should be considered in connection with the opening direction of the twelfth clause to which we have just referred. The will contains no traces of a wish to aggrandize a property which was already ample, by mere accumulation, until the division ; and the inference is easily drawn that the testator supposed that the income, instead of accumulating, would be enjoyed by the objects of his bounty. Indeed, he probably had the idea that a trust ordinarily means an arrangement by which the trustee safely keeps the <em>corpus </em>of the property, while the beneficiaries enjoy its income.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The conclusion to which we are led by the authorities to which we have referred, and by our own reasoning upon the will, is, that the fact that the division of the property devised and bequeathed by the twelfth clause is delayed until after the death of the widow, is not a fact from which we are to infer that the devise or bequest was intended to be contingent until her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">2. The twelfth clause directs that the division, when made, shall be made among the children of the trustee or their legal heirs, &amp;c., \u201cif any of them be dead when this bequest takes effect.\u201d An important question to determine is, what time is signified by the words \u201c when this bequest takes effect.\u201d Does it mean when the widow dies, and when the division shall be made ? If so, until then the persons designated cannot be known and their interests cannot vest, or not indefeasibly at least. The obvious answer to the question is, that the bequest takes effect' when the will takes effect. But is this what the testator meant ? We are not entirely sure; but we find nothing\u2019 in the words or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>their context to convince us that he did not mean this; and we must therefore take the obvious meaning of the words as the meaning in which the testator employed them. This view relieves the bequest of any uncertainty in regard to the persons who are to have the benefit of it, in so far as any uncertainty arises from the words under review, and, inasmuch as the persons can be ascertained at the death of the testator, is entirely consistent with their taking vested interests. Indeed it favors that construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">3. Another feature of the twelfth clause which we have reserved for special consideration is the power which is given to the trustee, in making the division, to trustee all or any part of the property when divided. In view of this power can we construe the beneficial interests as vested ?</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We have spoken of the power as a discretion, and in so far as it relates to the shares of the sons it is clearly a discretion. The words first used are, \u201cto trustee <em>all or any part </em>of the property so divided among his eight children or their heirs-at-law,\u201d &amp;c. A trust to trustee all or any part of tbe property is purely discretionary, for, as is urged by counsel, a power to trustee any part may be satisfied by its exercise upon an infinitesimal part, and, consequently, by not being exercised at all. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Bur</em>ges, 10 R. I. 422. But the words first used are followed by words relating to the shares of the daughters, which have the appearance of being more mandatory in their signification. We refer to the words, \u201c and that part of it which may belong to the daughters, married or single, <em>to be so trusteed </em>as that the income thereof shall be paid to them or either of them, on their own receipt,\u201d &amp;c. Are these words to be construed as an imperative direction, restrictive of the broad discretion to trustee all or any part of the property previously conferred in the same sentence, which makes it the trustee\u2019s duty in making the division to trustee the shares of the daughters, or are they rather to be construed as words which simply point out the manner in which the trustee, in case he thinks proper to trustee the shares of the daughters, shall exercise that discretion. We prefer the latter construction as more consistent, on the whole, both with the structure of the sentence and with the direct and clear language in which the power is conferred. It may also be noted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>words are, u to be so trusteed as that the income thereof shall be paid to them <em>or either of them,\u201d </em>as if it were in the mind of the testator that the trustee would be at liberty to trustee the share of one of the daughters and not that of the other, in the exercise of his discretion. The giving of so large a discretion need occasion no surprise when it is remembered that the donee is the father of the beneficiaries, and consequently can have no motive to use it otherwise than for their good. An option to divide or hold in trust is clearty given him in the fourth clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Is the vesting of the beneficial interests given by the twelfth clause compatible with the existence of such a power or discretion on the part of the trustee? We think it is. The rights of the beneficiaries are designed to exist independently of the exercise of the discretion, subject only to modification in the event of its exercise. The power or discretion is in the nature of a condition subsequent. It does not prevent the beneficial estates from vesting; it only subjects them to a liability to be divested to a certain extent in case it is exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The result, then, to which we are led, or rather to which we have painfully groped our way, is, that the beneficial interests given by the twelfth clause vested immediately upon the death of the testator in the children of his brother Daniel then living, and in the heirs-at-law, so called, through the brother\u2019s blood of the child then deceased. This is a result which may, indeed, in some of its consequences, disappoint the wishes of the testator; but it is the result which best accords with the purpose which certain intimations of the will lead us to think he entertained, that the children of his brother and their heirs-at-law, so called, through the brother\u2019s blood, should have an immediate claim,, subject to the prior contingent claim of his wife upon the residuary estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Then regarding the equitable interests as vested, the question recurs, Is there anything to prevent an immediate division of the property devised ? In considering this question it is to be borne in mind: first, that the testator\u2019s widow, for whose security the division was apparently delayed, consents to an immediate division, the security being superfluous or otherwise provided for; second, that the beneficiaries desire and ask for an immediate division ; and, third, that Daniel Rogers, the trustee, wishes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>make the division without further delay, if it can be made consistently with his duty. In these circumstances, it seems to be entirely unnecessary to prolong the trust, unless the trustee wishes to create the new trusts which he has the discretionary power to create upon making the division after the decease of Mrs. Rogers. But the trustee, through his counsel, states that he does not wish any delay for that purpose, and prefers to relinquish this power rather than delay the division for the sake of exercising it. This we think he may do, the power being personal to himself, or, if possibly it may continue beyond himself, extending at the utmost only to successors of his own appointment, and whom he may appoint or not at his pleasure. We are therefore of the opinion that the trustee may properly divest himself of his trust, and of all the powers which he has as trustee under the will, by making an immediate division of the trust property ; and that we may properly enter a decree directing\u2014 or rather let us say, inasmuch as we might hesitate to direct a division if any party in interest were opposed to it \u2014 a decree giving the sanction of the court to such a division.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">There are some incidental questions to be decided before the property can be divided, upon which the trustee desires the instruction or decision of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">It appears that James S. Rogers, one of the eight children of Daniel Rogers who were living when the will was made, died in the lifetime of the testator, unmarried, childless, and intestate. It is claimed that the share of the residue, which would have gone to him if he had survived has lapsed, and must be disposed of as intestate estate. We do not so construe the will. The devise is to Daniel Rogers in trust, to divide the residue \u201c equally between his eight children now living or their legal heirs, <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per </em>capita, if any of them be dead when this bequest takes effect, and to trustee all or any part of the property so divided among his eight children or their heirs-at-law through his blood.\u201d Manifestly, if we ascribe to the words \u201c when this bequest takes effect,\u201d the meaning which we have ascribed to them, the testator has not overlooked the possibility of the death of one or more of the eight children in his lifetime, and has, in his own belief at least, designated who shall take by substitution for them. And see <em>Finlason </em>v. Tatlock, L. R. 9 Eq. 258. The persons to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>by substitution are the heirs-at-law of the deceased through the blood of Daniel Rogers, and they are to take <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita. </em>But, it is said, the father of James S. Rogers is his sole heir-at-law, and he is excluded from taking because the gift is to the heirs-at-law, through the blood of Daniel Rogers, <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per </em>capita, a description which is not appropriate to Daniel Rogers himself. We agree that the description is inappropriate to Daniel Rogers. The will also, which very cleai'ly manifests a design to avoid intestacy, affords no express indication of intent to benefit Daniel Rogers, who is himself an affluent and aged man. The general structure of the twelfth clause is likewise rather against the existence of such an intent. It appoints Daniel Rogers to hold the property for others and divide it among them, rather than to participate in it himself. We do not, however, agree that the effect of this view is to avoid the substitutional gift. The result, in our opinion, is, that the heir-ship of Daniel Rogers is to be disregarded, and the substitutional gift is to be construed as a gift to those who would be the heirs-at-law of James S. Rogers through the blood of his father, if his father were individually disentitled to heirship. Under this construction the seven children who survived the testator became entitled to the entire residue. It is true, we disregard by this construction the technical meaning of the words \u201c heirs-at-law ; \u201d but in so doing, we do what other courts have done, \u2014 look through the words for the meaning which is behind them. <em>Doody </em>v. <em>Higgens, </em>2 Kay &amp; J. 729 ; <em>In re Porter\u2019s </em>Trust, 4 Kay &amp; J. 188; <em>Gittings </em>v. <em>McDermott, </em>2 M. &amp; K. 69; <em>In re Steevens's Trusts, </em>L. R. 15 Eq. 110. It is also true that under this construction no effect is given to the words, <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita ; </em>but this is not through any fault of the construction, but because the words are inapplicable in the contingency which has happened. If, besides James S. Rogers, a brother or sister had died in the lifetime of the testator, leaving several children, then, under precisely the same construction, the words would have their just effect upon the substitutional gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Four of the beneficiaries, sons of Daniel Rogers, are of full age and competent to transact business. The trustee, of course, will have no difficulty in assigning to them their respective shares and in receiving from them the proper discharges. A fifth beneficiary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>a son of Daniel Rogers, also of full age, is <em>non compos mentis. </em>He lias as yet no guardian of his person and estate. Such a guardian should he immediately appointed to have the care and custody of the share set off to him. A sixth beneficiary, Maria Williams, who survived the testator, is now deceased, leaving a husband and a minor daughter. Her share, having vested in her on the death' of the testator, passed, on her decease, the real estate to her heirs, subject to the curtesy of her husband, and the personal estate to her legal representative, to be administered and distributed according to the law of the state of New York, the state of her domicil. Her personal representative is Jonas Williams. He is a party to the suit, though not described as her representative in the-suit. Her share of the personal property should be transferred to him, unieses he consents to have it transferred directly to the distributees. The seventh beneficiary is Anna R. Case, the wife of Augustus L. Case. She is entitled to have her share of the real estate transferred to her. She is entitled to have her share of the personal property, or a portion of it, settled to her separate use if she so desires. Pier wish should be ascertained. If she wishes no settlement it should be transferred to her directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In making the division, the trustee will, of course, make proper deductions for advances, so that none of the beneficiaries shall by reason thereof have any advantage over the others.</p>\n<p id=\"AqE\">We have now passed upon all the questions arising upon the twelfth clause which we deem it necessary to decide for the instruction of the trustee. Other questions are made upon other provisions of the will, but there is no exigency requiring their immediate decision. When such an exigency does arise, it will be time enough for us to decide them. <em>Decree accordingly.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
