Gen. Stat. R. I. cap. 47, \u00a7 6.\u2019 A school committee may give its order either in favor of\u2019 the trustees or treasurer of a school district, or directly in favor of a teacher. Cap. 53, \u00a7 17. Teachers, where towns are districted, are employed by the trustees of the districts ,* Cap. 52, \u00a7 1; and neither town nor town treasurer is made liable for their wages otherwise than upon the order of the school committee. We think, therefore, that where a town is districted neither town nor town treasurer is liable to garnishment in respect of any teacher\u2019s wages, until at least an order has been given in favor of such teacher by the school committee of the town. This does not appear to have been done in the case at bar. The judgment, agreeably to the agreement, must be for the plaintiff for the full amount of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><em>Judgment for plaintiff for </em>$130.63 <em>and costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
