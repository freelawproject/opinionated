The defendant pleaded to the jurisdiction that the property replevied exceeded fifty dollars in value. This plea was overruled and judgment was given for the plaintiff, whereupon the defendant appealed to the Court of Common Pleas. The Court of Common1 Pleas sustained the ruling of the court below, and submitted the questions of fact raised by the other pleas in the case to a jury, which found them in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. After verdict the case was brought by the defendant to this court on exceptions taken to the rulings of the Court of Common Pleas and allowed by the presiding judge.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b414-13\"><em>South Kingston, September </em>29, 1876.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Aat\">Dttreee, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alt\">The first exception raises the question whether, previous to the time when the General Statutes went into effect, Justice Courts had jurisdiction to issue writs of replevin where the goods and chattels to be replevied were of more than fifty dollars in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">The Revised Statutes, cap. 168, \u00a7 1, confer upon justices of the peace \u201c original and exclusive jurisdiction of all civil actions, legally brought before them, wherein the debt or damages de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>manded do not exceed fifty dollars,\u201d excepting certain actions among which the action of replevin is not mentioned. The Revised Statutes, cap. 208, \u00a7 13, empower justices of the peace to issue writs of replevin where the goods and chattels to be replevied are of fifty dollars or less in value, and to try the same. Chapter 656 of the Public Laws, passed in 186T, authorizes the establishment of Justice Courts, and confers upon such courts, when established, \u201cjurisdiction, to the exclusion of all other justices of the peace in the town, to try and determine all civil actions whatsoever, jurisdiction over which is now, or may be given to justices of the peace.\u201d This provision conferred jurisdiction upon Justice Courts to try and determine actions of replevin when the property replevied was of the value of fifty dollars and less, but conferred no jurisdiction over such actions if the property exceeded that amount. The same chapter (\u00a7 11) confers upon such courts \u201c original jurisdiction of all civil actions, legally brought before them, wherein the debt or damages demanded do not exceed one hundred dollars,\u201d excepting certain actions among which actions of replevin are not included. If the case at bar was, when it was brought, within the jurisdiction of a Justice Court, it was so under this provision. An action of replevin is a civil action, but it is not primarily an action to recover a debt or damages, but to recover specific chattels, and only incidentally to recover damages for their detention. Generally, the damages awarded for their detention are merely nominal, and less than a hundred dollars might be demanded for the detention of chattels worth thousands of dollars. The mere fact, therefore, that damages are demanded,-is not a sufficient reason for holding that jurisdiction of the action was conferred by Public Laws, cap. 656, \u00a7 11, unless we are prepared to go further and hold that a Justice Court under that statute might have had jurisdiction of an action of replevin for the recovery of chattels worth thousands of dollars, if only the damages demanded for their detention were laid at less than a hundred dollars. Manifestly such a construction would not accord with the intention of the General Assembly. The language of the Public Laws, cap. 656, \u00a7 11, is the same as the language of the Revised Statutes, cap. 168, \u00a7 1; yet that jurisdiction of actions of replevin was not designed to be conferred by cap. 168, \u00a7 1, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>inferrible from the fact that it was afterwards expressly conferred in cap. 208, \u00a7 13. We think jurisdiction of the action was not conferred by the Public Laws, cap. 656, \u00a7 11. And this construction is in accordance with the construction given to similar statutes in Massachusetts and Maine. <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Den</em>nis, 7 Met. 590 ; <em>Small </em>v. <em>Swain, </em>1 Me. 133; <em>Ridlon </em>v. <em>Emery, </em>6 Me. 261. The first exception is therefore sustained.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A5p0\"><em>JSf. E.
