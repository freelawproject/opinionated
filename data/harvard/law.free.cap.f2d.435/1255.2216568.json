The district court ordered the prison officials to permit collective religious services conducted by accredited ministers of their faith, \u201cso long as the doctrines espoused by the ministers are identical to those Minister [Jeremiah] Shabazz testified to during the court proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-18\">The court found it was not mandatory that the prison authorities make available Muslim periodicals and books requested by the plaintiffs because these writings \u201ccould be interpreted as an endorsement of a concept that whites generally and prison authorities should be defied by Muslim prisoners even when legal orders or demands are made.\u201d The court explained that \u201csuch a view is not an appropriate interpretation of Black religious Muslim doctrine * * * Since the literature could be subject to inferences urging such defiances if not interpreted by a trained Muslim minister, I rule that it is not mandatory that the prison authorities make available to prisoners the writings.\u201d The court specifically found that \u201cin the hands of the inmate who is not fully informed of the Black Muslim doctrine * * * the literature could constitute a \u2018clear and present danger of a breach of prison security or discipline or some other substantial interference with the orderly function of the institution. Long v. Parker, 3 Cir., 390 F.2d 816, 820, 822.\u2019 \u201d Knuckles v. Prasse, 302 F.Supp. 1036, 1058, 1059 (Ed.Pa.1969). This same reasoning apparently governed its decision relating to the wearing of medals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-22\">Similarly, we will not disturb the two conclusions that the plaintiffs had been subjected to \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d for two and one-half days. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>We reject the appeal of the prison authorities grounded on the argument of insufficient evidence and the plaintiff-appellants\u2019 argument that the court erred in not finding that the conditions persisted beyond this limited time, and that they were entitled to money damages as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-5\">This court has previously said in Gittlemacker v. Prasse, 428 F.2d 1, 4 (3 Cir. 1970): \u201cTo determine with precision, those rights which follow an inmate into prison involves a process of weighing and balancing conflicting interests.\u201d We conclude that The Honorable A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., the trial judge, approached his task of striking this proper balance with outstanding sensitivity, understanding and perception. The district court demonstrated an awareness that \u201c[i]n the case of a prisoner, the determination of what constitutes an actionable claim may become difficult since imprisonment unavoidably results in the forfeiture of certain rights and privileges commonly exercised in a free society.\u201d Gittlemacker v. Prasse, <em>supra, </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-6\">The district court succinctly posited the problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-15\">But a prison is not a private dwelling and a cell row is not a public highway. Thus plaintiffs\u2019 freedoms and rights must be analyzed in the realistic context of the prison situation where plaintiffs desire to exercise them. 302 F.Supp. at 1047.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1337-17\">Guided by these principles, we turn to the argument advanced by the inmate-appellants, which suggests an inconsistency between the court\u2019s conclusion that Eighth Amendment rights were denied them for two and one-half days and its refusal to award monetary damages. We do not find these conclusions incompatible. The complaint was a combination of counts in law and in equity. The district court treated this particular issue as one sounding in equity, setting forth in conclusion 7: \u201cPlaintiffs were subjected to cruel and unusual punishment, but since it does not appear that this practice has been or will be continued, injunctive relief is DENIED.\u201d 302 F.Supp. at 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"ANxb\">Accordingly, after considering all the arguments advanced by the cross-appellants, we will affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"AGE\">Judge Seitz concurs in the result except that were he in the district court he would have assessed at least nominal damages against the defendants legally responsible for the conditions found to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. See Basista v. Weir, 340 F.2d 74, 87 (3d Cir. 1965).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
