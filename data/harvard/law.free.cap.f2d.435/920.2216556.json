Appellant seeks among other things to enjoin the state trial court from further criminal proceedings until that court has acted on his application to it for habeas corpus relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>The district court denied the petition on grounds of failure to exhaust available state remedies, and because no circumstances were alleged or shown to exist that would warrant federal interference with administration of justice in the state courts. This ruling is manifestly correct. See Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 1970, 398 U.S. 281, 90 S.Ct. 1739, 26 L.Ed.2d 234; Douglas v. Jeannette, 1943, 319 U.S. 157, 63 S.Ct. 877, 87 L.Ed. 1234; Wallach v.

It is appropriate to dispose of this pro se case summarily, pursuant to this Court\u2019s local Rule 9(c) (2), appellant having failed to file a brief within the time fixed by Rule 31, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
