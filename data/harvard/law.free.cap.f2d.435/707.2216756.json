(1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-24\">The Board found that the management of the Adam Loos Boiler Works Company unlawfully discharged an employee who was the workers\u2019 union steward, in reaction to his vigorous pursuit of his co-employees\u2019 rights with management. A discharge of an employee motivated in part by anti-union animus is unlawful. NLRB v. West Side Carpet Cleaning Co., 329 F.2d 758 (6th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-25\">The Company responded that upon a fair estimate of the entire record, the Board should have found the discharged employee was inefficient and unworkmanlike in the performance of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>job and that those were the factors motivating the union steward\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Upon a careful review of the entire record and upon consideration of the briefs and arguments of counsel, we find there is substantial evidence on the record as a whole to affirm the factual findings of the Board. The application for enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
