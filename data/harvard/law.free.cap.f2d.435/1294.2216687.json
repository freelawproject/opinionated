In the exercise of this Court\u2019s broad discretion to \u201crequire such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances,\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we remand the case with directions that the district court conduct a hearing at which the defendant Macias shall be present and shall be represented by his attorney, Sam Sparks, Esq., and of which hearing the defendant\u2019s former counsel shall have appropriate notice and an opportunity to attend and testify, and at which hearing all such relevant evidence on the issue of whether the defendant Macias was denied effective representation of counsel at his trial as may be offered either by the defendant Macias or by the United States shall be received. After the conclusion of such hearing, the district court shall make and enter appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law. If the district court finds that the defendant Macias was denied effective representation of counsel, it shall vacate and set aside the judgment of conviction and grant the defendant a new trial. Otherwise, the district court shall enter a judgment denying the defendant a new trial. The judgment of conviction shall remain in full force and effect unless the district court vacates and sets aside said judgment and grants the defendant a new trial, or in the event the district court shall deny the defendant a new trial unless and until otherwise ordered in further proceedings upon a subsequent appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-15\">Remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1375-11\">.
