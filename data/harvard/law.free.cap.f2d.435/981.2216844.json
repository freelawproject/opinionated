The court did find, however, that appellee\u2019s \u201cTulareloft 500\u201d model belt would infringe the patent in suit <em>if </em>the claims were valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-20\">Appellant appeals from the court\u2019s holding that claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 of its patent are invalid. It pursues its infringement charges only against appellee\u2019s \u201cTulareloft\u201d model. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-21\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-22\">Appellant asserted at the trial, and the trial court agreed, that claims 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 are subsidiary to claim 1. As set forth in Admitted Fact No. 8 in the pretrial conference order, the element or elements stated in each of claims 1, 3, 4 and 7 of the patent in suit, upon which appellant relied during the trial of the case as new and novel, was a \u201ccommon intersection\u201d for the shoulder and lap elements of a three point combination safety belt, said intersection lo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>cated toward the side of the wearer that is opposite the shoulder over which the shoulder belt passes. Actually, the \u201ccommon intersection\u201d is referred to in claim 1, and each of claims 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 incorporate claim 1 with the words, \u201cA safety belt as recited in claim 1 \u2022* * *\u00bb\u00bb Claim 6 is not in issue. Claim 8 probably has no claim for a common intersection, although the point is not material to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">Appellant asserts that its patent is valid because it describes the first unsymmetrical, three-point, non-discretionary lap and shoulder harness for use in safely restraining a vehicle\u2019s occupants in the event of a collision. The term \u201cunsymmetrical\u201d is used by appellant to describe the belt's design, which provides for shoulder and lap elements that intersect at a common point located toward the side of the wearer that is opposite the shoulder over which the diagonal strap passes. The term \u201cnon-discretionary\u201d is used by appellant to connote an asserted \u201cmust-be-worn\u201d feature of appellant\u2019s device that precludes the wearer from electing between the shoulder and lap elements because both are inseparably attached. Appellant urges that it is these features that distinguish its device from the prior art. It should be noted that in none of the claims is there any specification of an \u201cunsymmetrical belt\u201d nor is there any claim concerning the asserted \u201cnon-discretionary\u201d or \u201cmust-be-worn\u201d feature. A patent is limited by its claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">The prior art discloses: (1) a single lap restraining belt [SANDERS Patent No. 2,639,852 (not cited by the Patent Office)]; (2) a symmetrical or double shoulder harness [e.g., CARLISLE I Patent No. 2,365,625 (cited); WILSON Patent No. 2,576,867 (cited); MANSON Patent No. 2,275,450 (cited)]; (3) a single diagonal restraining belt [IRWIN Patent No. 1,971,264 (cited)]; (4) a combination of a symmetrical shoulder harness with a separate lap belt, the diagonal belts intersecting with the lap belt, designed for common use by all occupants of the front seat [LEVEAU (French) Patent No. 331,926 (not cited)] ; and (5) a combination of a diagonal shoulder strap with a separate lap belt [DEHAVEN Patent No. 2,606,727 (not cited)]. It is clear that the component elements of appellant\u2019s device were present in the prior art. The prior art showed single and double diagonal shoulder belts, lap belts and common connecting means. Thus, appellant's \u201cinvention\u201d must satisfy the stringent rule for patentability for devices that aggregate elements known to the prior art. <em>See, </em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equip. Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 71 S.Ct. 127, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">The district court found that the claims of appellant\u2019s patent were not limited to unsymmetrical harnesses or safety belts. Considering the pertinent prior art (particularly IRWIN, DE-HAVEN, SANDERS and LEVEAU), the court held that the claims in issue would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art, and that appellant\u2019s device did not produce a novel or unexpected result. We cannot conclude that the court\u2019s findings as to invalidity were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">We do not approve the trial court\u2019s findings that the \u201cmust-be-worn\u201d feature was a proper element of the claimed invention. The court\u2019s references to this matter were in its findings concerning infringement. We do not reach the question of infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-10\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
