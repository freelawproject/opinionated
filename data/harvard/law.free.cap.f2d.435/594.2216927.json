The question presented is whether appellant\u2019s mark Executive Model\u201d,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> so resembles Bond Stores\u2019 previously registered marks \u201cThe Executive\u201d,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cExecutive Group\u201d,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cYoung Executive\u201d,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u201cJunior Executive\u201d,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as to be likely to cause confusion, mistake, or to deceive. Appellant\u2019s mark is applied to men\u2019s shorts and slacks, and the marks of Bond Stores are used for a variety of men\u2019s clothing. \u00ab</p>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">Pursuant to the applicable statutory provision the Patent Office shall not refuse registration unless applicant\u2019s mark so resembles a registered mark \u201cas to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-17\">Appellant argued below that the cited registered marks are weak and entitled to little protection; and that its own mark emphasizes, or suggests, the style or cut of clothing, whereas the registered marks suggest the individual wearer of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-18\">The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> concluded that confusion or mistake as to source would be likely, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-19\">Despite the fact that the term \u201cEXECUTIVE\u201d is laudatory or highly suggestive in nature and is in the general category of weak marks, such marks are nevertheless entitled to some degree of protection in their field of trade. See: King-Kup Candies, Inc. v. King Candy Company, [48 CCPA 948, 288 F.2d 944] 129 USPQ 272 (CCPA, 1961). In the instant case, it is apparent that words such as \u201cTHE\u201d and \u201cJUNIOR\u201d merely emphasize the word \u201cEXECUTIVE\u201d and that \u201cEXECUTIVE\u201d is the dominant feature of applicant\u2019s mark because of the obvious meaning of the word \u201cmodel\u201d in the clothing field. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>over, we do not believe that purchasers would make any such fine distinctions between the meanings of the marks as applicant would have us make.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">We would only add that appellant\u2019s contention that its mark \u201cExecutive Model\u201d suggests that the \u201cstyle or cut of the garment is one commonly worn by executives\u201d, would seem to be precisely the meaning that the purchaser attaches to the registrant\u2019s mark \u201cExecutive Group\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">It seems to us that the board has provided the appropriate response to appellant\u2019s arguments renewed here. We agree with its decision, and therefore <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-11\">.
