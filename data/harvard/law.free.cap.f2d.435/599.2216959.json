The stuffing comprises such comestibles as cheese, sauerkraut, peanut butter, or other solid or semi-solid food material. According to the specification, a layer of ground meat \u2014hamburger or sausage meat, for example \u2014 completely surrounds the stuffing in a manner to contain and prevent exudation of portions of the inner stuffing that may be liquid. After the outer surface of the ground meat layer is covered with a batter coating, the product is deep fat fried. Claim 4 is illustrative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiq\">4. A food product comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqq\">a first food component having a substantially cylindrical shape,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-18\">a second food component consisting essentially of comminuted meat surrounding said first component in a layer of substantially uniform thickness, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-19\">a substantially uniform coating derived from a batter and having a thickness of an order of magnitude of one eighth inch surrounding said second food component,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-20\">said food product being substantially in the shape of a hot dog and having dimensions of an order of magnitude no greater than about the dimensions of a hot dog.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-21\">The references are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-22\">Matson 1,492,603 May 6, 1924</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHs\">Sawkins 1,591,945 July 6, 1926</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANh\">Jenkins 1,706,491 Mar. 26, 1929</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA6r\">Johnson 2,822,571 Feb. 11, 1958</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEU\">Australian patent 127,632 April 30, 1948</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZL\">British</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arm0\">specification 786,217 Nov. 13, 1957</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-34\">British discloses a three-component food product suitable for deep fat frying comprising a wiener or sausage entirely surrounded by a batter coating, which in turn is coated with an outer layer of precooked potatoes. Johnson discloses a hollow frankfurter with an axial opening end-to-end into which various foods, such as cheese or relish, may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>stuffed. The resultant product is placed in the conventional hot dog bun. Mat-son, Sawkins, Jenkins and Australian all disclose deep fat frying or baking batter-coated frankfurters or sausages.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\">The examiner rejected all claims under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 in view of the above references on several grounds. For one, he regarded appellant\u2019s three-component food product to distinguish from that of British principally in the particular order or arrangement of the product components, with the placement of one of the food components <em>inside, </em>rather than <em>outside, </em>the meat component to be no more than a matter of obvious choice. For another, he rejected the claims as unpatentable over Jenkins or Australian in view of Johnson or, alternatively, as unpatentable over Johnson in view of each of Matson, Sawkins, Jenkins or Australian. The crux of the examiner\u2019s position there seems to have been that it would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to <em>completely </em>surround, even at the ends, the inner stuffing component of Johnson with the comminuted meat component, and subsequently coat the resulting product with a batter prior to deep fat frying, all as suggested by the remaining references.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The board, while preferring the rejection employing the Johnson, Jenkins and Australian references, agreed with the examiner\u2019s other stated grounds of rejection, and affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Appellant\u2019s principal argument here is that there is no factual basis to support an allegation that Johnson suggests <em>surrounding </em>a stuffing component with com-minuted meal. It cannot be gainsaid, of course, that Johnson does not explicitly disclose <em>entirely </em>surrounding his stuffing component with comminuted meat, but contents himself with enclosing merely the sides of the cylindrical tube of stuffing, leaving the ends open. The examiner recognized as much, and turned to the Matson, Sawkins, Jenkins or Australian references for evidence that those of ordinary skill in the art would as a matter of course completely surround one food component with another as convenience, necessity, or choice in cooking or eating dictates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find no reversible error in that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The view we take renders it unnecessary to consider the other grounds of rejection advanced below. The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-35\">.
