We affirm the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>Borden based its oppositions on likelihood of confusion between the marks sought to be registered and the following marks, registrations of which are owned by Borden:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1416-4\">CHEEZ DOODLES for cheese-flavored corn curls.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1416-5\">CORN DOODLES, for corn chips.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJU\">YANKEE DOODLES for cake.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY8X\">DIPSY DOODLES for corn chips.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adi\">FRUIT DOODLES for prepared pastry product with fruit filling.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQU9\">NUTTY DOODLES for corn puffs, coated with caramel and peanut bits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1416-6\">Beich based its oppositions on likelihood of confusion between the marks sought to be registered and its registered trademark DIPSY DOODLE on a ribbon design for candy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-7\">Both opposers are admittedly prior users to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-8\">The board sustained Borden\u2019s oppositions on the grounds that the goods of Borden and appellant were similar, i. e., snack-type food products; and that since DOODLES, as applied to such products, was fanciful, appellant\u2019s use of the marks sought to be registered would be likely to cause confusion, deception or mistake within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d). Beich\u2019s oppositions were sustained on essentially the same grounds, the board noting that Beich\u2019s goods and appellant\u2019s were identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-9\">Appellant contends in its brief that similarity in terminal portions of trademarks is not alone a sufficient basis for a finding of likelihood of confusion, citing cases such as Younghusband v. Kurlash Co., 94 F.2d 230, 25 CCPA 886 (1938). None of the cited cases supports the broad proposition urged by appellant, but only the proposition that identical terminal portions of marks do not always require a holding of likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-17\">Appellant further contends that in this case the different first words of its marks obviate likelihood of confusion with the appellees\u2019 marks. Appellant\u2019s principal support for this contention is the fact that the second word, DOODLES, has been used on food products by several different companies<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and hence cannot serve a source-indicating function in any of the appellees\u2019 marks. Accordingly, appellant argues, the DOODLES portion of its marks cannot create a likelihood of confusion as to source, and since the first words are clearly dissimilar to all of appellees\u2019 marks, there can be no overall likelihood of confusion. While this argument has some merit, we note, as the board did, that the word \u201cdoodles\u201d as applied to food products is arbitrary and fanciful. We therefore conclude that the limited amount of third-party use-proved here, while possibly diluting the trademark significance of the term \u201cdoodles,\u201d does not entirely destroy its source-indicating function.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-18\">Appellant contended at oral argument that there was no doubt concerning the absence of likelihood of confusion. On the record before us we find that appellant\u2019s case leaves us with a good deal of doubt. According to longstanding practice, we must resolve this doubt in favor of appellees, the prior users.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1415-29\">.
