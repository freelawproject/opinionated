BRYAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"A-y\">Income taxes paid by W. Taylor Johnson and his wife, Foye K. Johnson \u2014 taxpayer \u2014 were recouped by a September 1969 judgment of the Federal Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Decision hinged on the appropriate tax treatment of a corporate distribution of moneys held in a depreciation account. The United States appeals, and successfully, we hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-11\">The facts, bared of simultaneous tax incidents, are these as taken from the Court\u2019s unquestioned findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-12\">\u201cThe Mayflower Corporation owned a high-rise apartment building at Virginia Beach, Virginia, * * *. The taxpayers acquired fifty-two percent of the corporation\u2019s stock in 1949 at a cost of $1,040.. The remaining forty-eight percent of the stock was purchased in 1954 * * * by the taxpayers at a cost of $144,500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-14\">\u201cFrom 1949 until 1963 no distributions were made to stockholders. There was, however, a substantial accumulation which counsel stated at the time of trial was a \u2018depreciation reserve\u2019 for equipment in the corporate account entitled \u2018Appreciation of Land and Building.\u2019 On June 19, 1963, the taxpayers\u2019 attorney wrote Johnson recommending a distribution which, in his opinion, could be affected as a tax-free return of capital under section 301 of the Internal Revenue Code. Subsequently, on June 21, 1963, a Board of Directors meeting was held and a resolution was adopted calling for the distribution of $169,000 to be paid June 26,1963.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-15\">\u201cIn preparing the minutes of the stockholders\u2019 meeting, taxpayers\u2019 attorney did not specify whether the distribution was to be made on a \u2018pro rata\u2019 or \u2018non-pro rata\u2019 basis. It is contended by plaintiff, however, that since the clear and admitted intention of the taxpayers was to avail themselves of the benefits of section 301, and since this could not be done if the distribution was pro rata, the distribution must be deemed to have been a non-pro rata basis.\u201d 303 F.Supp. at 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1338-16\">The parties agree that $13,564.70 of the $169,000 distributed was a dividend of current corporate income. It was paid on a pro rata basis, and is taxable to the Johnsons as ordinary income. The issue is how the receipt of the remainder \u2014 $155,435.30\u2014should be assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-17\">The position of the taxpayer is that this was a distribution of capital to them and that there was no gain because the sum so disbursed did not exceed the total amount paid by them for the stock. For this computation they combine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>costs of their two acquisitions. They show, too, that the Government stipulates that the taxpayer intended a non-pro rata distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-4\">The Government, on the other hand, insists that the acquisitions cannot be combined. Skinner v. Eaton, 45 F.2d 568, 570 (2 Cir.1930) cert. denied 283 U.S. 837, 51 S.Ct. 486, 75 L.Ed. 1449 (1931). It asserts that each acquisition must be apportioned its part of the distribution, individually. In this process, there is allotted to each the proportion of the distribution that the number of shares in that block bears to the number of shares outstanding. Thus the distribution for tax purposes would not be allocated on a non-pro rata reckoning in accordance with the stipulated intent of the taxpayer, but rather on a pro rata division. The Government illustrates its contention and the application of it specifically as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-5\">a/c 52 shares Acquired in 1949 a/c 48 shares Acquired in 1954</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-6\">Amount Received $80,826 $ 74,609</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-7\">Basis 1,040 144,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-8\">Gain $79,786 -0-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1339-9\">The language of the pertinent code sections persuades us to the Government\u2019s view. Internal Revenue Code of 1954, \u00a7 301, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 301, fixes the tax consequences of corporate distributions when, as here, admittedly they are not dividends, in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-10\">\u201c(a) In general. \u2014 Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a distribution of property (as defined in section 317(a) ) made by a corporation to a shareholder with respect to its stock shall be treated in the manner provided in subsection (c).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-11\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-12\">\u201c(c) Amount taxable. \u2014 In the case of a distribution to which subsection (a) applies\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-13\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-14\">\u201c(2) Amount applied against basis. \u2014That portion of the distribution which is not a dividend shall be applied against and reduce the adjusted basis of the stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-17\">\u201c(3) Amount in excess of basis.\u2014 (A) * * * that portion of the distribution which is not a dividend, to the extent that it exceeds the adjusted basis of the stock, shall be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1339-19\">IRC \u00a7 1012 determines \u201cthe adjusted basis\u201d of the stock, stating that \u201cthe basis of property shall be the cost' of such property * * *\u201d26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-20\">These provisions, in our judgment, preclude the aggregation of the cost of the two lots of stock here to reach an adjusted basis for tax purposes. The tax laws are peremptory and inexorably command assessment on the transaction as a pro rata distribution. See, too, United States v. Davis, 397 U.S. 301, 90 S.Ct. 1041, 25 L.Ed.2d 323 (1970). They must prevail, to repeat, notwithstanding the intent of the distributor and distributees. On the gain of $79,-786 as illustrated by the Government, the tax amounts to $17,472.76, totaling with interest $20,791.58. The District Court\u2019s refund of these taxes must be disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-21\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
