Thereafter, he commenced this proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, to vacate the judgment of conviction. The keystone of his contention was and is that \u201cthe incriminatory portion of \u00a7 4744(a) was declared unconstitutional in <em>Leary </em>* * Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969). The district court denied relief and Shaffer has appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-20\">Shaffer apparently recognizes that the Supreme Court did not in <em>Leary </em>strike down the marihuana tax statute [26 USC \u00a7 4741(a)] as unconstitutional on its face, but he fails to realize that, having entered a plea of guilty to a charge of violating the statute, he cannot now assert that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. A fortiori, where as here, his plea was counseled. See Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
