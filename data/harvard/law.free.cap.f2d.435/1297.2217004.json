He lost at every step of the administrative process, and in the district court. 308 F.Supp. 192. On this appeal his principal point seems to be that he should not merely have been told that he could have his own counsel when he appeared before the hearing examiner after the Social Security Administration had denied his claim, but should have been supplied with counsel at government expense. There is no suggestion that having counsel would have resulted in the presentation of any better case. It is quite apparent from the record that plaintiff was fairly treated; indeed, the examiner was exceptionally solicitous and helpful. We see no possible prejudice. Cross v. Finch, 5 Cir., 1970, 427 F.2d 406, 408-409; Granger v. Finch, 7 Cir., 1970, 425 F.2d 206, cert. denied 91 S.Ct. 46; Domozik v. Cohen, 3 Cir., 1969, 413 F.2d 5, 9; <em>cf. </em>Steimer v.
