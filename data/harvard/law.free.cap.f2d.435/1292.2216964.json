Upon remand, counsel was appointed for him. The district court, in reviewing the records of both the trial and a state evidentiary hearing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applied the standards of United States ex rel. Mathis v. Rundle, 394 F.2d 748 (3 Cir. 1968), that late appointment of counsel created a prima facie presumption of prejudice, and United States ex rel. Chambers v. Maroney, 408 F.2d 1186 (3 Cir. 1969), that this presumption could be rebutted by an affirmative showing of no prejudice to the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-23\">After making a detailed analysis of the. testimony adduced both at trial and at the state evidentiary hearing, the district court concluded that appellant was not denied effective assistance of trial counsel. We have reviewed the record and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-24\">Subsequent to the district court proceedings, this court reviewed our <em>Mathis </em>rule, and in Moore v. United States, 437 F.2d 730 (3 Cir. 1970), placed upon the relator the burden of proving prejudice based upon late appointment of counsel. Considered either in light of the standard applied by the district court, which placed upon the Commonwealth the burden of showing an absence of prejudice, or in view of the controlling standard of <em>Moore, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>the record discloses no denial of appellant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-4\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1372-16\">. Appellant\u2019s counsel and the district attorney stipulated that there was no necessity for an additional evidentiary hearing in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ahh\">. In a review of this court\u2019s decision in Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42. 54, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 1982, 26 L.Ed.2d 419, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agia\">Unquestionably, the courts should make every effort to effect early appointments of counsel in all cases. But we are not disposed to fashion a <em>per se </em>rule requiring reversal of every conviction following tardy appointment of counsel or to hold that, whenever a habeas corpus petition alleges a belated appointment, an evidentiary hearing must be held to determine whether the defendant has been denied his constitutional right.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
