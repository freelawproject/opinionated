Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 [1966]), and that the incriminating answers he gave in the absence of counsel were not accompanied by a waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-19\">In each of the two instances in which Desonia responded to questions, and the responses were admitted at trial, the oral and written warnings, taken together, fully complied with <em>Miranda. </em>The record indicates that the appellant fully understood his rights as therein stated. Under the circumstances, Desonia voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived those rights. The statements elicited were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
