At issue is whether petitioner and its subsidiaries were required to file a consolidated Federal income tax return for their taxable year ended January 31, 1965 solely because they elected to file a consolidated Federal income tax return for the previous taxable year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-25\">Appellant Regal, Inc. claims that Treasury Regulation 1.1502-11A is invalid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This regulation provides, with appropriate exceptions that once an affiliated group of corporations elects to file a consolidated return, such group must continue to file on a consolidated basis until permission of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue be obtained to make a change. We affirm the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>sion of the Tax Court upon the facts and for the reasons stated by Judge Raum in his opinion below, 53 T.C. 261 filed November 17,1969.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1002-17\">.

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1965, the regulation is inapplicable, and is replaced by Treasury Regulation 1.1502-75 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
