This was probably no boon to defendant. The incident occurred because experienced counsel was not familiar with the practice in the particular division of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-13\">The procedure and action of the court offended no statute or rule of the court. We hold that counsel here was responsible for knowing the procedure in the court. The appellant relies on Avila v. United States, 9 Cir., 76 F.2d 39. On its facts, Avila is distinguishable. There the defendant did not get the benefit of the court\u2019s own rule, and he had a right to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-14\">We find no merit to the contention about authentication of documents, the failure to suppress certain documents, or in the challenges made to the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-15\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
