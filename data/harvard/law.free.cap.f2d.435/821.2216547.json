He pleaded guilty and was later sentenced to an imprisonment term of three years. His codefendants, who were tried and found guilty, received lesser sentences. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, Saros challenged his sentence and appeals from the District Court\u2019s decision, denying him relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-25\">In his application to the District Court, Saros contended that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>sentence was invalid because the sentencing judge presided over the trial of his codefendants and thus considered evidence presented at that trial in Saros\u2019 sentencing. This does not vitiate a permissible sentence. As the District Court observed, a sentencing judge can exercise \u201ca wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law.\u201d Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241, 246, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1082, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949). <em>See, e. g. </em>Verdugo v. United States, 402 F.2d 599, 611 (9th Cir. 1968); Application of Hodge, 262 F.2d 778, 782 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, Hodge v. People of State of Cal., 356 U.S. 942, 78 S.Ct. 789, 2 L.Ed.2d 818 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Saros also contends that his guilty plea should be nullified because it was induced by the prosecutor\u2019s unkept promise that Saros would be sentenced by a different judge. Since this contention was not made in the District Court, we cannot consider it. Suggs v. Wilson, 403 F.2d 52, 54 n.l (9th Cir. 1968); Davis v. Rhay, 256 F.2d 617, 619 (9th Cir. 1958); Watkins v. Duffy, 197 F.2d 816 (9th Cir. 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
