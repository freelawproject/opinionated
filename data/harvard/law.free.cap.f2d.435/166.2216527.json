There was no direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-25\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion, the appellant has alleged that the district court failed to comply with the provisions of Rule 11, F.R.Crim.P., with the result that his plea was not understandingly entered. The district Court held that this contention was refuted by the files and records of the case, particularly the transcript of the proceedings at which the plea was proffered and accepted by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-26\">Our examination of the record leads us to agree with the ruling appealed from. The transcript shows that the district court adequately complied with the standards announced in McCarthy v. United States, 1969, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418. Accordingly the order appealed from is affirmed. See Streator v. United States, 5th Cir. 1968, 395 F.2d 661; Hunter v. United States, 5th Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 1203; United States v. Tivis, 5th Cir. 1970, 421 F.2d 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-27\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-17\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this pro se case summarily, pursuant to this Court\u2019s local Rule 9(c) (2), \u2022 appellant having failed to file a brief within the time fixed by Rule 31, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
