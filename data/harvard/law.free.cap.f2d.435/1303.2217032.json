We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-23\">Thomas was convicted upon trial by jury of conspiracy to violate civil rights. His conviction was affirmed on appeal, <em>sub nom. </em>Wilkins v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 376 F.2d 552, cert. den\u2019d 389 U.S. 964, 88 S.Ct. 342, 19 L.Ed.2d 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-24\">Rule 32(c), (2), F.R.Crim.P., provides in part that \u201cThe court before imposing sentence may disclose to the defendant or his counsel all or part of the material contained in the report of the presentence investigation and afford an opportunity to the defendant or his counsel to comment thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-25\">This Court has consistently held that Rule 32 places the disclosure of the contents of the presentence report, or any part of it, within the sound discretion of the sentencing court. United States v. Rubin, 5 Cir. 1970, 433 F.2d 442; United States v. Bakewell, 5 Cir. 1970, 430 F.2d 721; United States v. Chapman, 5 Cir. 1969, 420 F.2d 925; Roeth v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 380 F.2d 755, cert. den\u2019d 390 U.S. 1015, 88 S.Ct. 1266, 20 L.Ed.2d 165. Since Thomas has not shown that the district court abused its discretion, the judgment of the district court denying his motion for a copy of the presentence report is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
