The Statute Under Which the Defendant Was Convicted Is Unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The constitutionality of 50 App., United States Code \u00a7 462 has been upheld by the Supreme Court. United States v. O\u2019Brien, 1968, 391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672. See also United States v.

The Evidence Was Insufficient to Show a Violation of the Offense Charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The defendant pleaded guilty and the court, pursuant to Rule 11, Fed.R.Crim. P., properly satisfied itself that there was a factual basis for the plea.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">3. The Defendant Was Not Afforded an Opportunity to Enlist in the Regular Army as Provided in 50 App., U.S.C. \u00a7 454(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">He had the opportunity to attempt to enlist until notified to report for induction but made no such attempt. 50 App., U.S.C. \u00a7 465(d) provides in part that <em>\u201c </em>* * * no person shall be accepted for enlistment after he has received orders to report for induction * *</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">We find no reversible error and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
