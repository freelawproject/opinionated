Citizens Casualty Co. of N.

A series of American Express traveler\u2019s checks were stolen, including one numbered EA 51-409-390. The forgery of this check and others was ultimately the subject of an indictment which culminated in the conviction of Appellant, Cheryl Ann Law. In appealing her conviction the defendant asserts that the failure of the government to prove her real name was not the same as that she affixed to the traveler\u2019s checks requires reversal. It is Miss Law\u2019s contention that forgery requires a check to be signed with a false name, and the use of a false name can be shown only if one\u2019s real name is proven. We disagree and affirm her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-7\">In February of 1969, the defendant cashed two books of ten 20 dollar traveler\u2019s checks at the Hialeah Race Track in Hialeah, Florida. The checks were countersigned \u201cEllen Stuart\u201d in the presence of George Meyer, a track cashier, and the defendant supplied Mr. Meyer an Ohio driver\u2019s license which bore this same name.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-8\">These checks, which included check EA 51-409-390, were sent to the First National Bank of Miami, which then forwarded them to the American Express Company in New York City for collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-9\">During approximately this same time period, the defendant again countersigned the name \u201cEllen Stuart\u201d and, using the same Ohio driver\u2019s license, cashed a total of four other books of ten 20 dollar traveler\u2019s checks at the race track and at the Biscayne Kennel Club. Her luck waned, however, for as she attempted to cash another two books of checks at the window of cashier Paul O\u2019Kane, the Mutuel Manager was summoned and she was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-10\">The defendant was indicted in two counts under the name Cheryl Ann Law \u2014(1) for possessing stolen traveler\u2019s checks, knowing the same to have been unlawfully taken from a bank or savings and loan association in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(c) (1970), and (2) for causing check EA 51-409-390, a falsely made and forged security, to be transported in commerce, knowing it to be falsely made and forged, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2314 (1970). Upon the initial trial a jury acquitted the defendant of the Section 2113(c) charge, but was unable to agree on guilt as to the Section 2314 violation, whereupon the trial judge declared a mistrial as to this second charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-11\">Upon retrial of the Section 2314 violation, after submission of the case and during the course of its deliberations, the jury asked the court for further instructions on two questions: (i) the definition of forgery, and (ii) whether Cheryl Ann Law was legally known as Ellen Stuart. The judge thereupon defined forgery as \u201cthe false making with intent to defraud of any writing which if genuine might apparently be of legal efficacy or the foundation of a legal liability,\u201d but he refused to answer the second question, reasoning \u201cthere was no evidence on that subject [whether Cheryl Ann Law was legally Ellen Stuart] that I know of, so I cannot go back and try the case very well. You would have to have some evidence to raise that issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-13\">Defendant asserts that the trial court\u2019s definition of forgery, as it pertained to the indictment, assumed facts which were never presented in evidence. Specifically she claims that, in defining forgery for the jury, the court indirectly assumed that the defendant had signed the check with a false name, although there was no evidence on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-14\">This polemic, however, wrongfully assumes that the name used to sign the stolen checks is of material importance. It is not. The Circuit, in rejecting this specious argument, declared in United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>States v. Franco, 413 F.2d 282, 283 (1969):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1346-4\">* * * a stolen blank traveler\u2019s check becomes a forged security when someone fills in the signature spaces even if he uses his own signature. This is because a traveler\u2019s check is cashed on the credit of the issuer. Since American Express had never issued these traveler\u2019s checks to anyone, the person to fill them in, even if he used his own signature, necessarily created forged securities and the first negotiator of the forged securities was necessarily a forger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1346-6\">Since it made no difference who signed the checks, error in the court\u2019s response would have to be based upon a deduction that the court implied that a false name was used, when dealing with the cheeks. We cannot deduce any such implication from the record. Even if we could have, it would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-7\">Additionally, we should add that no objection as required by Fed.R.Crim. P. 30 was lodged after the trial court stated the definition of forgery to the jury. Thus, for the additional instruction to be grounds for reversal, it would have to be plain error within the purview of Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). From a close scrutiny of the record no error, let alone error of Rule 52(b) magnitude, is apparent. The conviction of Cheryl Ann Law is</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
