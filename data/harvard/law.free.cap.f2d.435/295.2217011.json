We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 suit was filed December 18, 1967, seeking recovery of overtime wages since February 1,1967, the effective date of 1966 amendments to the Act. These amendments brought central office employees of school boards within the overtime provision, and brought school boards within the definition of \u201cemployers.\u201d The constitutionality of the amendments was challenged by the State of Maryland which was joined by twenty-six other states including Illinois. A three-judge court sustained the amendments on June 13, 1967. Maryland v. Wirtz, 269 F.Supp. 826 (D.Md.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-19\">While Maryland's appeal from the district court\u2019s judgment was pending, the Wage and Hour Administrator on September 22, 1967 issued a bulletin indicating his \u201ctentative opinion\u201d that central office school employees \u201cwould not seem to be within the coverage of the [Fair Labor Standards] Act.\u201d On October 19, 1967, and December 12, 1967, the Administrator issued further bulletins expressing the same \u201ctentative\u201d opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-20\">On June 10, 1968, the Supreme Court affirmed the ruling of the three-judge court upholding the constitutionality of the amendments as applied to school employees. Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S. 183, 88 S.Ct. 2017, 20 L.Ed.2d 1020 (1968). On October 18, 1968 the Administrator rescinded his earlier tentative opinion and stated that central office clerks of school boards were covered by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-22\">The district court\u2019s judgment before us was entered June 3, 1969. The district court found that defendant had failed to pay overtime from February 1, 1967 to the date of judgment, but that under Section 10(a) of the Portal-to-Portal Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 259,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>was not liable for overtime wages prior to October 18, 1968, the date of the Administrator\u2019s final opinion. The district court decided, however, that the Board was clearly liable for overtime after the October 18,1968 bulletin of the Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The bar to recovery of overtime under Section 10(a) of the Portal-to-Portal Act is limited by the requirement that an employer plead and prove that his failure to pay \u201cwas in good faith conformity with and reliance on * * * any written administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval or interpretation\u201d of the Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">We think the district court clearly erred in denying overtime relief for the period prior to October 18, 1968. The record discloses that the defendant did not learn of the existence of the administrative bulletins upon which it allegedly relied until January 25, 1968 and that it did not invoke the bar of Section 10(a) based on these bulletins until May 22, 1968 when it filed its third amended answer. But we need not rest our decision upon consideration of these facts. We prefer, instead, to base our conclusion on the grounds that the bulletins of the Administrator allegedly relied upon formed no proper basis for the invocation of the bar of Section 10(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The bulletins were vague and ambiguous. They could not have served to aid school administrators during the period of litigation concerning the 1966 amendments. The Administrator hedged his tentative opinion with qualifications: \u201cdoes not appear appropriate for us to issue interpretations * * * until the court has ruled,\u201d \u201cwe are not in a position to give anything other than tentative opinions,\u201d \u201cwould not seem.\u201d It is clear from this language that the Administrator did not reach a definitive opinion until October 18, 1968. Although the Board might have acted prudently in delaying payment of the overtime until this date, we hold that such a \u201ctentative opinion\u201d did not provide the Board with the statutory bar to plaintiffs\u2019 recovery of the overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Defendant Board also argues that it was relieved, under Section 10(a), from paying the overtime for the period prior to October 18, because it acted in good faith and prudently, given the extensive constitutional attack on the 1966 amendments. Section 10(a), however, requires more than good faith conduct; to be relieved of paying overtime under the Act there must be good faith reliance upon a written administrative order, etc. The Board\u2019s reliance on General Electric Co. v. Porter, 208 F.2d 805, 817 (9th Cir. 1953), cert. denied 347 U.S. 951, 74 S.Ct. 676, 98 L.Ed. 1097 (1954), and Kelly v. Ballard, 298 F.Supp. 1301 (S.D.Cal. 1969), is misplaced. The claims there were for liquidated damages, which the trial court may, under Section 11<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Portal-to-Portal Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260, refuse to award if the employer acts in good faith and with reasonable grounds for believing that his conduct is not in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Section 11 does not apply to claims for overtime wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">We conclude that the district court erred in holding the plaintiffs were not entitled to the overtime wages claimed for the period before October 18, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The district court also held that plaintiffs were not entitled to liquidated damages under Section 216(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Under that section, liquidated damages in an amount equal to the overtime claimed are automatically awarded as a penalty for wrongful failure to pay overtime. However, Section 11 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> invests the district courts \u201cwith sound discretion\u201d to. award no liquidated damages under Section 216 (b) \u201cif the employer shows to the satisfaction of the court\u201d that his failure to pay overtime was \u201cin good faith and that he had reasonable grounds\u201d to believe his failure was not a violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The district court found that the Board was not liable for liquidated damages prior to October 18, since it had found that the Board was not liable for overtime in that period. It also denied liquidated damages claimed for the period after October 18 on the ground that the Board \u201cwas in the midst of protracted litigation aimed at settling the overtime question\u201d and since \u201csome of the delay in reaching a conclusion to this case cannot be attributed to defendants.\u201d Plaintiffs appeal only from that part of the judgment that denied liquidated damages after October 18, 1968.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We hold that plaintiffs were entitled to the liquidated damages sought because defendant had no good reason for believing it was not in violation of the Act by refusing to pay overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">It is true, as the district court noted, that the good faith reasonable belief requirement in Section 11 is not limited to good faith reliance on administrative rulings, etc. Section 11 does require, however, that the defendant\u2019s failure to pay \u201cwas in good faith <em>and </em>that he had reasonable grounds for believing\u201d that he was not in violation of the Act. (Emphasis added.) We fail to see how the Board, after the Supreme Court decision in Maryland v. Wirtz, <em>supra, </em>and after receiving the October 18 bulletin, can be held to have reasonable grounds for believing that it was not in violation of the Act. Its obligation to pay the overtime, at least from October 18, was clearly established by the Administrator\u2019s bulletin and must have been clear to the Board, even if it was in the midst of litigation for periods prior to that date. We think also that the question of who delayed the judgment of the district court has no bearing upon whether the Board had reason to believe it was not violating the Act in not paying overtime to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">For the reasons given, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to enter judgment for overtime from February 1, 1967, and for liquidated damages from October 18, 1968, to the date of judgment, June 3, 1969.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-10\">.

The plaintiffs do not appeal the denial of liquidated damages for the period prior to October 18, 1968, and we do not decide whether, and to what extent, they would be entitled to liquidated damages for that period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b378-16\">ENOCH, Senior Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A_S\">(dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-17\">Reluctantly I find myself in partial disagreement with my colleagues. I agree with the District Judge that although the Wage and Hour Administrator did say that he was in no position to issue other than tentative interpretations until the Supreme Court had ruled, nevertheless he was explicit in stating his opinion that the plaintiffs were not covered by the new law.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>The letters were written rulings sent in response to individual requests on a particular factual situation because, as the Administrator puts it, \u201cwe recognize the need for providing some guidance to interested parties in the interim,\u201d evidently pending Supreme Court ruling \u201con the fundamental constitutional issue.\u201d The letters seem to me to meet the standards set out in Martinez v. Phillips Petroleum Company, D. Idaho, E.D., 1968, 283 F.Supp. 514, 526, aff\u2019d. 9 Cir., 1970, 424 F.2d 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">I would hold that the defendant Board could properly rely, in good faith, on these written interpretations of the Administrator, from the time when their existence came to the Board\u2019s knowledge until the Administrator\u2019s rescission of his earlier opinions on October 18, 1968.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
