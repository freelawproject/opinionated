The date of trial was set for June 18, 1968. On June 11, 1968, defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a continuance which was granted. The trial date was reset for September 17, 1968. On that date, counsel requested a second continuance alleging his inability to locate and interview two witnesses. He also claimed insufficient time to prepare for trial due to defendant\u2019s unavailability. The motion for a further continuance was denied, the Court stating that the defense had had adequate time (more than three months) to make adequate preparation. Appointed counsel then requested permission to withdraw from the case, alleging that he had not had sufficient time to fully prepare his defense. This motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">The issue before us is whether the District Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s second motion for a continuance denied defendant the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed to him by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States' Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">We agree that if a request for delay in the date of a trial is justifiable, then expeditiousness should not be the ruling deterrent. Ungar v. Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 84 S.Ct. 841, 11 L.Ed.2d 921 (1964). However, the <em>Ungar </em>case also holds that in determining whether or not a denial of a continuance is arbitrary, \u201c[t]he answer must be found in the circumstances of each case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge.\u201d 376 U.S. at 589, 84 S.Ct. at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">Decisions on this point by this Court, both before and after the <em>Ungar </em>case are not inconsistent with that decision and have clearly held that a trial court\u2019s action on a motion for continuance is a matter of discretion and is not subject to review unless there is a clear showing of abuse of discretion or that a manifest injustice would result if the trial continued. See United States v. Jones, 369 F.2d 217 (7 Cir., 1966); United States v. Marzee, 249 F.2d 941 (7 Cir., 1957), cert. den. 356 U.S. 913, 78 S.Ct. 670, 2 L.Ed.2d 586; United States v. Cook, 184 F.2d 642 (7 Cir., 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-13\">When defendant\u2019s attorney filed the first motion for a continuance on June 11, 1968, he stated that he must have more time to prepare a defense. He also stated he needed more time to take the depositions of several witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-14\">Defendant\u2019s attorney filed his second motion for a continuance on the morning of the day set for the trial. He asserted his inability to locate and interview two witnesses, and also commented on the lack of time to prepare for trial due to the defendant\u2019s unavailability. Defendant\u2019s counsel related to the Court that he had originally geared his time to prepare for trial in August, but that the defendant \u201cwas unavailable to me at that time due to the fact he was defending a case in the state courts of Michigan.\u201d In support of his motion, defense counsel stated that the defendant had to appear in Michigan \u201ca minimum of eight times during the months of July and August\u201d in connection with the Michigan charge against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-15\">With reference to the witnesses, defendant\u2019s attorney admitted that he knew the names and addresses of these witnesses a week before the trial. He gave no reason why he had not been able to locate them- or, indeed, that he had tried to do so. Furthermore, there was no showing that defendant had been denied compulsory processs provided by Rule 17(b) and (f), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Defendant\u2019s at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>torney did not make any showing that he attempted to locate these witnesses and had failed to do so. In arguing his motion, he did not attempt to show the relevance of their testimony. Furthermore, once the trial had begun and it appeared that the testimony of the two witnesses might be helpful, the District Judge offered to issue an order requiring the attendance of these witnesses. Defendant\u2019s attorney, at that time, abandoned his motion for the attendance of the two witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">With reference to defendant\u2019s unavailability during the month of August, defendant himself admitted that he had not been absent from the city where the trial was held for a period of two weeks preceding September 17, the date when the trial commenced. And even considering that the defendant had been away for part of August, defense counsel still had part of June and all of July to interview his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The case at bar was an uncomplicated narcotics case. The trial thereof took but two days. No diligence was shown in attempting to have the witnesses in attendance at the trial. On the record before us, three and one-half months was certainly adequate time to prepare.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">During the trial itself, defense counsel admittedly represented his client aggressively and with skill. There is no proof or indication of incompetence or ineffectiveness on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">We hold that the District Judge acted within his sound discretion in denying defendant\u2019s second motion for a continuance. In our view, defendant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed to him under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Mr. Richard S. Manning, a member of the Illinois Bar, served as court-appointed counsel in this appeal. The Court wishes to thank him for the very able and conscientious service which he rendered to his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
