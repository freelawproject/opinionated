The district court, in an opinion reported at 305 F.Supp. 581 (S.D.N.Y.1970), held Revlon liable for trademark infringement; granted a permanent injunction against Revlon\u2019s use of the mark \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d; held Revlon in contempt for having procured a stay of a preliminary injunction by fraud and for having violated this court\u2019s modification of that preliminary injunction; and awarded Bassett damages in the amount of its expenses in prosecuting the contempt or, alternatively, Revlon\u2019s profits made on sales after the preliminary injunction, whichever is higher. Revlon appeals from the foregoing part of the district court\u2019s decision. However, the district court also denied Bassett\u2019s claim for an accounting of all of Revlon\u2019s profits on the trimmers marked \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d; denied Bassett\u2019s claim for expenses in prosecuting the contempt in addition to, rather than as an alternative to, other damages; and referred the case to a master for a determination of the amount of Bassett\u2019s expenses in prosecuting the contempt and the amount of Revlon\u2019s profits after the preliminary injunction. Bassett appeals from this part of the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">We affirm the district court\u2019s decision insofar as it held Revlon liable for trademark infringement, granted a permanent injunction against the use of the name \u201cCuti-Trim,\u201d and held Revlon in contempt. But we reverse the denial of an accounting for all of Revlon\u2019s profits from the trimmers marked \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d and the denial of Bassett\u2019s claim for expenses in prosecuting the contempt in addition to the accounting; and we remand to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"A4I\">Plaintiff, the W. E. Bassett Company, is a leading manufacturer of manicuring implements. It sells its products under the basic trademark \u201cTrim\u201d and under other trademarks derived from the word trim (e. g. \u201cTrim-clip,\u201d \u201cTrim-pac,\u201d \u201cTrim-ette\u201d). \u201cTrim\u201d and the variants used by Bassett are the subjects of Patent Office registrations. Since 1947, Bassett has sold over 200,000,000 implements under its registered trademark \u201cTrim.\u201d To enhance sales, and specifically for advertising and promotion of the \u201cTrim\u201d mark, Bassett has spent over $1,100,000 since 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-16\">Defendant, Revlon, is a well-known manufacturer of beauty care and other products, including a full line of cosmetics and manicuring articles. Its products are sold under its trademark and name \u201cRevlon.\u201d In the manicuring-implements field Bassett and Revlon are direct competitors. Although Revlon has substantial manufacturing facilities of its own, a large staff of trained personnel, and widespread warehousing facilities, it made unsuccessful efforts before the institution of this suit to acquire the business, including trademarks, of the Bassett Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>In January 1965, Revlon placed on the market a cuticle trimmer designated \u201cCuti-Trim,\u201d and sold it in packages bearing the legend \u201cRevlon Cuti-Trim.\u201d On June 4, 1965, Bassett instituted this action for trademark infringement seeking a permanent injunction against Revlon\u2019s use of the name \u201cCuti-Trim.\u201d Shortly after bringing the action, Bassett moved for a preliminary injunction <em>pendente lite </em>against any further use by Revlon of the mark \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d or of any similar mark. On November 19, 1965, Judge Palmieri granted such a preliminary injunction, finding <em>inter alia </em>that Bassett\u2019s \u201cTrim\u201d mark was valid, that it had acquired secondary meaning through its exclusive and heavily advertised use over the course of 18 years, that Revlon adopted the mark \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d with full knowledge of Bassett\u2019s trademark rights and in disregard of the confusion and deception the \u201cCutiTrim\u201d mark would cause to the purchasing public and to consumers, and that there was reasonable cause to believe that Revlon had infringed and was infringing Bassett\u2019s \u201cTrim\u201d mark to the irreparable injury of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Revlon appealed that decision to this court, and petitioned this court for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal. On November 23, 1965, we granted a stay on the basis of an affidavit submitted by Revlon, stating that it had in its inventory over 80,000 fully assembled cuticle trimmers marked \u201cCuti-Trim,\u201d that it was impossible to eradicate the words \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d without mutilating the implements and thereby rendering them unsalable, and that therefore Revlon would sustain immediate and irreparable harm unless we granted the stay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 3, 1966, we affirmed the preliminary injunction, but modified it to permit Revlon to market its existing stock of \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d \u2014 the 80,000 implements which it had averred were fully assembled on November 19. W. E. Bassett Co. v. Revlon, Inc., 354 F.2d 868 (2d Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">At the trial Judge Frankel granted Bassett a permanent injunction, but denied it an accounting of all of Revlon\u2019s profits on the \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d trimmers. He also found that Revlon had procured the stay of the preliminary injunction by fraud and had violated our modification and hence was in contempt; and, as stated above, he awarded Bassett partial damages. By orders dated March 12, 1970, we granted both Bassett and Revlon leave to appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">Revlon\u2019s first claim on appeal is that it did not infringe Bassett\u2019s mark because that mark was not valid and worthy of protection, because there was no substantial likelihood of confusion between \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d and Bassett\u2019s marks, and because Bassett had unclean hands thus barring an equitable relief. Judge Frankel found to the contrary on each of these assertions, and there is substantial evidence to support his findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>The first question is whether Bassett\u2019s mark \u201cTrim\u201d is descriptive of the function performed by the implements or whether it is so distinctive that, on its face, it identifies the producer. If it is the latter, Bassett does not have to show that the mark acquired secondary meaning. As we stated in our previous opinion, however, \u201cTrim\u201d is a weak mark descriptive of the products\u2019 function and hence it can be protected only if it had acquired secondary meaning so as to identify the product with the producer. See Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Safeway Properties, Inc., 307 F.2d 495 (2d Cir. 1962); Triumph Hosiery Mills, Inc. v. Triumph International Corp., 308 F.2d 196 (2d Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">On the question of secondary meaning, Judge Frankel was persuaded by the fact that Bassett had pursued a course of steady promotion of its mark and by Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s statement that the effect of such activities is often \u201cto impregnate the atmosphere of the market with the drawing power of a congenial symbol.\u201d Mishawaka Rubber and Woolen Mfg. Co. v. S. S. Kresge Co., 316 U.S. 203, 205, 62 S.Ct. 1022, 1024, 86 L.Ed. 1381 (1942). He therefore concluded that it was more likely than not that Bassett\u2019s endeavors had enough effect \u2014 even if subconscious \u2014 on consumers to give \u201cTrim\u201d secondary meaning. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Revlon argues that this \u201cmore likely than not\u201d inference was not enough at trial, though it may have been enough for purposes of the preliminary injunction, and that Bassett failed to show at trial, as was necessary, that its attempt to establish secondary meaning had succeeded. In support of this contention, Revlon relies on Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 305 U.S. Ill, 59 S.Ct. 109, 83 L.Ed. 73 (1938); DuPont Cellophane Co. v. Waxed Products Co., 85 F.2d 75 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, E. I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co. v. Waxed Products Co., 299 U.S. 601, 57 S.Ct. 194, 81 L.Ed. 443 (1936); Donald F. Duncan, Inc. v. Royal Tops Mfg. Co., 343 F.2d 655 (7th Cir. 1965); General Time Instr. Corp. v. U. S. Time Corp., 165 F.2d 853 (2d Cir.), cert. denied 334 U.S. 846, 68 S.Ct. 1515, 92 L.Ed. 1770 (1948); and similar eases. But those eases can be distinguished from the instant case because they dealt with terms like \u201cShredded Wheat\u201d or \u201cCellophane,\u201d which are generic, whereas \u201cTrim,\u201d while descriptive, is not generic. Since generic marks are the actual names of the products themselves, it is necessary for the producer to show that he actually succeeded in associating the term with the source in the public\u2019s mind. But when the term is not generic but merely descriptive, an inference of secondary meaning, properly supported, seems to be enough. See Armstrong Paint &amp; Varnish Works v. Nu-Enamel Corp., 305 U.S. 315, 59 S.Ct. 191, 83 L.Ed. 195 (1938); Maternally Yours, Inc. v. Your Maternity Shop, Inc., 234 F.2d 538 (2d Cir. 1956); Spice Islands Co. v. Spice Land Products, Inc., 262 F.2d 356 (2d Cir. 1959); Miss Universe, Inc. v. Patricelli, 408 F.2d 506 (2d Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">Revlon also argues that third-party uses of \u201cTrim\u201d and related marks diluted Bassett\u2019s exclusive use and impaired the demonstration of secondary meaning. However, the third-party products cited by Revlon range from very different to slightly different products from Bassett\u2019s, most of the third-party products have names slightly different from Bassett\u2019s, or else the third-parties did not promote their \u201ctrim\u201d name with as much effort and money as Bassett did. Hence, there is ample evidence to support Judge Frankel\u2019s inference that Bassett\u2019s \u201cTrim\u201d mark had attained secondary meaning, especially in view of the patent office\u2019s registration of that mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\"> Revlon\u2019s second contention is that it did not infringe Bassett\u2019s mark because there was no substantial likelihood of confusion between \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d and Bassett\u2019s marks. Judge Frankel found that there was likelihood of confusion because \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d was too similar to Bassett\u2019s mark, and again we\u2019 agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">Revlon relies on the fact that there is no evidence of actual confusion, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Bassett does not now sell a cuticle trimmer, and that Revlon always displayed its famous name along with \u201cCutiTrim.\u201d But, as the district court stated, a showing of actual confusion is not necessary and in fact is very difficult to demonstrate. See Miss Universe, Inc. v. Patricelli, supra; Maternally Yours, Inc. v. Your Maternity Shop, Inc., supra. Here there is certainly the <em>likelihood </em>of confusion between two names that are so similar. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the patent office twice refused to register Revlon\u2019s \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d name, thereby indicating that it felt that there might well be confusion. As we said in our previous opinion, even though Bassett does not now produce a cuticle trimmer, it and Revlon are in direct competition in the manicure field and Bassett should not be hindered in its likely endeavor to market a cuticle trimmer under the \u201cTrim\u201d mark because Revlon has previously established an identity with that mai'k as to this item. Finally, Revlon\u2019s reliance on the fact that it uses its well-known name along with \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d is misplaced. As Judge Frankel stated, this tactic could well show that Revlon was seeking \u2014 as it evidently did when it undertook to buy Bassett\u2019s business\u2014 to couple the benefits of the \u201cTrim\u201d mark with the persuasive powers of its own name, and thus the tactic could not ensure against, but might indeed promote, confusion. Cf. Armstrong Co. v. Nu-Enamel Corp., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Judge Frankel found further that Revlon intentionally and fraudulently infringed Bassett\u2019s mark. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">Revlon\u2019s actions and contentions are surrounded by an aura of indifference to plaintiff\u2019s rights and a smug willingness to determine unilaterally that the good will plaintiff had sought to foster could safely be treated as a nullity. These elements amount to a species of bad faith and wrongful intent. Defendant, deliberately and unnecessarily duplicating plaintiff's mark, acted in a way that was calculated to appropriate or otherwise benefit from the good will plaintiff had nurtured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">We agree. Revlon\u2019s explanation of its selection of the name \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d has little credibility particularly in view of its attempt to buy Bassett\u2019s business; and Revlon used the name in the teeth of the patent office\u2019s refusal to register it. See Morgan v. Daniels, 153 U.S. 120, 14 S.Ct. 772, 38 L.Ed. 657 (1894); Miles Shoes, Inc. v. R. H. Macy Co., 199 F.2d 602 (2d Cir. 1952), cert. denied 345 U. S. 909, 73 S.Ct. 650, 97 L.Ed. 1345 (1953). Cf. Kiki Undies v. Promenade Hosiery Mills, 411 F.2d 1097 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. dismissed, 396 U.S. 1054, 90 S.Ct. 707, 24 L.Ed.2d 698 (1970). The argument that Revlon\u2019s use of its well-publicized name along with \u201cCutiTrim\u201d indicates a lack of deliberate fraud is specious, for, if accepted, it would allow any company that is well enough known, to infringe a competing company\u2019s mark, especially if the competitor is small, merely by coupling its own name with the competitor\u2019s mark. See Armstrong Co. v. Nu-Enamel Corp., <em>supra; </em>Miles Shoes, Inc. v. R. H. Macy &amp; Co., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Revlon\u2019s last contention in this area is that Bassett should not be granted trademark protection because it misrepresented the origin, source of manufacture, and composition of its products. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115(b) (3). Judge Frankel examined these contentions fully and found that Bassett\u2019s alleged false representations were not intended to deceive, were not likely to deceive, and were not shown to have deceived the public, and that in any event they were not sufficiently related to the claim in suit to bar relief. We see no reason to disturb these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Revlon\u2019s second claim on appeal is that the district court erred in holding it in contempt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">Judge Frankel found that Revlon made a substantial misrepresentation in applying to the court in November 1965 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>for a stay of the preliminary injunction, when it swore that it would be impossible to eradicate the words \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d on the 80,000 existing trimmers without making them unmarketable,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> whereas a memo from its own employee, Joseph Dobkins, a few days later, stated that this could be done.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Frankel found that the Dobkins memo accorded with the mechanical possibilities knowable to Revlon at the time. Revlon introduced much evidence to show that this was untrue and that the Dobkins memo was a mistake, but that evidence was rebutted by the testimony of Bassett\u2019s witness, Joseph Bordeau. Bordeau, who is in the metal plating, buffing, and polishing business, testified that Bassett had twice asked him to remove the \u201cCutiTrim\u201d name from Revlon\u2019s trimmers and that he had easily done so by buffing. Judge Frankel found Bordeau\u2019s refuting testimony credible, and we cannot say that his finding is clearly erroneous. At the very least, as Judge Frankel also pointed out, Revlon had the duty to call the memo to our attention before the appeal was heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Second, it is also clear that Revlon violated our modification of the preliminary injunction. We stated in our January 3, 1966 order that since Revlon averred on November 19, 1965 that it had 80,000 Cuti-Trim trimmers on hand which would be useless if buffed, we would permit it to market 80,000 additional trimmers, but would limit it to that amount to prevent Revlon from profiting from an inventory buildup during the stay.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Revlon interpreted this to mean that it could market 80,000 trimmers of the stock existing on January 3 and that those which it marketed during the stay period would not be counted. It bases its contention on our use of the words \u201cexisting\u201d and \u201cadditional,\u201d when we knew it could have sold its whole stock before January 3. Thus altogether Revlon sold 148,000 trimmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-16\">Revlon\u2019s interpretation of our order is wholly unjustified, if not a deliberate distortion. Since we referred in our modification to the November 19 affidavit that Revlon had 80,000 trimmers on hand, and since we declared that our purpose was to prevent Revlon from profiting from an inventory build-up during the stay, it is plain that we meant to allow Revlon to sell the 80,000 trimmers existing on November 19, and no more. Revlon\u2019s sale of 148,000 was a blatant violation of our modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Although Judge Frankel found that Revlon was liable for infringing Bassett\u2019s mark and although he granted a permanent injunction against Revlon\u2019s use of the name \u201cCuti-Trim,\u201d he denied Bassett\u2019s claim for a full accounting of all of Revlon\u2019s profits from its trimmers marked with the infringing name. Instead, he granted an accounting only of Revlon\u2019s profits after the preliminary injunction as an alternative remedy for Revlon\u2019s contempt. On cross-appeal Bassett contends that since Revlon was found guilty of deliberately and intentionally infringing its mark, it is entitled to an accounting of all of Revlon\u2019s profits from the sale of the infringing article. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">An accounting should be granted if the defendant is unjustly enriched, if the plaintiff sustained damages from the infringement, or if an accounting is necessary to deter a willful infringer from doing so again. Monsanto Chemical Co. v. Perfect Fit Products Co., 349 F.2d 389 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied 383 U.S. 942, 86 S.Ct. 1195, 16 L.Ed:2d 206 (1966); Dad\u2019s Root Beer Co. v. Doc\u2019s Beverages, Inc., 193 F.2d 77 (2d Cir. 1951); Maternally Yours, Inc. v. Your Maternity Shop, <em>supra,; </em>Mishawaka Rubber &amp; Woolen Mfg. Co. v. S. S. Kresge Co., <em>supra, </em>Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Bros. &amp; Co., 240 U.S. 251, 36 S.Ct. 269, 60 L.Ed. 629 (1916); Maier Brewing Co. v. Fleischmann Distilling Corp., 390 F.2d 117 (9th Cir. 1968), cert. denied 391 U.S. 966, 88 S.Ct. 2037, 20 L.Ed.2d 879 (1968). Revlon would be unjustly enriched here if its sales of the \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d implements were attributable to its infringing use of Bassett\u2019s name. On the record as a whole, however, it appears that Revlon\u2019s sales of \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d were not attributable to the infringement, since Bassett did not manufacture a cuticle trimmer during that period. Thus, there was no likelihood of immediate confusion; those who bought cuticle trimmers bought Revlon\u2019s not because of its use of Bassett\u2019s mark \u201cTrim,\u201d but because Revlon made one and Bassett did not. Similarly, Bassett could not have sustained monetary damages from the sale of the \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d articles since it did not sell a cuticle trimmer at the time; and it did not sustain damages in good will since Revlon\u2019s product was of high quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Nevertheless, Revlon was found to have deliberately and fraudulently infringed Bassett\u2019s mark; and as indicated above, we agree with that finding. Accordingly, a full accounting is proper as a deterrent (Monsanto Chemical Co. v. Perfect Fit Products Co., <em>supra) </em>; and since Judge Frankel did find deliberate infringement here, he should have granted Bassett an accounting for all of Revlon\u2019s profits on the \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d items, not just on those sold after the preliminary injunction. It is essential to deter companies from willfully infringing a competitor\u2019s mark, and the only way the courts can fashion a strong enough deterrent is to see to it that a company found guilty of willful infringement shall lose <em>all </em>its profits from its use of the infringing mark. See Monsanto Chemical Co. v. Perfect. Fit Products Co., <em>supra, </em>349 F.2d at 390. Rev-Ion\u2019s course of conduct over a period of years has demonstrated a callous disregard for the rights of a competitor and for the mandates of the federal courts; consequently it'is appropriate that we require it to make a full accounting. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s denial of a full accounting, and we remand to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">The final questions in this case concern the amount of damages that Revlon should be required to pay. Judge Frankel granted Bassett its expenses in prosecuting the contempt, including counsel fees, or, alternatively, damages in the amount of Revlon\u2019s unlawful profits after the preliminary injunction, whichever is higher. Bassett contends that it is entitled to both. We agree. The reason set out immediately above \u2014 the need to deter deliberate infringers \u2014 also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>indicates that we should allow Bassett its expenses in prosecuting the contempt <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in addition to the accounting for all of Revlon\u2019s profits on the \u201cCutiTrim\u201d items.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Judge Frankel referred to a master the question of the amount of Bassett\u2019s expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, in prosecuting the contempt and of the amount of Revlon\u2019s net profits on the sale of just the 148,000 infringing trimmers sold in violation of the preliminary injunction. The larger of these two amounts was to be payable to Bassett. Since the question of how much of Bassett\u2019s litigation expenses were attributable to its prosecution of the contempt and the reasonableness of those expenses involve factual determinations, the reference to a master was warranted. Of course, as we have stated, the master must now determine not only the amount of those expenses and the amount of Revlon\u2019s profits since the preliminary injunction, but also the amount of <em>all </em>of Revlon\u2019s profits from all of its sales of the \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d implements.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">In determining the amount of Revlon\u2019s profits, it will be necessary to decide whether to allow Revlon the deductions which it claims but which Bassett disputes: manufacturing overhead, five out of six operating expenses,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and federal income tax. And since these are questions of law, we must establish guidelines to govern that determination. The pattern used for the partial accounting can be used for the full accounting. Subject to a determination of the reasonableness of the claimed deductions, Revlon should be able to deduct from its net sales its overhead, most of its operating expenses, and the federal income taxes on the \u201cCuti-Trim\u201d items. The only one of the claimed deductions which Revlon should not be allowed is the overlabelling expense, because Revlon should have to bear the cost of correcting its own wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">We remand to the district court, directing it to order Revlon to make a full accounting of all of its profits from sales of the infringing items and to pay Bassett the amount of Bassett\u2019s expenses in prosecuting the contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Affirmed in part; reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-5\">.

Thus, it would become necessary to junk all of these 80,000 units since it is impossible to separate the, cutting head from the handle of the completed cuticle trimmer.
