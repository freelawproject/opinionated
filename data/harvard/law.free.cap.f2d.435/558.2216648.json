The Board\u2019s Supplemental Decision pursuant to the remand is reported at 181 N.L.R.B. No. 13. Pursuant to its Supplemental Decision, the Board affirmed its original order. This original order had already been ordered enforced by this Court, 396 F.2d 775 (6th Cir. 1968), however certiorari was granted and the case remanded, 395 U.S. 828, 89 S.Ct. 2125, 23 L.Ed.2d 737, with instructions to remand it to the Board for further consideration in light of N. L. R. B. v. Gissel Packing Company, 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">We have considered the entire record, the briefs and oral arguments of counsel and conclude that the original and supplemental findings of fact of the Board are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">The company\u2019s petition to review and set aside the Supplemental Decision of the Board must be denied and enforcement of the order of the Board must be granted. It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
