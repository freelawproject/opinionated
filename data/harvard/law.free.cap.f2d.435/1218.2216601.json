Appellants were and are California residents. Appellee at all material times has been a resident of South Dakota. Appellants received an order for substituted service on appellee. Appellee appeared specially and moved to quash. The motion was properly granted because appellee had no contacts at all with California. California\u2019s long-arm statute could not authorize constructive service upon the appellee. Therefore, Rule 4(d), Fed.R.Civ. Proc., granting to federal district courts the same long-arm powers enjoyed , by the courts of the states in which they sit, could not have authorized this substituted service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-22\">Appellants argue that, even if service could not be effected under Rule 4(d), service was proper under Rule 4(e). In pertinent part, Rule 4(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-23\">\u201cWhenever a statute of the United States or an order of court thereunder provides * * * service may be made under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed by the statute or order * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-24\">Appellants\u2019 theory is that Rule 4(e) gives the district court discretionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>power to order service of process anywhere in the nation and that the district court\u2019s issuance of its initial order for service was an appropriate exercise of that discretion, because appellants read Rule 4(e)\u2019s reference to \u201ca statute of the United States\u201d to include Rule 4(e) itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">We reject appellants\u2019 argument. Rule 4(e) is not a statute authorizing substituted service. It is simply a procedural rule, complementing those federal statutes extending <em>in personam, </em>jurisdiction of federal district courts beyond the geographical boundaries of their respective districts. Had the draftsmen of Rule 4(e) intended that rule to extend discretionary power to district courts to order substituted service nationwide, apart from any express statutory authority to do so, they would have stated that extraordinary power directly, not elliptically.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-9\">Appellants suggest that the district court should have transferred the action, rather than dismissing the complaint. Appellants did not seek a transfer in the district court. We perceive no error in the district court\u2019s failure <em>sua sponte </em>to transfer the action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
