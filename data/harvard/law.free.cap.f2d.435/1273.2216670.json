The Honorable John W. Reynolds, Judge, U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, is sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1354-10\">REYNOLDS, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1354-11\">Norman Slade Conrad appeals from the denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus which sought his release from the Army Reserve on the ground that the Army improperly denied him a discharge as a conscientious objector.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-12\">In September 1962, while a student at the University of Wisconsin, Conrad joined the ROTC. Two years later he became a member of the Army Reserve. In the spring of 1967, appellant began to develop the beliefs which later were to be the basis of his assertion of conscientious objection. By June 1968, the beliefs had reached such a stage of maturation that Conrad notified the Army that he claimed conscientious objector status. When the Army did not respond to this claim, Conrad sent a letter to the Army requesting discharge from the Army Reserve as a conscientious objector. The Department of the Army then furnished appellant with information concerning Army Regulation 135-25 (AR 135-25) which prescribes policies, criteria, and procedures governing the disposition of Reserve members of the Army who claim to be conscientious objectors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-19\">Conrad then made a formal application for discharge which set in motion the hearing and interview procedures specified in AR 135-25 and culminated in an Army Conscientious Objector Review Board recommending that the application be disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-20\">The review board found that Conrad\u2019s application for conscientious objection classification was founded on \u201cphilosophical views and a personal moral code\u201d and thus automatically disqualified Conrad from conscientious objector classification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On this basis alone the board felt compelled to recommend disapproval of the application. The board further found that Conrad\u2019s beliefs were \u201cthe philosophical views of an intelligent individual\u201d; were the product of \u201cmoral/philosophical maturation\u201d; and that they were of a \u201csociological/philosophical/personal/moral code nature.\u201d The board found that appellant\u2019s beliefs were \u201cpoorly grounded in religious training and belief\u201d and that Conrad did not establish that his beliefs stemmed from any \u201cadult religious training that would have altered his conscience and values.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>Based upon the findings and recommendation of the review board, the application was formally disapproved and the action below was commenced seeking Conrad\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">Appellant contends that the district court, in finding a basis in fact for the Army\u2019s denial of conscientious objector classification, applied the wrong standard in determining the question of whether or not appellant\u2019s beliefs entitled him to be classified as a conscientious objector.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-6\">The district court found \u201caffirmative evidence\u201d to support the review board\u2019s determination that Conrad\u2019s beliefs were such as to be grounds for automatic disqualification as a conscientious objector, <em>i. e., </em>they were founded on philosophical views and a personal moral code, and the court concluded that his beliefs were not \u201c \u2018based on religious training and belief\u2019 within the meaning of 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j) as enunciated in U. S. v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163 [85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733] * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-7\">The record demonstrates with clarity that the Army review board and the district court determined that Conrad was not to be granted conscientious objector classification because his beliefs were not based on \u201creligious\u201d training and belief, using the word \u201creligious\u201d in its traditional and formal sense, but rather that they developed from \u201cother stimuli.\u201d Conrad\u2019s beliefs were deemed to have arisen from philosophical and moral considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-8\">Conscientious objector status is to be afforded to any person \u201cwho, by reason of religious training and belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form.\u201d 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j). The Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase \u201creligious training and belief\u201d to embrace \u201c[a] sincere and meaningful belief which occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those admittedly qualifying for the exemption * * *. United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 176, 85 S.Ct. 850, 859, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965). More recently, and since the district court\u2019s decision in this matter, the Supreme Court has further elaborated on its interpretation of \u201creligious training and belief.\u201d Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970). There it was held that, under <em>Seeger, </em>all that is necessary for a person\u2019s conscientious objection to all war to be religious under 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j) \u201cis that this opposition to war stem from the registrant\u2019s moral, ethical, or religious beliefs about what is right and wrong and these beliefs be held with the strength of traditional religious convictions.\u201d Welsh v. United States, <em>supra, </em>at 340, 90 S.Ct at 1796.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-10\">The holding of the <em>Welsh </em>case requires reversal of the order entered by the district court since it appears that the order was based on the view that 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j) does not contemplate conscientious objection based on deeply held moral or ethical considerations but requires that it be based on more conventional religious training. United States v. Rink, 430 F.2d 647 (7th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-11\">The Government urges affirmance of the district court\u2019s order on the ground that Conrad\u2019s beliefs were not sincerely held. The district court made no finding with respect to the sincerity with which Conrad held his beliefs. The Army review board did not believe that \u201che was truthful or sincere in his stated religious beliefs.\u201d A fair interpretation of that finding, particularly in light of the board\u2019s determination that Conrad's beliefs were philosophical and moral in origin, would be that the board did not feel Conrad was sincere in ascribing a traditional religious foundation to the beliefs he held.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-12\">The order of the district court is reversed, and the case is remanded with directions to enter an order granting the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1354-15\">.
