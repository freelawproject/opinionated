He challenges the constitutionality of his state murder conviction on the ground that a written exculpatory statement, and oral statements made to a coroner, which were used to impeach his testimony at his state trial, were taken from him involuntarily in violation of due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">The essential elements of Walters\u2019 claim were that (1) his arrest was illegal; (2) at the time the statements were made, he had been confronted with evidence illegally seized from his car and apartment; (3) at the time the statements were made, he had been deprived of the assistance of counsel; (4) he had not been warned of his rights; (5) the statements were made after lengthy interrogation by the police; and (6) the petitioner only had four and one-half years of education.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">The district court carefully considered all of these allegations. In order to decide the question of voluntariness, Judge Blumenfeld held a hearing on April 21, 1969 at which Walters himself testified. Superintendent Walsh of the Bridgeport Police Department and Dominick Conti also testified. Both were lieutenants of detectives in 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">While there was conflicting testimony on some issues, such as whether Walters had requested an attorney during interrogation, there was ample evidence to support Judge Blumenfeld\u2019s findings of fact and his conclusion that Walters was free to speak or remain silent and that his statements, in which he sought to establish his innocence, were voluntarily made under the standards prevailing before Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964), Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) and Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
