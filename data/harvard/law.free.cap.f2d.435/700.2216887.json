Motions for a new trial and arrest of judgment were filed but later withdrawn. Gaines did not appeal his conviction and sentence. In March 1968 he filed a petition under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Hearing Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging therein that (1) he was denied effective assistance of counsel; (2) he was denied his right to appeal; (3) illegally seized evidence was adduced by the prosecution at his trial; and (4) perjured testimony was then given against him. The petition, following hearing, was denied on June 28, 1968 by the trial judge to whom it was presented; the Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed on November 1, 1968, 213 Pa.Super. 749, 246 A.2d 890 (1968), and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania denied allocatur on January 3, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">Gaines then filed a petition for habeas corpus relief in the District Court on February 20, 1969, alleging (1) denial of effective assistance of counsel at his trial; (2) introduction of illegally seized evidence at his trial; (3) his motions for a new trial were withdrawn without his approval; and (4) he was not informed of his right to appeal and his right to free counsel to prosecute his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-15\">The District Court, following two days of hearing, at which Gaines and his state trial counsel testified, denied Gaines\u2019 petition for habeas corpus relief, and the instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-16\">On review of the trial record and that below, and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs and oral argument, we are of the opinion that the District Court did not err in its findings that Gaines\u2019 \u201ctrial counsel was appointed sufficiently in advance of trial to thoroughly prepare relator\u2019s case, that he was in fact thoroughly prepared,\u201d' and that trial counsel\u2019s \u201crepresentation of relator at trial was in our opinion well informed and fully competent. * * * \u201d We are further of the opinion that the District Court correctly held that there was no merit to Gaines\u2019 contentions that he had not knowingly and voluntarily withdrawn his motions for a new trial and arrest of judgment and that he had not been advised of his right to appeal. We further agree with the District Court\u2019s holding that it was unnecessary to reach the issue of the introduction of allegedly illegally seized evidence because there was \u201cstrong affirmative evidence\u201d establishing Gaines\u2019 participation in the robbery charged, and the introduction of the alleged illegally seized evidence \u201ccontributed nothing material to the case against him,\u201d thus calling into play the doctrine that where it is clear \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained\u201d it does not afford a basis for habeas corpus relief.

Rundle, 417 F.2d 282, 283-284 (3 Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-17\">The Order of the District Court denying habeas corpus relief will be affirmed for the reasons so well stated by Judge Wood in his Opinion, 321 F.Supp. 189.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-18\">. 19 P.S.Annot. \u00a7 1180-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
