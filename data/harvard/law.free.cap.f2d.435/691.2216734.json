A hearing was held, with appellant present and represented by counsel. The record was forwarded to the Chief of Naval Personnel who sustained the action, as did the Secretary of the Navy. This action was brought in December 1967, seeking to have the district court direct the Secretary of the Navy to convene a court of inquiry \u201cor other appropriate hearing pursuant to U. S. Naval Regulations\u201d to investigate the circumstances surrounding his relief from command. Appellant remains in active Navy service.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">After reviewing the voluminous record, the district court concluded that the Navy\u2019s actions were internal, administrative matters involving the judgment of Naval Command concerning duty assignment and promotion under Vietnam War conditions, that the Navy acted in substantial conformance with regulations and well within the bounds of fundamental due process, and granted a motion for summary judgment of dismissal. Arnheiter v. Ignatius, 292 F.Supp. 911 (N.D.Cal.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">We affirm so much of the district court\u2019s opinion as holds that the federal courts have no jurisdiction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-12\">\u201c(J)udges are not given the task of running the Army. * * * The military constitutes a specialized community governed by a separate discipline from that of the civilian. Orderly government requires that the judiciary be as scrupulous not to interfere with legitimate Army matters as the Army must be scrupulous not to intervene in judicial matters.\u201d Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 93, 73 S.Ct. 534, 540, 97 L.Ed. 842.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-15\"><em>See also </em>E.
