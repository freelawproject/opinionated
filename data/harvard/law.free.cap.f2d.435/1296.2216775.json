The Board\u2019s decision is reported at 177 N.L.R.B. No. 65, 71 L.R.R.M. 1595 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-18\">The Board found that the Company violated Sections 8(a) (4) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act by discharging three employees for having met, and having given a written sworn statement to, a Board field examiner investigating unfair labor practice charges filed against Scrivener. The Board dismissed other charges alleging that Scrivener had violated Sections 8(a) (1), (3) and (5) of the Act, giving as a reason that Scrivener\u2019s operation did not meet the Board\u2019s discretionary jurisdictional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-19\">The principal question raised on this appeal is whether Section 8(a) (4) of the Act, which makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cto discharge * * * an employee because <em>he has filed charges or given testimony under this </em>[Act]\u201d is to be construed to encompass discharge of employees for giving written sworn statements to Board field examiners. This Court stated in N.L.R.B. v. Ritchie Mfg. Co., 354 F.2d 90 (8th Cir. 1966), that \u201cWe are reluctant to hold that \u00a7 8(a) (4) can be extended to cover preliminary preparations for giving testimony.\u201d This reluctance continues. We are particularly hesitant to overrule or distinguish <em>Ritchie </em>in a case where the Board\u2019s jurisdiction to act is marginal. Compare, Hoover Design Corporation v. N.L.R.B., 402 F.2d 987 (6th Cir. 1968); King Radio Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 398 F.2d 14 (10th Cir. 1968); Oil City Brass Works v. N.L.R.B., 357 F.2d 466 (5th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-20\">The National Labor Relations Board suggests that if we are unwilling to overrule or distinguish <em>Ritchie, </em>we can accomplish the same result by upholding the Board\u2019s finding that the discharges complained of violated Section 8(a) (1) as well as Section 8(a) (4) of the Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>We are unwilling to take this course. To do so would be to overrule <em>Ritchie </em>implicitly, and we \u00e1re not prepared to take that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-4\">We decline to enforce the order of the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
