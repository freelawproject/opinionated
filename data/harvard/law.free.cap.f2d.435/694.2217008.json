Skolnick and Jean MacDonald, acting pro se, filed a complaint in the district court seeking compliance by the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders and its chairman with the provisions of the public information section of the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (Supp. Y, 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-19\">Plaintiffs allege that the Commission wrongfully suppressed a report, \u201cThe Fruits of Racism,\u201d which had been submitted to it in the course of its investigations and that this suppression was violative of the duty imposed by Section 552(a) (3) which requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-20\">[E]ach agency [defined in \u00a7 551(a) as \u201ceach authority of the Government of the United States,\u201d with certain exceptions] * * '* shall make * * * [requested] records promptly available to any person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-21\">The complaint was dismissed on March 4, 1968 by the Executive Committee of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which ruled that \u201cthe complaint states no cause of action justiciable in this Court.\u201d Plaintiffs appeal from the order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-22\">Shortly after the complaint was filed and before its dismissal, the Commission filed its final report. The Government contends that by this act the Commission was automatically dissolved and that any suit then pending against it abated. We agree and therefore need not reach the Government\u2019s additional arguments that the Commission was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>a suable entity and, in any event, was not properly served with process.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The Commission was established by Executive Order 11365, 3 C.F.R. 310 (Supp.1967), which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">The Commission shall make an interim report as to its findings of fact not later than March 1, 1968, and shall present its final report and recommendations not later than one year from the date of this order [July 29, 1967]. It shall terminate upon presenting its final report and recommendations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">In its report, dated March 1, 1968, the Commission stated that a sense of urgency concerning the problems it had explored led it to \u201cconsolidate in this single report the interim and final reports called for by the President.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus pursuant to the terms of the order which created it, the Commission dissolved on March 1, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">We believe that our recent decision in Skolnick v. Parsons, 397 F.2d 523 (7th Cir. 1968), is determinative of the issues raised by plaintiffs. In <em>Parsons, </em>the plaintiff attempted to compel the President\u2019s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice to release a report which the Commission had allegedly suppressed. We there held that \u201cany mandamus type of action against [the Commission] abated when the Commission terminated.\u201d 397 F.2d at 525. It appears that in <em>Parsons </em>the complaint was not filed until after the termination of the Commission\u2019s existence while the complaint here was filed a few days prior to the Commission\u2019s dissolution. However, we placed no reliance on that fact in <em>Parsons, </em>but based our decision on reasons equally applicable to the instant situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\"><em>Parsons </em>requires that a pending suit, even if properly instituted against an existing governmental agency, abate when the agency dissolves without a successor assuming its powers and functions. On March 1, 1968, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders became <em>functus officio, </em>and no other governmental officer or authority was appointed to succeed to any of its duties. Consequently there would be no one against whom a decree requiring the production of the allegedly suppressed document could operate. We therefore hold that there is no available remedy and that the plaintiffs\u2019 suit abated on the dissolution of the Commission without a successor.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-13\">. <em>Sec </em>Skolnick v. Parsons, 397 F.2d 523, 525-26 (7th Cir. 1968), for a description of this committee and the manner in which it screens complaints submitted by pro se litigants. That case is dispositive of plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the procedure according to which the Executive Committee operates violates due process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b775-10\">.
