The sole issue presented on this appeal is whether she was denied the effective assistance of counsel following closing argument and during the period when the cause was under consideration by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-19\">The facts are that appellant\u2019s employed trial counsel was compelled to depart the trial due to the death of his father. Upon being advised of this turn in events, the court offered to declare a mistrial. Trial counsel determined to go forward through the closing arguments and arranged for the presence of other counsel during the further proceedings. Substitute counsel for appellant was present in the court room at all times during the further proceedings, and no prejudice to her is discernible. The contention of lack of effective counsel thus fails for want of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
