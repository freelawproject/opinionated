Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274) guilty plea is attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-33\">There is no allegation that he did not understand the consequences of his plea. And, he had competent trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-34\">The contention that his plea was coerced because there was a threat to use his wife as a witness is made. Assuming this would violate a privilege either he or his wife could claim, the answer is he had competent counsel, a state rule of evidence is involved, and we have held in Moss v. Craven, 9 Cir., 427 F.2d 139, that Boykin is not retroactive.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
