In our view, reliance here on Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476, on the facts of this ease, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-17\">Contentions that Molina was not represented by competent counselor are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-18\">The state failure to hold a pre-hearing reception on admissions of Molina and of his co-defendant is attacked. No such hearing was requested. This may have been trial strategy of able counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
