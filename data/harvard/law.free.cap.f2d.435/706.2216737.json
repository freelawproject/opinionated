Ruling that this exclusionary policy was not arbitrary or unreasonable, the district court granted a motion to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-26\">On this appeal, the parties agree that the challenged policy has been abandoned, although the plaintiff has not been admitted to the barbering course. The dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>continued policy was the only alleged wrong asserted in the complaint and considered by the district court. Thus, the controversy litigated in the district court is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Accordingly, the judgment will be vacated and the cause remanded to the district court for dismissal as moot, without prejudice to any other federally cognizable complaint the prisoner may have.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
