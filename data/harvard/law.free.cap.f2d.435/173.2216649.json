BISHOP, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. The FRANKLIN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b253-31\">No. 29791.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b253-32\">United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b253-34\">Dec. 10, 1970.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Alan B.

During and following the latter trial the insurer made unsuccessful motions for directed verdict, for new trial and for judgment n. o. v. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">It is conceded by appellant\u2019s counsel that the evidence at the last trial did not differ in any material particular from the evidence at the former trial which resulted in the last appeal. Nevertheless, we are urged to hold that the prior panel incorrectly determined the controlling legal principles and that this panel should reexamine those principles and reverse for entry of judgment for the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">The rule in this Circuit as to \u201claw of the case\u201d is fully explicated in Lincoln National Life Insurance Co. v. Roosth, 5 Cir. 1962, 306 F.2d 110, 113-114, head-notes 2-6 inclusive and supporting text. The guidelines established in that decision mandate an affirmance of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-12\">. Bishop v. Franklin Life Insurance Company, 5 Cir. 1969, 412 F.2d 949, reversing the lower court for granting Franklin\u2019s motion for directed verdict, and remanding for a new trial. We held there that jury issues were present (1) as to the materiality of misrepresentations by the insured as to his state of health contained in his application for insurance, and (2) as to the reliance the insurer placed upon such misrepresentations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
