The Commissioner had determined under \u00a7 482 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 482 (1954) (formerly \u00a7 45 of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code), that all of the income for those years of the Austin-Western Hemisphere Company (AWH) a subsidiary of AW, be reflected as the income of its parent, AW, for federal tax purposes. The district court found that the Commissioner\u2019s total reallocation of income was unreasonable, arbitrary and erroneous, and held that no part of AWH\u2019s income be allocated to AW. While we agree with the district court that the Commissioner\u2019s total re-allocation of income was erroneous, we believe some re-allocation is necessary. We remand this case to the district court to determine what part of AWH\u2019s income should be allocated to AW.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">From 1953 to 1955, AW manufactured heavy machinery and equipment (such as road graders, road rollers, hydraulic cranes and street sweepers), which it sold to distributors in the United States and foreign countries. The machines, valued from $16,000 to $20,000, were made to the specific order of the distributors, who in turn sold them to the ultimate users. The distributors developed the market and maintained contact with the customers by providing instructions, parts and service and demonstrating the machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">In 1952, AWH was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of AW. The initial capitalization was $5,000, and nothing more was invested in AWH. AWH was to act as a distributor of AW\u2019s products in the Western Hemisphere outside of the United States. The stated purpose of AWH\u2019s incorporation was to expand foreign trade for AW and to take advantage of tax benefits under \u00a7 921 and \u00a7 922 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921, 922 (1954) (formerly \u00a7\u00a7 109 and 26(i) of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code), which, imposes reduced tax rates on a corporation which qualifies as a Western Hemisphere Trade Corporation. In order to qualify as a Western Hemisphere Trade Corporation, a corporation must derive 95% of its gross income from sources outside of the United States and within the Western Hemisphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">AWH sold AW\u2019s machinery to the same 25 to 30 foreign distributors who, prior to AWH\u2019s creation, had bought directly from AW. AWH became responsible for filling orders and shipping the goods to the distributors. At the time of AWH\u2019s incorporation, AW notified its distributors that they would be dealing with AWH in the future, but that there would be no other change in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>terms and conditions of their sales relationship. AWH made no effort to seek additional distributors in its designated market, although it employed a Spanish speaking salesman who kept in contact with the distributors. AWH also sent some printed catalogues, circulars and other advertising material written in the Spanish language to the distributors, but the distributors themselves were primarily responsible for the advertising to their customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">AWH was officed in AW\u2019s building in Aurora, Illinois, and had no other office space or warehouse, and paid AW rent for the offices. AWH had no inventory of machines or parts other than those which were ordered by the distributors and in transit to them. Some AWH employees worked in its export department performing supervisory, clerical and sales duties, but this was the extent of AWH\u2019s separate work force. A number of employees worked jointly for AW and AWH in arranging for shipment and insurance, and in managing AWH\u2019s office in Aurora. AW paid the salaries of AWH's employees and did other administrative work for AWH.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">On October 8, 1952, AWH\u2019s Board of Directors passed a resolution in which it agreed to pay AW for the cost of the machinery plus \u201can amount equal to fifteen per cent (15%) of the cost price of products purchased by this corporation from Austin-Western Company * * * in payment for the furnishing of general administrative services by officers and employees of Austin-Western Company to this corporation.\u201d The 15% cost figure, which sought to represent the services performed by AW, was justified at trial on the basis of the average of AW\u2019s cost from 1948 to 1952. A study introduced at trial indicated that this 15% figure, which was AW\u2019s sole remuneration from AWH other than for AW's bare manufacturing costs, included 10% for general administrative services and 5% for profit to AW. The cost figure, against which the 15% was applied, represented AW\u2019s manufacturing costs only, and did not include the additional costs of marketing which AW charged to its other distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">From 1953 to 1955, AWH\u2019s net profit percentage (to cost) exceeded AW\u2019s net profit percentage and the consolidated net profit percentage for both AW and AWH. In 1953, AWH\u2019s net profit percentage was 12.9%, AW\u2019s percentage was 11.9%, and the consolidated net profit percentage was 12.1%; for 1954 and 1955 respectively, 9.5% and 9.8% represented the net profit percentage for AWH, 8.5% and 2.5% for AW, and 8.-6% and 3.2% for both AW and AWH in the consolidated net figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The Commissioner, under \u00a7 482, ruled that all of AWH\u2019s net income should be allocated to AW. Section 482 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">In any case of two or more organizations, trades, or businesses (whether or not incorporated, whether or not organized in the United States, and whether or not affiliated) owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests, the Secretary or his delegate may distribute, apportion, or allocate gross income, deductions, credits, or allowances between or among such organizations, trades, or businesses, if he determines that such distribution, apportionment, or allocation is necessary in order to prevent evasion of taxes or clearly to reflect the income of any of such organizations, trades, or businesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">The district court decided that the net income of AW on its sales to AWH, was clearly reflected on AW\u2019s returns and that the Commissioner had acted unreasonably and arbitrarily in allocating all of AWH\u2019s net income to AW. It also held that no apportionment between AW and AWH was necessary under \u00a7 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">The practical advantage of inflating AWH\u2019s income is obvious. Since it was a Western Hemisphere Trade Corporation, its income was taxed at a rate substantially lower than that of AW. The corporations between them, would pay less taxes if more income were attributed to AWH.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Taxpayer argues that since AWH was a valid Western Hemisphere Trade Corporation and entitled to take advantage of the tax benefits under \u00a7 922, the Commissioner cannot use \u00a7 482 to strip it of its favored tax treatment. The creation of a corporation in order to obtain tax'benefits is a valid business purpose and cannot constitute evasion of taxes. Nevertheless, Western Hemisphere Trade Corporations are not immune from \u00a7 482.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\">If Congress had intended to make * * * [\u00a7 482] * * * inapplicable to Western Hemisphere trade corporations, it would have been very simple to have said so at the time the original Western Hemisphere trade corporation provisions were enacted. Eli Lilly &amp; Company v. United States, 372 F.2d 990, 1001, 178 Ct.Cl. 666, (1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Even if the creation of a Western Hemisphere Trade Corporation, such as AWH, was not for the purpose of tax avoidance, the sales transactions and pricing policies between it and AW are subject to \u00a7 482 inquiry. The income of each company must be \u201cclearly reflected\u201d for tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Taxpayer\u2019s reliance on W. Braun Co. v. C.I.R., 396 F.2d 264 (2d Cir. 1968), is misplaced. <em>Braun </em>merely holds that the creation of a corporation to take advantage of the tax laws does not constitute evasion of taxes under \u00a7 482. It does not decide that \u00a7 482 is inapplicable if the income of a validly created corporation, such as AWH, is not clearly reflected <em>vis-\u00e1-vis </em>its parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The evil to which \u00a7 482 addresses itself is the \u201c* * * improper \u2018milking\u2019 of one business for the benefit of the other, * * Simon J. Murphy Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Rev., 231 F.2d 639, 644 (6th Cir. 1956). See Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation, vol. 7, \u00a7 38.61 <em>et seq. </em>As the Third Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">Whenever the lack of an arm\u2019s length relationship produces a different economic result from that which would ensue in the case of two uncontrolled taxpayers dealing at arm\u2019s length, the Commissioner is authorized to allocate gross income and deductions. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Chelsea Products, Inc., 197 F.2d 620, 623 (3d Cir. 1952).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">The test which the Commissioner followed is whether the controlled taxpayers would have realized the same income from \"their sales transactions if they had conducted them at arm\u2019s length. Local Finance Corp. v. C.I.R., 407 F.2d 629 (7th Cir. 1969); W. Braun Co. v. C.I.R., <em>supra; </em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Ach v. C.I.R., 358 F.2d 342 (6th Cir. 1966); Cohen v. C.I.R., 266 F.2d 5 (9th Cir. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">The Commissioner decided that the inter-organizational sales between AW and AWH reflected on their tax returns presented an inaccurate portrait of their respective income. For this reason, he re-allocated the income between the companies under \u00a7 482 in order to place AWH on a parity with the other distributors of AW\u2019s products.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">Taxpayer bears the burden in this refund suit to show that the Commissioner\u2019s re-allocation was arbitrary, and that the amounts shown on the tax returns were correct. Local Finance Corp. v. C.I.R., <em>supra; </em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Grenada Industries, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Rev., 17 T.C. 231, 259 (1951), aff\u2019d 202 F.2d 873 (5th Cir. 1953), cert. denied 346 U.S. 819, 74 S.Ct. 32, 98 L.Ed. 345 (1953). It advanced two theories in the district court to show that the AW-AWH sales transactions constituted an arm\u2019s length relationship, and that the Commissioner\u2019s total re-allocation was thus erroneous. First, it alleged that the 5% profit margin realized in the AWH resolution by AW represented the profit AW would have made in an arm\u2019s length sale to other distributors. Second, the actual profits AWH realized would have been the same if it were an uncontrolled domestic distributor of AW. While both theories indicate that a total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>re-allocation of income from AWH to AW by the Commissioner was erroneous, they also show that some re-allocation was necessary. The district court did not critically examine these theories and make a finding that partial re-allocation was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The 115% cost theory fails to demonstrate that the income of AW and AWH was clearly reflected by AW. The 115% figure was based on AW\u2019s costs of production to independent distributors from 1948 to 1952. Using this cost figure, a 5% profit margin to AW was reached. Yet, AW\u2019s actual profit margin for those same years, 1948 to 1952, exceeded 5% and were respectively 7.-05%, 9.38%, 10.2% and 10.51%. Thus, this study cannot be used to justify the arm\u2019s length test; according to its own terms, the study shows a discrepancy between the profit realized by AW from its independent distributors between 1948 and 1952, and from AWH, hypothesized as a 1948 to 1952 independent distributor for profit purposes. The deviations in the respective profit margins justify some re-allocation of income from AW to AWH.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Besides this, the cost against which the 115% is applied and the 5% profit margin derived is based on the costs of manufacturing only. The study of the cost from 1948 to 1952 used total cost of production, which is higher than manufacturing cost. \" If the total cost of production from 1952 to 1955 to AWH were used, the actual amount realized by AW from its sales to AWH would amount to a profit margin of less than 5%.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The second theory \u2014 treating AWH as an independent domestic distributor \u2014 rests on the assumption that the prices AWH paid would have been the same if it were an independent distributor. The fallacy of this theory is that AWH would not have been entitled to the discounts which the study gave it. Without the discounts, AWH\u2019s costs would be higher and its profit lower. To give to AWH certain discounts which it would not have received as an independent and uncontrolled distributor is not a proper application of the arm\u2019s length standard here.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The Kegular Distributor Discount of 22.5% was given to AWH when it was entitled only to a 17.5% discount. The 22.5% discount is given only to Class A distributors, which are classified as possessing financial strength and stocking a considerable amount of repair parts. AWH fails to meet these standards; its initial and only capitalization was a bare $5,000, and it did not stock parts. Since AWH could not claim the full 22.5% discount here, its costs would be higher, and its profits lower.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">AWH was also given the Prompt Payment Discount in this hypothetical pricing study used to justify the prices charged by AW. Independent distributors were given this discount if they paid cash by the tenth day of the month following the date of invoice. Yet, AWH paid its bills by this day of the month on only 20 of the 36 occasions. This fact was not reflected in the hypothetical study.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">Further, the Selling and Advertising Expenses Discount given to AWH did not take into account the fact that AW participated to some extent in the advertising for which AWH would have been responsible as an independent distributor. With respect to the Quantity and Middleman Discount given to AWH, there is evidence that AW did not actually give this discount to its other distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">Taxpayer argues that if AWH were not given the discounts, it could make no profit in its sales to its customer-distributors. In a case where AWH\u2019s distributors would be entitled to the discounts but AWH would not, AWH could make no profit since AWH would have to buy from AW at a price higher than that at which it would sell to its distributors. Yet, the fact that AWH would make no profit should not be a consideration in applying the arm\u2019s length test.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">In both studies, the scales were tipped in the taxpayer\u2019s favor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>The analogy between AWH and the independent distributor, which must form the basis for application of the arm\u2019s length standard to this case, contained misleading assumptions and was highly biased in favor of the taxpayer. These studies likewise indicate, however, that AWH did realize some income in its sales from AW. Thus, the Commissioner\u2019s total re-allocation under both theories advanced by the taxpayer was erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm that part of the district court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Yet, when AWH is placed on a parity with AW\u2019s other distributors, it is clear that its income would be reduced and AW\u2019s increased. We thus remand this portion of the case to the district court for a determination of partial re-allocation. The district court has the power to decide what portion of AWH\u2019s income should be re-allocated to AW. W. Braun Co. v. C.I.R., <em>supra; </em>Ach v. C.I.R., <em>supra. </em>The court may base its decision on either of the two theories advanced by the taxpayer, but should reject those aspects of the theories which do not meet the arm\u2019s length standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Affirmed in part, reversed and remanded in part, with instructions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
