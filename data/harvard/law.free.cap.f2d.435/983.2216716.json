We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-25\">Plaintiffs-appellees, Alvin J. Hollman and Howard B. Blakely, are veterans who were employed by defendant-appellant Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Division of United Aircraft Corporation (Pratt &amp; Whitney) prior to their entry into military service. Hollman began working for Pratt &amp; Whitney in 1960 and continued in that employment until December 4, 1964, when he left his position to serve in the armed forces. Upon his release from active duty Hollman applied for reinstatement and was re-em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>ployed by the company on November 29, 1966. Similarly, Blakely entered Pratt &amp; Whitney\u2019s employ in 1961 and remained there until March 6, 1964, when he was summoned to military service. After satisfactorily completing his tour of duty, Blakely applied for reinstatement and was remployed on March 22, 1966.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">At the completion of the 1966 work year, Hollman received $20.83 in vacation pay based on his gross earnings from November 29, 1966 through December 31, 1966. At the same time Blakely received $192.93 in vacation pay based on his gross earnings from March 22, 1966 through December 31, 1966. Both employees asserted that they were entitled to additional vacation pay for 1966 for the portion of the year they spent in military service and to vacation pay for 1964 and 1965. The applicable bargaining agreements<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and company rules to which appellees were subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>stated that to be entitled to vacation pay an employee (1) must have been continuously and actively employed for at least six months prior to December 31 of the eligibility year (the year in which the vacation is earned); (2) must have been on the active payroll on December 31 of the eligibility year or, if he were on leave of absence, furlough or in the military service on December 31 of the eligibility yeax; must have returned to appellant\u2019s active payroll and employ before December 31 of the year immediately following the eligibility year;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (3) must have had gross earnings<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> during the eligibility year to which to apply certain set percentages to arrive at the proper compensation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">In accordance with these guidelines Pratt &amp; Whitney refused appellees any vacation pay for 1964 \u2014 even though they had gross earnings during the year \u2014 inasmuch as they were not on the active payroll as of December 31, 1964 and did not return to the company\u2019s active payroll and employ during 1965. In addition, since appellees were not on the active payroll as of December 31, 1965 and had no gross earnings during that year, they received no vacation pay for 1965. Both employees were on the active payroll as of December 31, 1966, however, and thus were awarded vacation pay for 1966 based on their actual gross earnings during that year. In response to Pratt &amp; Whitney\u2019s determination to award them no fux\u2019ther vacation pay, Hollman and Blakely filed this action in district court, alleging that the company\u2019s policy deprived them of their rights under Section 9 of the Universal Military Training and Service Act. The district court, though rejecting appellees\u2019 claims for vacation pay for 1965 and the portions of 1964 and 1966 that they spent in military service, held that under Ea-gar v. Magma Copper Co., 389 U.S. 323, 88 S.Ct. 503, 19 L.Ed.2d 557 (1967), appellees were entitled to vacation pay for 1964 based on their actual gross earnings during that year. Accordingly, the court awarded Hollman $206.77 and Blakely $45.53, with interest at six percent from date of judgment. The sole question before the Court in this appeal by Pratt &amp; Whitney is whether the trial court erred in granting vacation pay for 1964.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-12\">At the heart of this controversy is Section 9 of the Universal Military Training and Seiwice Act, the pertinent provisions of which follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-13\">(a) Any person inducted into the armed forces under this title * * * for training and service, who, in the judgment of those in authority over him, satisfactorily completes his period of training and service * * * shall be entitled to a certificate to that effect upon the completion of such period of tx*aining and service, which shall include a record of any special proficiency or merit attained. * -X- -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-15\">(b) In the case of any such person who, in order to perform such training and service, has left or leaves a position (other than a temporary position) in the employ of any employer and who (1) receives such certificate, and (2) makes application for reemployment within 90 days after he is relieved from such training and service or from hospitalization continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>after discharge for a period of not more than one year\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-4\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-5\">(B) if such position was in the employ of a private employer, such person shall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-6\">(i) if still qualified to perform the duties of such position, be restored by such employer or his successor in interest to such position or to a position of like seniority, status, and pay; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-7\">(ii) if not qualified to perform the duties of such position by reason of disability sustained during such service but qualified to perform the duties of any other position in the employ of such employer or his successor in interest, be restored by such employer or his successor in interest to such other position the duties of which he is qualified to perform as will provide him like seniority, status, and pay, or the nearest approximation thereof consistent with the circumstances in his case, unless the employer\u2019s circumstances have so changed as to make it impossible or unreasonable to do so * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-9\">(c) (1) Any person who is restored to a position in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b) [of this section] shall be considered as having been on furlough or leave of absence during his period of training and service in the armed forces, shall be so restored without loss of seniority, shall be entitled to participate in insurance or other benefits offered by the employer pursuant to established rules and practices relating to employees on furlough or leave of absence in effect with the employer at the time such person was inducted into such forces, and shall not be discharged from such position without cause within one year after such restoration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-11\">(2) It is declared to be the sense of the Congress that any person who is restored to a position in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b) [of this section] should be so restored in such manner as to give him such status in his employment as he would have enjoyed if he had continued in such employment continuously from the time of his entering the armed forces until the time of his restoration to such employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-12\">Pratt &amp; Whitney argue that vacation pay is an \u201cother benefit\u201d under Section 459(c) (1) of the Act and assert that a veteran\u2019s entitlement to vacation pay therefore is limited by the statute to those rights \u201coffered by the employer pursuant to established rules and practices relating to employees on furlough or leave of absence.\u201d Under appellant\u2019s analysis of the Act, an employer who denies a returning veteran vacation pay has not infringed upon his rights so long as he has treated the veteran precisely the same as he would have treated an employee on furlough or leave of absence for the same period of time that the returning veteran was in the service. Since under the applicable bargaining agreement and Pratt &amp; Whitney\u2019s rules and procedures an employee on furlough or leave of absence for the period that Hollman and Blakely were in the military service would have received no vacation pay for 1964, appellant asserts it follows as a matter of law that appellees were not entitled to vacation pay for 1964 and that the district court thus erred in granting it to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-13\">This proffered path, however, was barricaded by the Supreme Court in Eagar v. Magma Copper Co., <em>supra, </em>which was decided per curiam on the authority of Accardi v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 383 U.S. 225, 86 S.Ct. 768, 15 L.Ed.2d 717 (1966).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Accardi </em>arose out of a tugboat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>fireman\u2019s assertion that his employer was required by what is now Section 9 of the Act<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to include his years in the armed forces in calculating his separation allowance, which increased in proportion to the length of time an employee had rendered \u201ccompensated service.\u201d The Second Circuit<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> read the statute as distinguishing between rights flowing from \u201cseniority\u201d and \u201cfringe benefits.\u201d With regard to seniority rights, the Court held that veterans were entitled to' be treated as if they had not left their civilian employment. \u201cFringe benefits,\u201d in the Court\u2019s view, were governed by the clause of Section 9(c) (1) dealing with \u201cinsurance or other benefits,\u201d which placed the returning veterans in no better position than an employee furloughed or on leave of absence for non-military reasons. Since the applicable bargaining agreement did not treat time spent by employees on furlough or leave of absence as \u201ccompensated service,\u201d the Second Circuit denied Aeeardi credit for his military service years. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that Congress intended the Act \u201c* * * to preserve for the returning veterans the rights and benefits which would have automatically accrued to them had they remained in private employment rather than responding to the call of their country,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> without regard to the label that might be placed upon a particular employment benefit. The Court expressly rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cinsurance or other benefits\u201d clause, holding that the clause was \u201c* * * intended to add certain protections to the veteran and not to take away those which are granted him by [9(b) (B)].\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-10\">In the subsequent case of <em>Magma Copper, </em>a collective bargaining agreement provided for paid vacations at the end of a work year to any employee who had been employed for at least one year and had worked seventy-five percent of the shifts available to him that year. The agreement also provided for holiday pay to those employees who worked the shifts immediately preceding and immediately subsequent to the holiday and who had been on the payroll for three consecutive months prior to the holiday. The agreement specifically stipulated that \u201cany employee leaving the service of the company for any reason (except lay-off due to reduction of work force) before his annual determinative date shall not be entitled to a vacation or vacation pay in lieu therecf. * * *\u201d Eagar left the company\u2019s employ one week before his annual determinative date to enter military service.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>satisfactorily completing his tour of duty, Eagar was reemployed by Magma Copper. Although he had worked severity-five percent of the shifts for the year ending March 12, 1959 and had worked the shifts both before and after Memorial Day and Independence Day in 1962, the company refused his claims for vacation pay for those periods because (1) as to vacation pay, he was not in the service of the company at the end of the vacation earning year as required by the contract, and (2) as to holiday pay, he had not been on the company payroll for three consecutive months prior to either holiday. The Ninth Circuit<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> sustained the company\u2019s determination of the vacation pay and holiday pay, reasoning that vacation rights are not \u201cseniority, status, and pay\u201d but fall under the heading of \u201cother benefits,\u201d with the consequence that returning veterans are entitled to them only where non-veterans on furlough or leave of absence would be entitled to them. In a per curiam opinion the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit on the authority of <em>Aeeardi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">We regard <em>Magma Copper </em>as determinative of the case at bar. In 1964 both Hollman and Blakely had been in the employ of appellant for more than six months, and both had actual gross earnings during that year. It is therefore evident \u2014 indeed, it was stipulated \u2014 that appellees, like Eagar, were denied vacation pay for 1964 for the sole reason that they were not on appellant\u2019s active payroll at the end of the work year, an absence necessitated by service to their country. To approve the denial of vacation pay in these circumstances would be to reject the teachings of <em>Magma Copper </em>and the basic principle that \u201c* * * he who is \u2018called to the colors is not to be penalized on his return by reason of his absence from his civilian job,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> a step we chose not to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">Pratt &amp; Whitney argues that had appellees remained in the company\u2019s employ instead of entering military service, there is no assurance they would have received vacation pay for 1964, since they might have been absent on furlough or leave of absence on December 31, 1964, or they might have left the company\u2019s employ completely prior to that date. This argument will not stand the bright light of inspection. Under appellant\u2019s analysis, similar contingencies could have defeated the veteran\u2019s rights in <em>Magma Copper, </em>since an employee who, for any reason, left the company before his anniversary year date received no vacation pay for, that year. The Supreme Court has made clear, however, that \u201cIn light of the purpose and history of this statute, * * * we cannot assume that Congress intended possibilities of this sort to defeat the veteran\u2019s seniority rights.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-11\">Pratt &amp; Whitney also asserts that Dugger v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, 276 F.Supp. 496 (S.D.Tex. 1957), affirmed 5th Cir. 1969, 403 F.2d 719, certiorari denied, 395 U.S. 907, 89 S.Ct. 1752, 23 L.Ed.2d 222 (1969)' compels the conclusion that the district court committed error in awarding appellees vacation pay for 1964. We disagree. In <em>Dugger, </em>unlike the instant case, the company did not require employees to be on the active payroll at the end of the work year to be eligible for vacation pay. Dugger performed enough compensated service in 1963 to earn a paid vacation in 1964 and received the pay even though he entered the military service prior to the close of the 1963 work year. Thus the precise question before this Court was not at issue in <em>Dugger. </em>It is true that in <em>Dugger </em>the Court approved the result reached by the district court in its refusal to grant the employee vacation pay for 1964 and 1965, the years following induction in which the number of days of \u201ccompensated service\u201d that the employee performed for the company numbered 0 to 85, respectively, and in which the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>ployee had received sixty days paid vacation from the Government.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We do not believe, however, that the Court\u2019s approval of that result is inconsistent with our determination in the instant case; appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Dugger </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-4\">In these times of relatively high wages and steep income taxes, unions bargain vigorously for indirect compensation in the form of a host of diverse benefits.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Whether the benefits are elements of \u201cseniority\u201d or \u201cother benefits,\u201d the veteran\u2019s stake in them must be protected if they would automatically accrue to him but for induction. Clearly, the exclusion of veterans from benefits that have come to be regarded as essential perquisites of employment is inconsistent with the Universal Military Training and Service Act. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1063-26\">. 62 Stal. 614, as amended, 50 U.S.C.War Appendix \u00a7 459.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">.

At the time the Supreme Court decided <em>Accardi </em>and <em>Magma Copper, </em>a conflict existed among courts of appeals concerning the \u201cother benefits\u201d clause. It had been held, on the one hand, that vacation pay came within the statutory protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>of \u201cseniority, status, and pay.\u201d <em>See </em>Mentzel v. Diamond, 3rd Cir. 1948, 167 F.2d 299; MacLaughlin v. Union Switch &amp; Signal Co., 3rd Cir. 1948, 166 F.2d 46. On the other hand, certain courts of appeals had ruled that vacation rights were \u201cother benefits,\u201d which were governed by the employer\u2019s rules relating to employees on leave of absence or furlough. <em>See, e. g., </em>Dwyer v. Crosby Co., 2d Civ. 1948, 167 F.2d 567; Siaskiewicz v. General Electric Co., 2d Cir. 1948, 166 F.2d 463; Foster v. General Motors Corp., 7th Cir. 1951, 191 F.2d 907; Brown v. Watt Car &amp; Wheel Co., 6th Cir. 1950, 182 F.2d 570. In light of <em>Accardi </em>and <em>Magma Copper </em>a broader view of the statute has been taken. <em>See </em>Edwards v. Clinchfield Railroad Co., 6th Cir. 1969, 408 F.2d 5; Morton v. Gulf Mobile &amp; Ohio Railroad Co., 8th Cir. 1969, 405 F.2d 415.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">.

Dugger was entitled to thirty days paid vacation each year he was in the service. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 701.

Double pay clearly would not have accrued to Dugger had he remained in private employment, a notable distinction between <em>Dugger </em>and the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"A4b\">.
