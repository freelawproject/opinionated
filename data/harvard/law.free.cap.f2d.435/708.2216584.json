We agree with the district court that the allegations and proffered showing on the issue of racial discrimination in jury selection are inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-25\">The appellant also says that the district court committed reversible error in refusing to treat a letter received from him while this proceeding was pending as an enlarging amendment of his motion. However, that letter merely asked the court to reconsider its denial of an earlier petition. Neither the substance nor the form of the communication was such as to oblige the court to review its earlier decision in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-26\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
