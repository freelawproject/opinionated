The United States claims an interest in the land under the Washington statute,, R.C.W. 90.40.050, which if valid would relieve the United States of the duty to compensate the owner of the land, the State of Washington, for the taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-16\">The Honorable Charles L. Powell, after a documentary trial to him in the district court, held that the state statute under which the United States claimed its interest was invalid because it violated both the Federal Enabling Act, 25 Stal. 676 (1889), as amended, 47 S.tal. 150 (1932), and the Washington State Constitution, Art. XVI, \u00a7 1. Judge Powell concluded that the United States must pay for the interest it seeks to retain. We think Chief Judge Powell\u2019s determination was correct, and we affirm on the basis of his opinion which is printed in full in 293 P.Supp. 1042 (E.D.Wash. 1968).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
