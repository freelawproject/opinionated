The attorney who had represented Appellant at the preliminary examination was permitted to withdraw from the case and another attorney was appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-19\">On the first day of the trial, after several witnesses had been cross-examined, Appellant expressed dissatisfaction with the way in which he was being represented.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The next day in the trial judge\u2019s chambers an exchange took place with regard to Appellant\u2019s representation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMY\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * * Mr. Kates, Mr. Helm has come in and informed the Court that you are dissatisfied with his services, is this true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-20\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I thought that I let that be known yesterday in Court, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-21\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-22\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * * I have been in the legal profession for many, many years \u2014 and I have known Mr. Helm for many, many years.

Some two years following his sentence Appellant began filing a series of <em>error coram nobis </em>and <em>habeas corpus </em>petitions in various counties in the California judicial system, alleging essentially that he had been denied his right to counsel; these petitions were successively denied. On a previous habeas corpus petition filed in the United States District Court, an order issued holding that Appellant\u2019s claim respecting his right to counsel was premature in that he had not exhausted his state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-23\">The instant petition was filed on March 18, 1968; the district court, having considered all of the claims, found that there were no constitutional infirmities which would entitle Appellant to the relief sought and thus denied the petition. On this appeal Appellant contends that he has exhausted his state remedies and that he was deprived of his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel at the trial which resulted in his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-24\">In its order the district court did not discuss exhaustion of state remedies; nor do we regard the question as being material for the reason that the matters argued have substantially been before the state judiciary prior to the filing of the instant petition. Congress did not intend \u201cto require repetitious applications to state courts\u201d and we therefore decline to discuss exhaustion. See Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 449, n. 3, 73 S.Ct. 397, 403, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953); Roberts v. LaVallee, 389 U.S. 40, 42, 88 S.Ct. 194, 19 L.Ed.2d 41 (1967). See also, United States ex rel. Gockley v. Myers, 411 F.2d 216 (3rd Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-25\">Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), established the right of an indigent defendant in a state criminal trial to have the assistance of counsel. This Court, in Beasley v. Wilson, 370 F.2d 320, 322 (9th Cir. 1966), has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-26\">\u201cWhile the courts are bound to recognize and protect the right to counsel provided by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution, this right is not absolute in the sense that it may not be waived.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>Quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938), the Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-4\">\u201cA waiver is ordinarily an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege. The determination, of whether there has been an intelligent waiver of the right to counsel must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u201d 370 F.2d at 322.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">The above definition of waiver was reiterated in the recent case of Groves v. Prickett, 420 F.2d 1119, 1125 (9th Cir. 1970). To constitute a waiver the record or evidence must show that the accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer. Boy-kin v. Alabama, <em>395 </em>U.S. 238, 242, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U.S. 506, 516, 82 S.Ct. 884, 8 L.Ed.2d 70 (1962). The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in McConnell v. United States, 375 F.2d 905, 910 (5th Cir. 1967), laid down the following guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-6\">\u201cIn determining whether there is a competent, informed and intelligent waiver, the judge before whom an accused appears without counsel is charged with a serious responsibility that cannot be perfunctorily performed. * * * All reasonable presumptions must be indulged against a waiver * * * and any waiver must clearly appear on, the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1168-7\">Here, the Appellant stated unequivocally that he no longer wished the services of his appointed counsel. He further indicated to the court that he would refuse to cooperate if counsel were allowed to continue. Appellant, though he professed to be incapable of representing himself, attempted to excuse his conduct by insisting that his attorney was not handling the case properly. The record bespeaks of a simple disagreement between Appellant and his appointed counsel as to the manner in which the case was to be conducted. Appellant now is in no position to complain that he was forced to proceed without counsel, a situation for which he was intentionally and knowingly responsible. See United States v. Grow, 394 F.2d 182 (4th Cir. 1968), cert. den. 393 U.S. 840, 89 S.Ct. 118, 21 L.Ed.2d Ill. The Constitution does not force an unwanted attorney upon a defendant. Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942); Min- or v. United States, 375 F.2d 170, 172 (8th Cir. 1967), cert. den. 389 U.S. 882, 88 S.Ct. 131,19 L.Ed.2d 177.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-9\">\u201cIf the defendant does not agree with his counsel, he has a right to present his own contentions; but the sovereign is under no duty to search for counsel until it finds one who will agree with him.\u201d Jackson v. United States, 258 F.Supp. 175, 184 (D.C.N.D.Tex.1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqz\">And in Williams v. Beto, 354 F.2d 698, 705, 706 (5th Cir. 1966), involving a habeas attack upon the effectiveness of counsel, that Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-10\">\u201cWhen one seeks the assistance of counsel, he thereby confesses his own inadequacy in the field and stipulates his willingness, like any other client x- <em>* </em>to be bound by the presumably superior knowledge of the professional man on whose assistance he proposes to depend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-11\">\u201cHe agrees that this attorney will be in charge of his defense in the legal battle about to begin. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-12\">\u201cIf the indigent client, conferred upon and trusted to the lawyer, knows more about what ought to be done in handling the case, then he needs no counsel and it is folly for him to ask for it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuU4\">The case here is not unlike that of United States ex rel. Davis v. McMann, 386 F.2d 611, 618, 619 (2nd Cir. 1967), wherein that Court, quoting at length from the record, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-13\">\u201c[W]e have recognized a right of a defendant to proceed without counsel and to refuse the representation of assigned counsel. * * * [\u00b6] e may not use this right to play a \u2018cat and mouse\u2019 game with the court * * * or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>ruse or stratagem fraudulently seek to have the trial judge placed in a position where, in moving along the business of the court, the judge appears to be arbitrarily depriving the defendant of counsel. More particularly is this so when, during trial, the defendant discharges his counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1169-6\">While Appellant did not waive the entire California bar, he, knowing full well the nature of the charges against him and the enormity of the consequences if convicted, adamantly refused the further assistance of his appointed counsel, an able member of that bar. The record fully supports the district court\u2019s finding that Appellant was not deprived of his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel since he expressly waived such representation; the order denying Appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1165-24\">. Concluding the testimony of a State witness, Appellant interrupted the proceedings with the following outburst: \u201cYour Honor, I\u2019m not being represented properly * * */\u2019 Partial Transcript of Proceedings, January 28, 1964, p. 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
