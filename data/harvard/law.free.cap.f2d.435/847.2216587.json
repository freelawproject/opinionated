Plaintiff Hackman is the court-appointed \u201cguardian\u201d of the injured child. The present appeal has been taken from a judgment for the plaintiff, entered on a jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-27\">The only issues we find it necessary to consider are jurisdictional. Jurisdiction is based solely upon diversity of citizenship. All parties except the guardian admittedly are citizens of Pennsylvania. Neither in pleading nor in proof did the plaintiff guardian allege or establish his own domicile or citizenship. The complaint alleges no more than that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>the \u201caddress of Wesley Hackman is 1008 Ocean Avenue, Ocean City, New Jersey.\u201d At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case at trial the defendant moved for a directed verdict on the ground that jurisdiction had not been alleged or proved. The court at first peremptorily denied the motion, then granted a request by the plaintiff to reopen his case to prove jurisdiction, saying, \u201cWell, you only need ask one question. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Thereupon plaintiff\u2019s counsel recalled the infant plaintiff\u2019s father to the stand and elicited testimony that Wesley Hack-man was his son\u2019s \u201clegally appointed guardian for the purposes of this lawsuit\u201d and that \u201che resides in Ocean City, New Jersey.\u201d The court then cut short an effort of defense counsel to inquire further into facts relevant to jurisdiction saying, \u201cThere is only one issue before the court and that is the residence of the guardian. That is all. So confine your questions to thal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\"> Actually there were two issues and the guardian\u2019s \u201cresidence\u201d was neither. The first jurisdictional question was the citizenship or domicile of the guardian, as to which his New Jersey residence was relevant evidence but not in itself conclusive. Therefore, the court\u2019s refusal to permit defense counsel to inquire further into the matter was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Moreover, this case was tried after our decision in McSparran v. Weist, 1968, 402 F.2d 867, though the cause of action arose before that decision. Therefore, the district court, whether acting on motion or <em>sua sponte, </em>was obligated to determine whether diversity, if established, had been \u201cartificially\u201d created within the teaching of <em>McSparran </em>and, if so, whether the plaintiff would be unreasonably prejudiced or burdened by dismissal of the federal action and relegation to his state remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">The judgment will be vacated and the cause remanded to the district court for the taking of testimony and the making of appropriate findings and legal rulings upon the jurisdictional issues. We made no decision upon the non-jurisdictional contentions of the appellant, but the district court shall be free to reexamine them if it does not dismiss the case on jurisdictional grounds.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
