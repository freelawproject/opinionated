In the course of investigating the theft, two F.B.I. Agents went to defendant\u2019s home and upon questioning, he allegedly admitted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>he knew the wigs were stolen prior to purchasing them, having been apprised of that fact by the seller. It is this admission of knowledge which the defendant sought to have excluded from evidence by way of a pre-trial motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In compliance with the requirements of Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), the trial court ordered an evidentiary hearing, without the presence of the jury, to determine the voluntariness, <em>vel non, </em>of the defendant\u2019s oral statement. From that evidentiary hearing, the following facts appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Agents Sloan and Holloman of the F. F.I. arrived at the defendant\u2019s apartment between 9:00 and 9:30 A.M. Defendant\u2019s wife answered the door and the agents asked to see Mr. Littlepage. The defendant\u2019s wife went upstairs and awakened him and he subsequently came to the door. Sloan and Holloman identified themselves as Special Agents of the F.B.I. and stated that they wanted to ask the defendant a few questions. When queried by the defendant as to the nature of the questions, the agents stated that they wished to talk about some missing television sets and George Mc-Gann. The defendant was given a <em>Miranda </em>warning of his constitutional rights and he executed a waiver of rights form. There is some dispute whether the <em>Miranda </em>warning was given before or after the announced purpose of the questioning, but in view of our disposition the point is not material. From the defendant\u2019s own testimony at the evidentiary hearing, it clearly appears that he was fully advised of his constitutional rights, including the right to appointed counsel and that counsel\u2019s <em>presence </em>during interrogation. The defendant stated that he understood his constitutional rights as explained, that he was \u201cwilling to cooperate with the F. B.I.\u201d and that he had \u201cnothing to hide\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The interview of the defendant was conducted at a dining room table in defendant\u2019s apartment and lasted approximately one hour. It was during this time that the damaging admission was allegedly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">We have carefully examined the transcript of the pre-trial hearing and find it totally devoid of any facts or circumstances which would warrant the conclusion, or even the inference, that the defendant's questioning amounted to <em>custodial interrogation, </em>triggering the requirement of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">The defendant testified that he answered all questions freely, that he was not placed under arrest nor told that he would be arrested, and that no charges were pending against him. Bolstering the conclusion that his statement was voluntary was the defendant\u2019s subsequent voluntary appearance at F.B.I. offices the afternoon of the same day accompanied by one John Griffin Wright, whom the F.B.I. Agents had earlier inquired about. It seems quite clear that the questioning in the instant case was not accomplished while the defendant was \u201cin custody * * * or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 477, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1629, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). In a case recently decided by this court involving strikingly similar facts, we came to a like conclusion. United States v. Kershner, 432 F.2d 1066 (5th Cir. 1970). The record in the case at bar is barren of any facts indicating a coercive or compelling atmosphere, the defendant's conclusions to the contrary notwithstanding. See, United States v. Hall, 421 F.2d 540 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 990, 90 S.Ct. 1123, 25 L.Ed.2d 398 (1970). Having thus concluded that the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s questioning were not such as to require the giving of a <em>Miranda warning </em>and the statement made by the defendant was freely given by his own testimony, we need not pass upon the further allegation that defendant\u2019s waiver of rights was vitiated by asserted misrepresentations on the part of the F.B.I. Agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The alleged error of the trial court in failing to make findings of fact relating to the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statement is without merit. The undisputed and uncontradicted facts clearly demonstrate voluntariness and that determination is \u201cclearly evident\u201d and \u201cascertainable\u201d from the record, thereby negating the necessity of formal findings to that effect, Jackson v. Den-no, <em>supra, </em>at 378-379, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908; United States v. Harper, 432 F.2d 100 (5th Cir. 1970); United States v. Feinberg, 383 F.2d 60 (2d Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The defendant\u2019s further assertion that the wigs introduced into evidence were the fruit of an illegal search and seizure is likewise without merit. At the time the wigs were offered into evidence, defendant\u2019s counsel made no objection, nor could such an objection have been sustained for the wigs admitted at trial were not the same wigs which defendant claims were obtained as the result of an illegal search and seizure. The defendant\u2019s failure to object while cognizant of this fact is readily understandable.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The defendant lastly complains that it was error for the trial court to allow the government to impeach a material defense witness. Upon cross-examination of defense witness Russell Gilmore, the government attorney asked Gilmore if there was a complaint pending against him in the district court charging him with the same offense for which the defendant was being tried. Gilmore responded affirmatively without objection by defendant\u2019s counsel. As such, we may recognize only \u201cplain error\u201d on review. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). Having examined the record thoroughly, we conclude that the question propounded to the witness was proper cross-examination, as the government contends, to show hostility or bias. United States v. Dardi, 330 F.2d 316 (2d Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 845, 85 S.Ct. 50, 13 L.Ed.2d 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
