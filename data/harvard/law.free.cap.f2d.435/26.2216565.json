United States, 385 U.S. 372, 87 S.Ct. 533, 17 L.Ed.2d 428 (1966). On the second trial, the questioned evidence was excluded but appellant was again convicted. His conviction was affirmed by this court, United States v. Schipani, 414 F.2d 1262 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 922, 90 S.Ct. 902, 25 L.Ed.2d 102 (1970). Appellant was sentenced to three years imprisonment on each of the five counts of which he was convicted, the sentences to run concurrently. In addition, he was fined $2,500 on each count for a total of $12,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Appellant moved under Rule 35 of Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for a reduction of sentence. In denying this motion Judge Weinstein, who had presided at appellant\u2019s trial and had fixed the sentence, conceded that the prison sentence was \u201cfar longer than would be expected in a routine tax case,\u201d and stated that the primary reason for the severity of the sentence was the judge\u2019s conclusion that appellant was a \u201cprofessional criminal.\u201d The judge acknowledged that this conclusion was based on information obtained from the excluded wiretaps which established, the judge said, that defendant was \u201ca criminal figure, and that his undeclared income was the proceeds of organized crime.\u201d Judge Weinstein raised, <em>sua sponte, </em>the question of the propriety of using the excluded evidence for the purpose of determining the sentence. He decided that use of the evidence was proper. We agree and affirm the denial of the Rule 35 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">A sentencing judge\u2019s access to information should be almost completely unfettered in order that he may \u201cacquire a thorough acquaintance with the character and history of the man before [him].\u201d United States v. Doyle, 348 F.2d 715, 721 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 843, 86 S.Ct. 89, 15 L.Ed.2d 84 (1965).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-12\">\u201cHis task within fixed statutory or constitutional limits is to determine the type and extent of punishment after the issue of guilt has been determined. Highly relevant \u2014 if not essential \u2014 to his selection of an appropriate sentence is the possession of the fullest information possible concerning the defendant\u2019s life and characteristics. And modern concepts individualizing punishment have made it all the more necessary that a sentencing judge not be denied an opportunity to obtain pertinent information by a requirement of rigid adherence to restrictive rules of evidence properly applicable to the trial.\u201d Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241, 247, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1083, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949) (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">This policy permits the broad acceptance of hearsay in the sentencing procedure. See, e. g., Williams v. Oklahoma, 358 U.S. 576, 79 S.Ct. 421, 3 L.Ed.2d 516 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">In the present case the accuracy of the excluded evidence was not questioned either at sentencing or at the hearing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the motion which is here appealed. The information obtained by the wiretaps was highly relevant to the character of the sentence to be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The appellant urges that the rule providing for exclusion in certain proceedings of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment requires the rejection of the wiretap evidence at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The purpose of the exclusionary rule is, of course, to discourage unconstitutional acts by law enforcement officials. Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961). The issue h\u00e9re is whether the exclusionary rule ought to be extended to include sentencing procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">We believe that applying the exclusionary rule for a second time at sentencing after having already applied it once at the trial itself would not add in any significant way to the deterrent effect of the rule. It is quite unlikely that law enforcement officials conduct illegal electronic auditing to build up an inventory of information for sentencing purposes, although the evidence would be inadmissible on the issue of guilt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">It is this weakness in deterrent force which has led, as Judge Weinstein pointed out in his thorough opinion to the holdings that such evidence may be considered by a parole board in revoking parole, United States ex rel. Sperling v. Fitzpatrick, 426 F.2d 1161 (2d Cir. 1970), that it is admissible in grand jury proceedings, United States v. Blue, 384 U.S. 251, 255 n. 3, 86 S.Ct. 1416, 16 L.Ed.2d 510 (1966), that defendants other than those whose property has been unlawfully seized do not have the benefit of the rule, Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969), and that the illegally seized evidence may be used to impeach the credibility of a criminal defendant who has made untruthful assertions at trial on his direct case, Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62, 74 S.Ct. 354, 98 L.Ed. 503 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">Where illegally seized evidence is reliable and it is clear, as here, that it was not gathered for the express purpose of improperly influencing the sentencing judge, there is no error in using it in connection with fixing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-8\">. In the case of Verdugo v. United States, 402 F.2d 599 (9th Cir. 1968), a divided panel decided that the exclusionary rule was applied where evidence was illegally seized to enhance the possibility of a heavier sentence after the basic investigation had been completed. As Judge Weinstein noted the <em>Verdugo </em>case presents quite a different situation from that now before us. We need not now pass upon the question of whether evidence ought to be excluded where it has been seized under the conditions presented in <em>Verdugo.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
