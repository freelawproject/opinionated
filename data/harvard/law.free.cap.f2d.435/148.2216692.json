We are informed that this discharge carries no continuing obligation by way of reserve duty or otherwise and that appellant\u2019s position regarding veteran\u2019s benefits is substantially the same as it would have been had he been granted an Honorable Discharge. Indeed, his position in this regard is markedly better than it would have been had he been granted the discharge he sought as a conscientious objector. <em>See </em>38 U.S. C. \u00a7 3103.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-21\">Since we know of no adverse collateral consequences of this discharge, <em>cf. </em>Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968), it is hereby ordered that this appeal be dismissed as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
