Sollie, however, participates in the Maryland State Retirement Service (\u201cMSRS\u201d) plan, and will be entitled to a pension as well as full Social Security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Jackson acknowledges that generally, under Maryland law, in a divorce proceeding, retirement plans are considered marital property subject to division, and Social Security benefits are considered non-marital property, which are not subject to division. He argues, however, that the marital portion of the CSRS pension should be reduced in order to reflect an offset. The offset, he states, is an <em>implicit </em>embedded Social Security element representing the amount of Social Security benefits Jackson would have been entitled to had he not participated in the CSRS. By accounting for the offset, Sollie\u2019s share of the marital portion of the CSRS pension would be reduced, and, in Jackson\u2019s opinion, this would result in a more equitable distribution of the marital assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The Circuit Court rejected Jackson\u2019s offset argument, and ordered the retirement plans be divided so that each party would receive 50% of the marital share of the other party\u2019s retirement plan. For the reasons explained below, we agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>with the Circuit Court on this point, and hold that, under the doctrine of federal preemption, a trial judge may not offset the value of hypothetical Social Security benefits against the marital share of a CSRS pension when dividing marital assets in a divorce proceeding. We, however, vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court, and remand the case for that court to take into consideration the parties\u2019 anticipated Social Security benefits as a relevant factor under Md. Code (1984, 2012 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 8-205(b) of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The parties were married on June 21, 1980. By this time, each party was already employed and contributing to their respective pension plans. After thirty-five years of marriage, Petitioner filed a complaint for an absolute divorce. Although the parties agreed to divide other marital assets equally, they were unable to reach a consensus as to how to dispose of their respective pension plans. On June 25, 2015, the parties appeared before the Circuit Court for Howard County for a trial. The trial judge bifurcated the case, and heard the grounds for divorce first, followed by testimony concerning the disposition of Jackson\u2019s CSRS pension, and Sollie\u2019s MSRS pension. In the latter proceeding, the trial judge heard testimony from Jackson, his expert witness, and Sollie\u2019s expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Jackson testified about his employment history, including twelve years in the private sector and over thirty-eight years with the Social Security Administration where he remains a full-time employee. As a federal employee, Jackson enrolled in the CSRS, and began making contributions on January 18, 1977.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He explained that, as a CSRS employee, he does not qualify for Social Security benefits, because his employer does not withhold Social Security taxes from his salary. He further explained that he would be eligible to receive limited Social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Security benefits, because he previously worked in the private sector, and contributed to the prograna.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Jackson explained that when an individual, such as himself, is eligible for Social Security benefits as well as a pension from a position that did not contribute to the Social Security program, the individual will be adversely impacted by two statutory provisions enacted by Congress. First, under the Windfall Elimination Provision (\u201cWEP\u201d), a special formula is used to reduce the amount of Social Security benefits that the individual is entitled to receive. <em>Windfall Elimination Provision, </em>Social Security Admin. (Jan. 2016), www.ssa.gov/pubs/ EN-05-10045.pdf [https://perma.cc/DX2K-WF4X]. If Jackson were to receive Social Security benefits starting at age 66, the WEP would reduce his estimated benefits of $381 per month to $131 per month. Second, under the Government Pension Offset (\u201cGPO\u201d), there is a similar reduction in the Social Security spousal or survivor benefits an individual, including a former spouse, may receive. <em>Government Pension Offset, </em>Social Security Admin. (July 2015), www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10007.pdf [https://perma.cc/Y7W3-K5D6].</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Jackson called an expert witness in the areas of the CSRS and pensions to testify on his behalf. The expert explained that a portion of Jackson\u2019s salary is withheld to fund the CSRS instead of Social Security. Therefore, in the expert\u2019s opinion, the Circuit Court should account for the embedded Social Security element that allegedly exists within the CSRS pension:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">[T]he Social Security element means the amount of Social Security that [Jackson] would have had if he had been a private company employee or participated in the FERS program. So if you set that aside and allocate [the value of the embedded element] to Mr. Jackson and then divide the balance of that, the remainder, by the marital fraction, so in essence attributing some of Mr. Jackson\u2019s CSRS Pension to Social Security, then this, in my opinion, provides an equitable distribution of the retirement pensions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>In essence, because Social Security benefits are non-marital property, and thus, not subject to division by a court in a divorce proceeding, the expert proposed that the embedded Social Security element should be similarly treated as non-marital. Otherwise, according to the expert, an inequitable division would occur, because a portion of that embedded element would be distributed to Sollie.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Although Sollie did not testify, she did call an expert witness in the areas of pension, pension valuations, and Social Security benefits. The expert testified about Sollie\u2019s employment history, and explained that Sollie has contributed to the MSRS for over twenty-eight years, beginning on August 1, 1986, as well as to Social Security. As a result, upon retirement, Sollie will be entitled to a pension as well as Social Security benefits. Sollie\u2019s expert disagreed with the pension valuation calculations made by Jackson\u2019s expert. The expert explained that any attempt to value the hypothetical Social Security element would be speculative, because the element does not exist within the CSRS. The CSRS and Social Security are separate and distinct programs with distinguishing characteristics. Additionally, the expert explained that state courts are federally preempted from interfering with Social Security, and that Jackson was trying to circumvent Congressional intent by suggesting that the trial court could offset the value of Social Security benefits. Congressional intent is expressed by the interplay between the CSRS, the WEP, and the GPO: Jackson, as a CSRS employee, is entitled to reduced Social Security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">On June 30, 2015, the Circuit Court entered its judgment granting Jackson an absolute divorce. On the issue of how to equitably divide the retirement plans, in its memorandum opinion, the Circuit Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">It is not the role of the Court to make things equal, only to divide marital property equitably.... Each party\u2019s retirement shall be divided in accordance with the Bangs Formula, giving each party 50% of the marital share of the other party\u2019s retirement, with the marital share being defined as the number of months of the employee\u2019s qualifying partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>ipation in the plan from June 21, 1980 and June 25, 2015 and the denominator being the total number of months of the employee\u2019s qualifying participation in the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">On July 16, 2015, Jackson filed a notice of appeal in the Court of Special Appeals, and, on August 25, 2015, he filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court. Before the commencement of proceedings in the intermediate appellate court, we granted <em>certiorari </em>to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS3x\">Should Maryland adopt the [position of a] majority of states and require a trial judge to consider whether social security benefits should be offset against the marital portion of [a] CSRS pension upon dividing assets as a result of [a] divorce?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\"><em>Jackson v. Sollie, </em>445 Md. 19, 123 A.3d 1005 (2015). For the reasons stated below, we shall answer twofold: (1) in a divorce proceeding, a trial judge is preempted by federal law from dividing Social Security benefits (including its hypothetical value) directly or by way of an indirect offset when determining the equitable distribution of marital property; (2) on the basis of the evidence presented, a judge must consider a party\u2019s actual or anticipated Social Security benefits as a relevant factor under F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b) when determining whether to grant a monetary award to adjust the equities and rights of the parties concerning marital property. \u201cA court that grants a divorce has authority to determine which property is marital property, to assess its value, to order the transfer of ownership.of certain categories of property, and to grant a monetary award to adjust \u2018the equities and rights of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinette v. Hunsecker, </em>439 Md. 243, 245-46, 96 A.3d 94, 95 (2014) (quoting F.L. \u00a7\u00a7 8-201 through 8-205). Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court, and remand this case for the judge\u2019s consideration of the parties\u2019 anticipated Social Security benefits in determining whether it would be equitable to enter a monetary award.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">The question before this Court is a question of law as it concerns the limits of a trial court\u2019s authority in a divorce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>proceeding. \u201cAs with all questions of law, we review this matter <em>de novo.\u201d Toms v. Calvary Assembly of God, Inc., </em>446 Md. 543, 551, 132 A.3d 866, 870-71 (2016) (citing <em>State v. Johnson, </em>367 Md. 418, 424, 788 A.2d 628, 631 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">We are asked to address an issue of first impression in Maryland, and to determine whether a trial court, in a divorce proceeding, may consider hypothetical Social Security benefits, allegedly located within the CSRS pension, and offset that amount when determining whether to make a monetary award in order to achieve an equitable distribution of marital property. First, we shall address whether a judge may offset the value of hypothetical Social Security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Social Security and Federal Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">We are guided by the United States Supreme Court on the issue of whether Maryland courts are federally preempted from indirectly dividing Social Security benefits by way of an offset. We know from <em>Flemming v. Nestor </em>that Social Security benefits are distinguished from annuities, and are not considered an accrued property right. 363 U.S. 603, 610, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 1372, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435, 1444 (1960). \u201cTo engraft upon the Social Security system a concept of \u2018accrued property rights\u2019 would deprive it of the flexibility and boldness in adjustment to everchanging conditions which it demands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt is apparent that the noncontractual interest of an employee covered by the Act cannot be soundly analogized to that of the holder of an annuity, whose right to benefits is bottomed on his contractual premium payments.\u201d <em>Flemming, </em>363 U.S. at 610, 80 S.Ct. at 1372, 4 L.Ed.2d at 1443-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">An analysis of the Social Security program as discussed in <em>Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo </em>provides additional guidance. 439 U.S. 572, 99 S.Ct. 802, 59 L.Ed.2d 1 (1979). At issue in <em>Hisquierdo </em>was a state court\u2019s power, in a divorce proceeding, to divide or offset the value of an expected interest in federal retirement benefits administered under the Railroad Retirement Act (\u201cRRA\u201d). The Supreme Court held that the statuto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ry scheme enacted by Congress, which it analogized to the Social Security Act (\u201cSSA\u201d), preempted state courts from directly or indirectly interfering with the RRA benefits. <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. at 586, 588, 99 S.Ct. at 810-11, 59 L.Ed.2d at 14. Under the RRA, an employee\u2019s spouse qualified for benefits, but any entitlement to those benefits terminated upon an absolute divorce. <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. at 575, 99 S.Ct. at 805, 59 L.Ed.2d at 7. Thus, any benefits derived from the RRA cannot be subject to division in a divorce proceeding. The Supreme Court acknowledged that \u201c[t]he burden of marital dissolution may be particularly onerous for a spouse who, unlike respondent, has no expectation of receiving his or her own social security benefits[,]\u201d but it further stated that Congressional action would be required to amend the statutory scheme. <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. at 590, 99 S.Ct. at 812, 59 L.Ed.2d at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The Supreme Court dedicated significant time comparing the statutory scheme of the RRA to the SSA, and discussing their similarities. \u201cLike Social Security, and unlike most private pension plans, railroad retirement benefits are not contractual. Congress may alter, and even eliminate, them at any time.\u201d <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. at 575, 99 S.Ct. at 805, 59 L.Ed.2d at 7 (footnote omitted). Both programs have an anti-attachment provision to \u201cprevent[ ] the vagaries of state law from disrupting the national scheme, and [to] guarantee[ ] a national uniformity that enhances the effectiveness of congressional policy.\u201d <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. at 584, 99 S.Ct. at 809-10, 59 L.Ed.2d at 12. The Supreme Court noted that the RRA\u2019s anti-attachment provision evidenced Congressional intent to protect the employee\u2019s benefits from interference from state courts. Any diminution of those benefits to the intended employee-beneficiary would circumvent the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution and \u201cfrustrate[] the congressional objective.\u201d <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. at 585, 99 S.Ct. at 810, 59 L.Ed.2d at 16. The Supreme Court further rejected the offset argument, because any indirect interference of the RRA benefits would similarly \u201cupset the statutory balance and impair [the employeej\u2019s economic security just as surely as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>would a regular deduction from his benefit check.\u201d <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. at 588-89, 99 S.Ct. at 811, 59 L.Ed.2d at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Jackson argues that <em>Hisquierdo </em>is distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice, </em>and he cites to other state appellate courts, including <em>Cornbleth v. Cornbleth, </em>397 Pa.Super. 421, 580 A.2d 369 (1990) and <em>Kelly v. Kelly, </em>198 Ariz. 307, 9 P.3d 1046 (2000), <em>as amended </em>(Oct. 11, 2000), that have held that an indirect consideration of Social Security benefits does not tread on federal preemption grounds. Furthermore, Jackson cites to <em>Pleasant v. Pleasant, </em>97 Md.App. 711, 720 n. 3, 632 A.2d 202, 207 (1993), as giving credence to this trend of jurisdictions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Social Security Act and the Civil Service Retirement Act</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Because the issue before this Court involves two federal programs, we shall explore their characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">In <em>Pleasant, </em>the Court of Special Appeals explained that \u201cthe Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution precludes states from intervening in the allocation of social security benefits\u201d and therefore \u201csocial security benefits may not be considered marital property or be subject to distribution in any manner in a divorce proceeding.\u201d 97 Md.App. at 719, 632 A.2d at 206. The intermediate appellate court correctly rested its decision on federal preemption grounds. As part of the SSA, Congress enacted an anti-assignment and anti-legal process provision, which prevents state courts from directly interfering with Social Security benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">The right of any person to any future payment under this subchapter <em>shall not be transferable or assignable, </em>at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this subchapter shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, <em>or other legal process, </em>or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a) (2012) (emphasis added). This provision prohibits a beneficiary from transferring or assigning his or her interest in Social Security benefits to another.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cLike anti-attachment provisions generally ... it ensures that the benefits actually reach the beneficiary. It pre-empts all state law that stands in its way.\u201d <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. at 584, 99 S.Ct. at 809, 59 L.Ed.2d at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In 1975, Congress amended the SSA to include two narrow exceptions to the anti-assignment provision. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659(a) (2012), a state court is permitted to withhold Social Security benefits in order \u201cto enforce the legal obligation of the individual to provide child support or alimony.\u201d Notably, in 1977, Congress further amended the SSA to clarify the definition of \u201calimony.\u201d Alimony is narrowly defined as \u201cperiodic payments of funds for the support and maintenance of the spouse (or former spouse) of the individual....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659(i)(3)(A) (2012). Congress expressly stated that alimony does not include \u201cany payment or transfer of property <em>or its value </em>by an individual to the spouse or a former spouse of the individual in compliance with any community property settlement, equitable distribution of property, or other division of property between spouses or former spouses.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659(i)(3)(B)(ii) (2012) (emphasis added). <em>See Depot v. Depot, </em>893 A.2d 995, 999 (Me.2006) (\u201cCongress has specifically excluded any similar payment obligation arising from any community property settlement, equitable distribution of property, or other division of property between spouses or former spouses.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, Congress further delineated the boundaries of a state court\u2019s power to interfere with Social Security benefits. As explained in <em>In re Marriage of Crook, </em>211 Ill.2d 437, 286 Ill.Dec. 141, 813 N.E.2d 198, 204 (2004), \u201cthe amendment clarified Congress\u2019 intent that Social Security benefits remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>nonassignable until Congress chooses to modify its position on this issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Notably, Congress reserves \u201c[t]he right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision\u201d of the SSA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 (2012). Unlike a CSRS pension, Social Security benefits are not considered property, but instead are considered non-contractual benefits. <em>Flemming, </em>363 U.S. at 610, 80 S.Ct. at 1372, 4 L.Ed.2d at 1444. <em>See also Pleasant, </em>97 Md.App. at 719, 632 A.2d at 206 (categorizing Social Security benefits as non-marital property, because the Supremacy Clause \u201cprecludes states from intervening in the allocation\u201d of those benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The Civil Service Retirement Act is substantively different than the SSA as reflected in its treatment by state courts. A defining characteristic is that under Maryland law, retirement pensions, including the CSRS, are considered marital property subject to division in a divorce proceeding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">Federal law permits state divorce courts to treat certain pension and retirement rights as marital property, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 8345(j), and, correspondingly, Maryland has specifically authorized its trial courts to implement a monetary award by transferring a portion of a party\u2019s pension or retirement plan to his or her spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-8\"><em>Heyda v. Heyda, </em>94 Md.App. 91, 94, 615 A.2d 1218, 1219-20 (1992). <em>See </em>Md. Code (1984, 2012 Repl. Vol.), F.L. \u00a7 8-201(e)(1) (defining marital property-as \u201cthe property, however titled, acquired by 1 or both parties during the marriage\u201d); F.L. \u00a7 8-205(a)(1) and (a)(2) (stating a court may either grant a monetary award, or \u201ctransfer ownership of an interest in ... a pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan, from one party to either or both parties[,]\u201d or both).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">The treatment by Congress of the CSRS has been markedly different than that of the SSA. For instance, unlike the SSA, the CSRS does not contain an anti-assignment provision. The program was amended to allow the assignment of benefits to former spouses. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8345(j)(1) (2012). Furthermore, Congressional intent is clear in that a CSRS pensioner is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>eligible for Social Security benefits. To reinforce this, any CSRS pensioner who derives Social Security benefits from another source will be subjected to penalties under the WEP and GPO, which will result in reduced benefits. Such a statutory structure prevents a \u201cdouble dipping\u201d of benefits, because a CSRS pension <em>substitutes </em>for Social Security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Jurisdictional Split on the Issue of Federal Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Jackson argues that although state courts are preempted from directly dividing Social Security benefits as explained above, trial courts are not preempted from the <em>indirect </em>consideration of those benefits in a CSRS pension. He posits that it is permissible for a state court, first, to consider the value of the implicit embedded Social Security element, and, second, to offset that amount by removing that value from the marital portion of the pension prior to a judge\u2019s determination of how to equitably distribute the remaining marital portion. Without the offset, Jackson argues, Sollie will receive a portion of the embedded Social Security element within Jackson\u2019s CSRS pension. He argues that this is inequitable, because Sollie\u2019s Social Security benefits cannot be distributed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Although this is an issue of first impression in Maryland, several jurisdictions have previously addressed it. There exists a sharp split, however, in their resolution of the issue. The highest appellate court in South Dakota explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">The U.S. Supreme Court has not specifically addressed whether a state court can indirectly offset or otherwise consider the parties\u2019 respective Social Security benefits in dividing marital property in a dissolution proceeding. However, several state courts look to the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. 572, 99 S.Ct. 802, 59 L.Ed.2d 1 (1979), as instructing them that Social Security is not subject to an indirect adjustment through offset.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">However, some courts allow an indirect offset.... Most courts utilize yet another, less restrictive approach. These courts disallow an offset but allow a general consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>a party\u2019s anticipated social security benefits in the overall scheme when making a property division.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\"><em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>734 N.W.2d 801, 807-08 (S.D.2007) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). <em>See also Forrester v. Forrester, </em>953 A.2d 175, 181 (Del.2008) (\u201cNine jurisdictions have determined that retirement plans that substitute for federal Social Security are subject to division as a marital asset. Four jurisdictions do not treat such plans as marital assets.\u201d) (footnotes omitted). Jackson argues that this Court should join with the jurisdictions that hold indirect consideration of Social Security benefits does not tread on federal preemption grounds. Sollie, however, argues that Maryland should join with state appellate courts that have refused to consider Social Security benefits in any manner because of federal preemption as explained in <em>Hisquierdo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Briefly, we examine the jurisdictional split. Jackson cites to cases where the appellate courts have distinguished <em>Hisquierdo, </em>because the consideration of an embedded Social Security element within a CSRS pension (or a pension that similarly precludes Social Security participation) does not involve the <em>direct </em>division of Social Security benefits. Thus, according to these jurisdictions, <em>Hisquierdo </em>is not violated by an indirect consideration, and equity is permitted to prevail, under state law, in the distribution of marital assets between divorcing parties. <em>See Johnson, </em>734 N.W.2d at 808-09 (\u201c[The consideration] recognizes and compensates for the inequity of including all of [one party\u2019s] CSRS benefits in the marital estate while [the other party\u2019s] social security benefits are entirely excluded.\u201d); <em>Depot, </em>893 A.2d at 1001 (\u201cA divorce court\u2019s consideration of a spouse\u2019s anticipated or actual Social Security benefit payments as a relevant factor ... does not represent a transfer or assignment ... in violation of the Social Security Act\u2019s anti-assignment provision.\u201d) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a)); <em>Eickelberger v. Eickelberger, </em>93 Ohio App.3d 221, 638 N.E.2d 130, 135 (12 Dist.1994) (\u201cAs a matter of public policy, a trial court should consider one spouse\u2019s Social Security benefits before that court divides the other spouse\u2019s entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>public pension and retirement plan [and then it may order an offset].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><em>Cornbleth v. Cornbleth, </em>397 Pa.Super. 421, 580 A.2d 369 (1990) is the case most often cited for the proposition that indirect consideration does not run afoul of federal preemption. The case is factually analogous to the case <em>sub judiee, </em>and, like Maryland, Pennsylvania is an equitable distribution jurisdiction. Pennsylvania\u2019s intermediate appellate court held that a trial judge could consider the value of the embedded Social Security element, and offset it by removing that value from the marital share of the CSRS pension prior to dividing the marital assets. The court devised a formula<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to avoid the \u201cinequity of positions\u201d that would otherwise result between a CSRS pensioner and a Social Security participant. <em>Cornbleth, </em>580 A.2d at 372. <em>See also Johnson, </em>734 N.W.2d at 807-08 (identifying states that permit an indirect offset). \u201cTo the extent individuals with Social Security benefits enjoy an exemption of that \u2018asset\u2019 from equitable distribution we believe those individuals participating in the CSRS must, likewise, be so positioned.\u201d <em>Cornbleth, </em>580 A.2d at 371.

Olson, </em>445 N.W.2d 1, 11 (N.D.1989) (holding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Supremacy Clause prohibits state courts from distributing Social Security benefits directly or \u201cus[ing it] as an offset in division of marital property\u201d). It is Sollie\u2019s position that Social Security is not subject to valuation for purposes of an offset, which means that a court is precluded from considering its hypothetical value.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In Illinois, the highest appellate court explained that <em>\u201cHis-quierdo </em>establishes two important points: Social Security benefits may not be divided directly or used as a basis for an offset during state dissolution proceedings.\u201d <em>Crook, </em>286 Ill. Dec. 141, 813 N.E.2d at 204. The court discussed its rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">Instructing a trial court to \u201cconsider\u201d Social Security benefits ... either causes an actual difference in the asset distribution or it does not. If it does not, then the \u201cconsideration\u201d is essentially without meaning. If it does, then the monetary value of the Social Security benefits the spouse would have received is taken away from that spouse and given to the other spouse to compensate for the anticipated difference. This works as an offset meant to equalize the property distribution. That this type of \u201cconsideration\u201d amounts to an offset is recognized in the well-reasoned decisions from other state jurisdictions holding that under <em>Hisquierdo, </em>it is improper for a circuit court to consider Social Security benefits in equalizing a property distribution upon dissolution. <em>See Wolff v. Wolff, </em>112 Nev. 1355, 929 P.2d 916 (1996); <em>Olson v. Olson, </em>445 N.W.2d 1 (N.D.1989); <em>In re Marriage of Swan, </em>301 Or. 167, 720 P.2d 747 (1986).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ala\"><em>Crook, </em>286 Ill.Dec. 141, 813 N.E.2d at 205.

Nonetheless, <em>Hisquierdo </em>and the federal preemption doctrine compel our conclusion in this case. It remains a fact that it is not the province of this court \u2014 or of any state court \u2014 to interfere with the federal scheme, no matter how unfair it may appear to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>be....

In part, it relied on the language of the alimony exception to the SSA\u2019s anti-legal process provision, which allows for spousal support, but excludes \u201cany payment or transfer of property or its value by an individual to ... a former spouse of the individual in compliance with any community property settlement, equitable distribution of property, or other division of property between spouses or former spouses.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659(i)(3)(B)(ii) (2012). Pursuant to the statute, and <em>His-</em>quierdo\u2019s preemption analysis, the court reasoned that a trial judge may not create a hypothetical valuation and indirectly offset the embedded Social Security benefits within a pension that \u2014 like a CSRS pension \u2014 operates in lieu of Social Security. The <em>Olson </em>Court explained its rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">Although marital property is generally under state control, it is clear to us that Congress wants social security to be exclusively federally controlled. Congress preempted state divorce laws when it enacted its own scheme of social security benefits for divorced spouses. The anti-assignment and anti-legal-process provisions in the Social Security Act, with their specific allowance for spousal support, also promote federal uniformity and preempt state law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">We conclude that social security cannot be distributed or used as an offset in [the] division of marital property. To do so would conflict with the federal plan and would violate the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABm\">445 N.W.2d at 11 (footnote omitted). It further stated that any perceived inequity in excluding the former wife\u2019s Social Security benefits from division, but permitting the former husband\u2019s pension to be distributable, was beyond the court\u2019s power to address. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 14. <em>See also Gray v.

Referring to the amendment to the SSA\u2019s alimony exception, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659(a), it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">This provision not only prohibits the outright division of social security benefits, it also prohibits the indirect division of benefits by awarding a nonparticipating spouse other marital property to compensate for his or her theoretical share of the participating spouse\u2019s benefits. <em>See Hisquierdo v.

Offsetting Social Security Benefits and the Issue of Federal Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">We hold that, under the doctrine of federal preemption, a trial judge may not offset the value of hypothetical Social Security benefits against the marital share of a CSRS pension when dividing marital assets in a divorce proceeding. <em>See Bd. of Trustees v. City of Baltimore, </em>317 Md. 72, 115, 562 A.2d 720, 740-41 (1989) (discussing the doctrine of federal preemption). <em>See also Dapp v.

Social Security benefits are not marital property subject to division directly or indirectly.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>The Supreme Court\u2019s preemption analysis in <em>Hisquierdo </em>is instructive. The SSA\u2019s statutory scheme precludes the division of Social Security benefits directly and indirectly by way of an offset. Congress has expressly sheltered the SSA from most state court action, and has specifically chosen not to do the same with the CSRS. \u201cIt is apparent that the noncontrac-tual interest of an employee covered by the [Social Security] Act cannot be soundly analogized to that of the holder of an annuity, whose right to benefits is bottomed on his contractual premium payments.\u201d <em>Flemming, </em>363 U.S. at 610, 80 S.Ct. at 1372, 4 L.Ed.2d at 1443-44. Congress enacted the SSA\u2019s anti-assignment provision, and, in 1975, it amended the SSA to permit an exception for child support and alimony. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659(a) (1975). Although Social Security benefits are available for spousal support, the SSA explicitly excludes \u201cany payment or transfer of property or its value by an individual to the spouse or a former spouse of the individual in compliance with any community property settlement, equitable distribution of property, or other division of property between spouses or former spouses.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659(i)(3)(B)(ii) (2012). Although the Supreme Court in <em>Hisquierdo </em>did not expressly decide whether a court could indirectly divide Social Security benefits by way of an offset, it held that the structure of the RRA, which it likened to the structure of the SSA, prohibited the indirect offset of RRA benefits. It determined that \u201c[a]n offsetting award [ ] would upset the statutory balance and impair petitioner\u2019s economic security just as surely as would a regular deduction from his benefit check.\u201d <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. at 588, 99 S.Ct. at 811, 59 L.Ed.2d at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">We hold that, in a divorce proceeding, federal law and the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretations of the SSA bar an indirect offset of Social Security benefits (including its hypothetical value) within a CSRS pension. <em>See id. </em>(analogizing the statutory scheme of the RRA to the SSA); <em>Flemming, </em>363 U.S. at 610-11, 80 S.Ct. at 1372-73, 4 L.Ed.2d at 1444 (distinguishing Social Security benefits and explaining the difference in treatment between those benefits and annuities). In addition to being preempted by federal law on the issue of whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>court may offset Social Security benefits directly or indirectly, we also note that any valuation of hypothetical Social Security benefits allegedly located within the CSRS pension would be speculative. Congress reserves \u201c[t]he right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision\u201d of the SSA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 (2012). As such, the Supreme Court explained that Social Security benefits are not an accrued property right:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">That [Social Security] program was designed to function into the indefinite future, and its specific provisions rest on predications as to expected economic conditions which must inevitably prove less than wholly accurate, and on judgments and preferences as to the proper allocation of the Nation\u2019s resources which evolving economic and social conditions will of necessity in some degree modify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">To engraft upon the Social Security system a concept of \u201caccrued property rights\u201d would deprive it of the flexibility and boldness in adjustment to everchanging conditions which it demands. It was doubtless out of an awareness of the need for such flexibility that Congress included in the original Act, and has since retained, a clause expressly reserving to it \u201c[t]he right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision\u201d of the Act. That provision makes express what is implicit in the institutional needs of the program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-7\"><em>Flemming, </em>363 U.S. at 610-11, 80 S.Ct. at 1372-73, 4 L.Ed.2d at 1444 (internal citations omitted).

Preemption Doctrine Does Not Apply to the General Consideration of Social Security Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">In <em>Pleasant, </em>the Court of Special Appeals stated: \u201cIn an appropriate case, of course, it may be that a court could consider the fact that a party is receiving, or will receive, social security benefits, as \u2018any other factor\u2019 in determining whether to make a monetary award.\u201d 97 Md.App. at 720 n. 3, 632 A.2d at 207. We agree. If the trial court determines from the evidence that a party is receiving or will receive Social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Security benefits, the court must consider those benefits as any other relevant factor, under F.L. \u00a7 8\u2014205(b), in determining whether to grant a monetary award to adjust the equities and rights of the parties in marital property. <em>See Alston v. Alston, </em>331 Md. 496, 509, 629 A.2d 70, 76 (1993) (\u201c[A] trial judge must weigh the relevant factors in light of the legislative purpose, and then use his or her sound discretion to arrive at an award that is equitable and in accordance with the statute.\u201d). Although trial courts are preempted from subjecting Social Security benefits to valuation for the purposes of a direct or indirect offset of those benefits, federal law does not prevent courts from generally considering a party\u2019s participation in the Social Security program. A general consideration is permissible, because it does not involve the direct division of Social Security benefits or the indirect division of those benefits by way of an offset. <em>See Depot, </em>893 A.2d at 1001 (stating that unlike an offset of Social Security benefits, a \u201cdivorce court\u2019s treatment of a spouse\u2019s anticipated or actual Social Security benefit payments as a factor relevant to the equitable distribution of property\u201d does not violate the SSA\u2019s anti-assignment or anti-legal process provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The Supreme Court of Washington held that the mere consideration of a party\u2019s Social Security benefits in a divorce proceeding did not constitute reversible error. <em>In re Marriage of Zahm, </em>138 Wash.2d 213, 978 P.2d 498, 503 (1999). <em>Hisquierdo, </em>it reasoned, was not violated, because \u201c[t]he trial court neither computed a formal calculation of the value of petitioner\u2019s social security benefits nor offset a formal numerical valuation into the court\u2019s property division via a specific counterbalancing property award to respondent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502. Thus, a general consideration of Social Security benefits was proper in order to make a just and equitable distribution when dividing marital property.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">A fair and equitable division by a trial court does not require mathematical precision, but rather fairness, based upon a consideration of all the circumstances of the marriage, both past and present, and an evaluation of the future needs of parties....

Importantly, that court stated that Social Security benefits could be considered by different statutory factors, including the determination of the parties\u2019 relative economic circumstances at the time of the divorce proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 503. In another case, that same court explained why the preemption doctrine does not apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">Neither the letter nor purpose of \u00a7 407(a) of the Social Security Act compel courts to ignore expected annual Social Security benefit payments when undertaking their responsibility to equitably divide marital property. A divorce court\u2019s consideration of a spouse\u2019s anticipated or actual Social Security benefit payments as a relevant factor pursuant to [Maine\u2019s statutory scheme] does not represent a transfer or assignment of ... in violation of the Social Security Act\u2019s anti-assignment provision. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 407(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">Such consideration also does not violate \u00a7 407(a)\u2019s prohibition against subjecting \u201cthe moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this subchapter ... to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or <em>other legal process, </em>or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Since <em>Hisquierdo </em>was decided, the Supreme Court had occasion to revisit \u00a7 407(a), and it adopted a restrictive view of the meaning of \u201cother legal process\u201d as used in that section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">\u201c[OJther legal process\u201d should be understood to be process much like the processes of execution, levy, attachment, and garnishment, and at a minimum, would seem to require utilization of some judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism, though not necessarily an elaborate one, by which control over property passes from one person to another in order to discharge or secure discharge of an allegedly existing or anticipated liability. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>Washington State Dep\u2019t of Soc. &amp; Health Servs. v.

A divorce court\u2019s treatment of a spouse\u2019s anticipated or actual Social Security benefit payments as a factor relevant to the equitable distribution of property is neither a judicial process \u201cmuch like the processes of execution, levy, attachment and garnishment,\u201d nor a mechanism by which control over Social Security benefits \u201cpasses from one person to another.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">The approach we approved in <em>Pongonis </em>[v. <em>Pongonis, </em>606 A.2d 1055 (Me.1992) ] makes common sense. The court\u2019s role in property division is to accomplish a just division that takes into account \u201call relevant factors.\u201d Just as few married couples engaged in a serious assessment of their retirement resources would ignore the availability of Social Security benefits, courts should not be required to ignore reality and fashion a distributive award of the parties\u2019 retirement and other marital assets divorced from the actual \u201ceconomic circumstances of each spouse at the time the division of property is to become effective\u201d .... Failing to consider Social Security benefit payments a spouse can reasonably be expected to receive in the near future may result in a distorted picture of that spouse\u2019s financial needs, and, in turn, an inequitable division of the marital property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-6\"><em>Depot, </em>893 A.2d at 1001-02 (internal citation and footnotes omitted). The court further reasoned that in order to avoid running afoul of preemption, when considering Social Security benefits, a trial judge \u201cmay not assign a lump sum value to Social Security benefits and either transfer or offset those benefits when exercising its [statutory] authority to divide marital property....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Similarly, Iowa\u2019s highest appellate court acknowledged preemption to a degree: \u201cstate courts are without power to directly or (by way of setoff) indirectly divide social security benefits in their formulation of economic terms and dissolution decrees.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Boyer, </em>538 N.W.2d 293, 295 (Iowa 1995). <em>Boyer </em>did not involve a CSRS-like pension, however, its facts mirror a typical divorce case where a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>judge must resolve numerous issues, including the distribution of multiple marital assets and alimony. Thus, its discussion on the general consideration of Social Security benefits is beneficial. There, although both parties qualified for Social Security benefits, the present value of the husband\u2019s anticipated benefits ($87,861.56) was much higher than the wife\u2019s anticipated benefits ($22,539.48). <em>Id. </em>at 294. \u201c[A] state court is not required to pretend to be oblivious of the fact that one party expects benefits that will not be enjoyed by the other. This contrasting economic security can be weighed as a factor in fixing the economic terms of a dissolution decree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293-94. The Supreme Court of Iowa explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">We see a crucial distinction between: (1) adjusting property division so as to indirectly allow invasion of benefits; and (2) making a general adjustment in dividing marital property on the basis that one party, far more than the other, can reasonably expect to enjoy a secure retirement. It should not invalidate a property division if a disproportionate expectation regarding social security benefits is acknowledged in the court\u2019s assessment of the equities....

In 1920, Congress enacted the Civil Service Retirement Act, which established the CSRS for federal employees. A defining characteristic of the CSRS program is that the employee does not participate in the Social Security program. Because the employer does not withhold Social Security taxes from the CSRS employee\u2019s salary, generally, the employee, upon retirement, will receive a larger pension in lieu of Social Security benefits. The employee may qualify for Social Security benefits, because of previous employment in the private sector. As will be discussed later, those benefits are subject to penalties under federal statutory provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\">.

The majority opinion raises several concerns. Specifically, among other things, the Majority exceeds the issue that is before this Court; the Majority\u2019s holding will require trial courts to speculate about future Social Security benefits in divorce actions; and, as to the authority for its holding, the Majority relies on a provision of a statute that does not authorize speculation by trial courts about future economic circumstances of litigants. Contrary to the result reached by the Majority, I would affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Howard County and hold that Social Security benefits are not to be offset against the marital portion of a Civil Service Retirement System (\u201cCSRS\u201d) pension in a divorce action or to be considered a factor under Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Code Ann., Fam.

Jackson, Respondent, had Social Security benefits and a pension, while Petitioner, as a federal employee, had almost no Social Security benefits, but had a pension under the CSRS. In other words, Petitioner paid into the CSRS, but did not pay into Social Security. As the Social Security Administration explains, \u201c[u]ntil 1984, employment by the [fjederal government was covered under the Civil Service Retirement System [] and not by Social Security.

Op. at 192, 141 A.3d at 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The statute to which the Majority refers, F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b), lists the considerations that a court must take into account in determining a monetary award as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>The court shall determine the amount and the method of payment of a monetary award, or the terms of the transfer of the interest in property described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, or both, after considering each of the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">(1) the contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">(2) the value of all property interests of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">(3) the economic circumstances of each party at the time the award is to be made;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">(4) the circumstances that contributed to the estrangement of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">(5) the duration of the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">(6) the age of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">(7) the physical and mental condition of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-12\">(8) how and when specific marital property or interest in property described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, was acquired, including the effort expended by each party in accumulating the marital property or the interest in property described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, or both;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-13\">(9) the contribution by either party of property described in \u00a7 8-201(e)(3) of this subtitle to the acquisition of real property held by the parties as tenants by the entirety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-14\">(10) any award of alimony and any award or other provision that the court has made with respect to family use personal property or the family home; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-15\">(11) any other factor that the court considers necessary or appropriate to consider in order to arrive at a fair and equitable monetary award or transfer of an interest in property described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-16\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">As to the authority for its holding, the Majority relies on F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b)(11), the \u201ccatchall\u201d provision that enables a trial court to consider \u201cany other factor that the court considers necessary or appropriate.\u201d <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 186, 141 A.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>at 1135 (\u201c[T]he Court of Special Appeals stated: \u2018In an appropriate case, of course, it may be that a court could consider the fact that a party is receiving, or will receive, social security benefits, as \u2018any other factor\u2019 in determining whether to make a monetary award.\u2019 We agree.\u201d (Citation omitted)). In my view, contrary to the Majority\u2019s reasoning, F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b)(11) does hot authorize a trial court to speculate as to future Social Security benefits. In other words, that F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b)(ll) provides that a court may consider \u201cany other factor that the court considers necessary or appropriate\u201d does not authorize a court to engage in speculation about a party\u2019s future receipt of Social Security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">With its inclusion of Social Security benefits as a factor to be considered under F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b)(11), the Majority\u2019s broad holding will cause difficulties in countless divorce actions. The exact amount of Social Security benefits to which a person will be entitled in the future depends on several variables, such as the amount of money that a person earns prior to retirement and the age at which the person retires. Indeed, the Social Security Administration provides estimates, not guaranteed amounts, of Social Security benefits. Thus, it is inherently speculative to attempt to estimate an amount of Social Security benefits to which a person will be entitled in the future, and to base a monetary award in a divorce action on such an estimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Yet, the Majority expects trial courts to engage in such speculation, and leaves several important questions unanswered. How exactly should a trial court go about calculating future Social Security benefits? What if the trial court values future Social Security benefits at a certain amount, and, years later, it turns out that the trial court\u2019s valuation was too high or too low? That outcome is not unlikely, given that, again, it is inherently speculative to attempt to pinpoint the exact amount of Social Security benefits to which a person will be entitled in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Notably, in drafting F.L. \u00a7 8\u2014205(b), the General Assembly carefully refrained from forcing trial courts to attempt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>predict the future.

It is reasonable to require a trial court to ascertain a spouse\u2019s existing economic circumstances; it is not reasonable to require a trial court to come up with an estimate as to a spouse\u2019s future economic circumstances, including future entitlement to Social Security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">As discussed above, in this case, one spouse had Social Security benefits, while the other spouse had almost no Social Security benefits. The out-of-State cases upon which the Majority relies, in which both parties worked and earned Social Security benefits, reach disparate outcomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">For example, the Majority relies on <em>Depot v.

As in <em>Depot, </em>there was a disparity between the parties\u2019 Social Security benefits; specifically, in <em>Boyer, </em>538 N.W.2d at 294, one spouse was entitled to more than three times as much in Social Security benefits as the other spouse. The trial court awarded the second spouse multiple assets \u201c \u2018to equalize the property distribution, and also recognizing and taking into consideration the greater benefit [that the first spouse] w[ould] be getting from [S]ocial [SJecurity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Iowa concluded \u201cthat [S]tate courts are without power to directly or (by way of setoff) indirectly divide [Sjocial [Security benefits in their formulation of economic terms and dissolution decrees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295.

In <em>Johnson, id. </em>at 805, one party raised an issue that was similar to the issue that Petitioner raised in this case: \u201cWhether the trial court abused its discretion when it did not offset [one partyj\u2019s [Sjocial [Sjecurity benefits against [the other party\u2019s] CSRS benefits.\u201d As the Majority does here, the South Dakota court exceeded this issue by broadly holding \u2014 without any reference to the CSRS in that holding \u2014 that \u201c[Sjocial [Sjecurity benefits may be considered as a factor, among others, when dividing marital property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808. Because that, in <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court of South Dakota went beyond that case\u2019s facts, does not mean that this Court must follow in kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Equally important, as the majority opinion acknowledges, Social Security benefits do not constitute \u201cproperty.\u201d <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 178, 141 A.3d at 1130 (\u201cSocial Security benefits are not considered property, but instead are considered non-contractual benefits.\u201d (Citing <em>Flemming v.

In so holding, the Supreme Court observed that the Railroad Retirement Act was similar, in many aspects, to the Social Security Act; for example, \u201c[l]ike Social Security, and unlike most private pension plans, railroad retirement benefits are not contractual. Congress may alter, and even eliminate, them at any time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 99 S.Ct. 802 (footnote omitted).

And, like the Social Security Act, Congress made an exception to the Railroad Retirement Act to permit collection and enforcement of child support and alimony obligations. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court explained that the Railroad Retirement Act, specifically 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231m, protected Congress\u2019s choice to target the benefits created by the Railroad Retirement Act to the employee and not a divorced spouse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">Congress has made a choice, and [45 U.S.C.] \u00a7 231m protects it. It is for Congress to decide how these finite funds are to be allocated. The statutory balance is delicate. Congress has fixed an amount thought appropriate to support an employee\u2019s old age and to encourage the employee to retire. Any automatic diminution of that amount frustrates the congressional objective. By reducing benefits received, it discourages the divorced employee from retiring. And it provides the employee with an incentive to keep working, because the former spouse has no community property claim to salary earned after the marital community is dissolved. Section 231m shields the distribution of benefits from state decisions that would actually reverse the flow of incentives Congress originally intended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\"><em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. at 585, 99 S.Ct. 802. The Supreme Court stated that it could not \u201clightly discard the settled view that anti-assignment statutes have substantive meaning[,]\u201d and that 45 U.S.C. 231m went \u201cfar beyond garnishment\u201d and made \u201cno exception for a spouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 586, 99 S.Ct. 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In the wake of <em>Hisquierdo, </em>although <em>Hisquierdo </em>involved the division of benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act, courts have held that the Social Security Act\u2019s prohibition against transfer and assignment, as codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407, prohibits the division of Social Security benefits in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>divorce proceeding. <em>See, e.g., Boyer, </em>538 N.W.2d at 295 (\u201cIt is apparent that <em>Hisquierdo </em>bars state courts from adjusting the parties\u2019 disproportionate [SJocial [SJecurity benefit expectations when formulating economic terms of dissolution decrees.

Although marital property is generally under [SJtate control, it is clear to us that Congress wants [SJocial [SJecurity to be exclusively federally controlled.... We conclude that [SJocial [SJecurity cannot be distributed or used as an offset in division of marital property. To do so would conflict with the federal plan and would violate the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. Any change in the allocation of [SJocial [SJecurity at divorce must come from Congress.\u201d (Footnote and paragraph breaks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">It also bears noting that it is well-publicized that the stability of the Social Security trust fund is in question. <em>See, e.g., </em>Jonnelle Marte, \u201cSocial Security trust fund will be empty in less than 20 years,\u201d <em>Washington Post, </em>June 22, 2016, <em>available at </em>https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/get-there/ wp/2016/06/22/social-security-and-medicare-still-face-shortfalls-trustees-say/ [https://perma.cc/48L9-BWUW] (\u201c[TJhe Social Security trust fund has enough cash to pay full benefits for another 18 years[.J\u201d). These potential circumstances make it even more difficult for a trial court to estimate the amount of Social Security benefits that a party will receive in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Courts in other jurisdictions have been confronted with the circumstance of one party\u2019s having paid into the CSRS \u2014 which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>exempted the spouse from Social Security \u2014 and have not concluded globally, as the Majority does, that present and future Social Security benefits are a factor to be considered in determining a martial property award. In <em>Cornbleth v. Cornbleth, </em>397 Pa.Super. 421, 580 A.2d 369, 373 (1990), <em>appeal denied, </em>526 Pa. 648, 585 A.2d 468 (1991), the Superior Court of Pennsylvania held that, in equitably distributing property in a divorce, the trial court should have considered exempt from distribution a portion of a CSRS pension equal to a Social Security benefit; <em>ie., </em>the trial court should have considered an offset of a spouse\u2019s non-marital property Social Security benefits contained within that spouse\u2019s CSRS pension. In <em>Com-bleth, id. </em>at 371, the husband was participating in a CSRS pension plan and did not participate in Social Security; and, \u201cany eligibility for Social Security would result in a commensurate decrease in his pension annuity under the\u201d Civil Service Retirement Act. Both the husband and wife had sizable pensions, and the wife also paid into Social Security. <em>Id. </em>at 372. On appeal, the husband argued that, although under federal law Social Security benefits are not marital property, \u201call or at least a portion of his CSRS pension should be similarly treated\u201d due to his nonparticipation in Social Security. <em>Id. </em>at 371. The Superior Court of Pennsylvania agreed with the husband, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">To the extent individuals with Social Security benefits enjoy an exemption of that \u201casset\u201d from equitable distribution we believe those individuals participating in the CSRS must, likewise, be so positioned. Consider for example an individual being divorced at approximately age fifty. Assuming a normal work history, that person will likely have accrued a substantial pension as well as a right to Social Security. When the pension is divided in equitable distribution there will be a diminution of the expected retirement income. However, the presence of Social Security will help offset the diminution. In contrast, an individual who was a civil service participant for many years will, if the trial court\u2019s approach is approved, be dealt a double blow of sorts. The pension will become part of the marital estate and, thus, divided, yet there will be no Social Security benefit waiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>to cushion this financial pitfall. The situation is exacerbated, thus providing a second \u201cblow\u201d, in that the money that would, in a conventional setting, be routed into Social Security, and thus into an exempt status, would either have been consumed by the couple, thus providing previous benefits enjoyed by both, or, perhaps, routed into the CSRS or another retirement type vehicle, which, of course, would then be included in the marital estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">In either scenario, a substantial stream of income which would be used to finance a future Social Security benefit, which for most individuals is excluded from equitable distribution, is not similarly shielded for the CSRS participant. Thus, the CSRS participant is at a disadvantage when compared to the majority of the work force. Consequently, should equity prevail, this difference must be negated if we are to equate the CSRS participant with Social Security, participants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 371-72 (footnote omitted). As to how to calculate the offset, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">To facilitate a process of equating CSRS participants and Social Security participants we believe it will be necessary to compute the present value of a Social Security benefit had the CSRS participant been participating in the Social Security system. This present value should then be deducted from the present value of the CSRS pension at which time a figure for the marital portion of the pension could be derived and included in the marital estate for distribution purposes. This process should result in equating, as near as possible, the two classes of individuals for equitable distribution purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">In <em>Harshbarger v. Harshbarger, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 121, 814 N.E.2d 105, 109-10 (2004), the Court of Appeals of Ohio stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">Consider a situation in which one spouse has accrued retirement benefits during the marriage under a pension plan that exempts that spouse from Social Security, and the other spouse, for whatever reason, has no retirement bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>fits, either under a pension plan or under Social Security. Barring unusual circumstances, an equitable division of the retirement benefits accrued during the marriage would be an equal division of those benefits.... It would not seem to be equitable, and we are aware of no cases finding it to be equitable, to offset against the retirement benefits accrued during the marriage by the only spouse who has accrued retirement benefits of any kind an amount [that is] equal to the hypothetical Social Security benefits that that spouse would have accrued had that spouse been under Social Security. For example, [suppose that a] husband has accrued during the marriage retirement benefits that will pay $5,000 a month, but would have accrued Social Security benefits paying $2,000 a month had he been under Social Security. Because all of the retirement benefits \u2014 $5,000 per month \u2014 were accrued during the marriage, it is obviously equitable to divide those benefits equally, so that each spouse receives $2,500 per month. But if the husband\u2019s hypothesized Social Security benefits in the amount of $2,000 per month are first deducted from his pension, leaving $3,000 to be divided, his wife will receive $1,500 per month, and he will receive $3,500 per month, which is not an equal division, and therefore an inequitable division, barring unusual circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">Using the non-Social Security spouse\u2019s hypothetical Social Security benefit instead of the Social Security spouse\u2019s actual Social Security benefit approaches this obviously inequitable resultf,] as the Social Security spouse\u2019s actual Social Security benefit approaches zero.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">Where the non-Social Security spouse\u2019s retirement benefits [that were] accrued during the marriage exceed the Social Security spouse\u2019s Social Security benefits [that were] accrued during the marriage, using the Social Security spouse\u2019s actual [S]ocial [S]ecurity benefits as an offset will always result in the equivalent of an equal division of the retirement benefits [that were] accrued during the marriage[,] and is therefore the more equitable method of division, barring unusual circumstances justifying an unequal division.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>In <em>Harshbarger, id. </em>at 107, one spouse was entitled to Social Security benefits, while the other spouse was a federal employee who participated in the CSRS; as far as the opinion reveals, the latter spouse was not entitled to any Social Security benefits. One spouse filed for divorce, <em>see id. </em>at 107, and a trial court concluded that \u201c \u2018equity dictates that[,] since a portion of [the non-Social Security spousej\u2019s pension is in lieu of Social Security benefits, that portion should be shielded from an equitable distribution[,]\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 108 (brackets omitted). The Social Security spouse appealed and contended that \u201c \u2018[t]he trial court abused its discretion in its determination of the [Sjocial [SJecurity [offset] of [the Social Security spousej\u2019s [Sjocial [SJecurity retirement against [the non-Social Security spousej\u2019s civil service retirement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals of Ohio agreed and \u201cconclude[d] that it is an abuse of discretion to apply the hypothetical Social Security offset instead of offsetting the actual amount of the Social Security spouse\u2019s Social Security benefits [that were] accrued during the marriage against the retirement benefits of the non-Social Security spouse [that were] accrued during the marriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">In sum, it is undisputed that Social Security benefits are non-marital property and that the Social Security Act expressly prohibits the division of Social Security benefits in a divorce proceeding. However, whether an offset, or even consideration, of Social Security benefits as a factor can be taken into account by a trial court in dividing marital property is an issue of first impression in Maryland; and, the Supreme Court has not spoken on the subject. As discussed above, courts in other jurisdictions are split on the matter and follow one of three approaches: (1) an offset of Social Security benefits is prohibited by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407 and Social Security benefits are not to be considered in the division of marital property (this is the approach advocated by Respondent in this case); (2) an indirect offset of Social Security benefits \u2014 either by: (a) offsetting the actual amount of one spouse\u2019s Social Security benefits accrued during the marriage against the retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>benefits of the CSRS pension spouse accrued during the marriage, or (b) determining the present value of the CSRS pension spouse\u2019s Social Security benefits had he or she participated in Social Security during the marriage (this latter approach is the approach advocated by Petitioner in this case) \u2014 is permissible; or (3) an offset of Social Security benefits is not allowed but a trial court may consider one spouse\u2019s Social Security benefits in the division of marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">I would affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Howard County and hold that Social Security benefits are not to be offset against the marital portion of a CSRS pension in a divorce action or to be considered a factor under F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b) in determining a monetary award in a divorce action. To the extent that in a footnote in <em>Pleasant v. Pleasant, </em>97 Md.App. 711, 720 n. 3, 632 A.2d 202, 207 n. 3 (1993), the Court of Special Appeals suggested that a trial court may consider Social Security benefits as a factor under F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b)(11), I would not adopt this rationale. As discussed above, Social Security benefits are not property, let alone marital property; the value of future Social Security benefits is speculative at best; and the payment of Social Security benefits is not guaranteed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The Majority makes Social Security benefits a new factor that is to be considered under F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b)(11) in routine divorce actions that involve the equitable distribution of marital property, regardless of the parties\u2019 circumstances with respect to having paid into Social Security. This holding greatly exceeds the question presented, ignores that Social Security benefits are not property, conflicts with F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b)(3)\u2019s requirement that a monetary award be based on a party\u2019s current economic circumstances, and will force trial courts to speculate about the amount of future Social Security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">For the above reasons, respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Judge HOTTEN has authorized me to state that she joins in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
