Code Ann., Crim. Proc. \u00a7 7-104 (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We granted the State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari in this case to decide whether that same provision likewise grants the Court of Special Appeals the authority to afford the same relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude easily that it does not. The answer to that particular question, however, does not resolve the matter at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">Rather, we must look to another aspect of the UPPA and, further, review once again advisory only instructions given at the time that they were mandated by Article 23 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Maryland Declaration of Rights. Today, we put to an end finally any question surrounding such instructions and the effect that they have upon an individual\u2019s criminal trial. We reaffirm our holding in <em>State v. Waine, </em>444 Md. 692, 122 A.3d 294 (2015), that structural error results from the giving of advisory only instructions that include expressly or by implication the presumption of innocence and the standard of proof. Such error, upon a proper petition for postconviction relief or motion to reopen a postconviction proceeding, entitles an individual to a new trial. We further hold that the Court of Special Appeals is statutorily authorized to review for an abuse of discretion a circuit court\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen and may remand the matter to the circuit court with instruction to award appropriate relief if the circuit court abused that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Advisory only instructions have a tortured history in this State. They are derived from Article 28, which reads: \u201cIn the trial of all criminal cases, the Jury shall be the Judges of Law, as well as of fact, except that the Court may pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction.\u201d Based upon that constitutional mandate, we required judges under then-Maryland Rule 756b \u201c[i]n every case in which instructions are given to the jury [to] instruct the jury that they are the judges of the law and that the court\u2019s instructions are advisory only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">In 1980, in <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>289 Md. 167, 423 A.2d 558 (1980), we were asked to decide whether Article 23 violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court held that Article 23 was constitutional on its face, reasoning that Article 23 limited the jurors\u2019 role as judges of the law only with respect to \u201cdisputes as to the substantive \u2018law of the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180, 423 A.2d 558. Although the court\u2019s instructions on the law of the crime were advisory, the Court determined that all other instructions on the law were always binding upon the jury. <em>Id. </em>The following year, the Court in <em>Montgomery v. State, </em>292 Md. 84, 90, 437 A.2d 654 (1981), subscribed to that standard by concluding that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>court erred in advising the jury that <em>all </em>of the court\u2019s instructions were advisory. The <em>Montgomery </em>Court reasoned that, because \u201ccertain bedrock characteristics\u201d of a criminal trial, such as the presumption of innocence and the standard of proof, \u201care not \u2018the law of the crime\u2019 \u201d they are likewise \u201cnot advisory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 437 A.2d 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">We were confronted again with a postconviction case concerning advisory only instructions in <em>State v. Adams, </em>406 Md. 240, 958 A.2d 295 (2008). We reaffirmed the constitutional standard articulated in <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery, </em>determined that the standard was not \u201cnew law,\u201d and, consequently, concluded that a criminal defendant who had failed to object to the advisory only instruction at trial waived the right to assert it as a ground for postconviction relief. <em>Id. </em>at 256-61, 958 A.2d 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In 2012, we decided <em>Unger v. State, </em>427 Md. 383, 48 A.3d 242 (2012). We held that our precedent was clearly wrong in concluding that the <em>Stevenson </em>interpretation of Article 23 was not a new constitutional standard. <em>Id. </em>at 417, 48 A.3d 242. As a result, we held that a defendant could challenge his pre-<em>Stevenson </em>conviction through a postconviction proceeding notwithstanding that the defendant did not object to advisory only jury instructions at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 391, 48 A.3d 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Just a few years later, we were asked in <em>Waine </em>to overrule <em>Unger </em>as a wrongful departure from principles of <em>stare deci-sis, </em>and to resurrect what was once the law under <em>Stevenson, Montgomery, </em>and <em>Adams. </em>444 Md. at 699, 122 A.3d 294. We held that <em>Unger </em>was rightly decided and that <em>stare decisis </em>in fact required us to adhere to it. <em>Id. </em>at 700-02, 122 A.3d 294. Recognizing that the constitutional standard set forth in <em>Stevenson </em>\u2014 that the jury is the judge of the law of the crime and the judge\u2019s remaining instructions on the law are binding\u2014 was a change in the law that must be applied retroactively; we further held, pertinent to the case now before us, that a motion to reopen based on <em>Unger </em>satisfied the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d standard under the UPPA. <em>Id. </em>at 702-03, 122 A.3d 294; <em>see Gray v. State, </em>388 Md. 366, 382-83 n.7, 879 A.2d 1064 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>(2005) (concluding that, \u201c[w]hile it is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to decide when \u2018the interests of justice\u2019 require reopening,\u201d a \u201cchange made in the law that should be applied retroactively\u201d satisfies this standard). We held finally, informed by <em>Sullivan v. Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 281-82, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993), that an instruction that does not satisfy the new constitutional standard announced by <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>constitutes \u201cstructural error not susceptible to harmless error analysis.\u201d <em>Waine, </em>444 Md. at 705, 122 A.3d 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">From this, we can discern that a petitioner whose conviction resulted from a trial in which the jury was given advisory only instructions is entitled to have his postconviction proceedings reopened because such clearly erroneous instructions implicate the petitioner\u2019s federal constitutional right to due process. To deny reopening a postconviction proceeding to a petitioner whose conviction rests upon an error of constitutional dimension not subject to a harmless error analysis would necessarily be an abuse of discretion as \u201cwell removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what the court deems minimally acceptable.\u201d <em>Gray, </em>388 Md. at 383, 879 A.2d 1064 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">In 1978, Respondent, James Leslie Adams-Bey, Jr., was convicted by a jury of first degree rape and related offenses in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, and for those crimes he was sentenced to life plus ten years of incarceration. His convictions were affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals and this Court. <em>Adams v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 528, 406 A.2d 637 (1979), <em>aff'd, </em>289 Md. 221, 424 A.2d 344 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Respondent petitioned unsuccessfully for postconviction relief in 2010. On August 14, 2012, shortly after we had decided <em>Unger, </em>Respondent moved pro <em>se </em>to reopen his postconviction proceeding on the ground that the jurors at his criminal trial were given advisory only instructions in violation of his constitutional right to due process of law. Respondent argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>those instructions were unconstitutional because the jury was not instructed to follow the court\u2019s explanation of the law and the court did not inform the jury of the binding nature of its instructions on the State\u2019s burden of proof or the presumption of innocence. The trial court instructed the jury, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A13C\">Madam Foreman, Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, <em>at this point in the proceedings I am required to advise you concerning the law in this case. I purposely use the term \u201cadvise\u201d since in a criminal case, under Maryland law, you are the judges of both the law and the facts. </em>However, I wish foremost to impress upon you that you should not reach any conclusion from anything that I have said or may say from my tone of voice or manner in saying it, that I have an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. This decision is yours to make, solely, based upon the facts derived from the competent testimony which has been presented for your consideration <em>as applied to the law as you find it to be. In this regard, should court and counsel appear to differ as to [the] lain which is applicable, you should apply the law as you find it to be, not as you think it should be. </em>And during this process you are not privileged to make new law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">In arriving at your verdict, <em>you\u2019re advised </em>that in this State an accused is entitled throughout the entire proceedings to the presumption of innocence. The burden constantly rests upon the State to convince you beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty of every fact material to the guilt of the accused, including every circumstance that enters into [the] grade or the degree of the crime charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\"><em>You\u2019re further advised </em>that the burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the offense was committed but also it was the defendant who is the person who committed these offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>.... And you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the accuracy of the identification of the defendant before you may convict him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\">To warrant a conviction in a criminal case, the charge must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. If you, the jury, consider all the evidence and entertain a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s participation in the crime, you <em>should </em>acquit him. Thus, a defendant is entitled to an acquittal if the alibi evidence taken into consideration with all of the other evidence in the case, raises a reasonable doubt of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Gentlemen, that concludes the <em>advisory instructions. </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The State argued in response that the court\u2019s instructions were not advisory because they did not permit the jury to disregard the law. The State asserted that the instructions given at Respondent\u2019s trial \u201cmaterially differed from the <em>Unger </em>Court\u2019s instructions\u201d because the court did not \u201cinstruct the jury that the instructions were not binding upon them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The circuit court denied Respondent\u2019s motion without a hearing. In the court\u2019s written order, the court stated that, \u201c[o]n November 5, 2012, D. Scott Whitney, Chief Attorney for the Office of the Public Defender delivered a copy of the transcript from the September 14 and 15, 1978 Jury Trial before Judge Childs.\u201d The circuit court then denied the motion, \u201chaving read and considered Defendant\u2019s Motion, Amendments to Motion to Reopen Post Conviction Proceedings, Response and <em>transcript\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Respondent, now represented by the Office of the Public Defender, filed an application for leave to appeal. He argued that the circuit court abused its discretion by denying his motion to reopen because, similar to <em>Unger, </em>the \u201cclear message conveyed to the jury was that it was the ultimate arbiter of the law, despite what the judge said.\u201d The State reasserted that, unlike the instructions in <em>Unger, </em>\u201cthe court\u2019s instructions to Adams-Bey\u2019s jury presented it with a clear role,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>therefore the instructions did not implicate Respondent\u2019s due process rights or warrant reopening his postconviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">In an unreported two-page opinion, the Court of Special Appeals granted Respondent\u2019s application for leave to appeal and addressed the merits of his appeal. The Court, citing the pertinent portion of the trial court\u2019s instructions, recognized that the jurors in Respondent\u2019s trial received an advisory only instruction similar to that given in <em>Unger. </em>Noting Respondent\u2019s argument that the \u201ccircuit court had abused its discretion in denying his motion,\u201d and that <em>Waine </em>had clarified that an advisory only instruction was structural error that \u201cmandated that the convictions be vacated,\u201d the Court \u201creverse[d] the circuit court\u2019s order denying Adams-Bey\u2019s motion to reopen his post-conviction proceeding\u201d and remanded \u201cto reopen Adams-Bey\u2019s post-conviction proceeding to consider his <em>Unger </em>claim and, thereafter, to vacate Adams-Bey\u2019s convictions and award him a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">As noted at the outset of this opinion, we granted certiorari in this case to review the provisions of the UPPA that grant the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals their respective authority to decide a motion to reopen in the first instance and to review that decision on appeal. Because the propriety of the circuit court\u2019s and the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s decisions depends upon an analysis of the instructions given at Respondent\u2019s trial, we must also clarify the state of the law on advisory only instructions and reaffirm the consequence of a structural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\"> The UPPA allows convicted persons to file a petition for post-conviction relief claiming that \u201cthe sentence or judgment was imposed in violation of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution or laws of the State[.]\u201d \u00a77-102(a)(1). The UPPA limits a petitioner to file only one petition. \u00a7 7-103. If a petitioner is denied postconviction relief, a petitioner may seek to reopen that postconviction proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>by filing a motion with the court. <em>See Gray, </em>388 Md. at 379-80, 879 A.2d 1064; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 7-108 (distinguishing between a petition and a motion; a petitioner is entitled to counsel and a hearing when filing a petition but not when seeking to reopen). Pursuant to \u00a7 7-104, \u201c[t]he court may reopen a postconviction proceeding that was previously concluded if the court determines that the action is in the interests of justice.\u201d We have interpreted \u00a7 7-104 to leave \u201cwithin the court\u2019s discretion to decide, in the interests of justice, if a postconviction proceeding should be reopened.\u201d <em>Gray, </em>388 Md. at 382, 879 A.2d 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The State has asked us to decide whether \u00a7 7-104 authorizes the Court of Special Appeals to order that a postconviction proceeding be reopened. The State argues that the \u201ccourt\u201d referenced in \u00a7 7-104 refers only to the circuit court and, consequently, the circuit court alone must decide whether granting a motion to reopen is in the interests of justice. According to the State, the Court of Special Appeals violated the dictates of \u00a7 7-104 by reviewing the circuit court\u2019s order <em>de novo, </em>deciding for itself that granting Respondent a new trial is in the interests of justice, and ordering the circuit court to afford Respondent postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">We conclude that the plain language of \u00a7 7-104, read in the context of the UPPA in its entirety, makes clear that the General Assembly was referring to the circuit court. <em>See Haile v. State, </em>431 Md. 448, 470, 66 A.3d 600 (2013) (explaining the canon of statutory interpretation that requires courts to look at the statutory scheme and the context in which the statute belongs). Section 7-102 sets forth the rights of convicted persons under UPPA to bring a petition \u201cunder this title in the circuit court for the county in which the conviction took place.\u201d Section 7-103 limits a petitioner to file one petition within ten years. Although \u00a7 7-104 only uses the word \u201ccourt\u201d rather than \u201ccircuit court\u201d in establishing the court\u2019s authority to reopen a postconviction proceeding, the statute logically refers and applies only to the circuit court. We have given \u00a7 7-104 that interpretation uniformly. <em>See Alston v. State, </em>425 Md. 326, 333-38, 40 A.3d 1028 (2012) (reviewing the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>court\u2019s power to reopen under \u00a7 7-104 upon the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration); <em>Evans v. State, </em>396 Md. 256, 277-78, 914 A.2d 25 (2006) (explaining that this Court reviews the circuit court\u2019s denial of a petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen a postconviction proceeding under \u00a7 7-104 for abuse of discretion); <em>Gray, </em>388 Md. at 384, 879 A.2d 1064 (concluding that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion to deny reopening under \u00a7 7-104). Section 7-104 is further unambiguous in the context of the statutory scheme as a whole because the UPPA specifically refers to the intermediate appellate court as the \u201cCourt of Special Appeals\u201d in other sections. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7-107 to 7-109. It follows necessarily that the Court of Special Appeals derives no authority from \u00a7 7-104 to determine that granting a motion to reopen is in the interests of justice and to order the circuit court to grant that relief. That only the circuit court has the discretion to decide initially whether to grant or deny a motion to reopen does not resolve, however, the scope of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s authority to review that decision on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Rather, we must look to \u00a7 7-109, which delineates the scope of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s jurisdiction once an application for leave to appeal is granted. Section 7-109(a) provides that, \u201cafter the court passes an order in accordance with this subtitle,\u201d the party aggrieved, either the petitioner or the State, \u201cmay apply to the Court of Special Appeals for leave to appeal the order.\u201d Section 7-109(b)(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">(3) If the application for leave to appeal is granted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">(i) the procedure for the appeal shall meet the requirements of the Maryland Rules; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">(ii) the Court of Special Appeals may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-9\">1. affirm, reverse, or modify the order appealed from; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-11\">2. remand the case for further proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">Notable for our purposes, the General Assembly in \u00a7 7-109 did not distinguish between the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s authority to review a petition for postconviction relief and a motion to reopen a postconviction proceeding. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>When the General Assembly draws no such distinction, neither should we. <em>See Bost v. State, </em>406 Md. 341, 350, 958 A.2d 356 (2008) (\u201cWe neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). The plain language of \u00a7 7-109 permits the intermediate appellate court in either case to affirm, reverse, or modify the judgment of the circuit court or remand to that court for further proceedings. The Court of Special Appeals, as does this Court, reviews a circuit court\u2019s order in this regard for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gray, </em>388 Md. at 383, 879 A.2d 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The State\u2019s argument that the Court of Special Appeals erred in reversing the circuit court\u2019s order, and requiring the court to grant Respondent relief, rises and falls with its determination that the Court of Special Appeals reviewed <em>de novo </em>the circuit court\u2019s denial of Respondent\u2019s motion to reopen. The State\u2019s contention finds no support in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion and ignores the strong presumption that judges know the law and apply it correctly. <em>See Abdul-Maleek v. State, </em>426 Md. 59, 74, 43 A.3d 383 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion did not state expressly that it was reviewing the circuit court\u2019s decision either <em>de novo or for </em>an abuse of discretion. It does not follow necessarily, however, that the Court of Special Appeals ignored the standard of review to which it was bound and instead made its own interests of justice determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Our reading of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion leads to a different conclusion. The Court of Special Appeals recognized that appellate review of a motion to reopen is limited to an abuse of discretion because it framed Respondent\u2019s argument around that standard. Not once did the Court of Special Appeals use the phrase <em>\u201cde novo,\u201d </em>nor did that court even opine that granting Respondent\u2019s motion was in the interests of justice. Rather, the Court of Special Appeals recited succinctly the law of advisory instructions, reviewed the instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>tions given at Respondent\u2019s trial, recognized that a structural error occurred, and determined consequently that the circuit court had abused its discretion in denying Respondent\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Kusi v. State, </em>438 Md. 362, 385, 91 A.3d 1192 (2014) (\u201cWhen the trial court exhibits a clear failure to consider the proper legal standard in reaching a decision, such an action constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Jenkins v. State, </em>375 Md. 284, 296, 825 A.2d 1008 (2003) (explaining that \u201cthe breadth of a trial judge\u2019s discretion to grant or deny a new trial is not fixed or immutable; rather it will expand or contract depending upon the nature of the factors being considered\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019s conclusion that the circuit court had abused its discretion, and its reversal of the judgment of that court on that basis, is consistent with the scope of its authority under \u00a7 7-109. Section 7-109 grants the Court of Special Appeals the authority to <em>reverse </em>or <em>remand </em>a circuit court\u2019s decision to deny a motion to reopen. That section therefore provides the Court of Special Appeals the authority to determine that the circuit court had abused its discretion and to afford the appropriate relief. If our intermediate appellate court was powerless to grant relief when a circuit court abused its discretion, then, as Respondent argues, the \u201c \u2018interests of justice standard\u2019 and the right to appellate review are meaningless.\u201d Section 7-109 permits such meaningful review, and we hold that the Court of Special Appeals acted within its statutory authority under \u00a7 7-109 in reviewing the circuit court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">We also hold that the Court of Special Appeals concluded correctly that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying Respondent\u2019s motion to reopen. That the circuit court did not hold a hearing on the motion to reopen or issue a written opinion explaining its reasons for the denial does not preclude an appellate court from reviewing the circuit court\u2019s decision. <em>See Gray, </em>388 Md. at 384-85, 879 A.2d 1064 (review<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>ing the circuit court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion and noting that the circuit court\u2019s brief statement that it considered the parties\u2019 arguments, along with the record, \u201cwas enough to inform the parties and the appellate courts of the reasons for [the court\u2019s] decision\u201d). Like in <em>Gray, </em>we can discern the circuit court\u2019s rationale for denying Respondent\u2019s motion to reopen. The basis of Respondent\u2019s motion was his <em>Unger </em>claim, and the briefs in support of each party were largely devoted to the question of whether the instructions given at Respondent\u2019s trial were sufficiently \u201cadvisory\u201d to satisfy the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d standard for reopening his postconviction proceeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The circuit court considered both parties\u2019 arguments and \u201cread and considered\u201d the transcript of Respondent\u2019s jury trial, yet denied the motion nevertheless. Having read the transcript of Respondent\u2019s trial, including the jury instructions, the circuit court concluded necessarily that those instructions were not advisory and therefore <em>Unger </em>did not warrant reopening his postconviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The parties dispute whether the instructions given at Respondent\u2019s trial were sufficiently \u201cadvisory\u201d to run afoul of due process. The State argues that the court\u2019s instructions were unlike those at issue in <em>Unger </em>and <em>Waine, </em>in which the juries were told that they were at liberty to disregard the courts\u2019 instructions. In <em>Unger, </em>the trial court had stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">Under the Constitution of Maryland, the jury in a criminal case is the Judge of the Law as well as the facts. <em>Therefore, anything which I may say about the law, including any instructions which I may give you, is merely adviso'ty and you are not in any way bound by it. You may feel free to reject my advice on the law and to arrive at your own independent conclusions.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">You are to make the sole determination as to what the evidence is and what the law is. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>427 Md. at 392, 48 A.3d 242 (alteration in original) (emphasis added). The trial court in <em>Waine </em>instructed similarly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">Under the Constitution and laws of the State, the jury in a criminal case is the judge of both the law and the facts and <em>anything that I say to you aboiot the law is advisory only. It is intended to help you, btd you are at liberty to reject the Court\u2019s advice on the lato and to arrive at your own independent conclusion on it, if you desire to do so.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">444 Md. at 697, 122 A.3d 294 (emphasis added). According to the State, the court\u2019s instructions at Respondent\u2019s trial pass constitutional muster because they did not include such advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">We conclude that the jurors at Respondent\u2019s trial received what were unquestionably advisory only instructions and, as a consequence of that structural error, Respondent is entitled to a new trial. The new constitutional standard announced in <em>Stevenson </em>is that the jury is the judge of the law of the crime and the judge\u2019s remaining instructions on the law are binding. 289 Md. at 180, 423 A.2d 558. Because bedrock constitutional principles such as the presumption of innocence and the standard of proof \u201care not \u2018the law of the crime,\u2019 \u201d the jury <em>must be told </em>that. <em>Montgomery, </em>292 Md. at 91, 437 A.2d 654. Consequently, the latter portion of the <em>Stevenson </em>rule\u2014 that the jury is bound by the court\u2019s instructions on the law other than the substantive law of the crime \u2014 is necessary to render constitutional an advisory only instruction. Lest there be any doubt, a jury instruction advising the jury that it is the judge of the law is an advisory only instruction. Such an instruction constitutes structural error if the court does not also inform the jury that it is bound by the presumption of innocence and the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. <em>See Robertson v. State, </em>295 Md. 688, 689, 457 A.2d 826 (1983) (per curiam) (concluding that the defendant \u201cwas entitled to an instruction that the court\u2019s comments on the burden of proof were not merely advisory but were binding upon the jury\u201d and that the \u201c[fjailure to give the requested instruction constituted reversible error\u201d); <em>Montgomery, </em>292 Md. at 91, 437 A.2d 654 (concluding that the trial judge erred in advising the jury that all of his instructions were advisory because \u201ccertain bedrock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>characteristics\u201d such as the presumption of innocence and standard of proof \u201care not \u2018the law of the crime\u2019 \u201d and \u201care not advisory\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Because the court\u2019s instructions to the jury at Respondent\u2019s trial did not follow the standard set forth by <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery, </em>those instructions were structurally erroneous. The trial court\u2019s instructions were framed by the concept that the jury was merely being \u201cadvised\u201d because the jurors \u201care the judges of both the law and the facts.\u201d The jurors were granted permission to apply the law as they found it to be, and the trial court repeated the advisory nature of its instructions when it instructed on the presumption of innocence and the State\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. At the close of the court\u2019s instructions, the trial court stated: \u201cGentlemen, that concludes the <em>advisory instructions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The court made no distinction between the \u201claw of the crime\u201d and the court\u2019s remaining instructions on the law, upon which the jury was bound.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And, in particular, the court declined to inform the jury of the binding nature of the court\u2019s instructions on matters of bedrock constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The State\u2019s reliance upon the instructions given in <em>Unger </em>and <em>Waine </em>is misplaced. Although those juries were told expressly that they could reject all of the courts\u2019 advice, which might have made those advisory instructions more <em>overtly </em>unconstitutional, that language was not dispositive. Rather, it was the courts\u2019 admonishment that the jury was the judge of the law and the failure to instruct that the jury was bound by the courts\u2019 instructions on the law other than the substantive law of the crime, if there happened to be such a dispute. <em>See Unger, </em>427 Md. at 388 n. 2, 48 A.3d 242 (\u201c[A] judge\u2019s instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>tions to the jury concerning the burden of proof, the presumption of innocence, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and other matters implicating federal constitutional requirements, must be binding upon the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In the present case, it matters not that the court\u2019s instructions did not include the precise language used in the trials of Mr. Unger and Mr. Waine. It is enough that the jurors were told that they were the judges of the law and should apply the law as they found it to be, and they were not instructed that they were bound by the court\u2019s instructions regarding the presumption of innocence and the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jenkins v. Hutchinson, </em>221 F.3d 679, 681 (4th Cir.2000) (concluding that the court gave advisory only instructions at the defendant\u2019s trial when the court stated that \u201c[y]ou will note that I use the word \u2018advisory\u2019 and I do so intentionally in that in this case, as is true in all criminal cases in Maryland, <em>it is the function of the jury to be the sole judges of both the facts and the law\u201d). </em>It follows necessarily that the court\u2019s instructions constituted structural error and rendered Respondent\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">We similarly reject the State\u2019s contention that \u201c[i]t can hardly be said that these instructions \u2018g[a]ve the jury permission to disregard any or all of the court\u2019s instructions, including those bedrock due process instructions on the presumption of innocence and the State\u2019s burden of proving the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d (Alteration in original) (quoting <em>Waine, </em>444 Md. at 704, 122 A.3d 294). That argument reflects an attempt to resurrect the \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d argument that we rejected expressly in <em>Waine. </em>In <em>Waine, </em>the State had urged us to adopt a case-by-case analysis for analyzing advisory only jury instructions, in which the post-conviction court would decide whether there was a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that the jurors understood that they could disregard the court\u2019s instructions on the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 444 Md. at 703, 122 A.3d 294. We declined that invitation because the reasonable likelihood test applies to review of ambiguous jury instructions. <em>Id. </em>at 704, 122 A.3d 294. In so declining, we recognized that advisory only jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>instructions are not ambiguous: \u201crather, such instructions are clear, but erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In comparing the instructions at Respondent\u2019s trial with those at issue in <em>Unger </em>and <em>Waine </em>and then suggesting that Respondent\u2019s jurors were not similarly affected, the State is arguing essentially that the jurors at Respondent\u2019s trial did not understand the judge\u2019s instructions to allow them to disregard matters of constitutional significance. Whether that is so, in light of <em>Waine, </em>is now irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">We emphasize that the constitutional infirmity at issue here is of the sort that \u201cwill always invalidate the conviction.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>508 U.S. at 279, 113 S.Ct. 2078. In the face of an instruction that \u201ccreate[d] the risk that the jury will convict the defendant even if the State has not met its required burden of proof,\u201d <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 291, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991) (White, J., dissenting), Respondent\u2019s conviction is essentially a nullity, <em>see Sullivan, </em>508 U.S. at 280, 113 S.Ct. 2078 (concluding that \u201cthere has been no jury verdict within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment\u201d when the jurors did not receive a proper reasonable doubt instruction). Consequently, there would be no purpose to remand to the circuit court to reconsider Respondent\u2019s motion in light of <em>Waine, </em>as suggested by the State. The error in the trial court\u2019s instructions was apparent within the four corners of the transcript and there is no further fact finding that needs to be conducted to decide the merits of Respondent\u2019s <em>Unger </em>claim. The Court of Special Appeals did not err in recognizing the structural error and ordering the circuit court to grant the appropriate relief. Having confirmed that the trial court gave an advisory instruction, Respondent is necessarily entitled to a new trial, and it would be an abuse of discretion to deny Respondent relief in light of <em>Waine. See Rose v. Clark, </em>478 U.S. 570, 577-78, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460 (1986) (noting that, when a defendant is deprived of those constitutional protections that constitute structural error, \u201ca criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence, and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>It also bears emphasis, moving forward, that trial courts at the time of Respondent\u2019s trial were <em>required </em>to give an advisory instruction under both Article 23 and Maryland Rule 757b.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is virtually certain that a court during that era would have given such an instruction and not effectively nullify it immediately thereafter by informing the jury of the binding nature of its instructions on constitutional matters. <em>Cf. Schowgurow v. State, </em>240 Md. 121, 125-26, 213 A.2d 475 (1965) (noting that \u201c[t]he conclusion is inescapable\u201d that the jury at the petitioner\u2019s trial was required to declare a belief in God because Article 36, at that time, imposed such a requirement and there exists a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that judges perform their duties). Only in such an extraordinary case \u2014 if ever there might be one \u2014 could it perhaps be a proper exercise of discretion to deny a motion to reopen postconviction proceedings on an <em>Unger </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">This case is not unlike those instances that have come before us where a change in the law on constitutional matters invalidated uniformly the sentences or convictions derived from those now-unconstitutional practices. <em>Bartholomey v. State, </em>267 Md. 175, 297 A.2d 696 (1972), is one such example. That case came to us on remand from the Supreme Court after its decision in <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 239-40, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) (per curiam), which held that statutes that permitted the imposition of the death penalty on a discretionary basis were unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. We noted that the Supreme Court had summarily vacated the death sentences in the consolidated cases before it and the 120 other cases that were still pending on the Court\u2019s docket. <em>Bartholomey, </em>267 Md. at 182-83, 297 A.2d 696. We therefore determined that the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Furman </em>\u201cinvalidate[d] <em>all </em>death penalties imposed pursuant to discretionary statutes ... without regard to the nature of the offense, the particular circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>stances under which the crime was committed, or the particular procedure followed in imposing the death sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184, 297 A.2d 696. As a consequence, Mr. Bartholomey\u2019s sentence was likewise invalidated \u2014 without further discussion on the merits \u2014 and we remanded to the sentencing court with instruction to impose a new sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 185-86, 297 A.2d 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The same result inures here. Respondent\u2019s trial was rendered constitutionally defective by virtue of the advisory only instructions provided to his jury and, accordingly, he is entitled to a new trial. The circuit court abused its discretion by determining that Respondent\u2019s motion to reopen did not satisfy the interests of justice standard. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY ANNE ARUN-DEL COUNTY.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Watts, J., joins in the judgment only.</p>\n<author id=\"b736-8\">Judge Watts</author>\n<p id=\"A0Kq\">joins the judgment only and writes separately as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Respectfully, I join the judgment only, and write briefly to explain my reasons for doing so. Consistent with my dissent in State v. Waine, 444 Md. 692, 708, 122 A.3d 294, 303 (2015) (Watts, J., dissenting), in my view, the decision in Unger v. State, 427 Md. 383, 411, 48 A.3d 242, 258 (2012), was clearly wrong and was a repackaging of the dissent in State v. Adams, 406 Md. 240, 312-40, 958 A.2d 295, 339-56 (2008) (Eldridge, J., dissenting). From my perspective, Unger represented an abandonment of the principle of <em>stare </em>decisis; and, as this Court determined in Adams, 406 Md. at 256, 958 A.2d at 305, the interpretation of Article 23 (Trial by Jury) of the Maryland Declaration of Rights in Stevenson v. State, 289 Md. 167, 178, 423 A.2d 558, 564 (1980) did not set forth a new constitutional standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">That said, to be sure, the law, as developed in Unger and Waine, is indisputably that, where \u201cadvisory instructions\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>were given at a trial that occurred before this Court issued Stevenson, a petitioner is entitled to postconviction relief in the form of the reopening of the postconviction proceeding and the award of a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the Majority indicates, instructions are \u201cadvisory\u201d where a trial court instructs the jurors that they are the judges of the law, and the trial court fails to instruct the jury that the trial court\u2019s instructions on matters other than the law of the crime, such as the State\u2019s burden of proof and the presumption of innocence, are <em>binding </em>\u2014 ie., not advisory. Thus, for example, in my view, where a trial court instructs a jury that the trial court\u2019s instructions on the law of the crime are \u201cadvisory only,\u201d but that all of the trial court\u2019s other instructions are binding, such instructions would not be deemed \u201cadvisory instructions\u201d of the type that Unger proscribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Determining that instructions are indeed \u201cadvisory instructions\u201d requires more than a determination that the instructions are \u201csimilar\u201d to those in Unger. Here, the Court of Special Appeals was required to go further than simply stating that \u201cthe trial court at Adams-Bey\u2019s 1978 trial gave a similar \u2018advisory only\u2019 jury instruction[.]\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I do not disagree that Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. (\u201cCP\u201d) \u00a7 7-109 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> permits an appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>court to reverse and remand with instructions that a circuit court reopen a postconviction proceeding and award a new trial. To reverse and remand to the circuit court for reopening and a new trial under CP \u00a7 7-109, however, an appellate court is required to determine that the jury instructions were indeed \u201cadvisory instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Similarly, a trial court that is faced with a petition to reopen a postconviction proceeding based on an Unger claim must evaluate whether the jury instructions were indeed \u201cadvisory instructions,\u201d as defined by Unger. The Majority\u2019s use of the term \u201cnecessarily,\u201d Maj. Op. at 706-07, 144 A.3d at 1210, does not mean that a trial court should automatically grant a petition to reopen a postconviction proceeding based on an Unger claim \u2014 or, for that matter, grant such a petition because the jury instructions were \u201csimilar\u201d to those that the trial court gave in Unger. Instead, a trial court, when faced with a petition to reopen a postconviction proceeding \u2014 and the Court of Special Appeals, when faced with an application for leave to appeal from the denial of a petition to reopen a postconviction proceeding \u2014 must determine whether the jury was instructed that the trial court\u2019s instructions on matters other than the law of the crime, such as the State\u2019s burden of proof and the presumption of innocence, were \u201cadvisory.\u201d Here, however, in its unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals did not make such a determination. The Majority affirms the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals only after analyzing the instant jury instructions and determining that they were indeed \u201cadvisory.\u201d See Maj. Op. at 706-07, 144 A.3d at 1210. From my perspective, though, although the Majority determines that the instructions in this case were \u201cadvisory instructions,\u201d the Majority opinion is not clear that, going forward, trial and appellate courts must engage in a similar determination that alleged advisory instructions are indeed \u201cadvisory instructions\u201d before granting relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>What is clear is that, when confronted with Unger claims, trial courts and the Court of Special Appeals must review the jury instructions and determine whether they were indeed \u201cadvisory instructions\u201d that Unger proscribes. The mere allegation that instructions were \u201cadvisory instructions,\u201d or that the instructions were similar to those that the trial court gave in Unger, is not sufficient to establish structural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">For the above reasons, respectfully, I join the judgment only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-13\">.

The State concedes that there was no dispute as to the law of the crime in this case. As a result, pursuant to our decision in <em>Montgomery, </em>the jury should not have been instructed that <em>any </em>of the court\u2019s instructions were advisory, much less those instructions on constitutional principles. <em>See Montgomery, </em>292 Md. at 89, 437 A.2d 654 (concluding that the trial court should not have instructed that its instructions were advisory because there was no substantive dispute as to the law of the crime).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b735-6\">.
