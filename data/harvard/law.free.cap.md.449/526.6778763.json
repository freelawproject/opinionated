We agree that, under the totality of the circumstances, the facts of this case fall short of the reasonable suspicion standard, under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1884, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 911 (1968), and therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The relevant facts are taken from testimony presented at a suppression hearing, and we view them in a light most favorable to the State, the prevailing party at that hearing. On November 12, 2013, at approximately 2 a.m., Corporal William Daughters, a twenty-four-year veteran of the Anne Arundel County Police Department, and Officer Dan Kramer, a trainee, were on patrol. The officers were driving through a large apartment complex in Glen Burnie that contained over fifty buildings and had approximately one thousand residents. Corporal Daughters indicated that the complex was considered a high crime area, because, in the year that he had been patrolling that area, there had been a shooting, the recovery of handguns, multiple thefts from cars, and drug arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">As the two officers entered the complex, they observed a vehicle stopping at a stop sign; the driver waited for the officers to cross the intersection before proceeding. As the officers drove through the complex, they observed an individual, later identified as Sellman, walk from a dark area on the side of one of the apartment buildings where there was no entry way towards an area lit by a street light. Corporal Daughters testified that \u201cit appeared we startled him.\u201d The officer explained that Sellman \u201ccame to an abrupt stop, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>then quickly, he started to turn to his right, but then stopped and then watched our car as it went by.\u201d Once the officers drove past him, Sellman continued on his way. Corporal Daughters observed Sellman through his rearview mirror, and saw him walk at a normal pace \u201ctoward[s] the roadway and [he] walked toward[s] the parking area. There are cars parked along the shoulder on that roadway, and he appeared to be walking towards those cars.\u201d He noticed that the vehicle he had previously seen at the stop sign \u201cstopped in the roadway and then the person on foot[, Sellman,] got into the left rear door of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Corporal Daughters later testified: \u201cI just thought it appeared odd at that point, people out on foot and people\u2014 instead of everyone getting into a car in one location, picking somebody up around the corner .... \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The officers turned the patrol car around, and followed the vehicle. Upon noticing that the vehicle had a broken rear taillight and a broken tag light dangling by its wiring harness below the bumper, Corporal Daughters activated the emergency lights, and the driver immediately pulled over.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The officers exited the patrol car, and approached the stopped vehicle from different sides. Corporal Daughters approached the driver\u2019s side and observed four occupants inside, including Sellman who was in the left-rear passenger seat.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Corporal Daughters explained to the driver, Samantha Gilles<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>pie, why he had pulled her over, and requested her driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration. Gillespie explained that she was unsure where the registration was, because she was borrowing the car from a friend, however, she did provide her driver\u2019s license. When asked why she was in the neighborhood, Gillespie explained that she was there to pick up Andrea Queen, a resident who lived in a nearby apartment. Officer Kramer testified: \u201cThe driver stated that they were taking her pregnant friend to go out and get some food[.]\u201d Queen was in the right-rear passenger seat opposite the driver. Corporal Daughters asked Queen if she had any identification. She responded no, but indicated that she lived in the complex. Corporal Daughters later testified that he had encountered Queen on a previous occasion, and had reason to believe she did not live at this particular complex.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He also testified that Sellman\u2019s behavior was unusual, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">On my first approach to the vehicle up to the point where I had actually physically asked him questions, where he had to respond to me, Mr. Sellman was sitting completely rigid in his seat, he had his hands on his knees and was looking straight ahead and never turned his head once.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The officers returned to the patrol car to conduct a warrant check on Gillespie, which came up negative. They also used the police database to access records from the Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) in order to check the status of the ^ driver and the vehicle she was driving; the vehicle was not reported as being stolen. The officers exited the patrol car, and returned to the stopped vehicle. Gillespie was given a written warning and then Corporal Daughters asked her to exit the vehicle. He took her to the rear of the vehicle, identified the broken lights, and told her that they needed to be repaired. At this time, Corporal Daughters asked Gillespie whether she had anything illegal in the car, and she responded no. He asked for permission to search the vehicle. Gillespie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>asked why, and Corporal Daughters explained \u201cwe had some problems in the area with some thefts and some drugs, and that kind of thing.\u201d Both officers testified that Gillespie consented to the search.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Corporal Daughters then asked Gillespie if the left-rear passenger, Sellman, lived in the apartment complex. She stated yes, and that she had picked him up as well. Gillespie remained with Officer Kramer while Corporal Daughters returned to the stopped car. Corporal Daughters testified that \u201cbecause of the history surrounding the apartment complex, I wanted to identify everybody in the vehicle.\u201d He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">I went back up to the vehicle [to obtain identification from the other occupants]. Again, at that point, I had a somewhat conflicting story about who lived in the apartment complex. The only one that stated they had, was the right-rear passenger, [Queen,] the female.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">When asked why this was conflicting, Corporal Daughters testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">Because now, the driver was saying that the left-rear passenger[, Sellman,] also lived in the apartment complex, yet when I asked the group in the car when I first approached who lived in the apartment complex, the only one that said they did, was the right-rear passenger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Prior to conducting the search, he asked the three passengers to identify themselves. The front-seat passenger, a male, provided identification. Corporal Daughters testified that Sell-man \u201ckept looking straight ahead and never looked at me[,]\u201d however, \u201c[o]nce I actually asked him a question, he turned toward me and gave me the name and date of birth.\u201d Queen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>also provided her name and date of birth. The officer then asked Sellman if he lived in the complex and Sellman replied that he did not, which conflicted with Gillespie\u2019s earlier statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Officer Kramer remained with Gillespie while Corporal Daughters returned to the patrol car to run warrant checks and a history on the three occupants, including the alias provided by Sellman: Marcus Neal Saunders, born July 12, 1982. While he was running a history on the names using the police database, Corporal Daughters contacted Corporal Miller<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and asked him to come to the scene to assist, because there were four detainees \u2014 two men and two females \u2014 and two officers at the scene. He wanted the parking lot checked to see if any cars had been broken into. After running the warrant checks, \u201c[a]ll three came back with no warrants.\u201d However, \u201cthe name Saunders had absolutely no record through [the] MVA, local arrest records, anything.\u201d He testified that this was unusual.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He also testified that he was confident in the identity of the other three occupants, because two had provided identification, and he knew the third, Queen, from a previous encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Corporal Miller arrived shortly thereafter and exited his patrol car. Officer Kramer remained with Gillespie at the rear of the stopped vehicle while Corporal Miller approached the vehicle from the right side, and Corporal Daughters approached the vehicle from the left side. Corporal Daughters opened the left rear door, and again questioned Sellman about his name. Sellman replied that he had provided his correct name, and when the officer informed him that no records came up under that name, Sellman explained that \u201che\u2019[d] never had a driver\u2019s license, he\u2019[d] never been arrested, [and] he\u2019[d] never been in trouble.\u201d The officer then ordered Sellman out of the vehicle, and had him place his hands on the trunk of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>car. Corporal Daughters testified that he conducted the frisk, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\">At that point, I had again conflicting stories about who had been picked up where, whether anybody at all lived in the apartment complex, if anybody, [and i]t was odd that they were driving through the parking lot, [and Gillespie informed me she was] picking people up on foot at that hour of the morning .... And before I continue any further, or continue to a search of the vehicle, which Ms. Gillespie allowed us to do, I wanted to make sure none of the passengers were carrying any weapons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">He testified that it was his intent to search the vehicle. At the suppression hearing, the State asked \u201cwhat is the normal course of procedure or the normal standard operating procedures\u201d prior to conducting a search of a vehicle. Corporal Daughters responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">We will take the individuals out of a car ... have them step out, individually, and make sure that they\u2019re not carrying weapons or anything that can harm us ... once they\u2019re out of the car. And then once the car is clear, officers or an officer will stay with the passengers or driver, whoever the occupants of the vehicle are.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">He testified that he asked Sellman if he had any weapons on him and Sellman responded no. Then, Corporal Daughters frisked Sellman, pursuant to these standard operating procedures, and discovered a handgun in Sellman\u2019s waistband.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Prior to trial, Sellman moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the frisk. He argued that the frisk was unconstitutional, because the officers lacked a reasonable basis to believe Sellman was armed and dangerous. On April 2 and 22, 2014, a pre-trial suppression hearing took place in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Corporal Daughters testified for the State; Ms. Gillespie testified for the defense; Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Kramer testified as a rebuttal witness for the State in order to corroborate Corporal Daughters\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The motions judge denied the motion to suppress, and upheld the frisk of Sellman. The judge found the initial traffic stop was valid, because the vehicle had a broken taillight and tag light, and that Gillespie freely and voluntarily consented to the search the vehicle. She also found credible the officers\u2019 description of Sellman: \u201c[H]e appeared to be nervous, how he was rigid, how he was looking ahead.\u201d Lastly, the judge found that the pat down was valid. According to the suppression court, there was reasonable articulable suspicion to frisk Sell-man, because the officers \u201cwere outnumbered at that point in time; They were in a high-crime area [and] it was late at night; The Defendant had come from a dark area; His [rigid and nervous] behavior in the vehicle led to some suspicion on their part .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">At trial, Sellman entered into a not guilty agreed statement of facts to the charges of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime. He was found guilty on both charges and was sentenced to a total of ten years in prison, the first five to be served without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Sellman appealed the constitutionality of the frisk to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, a divided panel of the intermediate appellate court affirmed the denial of the motion to suppress. It held, based on its review of the totality of the circumstances, that the facts created reasonable suspicion that Sellman was armed and dangerous, and that he had committed or was planning to commit a crime. Therefore, it reasoned, it was permissible for Corporal Daughters to frisk Sellman in the interest of officer safety. One judge dissented, and stated: \u201cIt is painfully obvious that the officers frisked [ ] Sellman not because they were acting upon reasonable suspicion that he was armed and dangerous, but because they routinely conduct suspicionless searches of every passenger in every car they search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Sellman filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court. We granted <em>certiorari </em>to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">1. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in finding the police had reasonable suspicion to believe Mr. Sellman was armed and dangerous, simply because he was stopped for generally suspicious conduct in a high crime area where thefts from cars had been reported at some unspecified time in the past?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in finding that the crime of theft from cars implies the use of a deadly weapon?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-6\"><em>Sellman v. State, </em>446 Md. 218, 130 A.3d 507 (2016). For the reasons stated below, we answer the questions in the affirmative. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment was inadmissible. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">At issue is the propriety of the denial of a motion to suppress evidence obtained by way of a frisk. We have previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">When reviewing the disposition of a motion to suppress evidence alleged to have been seized in contravention of the Fourth Amendment ...., we view the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing, and the inferences fairly deducible therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed on the motion. The appellate court defers to the trial court\u2019s fact-finding at the suppression hearing, unless the trial court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. Nevertheless, in resolving the ultimate question of whether the detention or attendant search of an individual\u2019s person or property violates the Fourth Amendment, we make our own independent constitutional appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case. Thus, this Court considers the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing, construed in the light most favorable to the State as the prevailing party at the suppression hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZTa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number><em>Bailey, </em>412 Md. at 362, 987 A.2d at 80 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). <em>See also Nathan v. State, </em>370 Md. 648, 659, 805 A.2d 1086, 1093 (2002) (\u201cWe will review the legal questions <em>de novo </em>and based upon the evidence presented at the suppression hearing and the applicable law, we then make our own constitutional appraisal.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Sellman argues that the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals should be reversed, because the facts do not amount to reasonable suspicion to justify a frisk under <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. at 1884, 20 L.Ed.2d at 911. Sellman argues that the record is devoid of any facts indicating he was armed or dangerous, or linking him to the suspected crime of theft of property from cars. He contends that the intermediate appellate court erred in justifying the frisk based on a generalized concern about car break-ins occurring in the area where he was stopped, which falls short of reasonable suspicion. In his brief, Sellman argued: \u201cThe [intermediate appellate] court relied on the purportedly violent nature of car break-ins, and the likelihood of weapon use, yet required no nexus between Mr. Sellman and that particular crime.\u201d He posits that to affirm the decision \u201cwould allow police to automatically frisk anyone who is stopped on reasonable suspicion as long as it takes place in a high crime area where violent crimes occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Naturally, the State disputes Sellman\u2019s interpretation of Court of Special Appeals\u2019 unreported opinion, and argues that the frisk was justified by reasonable suspicion that Sellman was armed and dangerous. For support, the State cites to several cases, including cases from other jurisdictions, where factors, such as the time of night, a location in a high crime area, or a suspect\u2019s nervous behavior, supported a <em>Terry </em>frisk of a car occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Fourth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Holt v. State, </em>435 Md. 443, 458, 78 A.3d 415, 423 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>(2013). It guarantees \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures[.]\u201d U.S. Const. amend. IV; <em>see Lewis v. State, </em>398 Md. 349, 361, 920 A.2d 1080, 1087 (2007) (\u201cThe Fourth Amendment, however, is not \u2018a guarantee against all searches and seizures, but only against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). \u201c[T]he touchstone of our analysis under the Fourth Amendment is always the reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen\u2019s personal security.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>398 Md. at 361, 920 A.2d at 1087 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cReasonableness, of course, depends on a balance between the public interest and the individual\u2019s right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law officers.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 109, 98 S.Ct. 330, 332, 54 L.Ed.2d 331, 336 (1977) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cIn these stop and frisk cases, the reviewing court \u2018must evaluate the reasonableness of a particular search or seizure in light of the particular circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Underwood v. State, </em>219 Md.App. 565, 571, 101 A.3d 514, 518 (2014) (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1880, 20 L.Ed.2d at 906).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In the present case, the parties do not dispute the propriety of the initial traffic stop based on minor traffic violations. The purpose of that stop was fulfilled once Gillespie received the written warning from the officers. Then, Gillespie consented to the search of the vehicle. The issue raised is whether, under all of the circumstances, the <em>Terry </em>frisk of Sellman was permissible under the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Our analysis, therefore, begins and ends with the frisk.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Reasonable Suspicion for a <em>Terry </em>Frisk</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">\u201cThe default rule requires that a seizure of a person by a law enforcement officer must be supported by probable cause, and, absent a showing of probable cause, the seizure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>violates the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Crosby v. State, </em>408 Md. 490, 505, 970 A.2d 894, 902-03 (2009). In <em>Terry, </em>however, the Supreme Court of the United States \u201crecognized that a law enforcement officer may conduct a brief investigative \u2018stop\u2019 of an individual if the officer has a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 505, 970 A.2d at 903 (citing <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 17, 88 S.Ct. at 878, 20 L.Ed.2d at 903). <em>See also In re David S., </em>367 Md. 523, 532, 789 A.2d 607, 612 (2002) (\u201c[A] police officer may stop and briefly detain a person for investigative purposes if the officer has reasonable suspicion, supported by articulable facts, that criminal activity \u2018may be afoot.\u2019 \u201d). \u201c[Although a reasonable stop is a necessary predecessor to a reasonable frisk, a reasonable frisk does not inevitably follow in the wake of every reasonable stop.\u201d <em>Simpler v. State, </em>318 Md. 311, 319, 568 A.2d 22, 25-26 (1990) (quoting <em>Gibbs v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 230, 238-39, 306 A.2d 587, 592 (1973)) (internal quotation marks omitted). To safeguard constitutional protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, a frisk following a <em>Terry </em>stop is permitted under limited circumstances:</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In addition to the authority to stop and briefly detain a person, the Supreme Court identified circumstances permitting police officers to pat-down the subject of a <em>Terry </em>stop:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR\">\u201c[T]here must be a narrowly drawn authority to permit a reasonable search for weapons for the protection of the police officer, where he has reason to believe that he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual, regardless of whether he has probable cause to arrest the individual for a crime. The officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; the issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger. And in determining whether the officer acted reasonably in such circumstances, due weight must be given, not to his inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch,\u2019 but to the specific reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d [at 909] (citations omitted).

In other words, \u201c[t]he officer has reason to believe that an individual is armed and dangerous if a reasonably prudent person, under the circumstances, would have felt that he was in danger, based on reasonable inferences from particularized facts in light of the officer\u2019s experience.\u201d <em>Bailey, </em>412 Md. at 367, 987 A.2d at 83 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>(citing <em>Longshore v. State, </em>399 Md. 486, 509, 924 A.2d 1129, 1141-42 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In <em>Crosby, </em>we dedicated significant time to the subject of reasonable suspicion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">First, reasonable suspicion is a common sense, nontechnical conception that considers factual and practical aspects of daily life and how reasonable and prudent people act. While the level of required suspicion is less than that required by the probable cause standard, reasonable suspicion nevertheless embraces something more than an inchoate and un-particularized suspicion or hunch. Second, a court\u2019s determination of whether a law enforcement officer acted with reasonable suspicion must be based on the totality of the circumstances. Thus, the court must ... not parse out each individual circumstance for separate consideration .... In making its assessment, the court should give due deference to the training and experience of the law enforcement officer who engaged the stop at issue. Such deference allows officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that might well elude an untrained person.

We hold that, under the totality of the circumstances, the record does not disclose articulable objective facts to support the frisk. <em>See Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. at 1884, 20 L.Ed.2d at 911 (holding, in order to conduct a frisk, an officer must have reasonable suspicion \u201cthat criminal activity may be afoot <em>and </em>that the persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous ....\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Pertinent factors in our analysis include: the officers\u2019 initial observations of Sellman before he entered the vehicle; the traffic stop occurred late at night in a high crime area; the officers were initially outnumbered four to two, and a third officer quickly arrived upon request; the officers received inconsistent statements about who lived in the complex; the four occupants, including Sellman, were compliant throughout the encounter; Sellman\u2019s behavior in the vehicle was characterized as unusual, because he was \u201csitting completely rigid in his seat, he had his hands on his knees and was looking straight ahead and never turned once\u201d until he was spoken to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>directly; warrant checks on all the occupants came back negative; Corporal Daughters was unable to locate any MVA records under the name provided by Sellman.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">\u201cWhile there undoubtedly is some risk to the police in every confrontation, <em>Terry </em>has never been thought to authorize a protective frisk on the occasion of every authorized stop.\u201d <em>Simpler, </em>318 Md. at 321, 568 A.2d at 26. Viewing the facts in a light most favorable to the State, a review of the record in the case before us does not advance beyond an \u201cunparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch,\u2019 \u201d which is far below the requisite constitutional standard for reasonable suspicion. <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Also pertinent to our analysis is the absence of any testimony from the officers providing individualized, objective reasonable suspicion that Sellman was involved in the crime of theft of property from cars. A generalized concern about theft from cars in the area is not on par with reasonable suspicion, and, without more, is too weak and attenuated to provide reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. Neither the motions court nor the appellate court may rubber stamp the unlawful conduct of an officer simply because the officer believed he had a right to engage in that conduct. <em>Ransome, </em>373 Md. at 111, 816 A.2d at 908.

See Nathan, </em>370 Md. at 659, 805 A.2d at 1093 (\u201cWe review the legal questions <em>de novo </em>and based upon the evidence presented at the suppression hearing and the applicable law, we then make our own constitutional appraisal.\u201d). Notably, although Corporal Daughters testified about the types of crimes that had occurred in the apartment complex where the stop occurred, those crimes occurred at some unspecified time in the past.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is no indication on the record of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>reports of thefts from cars occurring that evening, that week, or even that month. Additionally, the officers did not explain why, based on their observations of Sellman, he was suspected of criminal activity. The officers did not observe furtive gestures, evasive maneuvers, bulges, bags or containers, or any instruments associated with the suspected crime of theft, i.e., theft of property from cars. The officers also did not explain the significance of receiving inconsistent statements from the passengers about who lived in the complex and how this was related to their suspicion of criminal activity. <em>See Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 508, 970 A.2d at 904 (\u201c[T]he officer must explain how the observed conduct, when viewed in the context of all of the other circumstances known to the officer, was indicative of criminal activity.\u201d). <em>See also Ransome, </em>373 Md. at 109, 816 A.2d at 907 (stating that the officer \u201cnever explained why he thought that petitioner\u2019s stopping to look at his unmarked car as it slowed down was suspicious or why petitioner\u2019s later nervousness or loss of eye contact, as two police officers accosted him on the street, was suspicious\u201d). Unlike other cases, which will be discussed below, there is an absence of additional circumstances connecting Sellman to the suspected criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We can deduce from the record that the scene where the traffic stop took place was one in which the officers were in control, and did not fear for their safety. Neither officer testified that they were concerned for their safety, and we cannot rationally infer from the facts on the record that a reasonably prudent officer would have had reasonable suspicion to believe that Sellman, or any of the occupants, was armed. Therefore, the officers did not need to frisk Sellman in order to protect themselves or bystanders. <em>See Bailey, </em>412 Md. at 368, 987 A.2d at 84 (stating that a <em>Terry </em>frisk \u201cis limited to a pat-down of the outer clothing\u201d and its purpose is \u201cnot to discover evidence of a crime, but rather to protect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>police officer and bystanders from harm by checking for weapons[.]\u201d) (citation omitted). Although the officers were initially outnumbered four to two, throughout the encounter, the occupants \u2014 two women and two men \u2014 were compliant and responsive to the officers\u2019 questions. During cross-examination, Corporal Daughters described Gillespie as \u201ctalkative\u201d and \u201cfriendly\u201d and her demeanor as \u201c[n]othing out of the ordinary.\u201d There was no testimony that any of the occupants were acting hostile towards the officers. We also note that backup was immediately available upon request. Under the totality of the circumstances, it appears that the true purpose of requesting backup was to gather evidence of criminal activity rather than to alleviate any concerns of being outnumbered. Corporal Daughters testified that he requested an additional officer in order to have that officer check the parking lot for evidence of car break-ins.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">When the officers first approached the vehicle, they used their flashlights to illuminate the interior and noticed nothing unusual inside. Their observations of Sellman, prior to and after he entered the vehicle, did not include testimony that he acted furtively, evasively, or that he appeared to be carrying a weapon. Furthermore, the officers were able to establish that none of the four occupants, including Sellman under the alias he provided, was named in an outstanding warrant. Importantly, the fact that no MVA records were found under the alias provided by Sellman is a factor to be considered,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but Corporal Daughters never explained why he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>was not satisfied with Sellman\u2019s explanation as to why the police database contained no records under his alias or how this fact contributed to his suspicion that Sellman was involved in car break-ins.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At the time of the frisk, the officers had no information that the individual identified as Saunders had a criminal record or was dangerous. Under the totality of the circumstances, the absence of MVA records, without more, does not provide the requisite reasonable suspicion. It is significant that Corporal Daughters identified several factors,\" but he failed to explain <em>why </em>they made him suspicious. When we view the facts through an objective lens, the facts are too weak, individually or in the aggregate, to establish reasonable suspicion. <em>See Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 387, 735 A.2d 491, 508 (1999). <em>See also Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 515, 970 A.2d at 908 (stating, pursuant to a <em>Terry </em>stop, reasonable suspicion requires \u201cparticularized and objective reasons\u201d to support an officer\u2019s belief that criminal activity is afoot).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In <em>Crosby, </em>we held that a <em>Terry </em>stop was unlawful because the officer lacked reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. 408 Md. at 515, 970 A.2d at 908. An officer in an unmarked vehicle was patrolling through a high crime area late at night, and he stopped a vehicle after observing it \u201cmaneuvering in and out of parking spaces in the parking lot of an apartment complex.\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 495-96, 970 A.2d at 896-97. He also testified that the driver was slumped down in the driver\u2019s seat. <em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 496, 970 A.2d at 897. The officer obtained identification from the driver and the passenger; the licenses were valid, and the warrant check came back negative for both occupants. <em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 497-98, 970 A.2d at 898. The officer, however, continued to detain the occupants until a K-9 unit arrived at the scene, because he wanted a canine to scan the vehicle for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>presence of narcotics. <em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 498, 970 A.2d at 898. We held that the <em>Terry </em>stop was unlawful, because the conduct observed by the officer \u201cwas, by itself, wholly innocent.\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 515, 970 A.2d at 908. \u201cWithout particularized and objective reasons that support a different interpretation of what he observed, viewed in the totality of the circumstances, [the officerj\u2019s belief that criminal activity was afoot amounted to no more than an \u2018inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch.\u2019 \u2019 \u201d <em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 515, 970 A.2d at 908 (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d at 909). We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">Deputy Young testified only that he considered what he observed to be suspicious; he did not illuminate how his training and experience caused him to believe that what he observed revealed possible criminal activity. He acknowledged that he did not observe Crosby commit any traffic violations the entire time that he surveilled Crosby\u2019s supposedly peculiar driving behavior and route of travel. Despite driving in what Deputy Young identified as a \u201cbig loop,\u201d Crosby signaled before each turn that he made. Thus, this Court is without an \u201carticulated logic\u201d with which to evaluate objectively the deputy\u2019s decision to detain Crosby. As several courts have observed, it is impossible for a combination of wholly innocent factors to combine into a suspicious conglomeration unless there are concrete reasons for such an interpretation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-6\"><em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 511-12, 970 A.2d at 906-07 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added). Like <em>Crosby, </em>Corporal Daughters, in the instant case, did not explain why, based on his training and decades of experience, the conduct he observed made him suspicious that Sellman was involved in car break-ins and was likely to be armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In <em>Bailey, </em>we also held that a <em>Terry </em>frisk failed to pass constitutional muster. 412 Md. at 358, 987 A.2d at 78. There, an officer was patrolling a high crime area late at night and observed Bailey, the petitioner, standing in the shadows on the side of a house. <em>Bailey, </em>412 Md. at 359, 987 A.2d at 78. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>When questioned by the officer about whether he lived at that location, Bailey did not respond. <em>Id. </em>The officer testified that when he approached the petitioner, he observed that Bailey\u2019s hands were visible and that he had \u201cglossy eyes.\u201d Bailey, 412 Md. at 360, 987 A.2d at 79. The officer also detected the odor of ether. <em>Bailey, </em>412 Md. at 359, 987 A.2d at 78. He testified that although the possession of ether is not unlawful, it is often associated with phencyclidine (\u201cPCP\u201d). <em>Bailey, </em>412 Md. at 359-60, 987 A.2d at 78-79. The officer then frisked Bailey and discovered contraband. We explained that, under <em>Terry, </em>the pat-down was invalid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">At the suppression hearing, Officer Lewis indicated that he searched the petitioner to \u201c[c]heck for weapons,\u201d but did not provide any basis for his suspicion that the petitioner was armed and dangerous. Officer Lewis did not testify as to any factors that would lead to a suspicion that the petitioner was carrying a weapon. Further, there are no objective factors in the record that indicate that the petitioner was armed and dangerous. Although the encounter took place at nighttime, the petitioner was alone and the officer \u201ccould visibly see his hands,\u201d which, presumably because the officer did not indicate otherwise, were empty. There is no indication in the record that the petitioner made any threatening movements, or any movements at all, nor is there any indication that Officer Lewis suspected that the petitioner was dealing drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\"><em>Bailey, </em>412 Md. at 368, 987 A.2d at 83. Similarly, in the instant case, Corporal Daughters failed to provide any basis to support his belief that Sellman was armed, and no objective factors could support such a conclusion. For example, the officer did not observe weapons, bulging pockets, or any furtive movements, such as attempts to reach for a concealed weapon. Additionally, the officers did not have information to suggest that Sellman had a history of prior dangerousness or any connection to criminal activity. As we stated above, the officers\u2019 observations of Sellman revealed innocent conduct, and the officers did not provide an objective reason to support their interpretation of that conduct: namely, that Sellman was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>likely involved in criminal activity or was armed. Without additional circumstances to support the belief of reasonable suspicion, the frisk of Sellman is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Another case in which we rejected the State\u2019s argument that reasonable suspicion existed is <em>Ransome, </em>373 Md. at 111, 816 A.2d at 908. Although this case involves the stop of a pedestrian rather than the stop of a vehicle, the analysis is helpful. <em>Ransome, </em>373 Md. at 101, 816 Md. at 902. There, officers were patrolling through a high crime neighborhood and observed Ransome, a pedestrian, looking at their unmarked patrol car. <em>Id. </em>Ransome \u201chad a large bulge in his left front pants pocket, which [Officer] Moro took as an indication that petitioner might have a gun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The officers exited the patrol car, briefly questioned Ransome, and then frisked him. <em>Id. </em>The State argued the officers had reasonable suspicion to believe that Ransome was armed and dangerous based on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"API\">Officer Moro\u2019s observation and concern about the bulge in petitioner\u2019s left front pocket, ... that this was a high-crime area from which complaints about drug activity, loitering, and shootings had come, that it was late at night and the lighting was poor, that petitioner gazed upon the police car as it approached the pair but then declined to keep eye contact when confronted by Officer Moro, and that petitioner appeared nervous when the officer briefly questioned him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-6\"><em>Ransome, </em>373 Md. at 105, 816 A.2d at 904. We rejected the argument that the officer had reasonable suspicion that Ran-some was armed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">[PJetitioner had done nothing to attract police attention other than being on the street with a bulge in his pocket at the same time Officer Moro drove by. He had not committed any obvious offense, he was not lurking behind a residence or found on a day care center porch late at night, was not without identification, was not a known criminal or in company with one, was not reaching for the bulge in his pocket or engaging in any other threatening conduct, did not take evasive action or attempt to flee, and the officer was not alone to face him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>Ransome, </em>373 Md. at 109-10, 816 A.2d at 907. In other words, Officer Moro did not explain, based on his experience, why these factors were suspicious. <em>See id. </em>We noted that to hold otherwise would result in the abrogation of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Those same concerns are present in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The State cites several out-of-state cases for support, but those cases are easily distinguishable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For example, in <em>United States v. George, </em>732 F.3d 296, 304 (4th Cir.2013), the Fourth Circuit upheld a passenger frisk following a valid traffic stop. Although there are some similarities with the case <em>sub judice </em>\u2014 the stop occurred at 3:30 a.m. in a high crime area \u2014 there are also additional factual circumstances. <em>Id. </em>The officer was outnumbered four to one, and the passenger acted suspiciously, ignored \u201ca direct order to put his hands on the headrest in front of him,\u201d and \u201ccontinued not to make eye contact with Officer Roehrig.\u201d <em>George, </em>732 F.3d at 300. And \u201cmost importantly, [the passengerj\u2019s movements indicated that he may have been carrying a weapon.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>George, </em>732 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>301. <em>See also United States v. Cruz, </em>156 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.1998) (upholding a frisk, in part, due to the \u201cthe unexplained commotion among its occupants who outnumbered the police officer five to one\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The State also relies on <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>but that case is equally unavailing. 964 F.2d 738 (8th Cir.1992). In <em>Douglas, </em>an officer was patrolling an apartment complex, and observed the appellant \u201cbent over and backing out of the back seat of a car parked in a parking lot of an adjacent [ ] apartment[.]\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>964 F.2d at 739. The officer observed the appellant closing the door, and instead of going into the apartment building associated with that parking lot, he \u201cwalk[ed] down an embankment\u201d towards another complex. <em>Douglas, </em>964 F.2d at 739-40. When questioned, the appellant responded that he was staying at a nearby hotel and that, as he was passing through, he \u201cmerely shut a car door he had found open.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>964 F.2d at 740. The Eighth Circuit upheld the frisk that followed the <em>Terry </em>stop, because there was reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may be afoot and that he was armed. <em>Douglas, </em>964 F.2d at 740-41. Unlike the instant case, the appellee in <em>Douglas </em>was caught in an obviously compromising position that strongly indicated criminal activity. <em>Douglas, </em>964 F.2d at 740. The facts in the instant case are not nearly as incriminating. Corporal Daughters observed Sellman walking from the side of an apartment building towards a roadway, and he saw Sellman enter the car driven by Gillespie.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Nervousness as a Factor</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">A factor relied on heavily by the State is Sellman\u2019s nervous behavior throughout the encounter. In <em>Ferris v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>we warned \u201cagainst according too much weight to the State\u2019s routine claim that garden variety nervousness accurately indicates complicity in criminal activity: \u2018This repetitive assertion by the Government in all cases of this kind must be treated with caution.\u2019 \u201d 355 Md. at 389, 735 A.2d at 508-09 (quoting <em>United States v. Millan-Diaz, </em>975 F.2d 720, 722 (10th Cir.1992)).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>Ferris, </em>after the conclusion of a valid traffic stop, we held that the continued detention of the petitioner was unlawful, because \u201c[t]he factual circumstances!, including his nervousness,] ... fell short of establishing reasonable suspicion that Ferris was involved in criminal activity.\u201d 355 Md. at 387, 735 A.2d at 507-08. The facts were not particularized and \u201ccould fit \u2018a very large category of presumably innocent travelers, who would be subject to virtually random seizures were the Court to conclude that as little foundation as there was in this case could justify a seizure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 387, 735 A.2d at 508 (quoting <em>Reid v. Georgia, </em>448 U.S. 438, 441, 100 S.Ct. 2752, 2754, 65 L.Ed.2d 890, 894 (1980)). We characterized \u201cFerris\u2019s unexceptional nervousness\u201d as \u201ctoo ordinary to suggest criminal activity\u201d and distinguished it from nervousness, which may be described as \u201cdramatic, or in some other way be objectively indicative of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Ferns, </em>355 Md. at 389, 735 A.2d at 509 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Not unlike <em>Ferris, </em>we hold that Sellman\u2019s nervousness was not exceptional. Instead, his display of nervousness coupled with his compliance in answering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Corporal Daughters\u2019 questions and exiting the vehicle when ordered to do so, and the blatant lack of other suspicious circumstances \u201care too weak, individually or in the aggregate, to justify reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 387, 735 A.2d at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Cases that have upheld frisks based on factors, including nervousness, present circumstances which are markedly different than those in the case <em>sub judice. </em>For example, in <em>Underwood v. State, </em>the Court of Special Appeals upheld a valid <em>Terry </em>frisk, and that situation is readily distinguishable. 219 Md.App. at 575, 101 A.3d at 520. Underwood had been pulled over for speeding, and when the officer approached the vehicle, the appellant was sitting with \u201cextraordinary rigidity.\u201d <em>Underwood, </em>219 Md.App. at 567, 101 A.3d at 516-17 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cUnderwood was wearing a jacket\u201d and the two front pockets \u201cwere bulging out as if they were packed with something.\u201d <em>Underwood, </em>219 Md.App. at 567, 101 A.3d at 515. This prompted the officer to run a criminal background check, and he discovered that Underwood had a prior probation for a gun offense. <em>Underwood, </em>219 Md.App. at 570-71, 101 A.3d at 517-18. This further prompted the officer to request a K-9 search. <em>Id. </em>Twice he ordered Underwood to exit the vehicle, but he refused to comply. <em>Underwood, </em>219 Md.App. at 568, 101 A.3d at 516.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">Corporal Cooper advised using force if necessary to remove Underwood. Corporal Crouch opened the driver\u2019s door and reached for Underwood\u2019s right hand that was still in his lap. As Corporal Crouch \u201cstarted to reach for his right hand, [Underwood] started to move towards his right pocket.\u201d The officer cuffed the right wrist and began to tug Underwood out of the car. \u201cHe never moved until his entire upper body was out of the car, and then he moved his feet to put them underneath of him.\u201d Corporal Crouch fully handcuffed him and frisked him. The bulges in the two pockets of the jacket were gloves. Because of the right hand motion that Underwood had made, the officer patted down the right front pants pocket [and discovered a handgun].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number><em>Id. </em>The intermediate appellate court held that reasonable suspicion existed to justify the frisk: \u201cA fair inference from his exaggerated immobility is that he was consciously avoiding any movement that might be claimed to be a furtive motion, knowing that, if he were frisked, he had a handgun and drugs on his person.\u201d <em>Underwood, </em>219 Md.App. at 575, 101 A.3d at 520. It is important to note that it was Underwood\u2019s extraordinary rigidity in conjunction with the other factors that provided reasonable suspicion. This is unlike the instant case. <em>See also Matoumba v.

State </em>is also distinguishable. 138 Md.App. 638, 653-54, 773 A.2d 564, 573 (2001). During a valid traffic stop, the officer observed that the passenger \u201cwas unusually nervous while looking through his pockets for his license and was attempting to conceal something in a pocket that was large enough to hold a handgun.\u201d <em>Russell, </em>138 Md.App. at 653, 773 A.2d at 572. The officer \u201cexplained that he had conducted a large number of traffic stops, and that the level of nervousness exhibited by appellant was unusual for a mere passenger.\u201d <em>Russell, </em>138 Md.App. at 644-45, 773 A.2d at 568. He also testified that the stop occurred in a high crime area where a \u201cgreat deal of weapons\u201d have been recovered. <em>Russell, </em>138 Md.App. at 645, 773 A.2d at 568. Lastly, \u201c[h]e observed that the pocket into which appellant pushed something back was large enough to conceal a handgun.\u201d <em>Russell, </em>138 Md.App. at 653, 773 A.2d at 572. Thus, the frisk was justified because the factual circumstances supported the belief of reasonable suspicion that the passenger was armed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>The State also cites to <em>Cortes v. Nevada, </em>127 Nev. 505, 260 P.3d 184, 189 (2011) for support, but that case is also unavailing. There, the Nevada Supreme Court upheld the frisk of a passenger. <em>Id. </em>When the officer initiated a traffic stop and spoke to the driver, the passenger appeared unusually nervous, acted evasively, had a knife on his lap, refused to keep his hands in plain view, and, upon exiting the vehicle, tried to conceal his hands and back from the officer. <em>Cortes, </em>230 P.3d at 186. Under these circumstances, a reasonably prudent officer would have reasonable suspicion as well, but the same cannot be said in the instant case. \u201c[T]he reasonable suspicion standard carries limitations; it does not allow [a] law enforcement official to simply assert that innocent conduct was suspicious to him or her.\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 508, 970 A.2d at 904. We shall not \u201c \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 conduct simply because the officer believed he had the right to engage in it.\u201d <em>Ransome, </em>373 Md. at 111, 816 A.2d at 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Lawfulness of the Institutionalized Police Department Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Having addressed the first question presented, we choose now to address separately the lawfulness of the alleged police department policy, which authorizes officers, prior to conducting a consent search of a vehicle, to pat down the occupants of the car. We do not dispute that as a matter of safety it may be reasonable to order the occupants to exit the vehicle. However, where reasonable suspicion that the occupants) is armed and dangerous is absent, the frisk of an occupant is an unreasonable intrusion on Fourth Amendment protections. This pernicious institutionalized procedure is unlawful and is counter to <em>Terry </em>and its progeny.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>We addressed this issue <em>in Simpler </em>where the officer testified that he carried out a frisk as \u201ca matter of routine caution.\u201d 318 Md. at 321-22, 568 A.2d at 27. This echoes Corporal Daughters\u2019 testimony, in the case at bar, that, pursuant to receiving consent to search a vehicle, it is normal operating procedure to frisk the occupants. In <em>Simpler, </em>we rejected the assertion that an officer could conduct a pat-down of a person as \u201ca matter of routine caution\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">The circuit judge at the suppression hearing did not seem to sustain the frisk based on the evidence that Simpler had previously carried a carpet knife. Rather, the circuit judge found that it was \u201cnormal for the officer to patdown those who were there .... \u201d This finding does not distinguish between the patdowns of Simpler and of the underage males. The finding echoes [Officer] Wassmer\u2019s testimony that the patdowns were \u201ca matter of routine caution.\u201d Underlying the testimony and the finding is the notion that any lawful stop justifies a frisk. As we have seen above, that is not the law. Rather, the burden was on the State at the suppression hearing to demonstrate that the seizure fell within one of the well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>See State v. Wilson, </em>279 Md. 189, 194, 367 A.2d 1223, 1227 (1977). This the State failed to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">318 Md. at 321-22, 568 A.2d at 27 (emphasis added). We reiterate: \u201cWhile there undoubtedly is some risk to the police in every confrontation, <em>Terry </em>has never been thought to authorize a protective frisk on the occasion of every authorized stop.\u201d <em>Simpler, </em>318 Md. at 321, 568 A.2d at 26-27. \u201c[B]efore an officer \u2018places a hand on the person of a citizen in search of anything, he must have constitutionally adequate, reasonable grounds for doing so[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.

We have previously recognized that \u201c[t]he suspected criminal activity itself can furnish the dangerousness justifying a frisk following a <em>Terry </em>stop.\u201d <em>Simpler, </em>318 Md. at 318, 568 A.2d at 25. In <em>Simpler, </em>for example, we held that the <em>Terry </em>frisk following a stop for suspected underage drinking was unlawful, because the facts did not establish reasonable suspicion that the suspect was armed or dangerous. 318 Md. at 312, 568 A.2d at 22. The suspected crime was a minor offense to which we refused to infer weapons use:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">While there undoubtedly is some risk to the police in every confrontation, <em>Terry </em>has never been thought to authorize a protective frisk on the occasion of every authorized stop. The very minor offense authorizing the stop here cannot, in and of itself, justify the frisk.

LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 9.4(a), at 505-06 (1987)). Many jurisdictions have held that particular crimes, such as crimes of violence, justify a <em>Terry </em>frisk because the crime itself implies weapons use, and therefore, provides reasonable suspicion that a suspect is armed and dangerous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>[I]n some cases the right to conduct a protective search must follow directly from the right to stop the suspect. The Court seems to take this view in Terry, although Justice Harlan\u2019s concurring opinion proceeds to \u201cmake explicit what I think is implicit\u201d in the majority opinion, namely, that \u201cthe right to frisk must be immediate and automatic if the reason for the stop is, as here, an articulable suspicion of a crime of violence.\u201d Lower courts have been inclined to view the right to frisk as being \u201cautomatic\u201d whenever the suspect has been stopped upon the suspicion that he has committed, was committing, or was about to commit a type of crime for which the offender would likely be armed, whether the weapon would be used to actually commit the crime, to escape if the scheme went awry, or for protection against the victim or others involved. This includes such suspected offenses as robbery, burglary, rape, assault with weapons, car theft, homicide, and dealing in large quantities of narcotics[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 9.6(a) 853-54 (5th ed. 2012) (footnotes omitted). We agree with LaFave that minor crimes do not, in and of themselves, justify a <em>Terry </em>frisk <em>without additional circumstances </em>that establish reasonable suspicion that a suspect is armed and dangerous. We repeat here that \u201c[wjhile there undoubtedly is some risk to the police in every confrontation, <em>Terry </em>has never been thought to authorize a protective frisk on the occasion of every authorized stop.\u201d <em>Simpler, </em>318 Md. at 321, 568 A.2d at 26. \u201cOther circumstances\u201d must be present to provide the basis for reasonable suspicion that a suspect is armed and dangerous.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">But for other types of crimes, such as trafficking in small quantities of narcotics, possession of marijuana, illegal possession of liquor, prostitution, bookmaking, shoplifting and other theft, passing bad checks, underage drinking, driving under the influence and lesser traffic offenses, minor assault without weapons, curfew information, or vagrancy, as well as when the stop is for a legitimate noncriminal reason, or when the officer\u2019s duties otherwise necessitate his being in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>close proximity to the individual, there must be, as Justice Harlan noted in <em>Terry, </em>\u201cother circumstances\u201d present.

LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 9.6(a) 855-62 (5th ed. 2012) (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added). As we have already explained above, there is a dearth of \u201cadditional circumstances\u201d to justify a <em>Terry </em>frisk, in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The crime of theft of property from a vehicle can be a major or minor offense, depending upon the value of the goods taken. It is not a crime of violence or one in which we can say places the police officer in a potentially dangerous situation, absent other circumstances. As LaFave explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">The cases which have upheld frisks incident to a temporary arrest while a ticket or notice to appear was prepared have usually involved contacts occurring during the hours of darkness, though it is to be doubted that this fact alone will justify a frisk. Usually there is something more causing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>the officer to conclude that he is in a potentially dangerous situation, such as: that the person has made a sudden and otherwise inexplicable move toward a pocket or other place where a weapon might be concealed; that the person failed to respond to the officer\u2019s directive that he stop his vehicle or that he keep his hands in view or remove his hands from his pocket; that'there is a characteristic bulge in the person\u2019s clothing; that the person stopped displayed a \u201cboisterous, aggressive\u201d attitude, that the officer had previously obtained information that this person carried a weapon; that the officer saw a weapon or holster in the person\u2019s car; or that in addition to the minor offense there is some reason also to suspect the individual of much more serious criminal conduct.

LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 9.6(a) 865-68 (5th ed. 2012) (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added). As a matter of policy, we decline the opportunity to create a bright line rule, and we will not presume that when an officer has reasonable suspicion that an individual is involved with the crime of theft of property from cars, the officer may automatically infer that individual is also armed. When reviewing whether reasonable suspicion exists, \u201c[t]he test is \u2018the totality of the circumstances,\u2019 viewed through the eyes of a reasonable, prudent, police officer.\u201d <em>Bost, </em>406 Md. at 356, 958 A.2d at 365. \u201cThe officer has reason to believe that an individual is armed and dangerous if a reasonably prudent person, under the circumstances, would have felt that he was in danger, based on reasonable inferences from particularized facts in light of the officer\u2019s experience.\u201d <em>Bailey, </em>412 Md. at 367, 987 A.2d at 83 (citing <em>Longshore, </em>399 Md. at 509, 924 A.2d at 1141-42).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Accordingly, we hold that, under the totality of the circumstances, Corporal Daughters did not have reasonable articula-ble suspicion to frisk Sellman.

During the course of the patrol, Corporal Daughters observed Sellman emerge from a \u201cdark area on the side of\u2019 an apartment building where there was no entrance. According to Corporal Daughters, Sellman came to an abrupt stop and seemed startled when he noticed the officers\u2019 marked law enforcement vehicle. Sellman quickly turned to the right and stopped again, watching the patrol vehicle as it passed. Sellman then resumed a normal pace and proceeded toward the roadway. Shortly thereafter, Corporal Daughters observed Sellman get into a vehicle that had pulled up next to Sellman on the roadway. The officers followed the vehicle and noticed that it had a broken rear-right tail light lens and that the tag light was hanging from a wire below the bumper. Corporal Daughters activated the patrol vehicle\u2019s emergency lights and pulled the vehicle over.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Corporal Daughters told the driver of the vehicle, Samantha Gillespie (\u201cGillespie\u201d), that he had pulled her over due to the broken tail light lens and tag light. Upon shining his flashlight into the vehicle, Corporal Daughters noted a total of four individuals, including Sellman, who was seated in the left-rear passenger seat. Corporal Daughters asked if anyone in the vehicle lived in the Villages at Marley Station apartment complex, and only a female passenger, Andrea Queen (\u201cQueen\u201d), answered affirmatively. Sellman did not respond. Corporal Daughters asked Gillespie if there were \u201cany guns, bombs, weapons, dead bodies\u201d in the vehicle, and she answered \u201cno.\u201d Corporal Daughters then asked if they could search the vehicle, and, according to the officers, Gillespie answered, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d As Corporal Daughters started to approach the vehicle, Gillespie asked, \u201cWhy do you want to search the vehicle?\u201d Corporal Daughters responded that they \u201chad some problems in the area with some thefts and some drugs\u201d and Gillespie answered that she understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Before conducting the search, Corporal Daughters asked Gillespie whether Sellman also lived in the Villages at Marley Station apartment complex, and she answered affirmatively. Corporal Daughters testified that, because of the inconsistencies regarding who actually lived in the apartment complex and \u201cthe history surrounding the apartment complex, [he] wanted to identify everyone in the vehicle.\u201d Corporal Daughters returned to the vehicle and asked for identification from the remaining three passengers. One male passenger, Donald Harris, had a State-issued identification card, but Queen said that she did not have identification. Corporal Daughters testified that, throughout the stop, Sellman sat rigidly in his seat and looked straight ahead. When Corporal Daughters asked for his information, Sellman turned toward Corporal Daughters and provided the name \u201cMarcus Neal Saunders\u201d and a date of birth of July 12, 1982. A warrant search of all of the passengers came up negative, but the officers could not find a \u201cMarcus Neal Saunders\u201d in the database.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Wfiiile the warrant checks were processing, Corporal Daughters requested that another officer, Officer Miller, join him and Officer Kramer at the stop. Corporal Daughters testified that he asked Officer Miller to come because there were four people in the car and only two officers. Additionally, Corporal Daughters testified that he wanted to check the parking lot where the vehicle had been to see if any vehicles had been broken into. Once Officer Miller arrived, he and Corporal Daughters approached the vehicle, and Corporal Daughters asked Sellman whether he had given Corporal Daughters the correct name, explaining that \u201csomething should come back\u201d when the officers put his name into their d\u00e1tabase. Sellman replied that he had provided the correct name and that he must not be showing up in the database because he had never been arrested and had never had a driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Corporal Daughters asked Sellman to step out of the vehicle and place his hands on the trunk. During Corporal Daughters\u2019s testimony, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">[PROSECUTOR:] ... [W]hat did you tell [Sellman]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>[CORPORAL DAUGHTERS:] I had him step out of the vehicle and asked him to place his hands on the trunk of the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">[PROSECUTOR:] And why did you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">[CORPORAL DAUGHTERS:] At that point, I had again conflicting stories about who had been picked up where, whether anybody at all lived in the apartment complex, if anybody. It was odd that they were driving through the parking lot, picking people up on foot at that hour of the morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">[PROSECUTOR:] Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">[CORPORAL DAUGHTERS:] And before I continue any further, or continue to a search of the vehicle, which Ms. Gillespie allowed us to do, I wanted to make sure none of the passengers were carrying any weapons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Corporal Daughters testified that, as he conducted the Terry frisk\u2019 of Sellman, he felt the impression of a gun where Sellman\u2019s belt buckle would be. Corporal Daughters removed a semiautomatic handgun from Sellman\u2019s waistband. A subsequent search revealed drugs, including cocaine, on Sellman\u2019s person. Officer Kramer, who was no longer a law enforcement officer at the time of the hearing on the motion to suppress, testified at the hearing and concurred with Corporal Daughters\u2019s description of the events as they occurred on November 12, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">During the hearing on the motion to suppress, Gillespie disputed much of Corporal Daughters\u2019s testimony. Gillespie testified that the damage to the vehicle was barely visible and that the officers had to crouch down to show her what needed to be repaired. Gillespie characterized the Corporal Daughters\u2019s behavior toward the occupants of the vehicle as \u201cpretty mean[,]\u201d and she testified that she unequivocally told the officers \u201cno\u201d when they asked to search the vehicle. Gillespie also testified that warrant check took approximately twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>minutes, which conflicted with Corporal Daughters\u2019s and Officer Kramer\u2019s testimony at the hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">The circuit court found that the frisk of Sellman was valid for the following reasons: (1) the passengers in the car outnumbered the officers; (2) the stop occurred late at night in a high-crime area; (3) the officers observed Sellman coming from a dark area; (4) the officers became suspicious of Sellman based on his behavior in the vehicle; and (5) the officers \u201chad a reasonable articulable suspicion at that point to do the [frisk]\u201d of Sellman. Additionally, the circuit court found that the length of the stop was valid because Gillespie consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Sellman noted an appeal, and in an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress. Specifically, the Court of Special Appeals determined that Sellman\u2019s suspicious behavior, combined with his presence late at night in a high-crime area, was \u201csufficient to arouse reasonable suspicion, in the eyes of an experienced law enforcement officer, that [Sellman] had committed or was planning to commit a crime.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals also remarked that Corporal Daughters\u2019s \u201cconcern that [Sellman] had broken into cars supported a reasonable suspicion that he was armed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In the instant case, I would hold that Corporal Daughters had reasonable articulable suspicion to believe that criminal activity may have been afoot and to believe that Sellman may have been armed and dangerous. In evaluating whether a frisk of an individual is warranted, the Court must balance \u201cthe need to search (or seize) against the invasion which the search (or seizure) entails.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) (citation and internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>mark omitted). As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cin justifying the particular intrusion the [law enforcement] officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion. ... Anything less would invite intrusions upon constitutionally guaranteed rights based on nothing more substantial than inarticulate hunches[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21-22, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1884 (footnote omitted). Considering the totality of the circumstances, I would conclude that the following factors establish sufficient reasonable articulable suspicion to support denial of the motion to suppress: (1) the stop occurred late at night in a high-crime area; (2) specifically, Corporal Daughters testified that there had been multiple thefts from vehicles, a shooting, illegal handgun possessions, and drug arrests at the apartment complex; (8) Sellman behaved nervously before and during the stop; (4) specifically, Sellman came out of the darkened area of the apartment complex, made evasive movements upon seeing the law enforcement vehicle, and behaved nervously within the vehicle during the stop; (5) Gillespie advised that Sellman lived at the apartment complex, while Sellman did not respond when Corporal Daughters asked if anyone in the vehicle lived at the apartment complex; and (6) Sellman provided false identification to Corporal Daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">As the Supreme Court has incisively observed, \u201ctraffic stops are especially fraught with danger to [law enforcement] officers.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Johnson, </em>555 U.S. 323, 330, 129 S.Ct. 781, 172 L.Ed.2d 694 (2009). Indeed, \u201cthe risk of a violent encounter in a traffic-stop setting stems not from the ordinary reaction of a motorist stopped for a speeding violation, but from the fact that evidence of a more serious crime might be uncovered during the stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331, 129 S.Ct. 781, 784 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In considering potential risks to officer safety, I would agree with the circuit court that the area in which this stop occurred is a salient factor in assessing the \u201cwhole picture.\u201d <em>Stokes v. State, </em>362 Md. 407, 416, 765 A.2d 612, 616 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As noted above, when, as in this case, a stop occurs in a high-crime area, \u201cofficers are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>required to ignore the relevant characteristics of a location in determining whether the circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation.\u201d <em>Henson v. United States, </em>55 A.3d 859, 867-68 (D.C.2012) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, Corporal Daughters testified that there had been a shooting and other weapon and drug-related offenses at the apartment complex. Thus, the possibility of encountering an armed and potentially dangerous individual was a present concern at the time of the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Turning to Sellman\u2019s behavior, in light of the testimony at the suppression hearing, I would conclude that Sellman exhibited nervousness, both prior to and during the course of the stop \u2014 certainly behavior that contributed to the establishment of reasonable articulable suspicion for the frisk. In so concluding, I would not grant greater weight to nervousness as a factor in a totality of the circumstances analysis than this Court has previously. Rather, consistent with prior holdings, I would note that nervousness alone is not dispositive in a determination of reasonable suspicion; however, persistent nervousness is a factor that this Court should consider as part of the totality of the circumstances. <em>See United States v. Simpson, </em>609 F.3d 1140, 1148 (10th Cir.2010) (\u201cExtreme and persistent nervousness, however, is entitled to somewhat more weight.\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks- omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Although Sellman was not shaking like the defendant in <em>Simpson, id. </em>at 1145, he exhibited nervous and evasive behavior prior to and during the stop. Corporal Daughters testified that when the officers first observed Sellman step out from the shadows of the apartment complex, Sellman stopped, quickly changed course, and then stopped again after seeing the marked law enforcement vehicle. Sellman\u2019s reaction to the law enforcement vehicle was made more suspicious by his emergence from a dark area of the apartment complex where there was no entrance. As with many factors that the Court considers as part of the totality of the circumstances, an individual\u2019s presence in a dark area alone does not give rise to the suspicion that they are armed and dangerous. <em>See Bailey v. State, </em>412 Md. 349, 368, 987 A.2d 72, 83 (2010) (\u201cAlthough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>the encounter took place at nighttime, the [defendant] was alone and the officer \u2018could visibly see his hands,\u2019 which, presumably because the officer did not indicate otherwise, were empty.\u201d). This Court has, however, noted that it will consider such factors as part of the totality of the circumstances. Indeed, in <em>Ransome v. State, </em>373 Md. 99, 110, 816 A.2d 901, 907 (2003), this Court explained that we consider whether an individual appears to be hiding or \u201clurking\u201d in a dark area as a factor when determining whether an officer had reasonable suspicion to believe the individual was armed and dangerous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, Sellman\u2019s nervous behavior immediately after emerging from a dark side of a building where there was no entrance is a pertinent consideration in the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Sellman\u2019s behavior during the stop also bears on the determination as to reasonable suspicion for the frisk. Corporal Daughters testified that, throughout the course of the stop, Sellman sat \u201ccompletely rigid in his seat, he had his hands on his knees and was looking straight ahead and never turned his head once.\u201d Corporal Daughters indicated that this behavior was unusual. In assessing whether an individual\u2019s nervousness is beyond the usual level, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has credited the opinion of the law enforcement officers who observed the nervous behavior. <em>See Simpson, </em>609 F.3d at 1148 (The law enforcement officer \u201cdid not merely assert that [the defendant] was nervous, he provided a basis for that conclusion \u2014 [the defendant] was shaking uncontrollably throughout the entire encounter, even when assured he would not get a ticket. ... [W]e credit as a factor towards reasonable suspicion, albeit cautiously, [the defendant]^ manifestation of extreme nervousness.\u201d). In this case, the circuit court found Corporal Daughters\u2019s testimony credible, and, as such, Corporal Daughters\u2019s characterization of Sellman\u2019s nervousness as unusual is a relevant factor to be considered in determining the existence of reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Of particular significance in the present case is Sellman\u2019s provision of false identification to Corporal Daughters. Indeed, the circumstances of this case closely mirror those in cases in which other courts have determined reasonable suspicion existed based partially on the provision of false identification. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Richmond, </em>641 F.3d 260, 261 (7th Cir.2011) (During a conversation with a law enforcement officer, \u201c[a]fter [the defendant] denied having any identification on him, [the officer] asked [the defendant] his name. ... [the defendant] lied. A database search through the squad car\u2019s mobile computer reported \u2018no record on file,\u2019 which [the officer] knew to be particularly unusual and potentially indicative of a false name.\u201d). Here, when the officers ran the name and date of birth that Sellman provided through the database, no information came back, \u201cas if [the name] [did not] exist.\u201d I would agree with the United States Court of Appeals for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Seventh Circuit that an individual\u2019s provision of false identification bears on considerations of officer safety. <em>See Richmond, </em>641 F.3d at 262 (\u201cThe \u2018no record on file\u2019 report generated by the pseudonym indicated that [the defendant] might have been trying to hide information.\u201d (Citation omitted)). Indeed, such circumstances rightfully raise a law enforcement officer\u2019s suspicion that the individual with whom he or she is speaking might have a \u201cdangerous reaction to confrontation^]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">This case is distinguishable from <em>United States v. Powell, </em>666 F.3d 180, 185, 189 (4th Cir.2011), in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that an individual\u2019s provision of inconsistent information regarding the validity of his license did not establish reasonable suspicion that he was armed and dangerous. Unlike Sellman, the defendant in <em>Powell, id. </em>at 184, did not display any nervous or evasive behavior and was very forthcoming with the law enforcement officers. Furthermore, the defendant in <em>Powell, id. </em>at 189, did not attempt to give a false name, and the Fourth Circuit expressed doubt that his claim as to the validity of the license was itself suspicious. By contrast, it is not in dispute that Sellman provided the name \u201cMarcus Neal Saunders\u201d to Corporal Daughters when asked for his name. Even after Corporal Daughters informed Sellman that the name returned no information in the database, Sellman insisted that he had given the correct name, further heightening Corporal Daughters\u2019s suspicion. Thus, the circumstances of the present case are distinguishable from <em>Powell, </em>as the defendant in <em>Powell </em>did not provide a false name to law enforcement officers, did not continue to insist that the name was accurate after a database search, and did not appear nervous before and during the course of the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">In its unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals explained that Corporal Daughters had reasonable articulable suspicion to believe that Sellman was involved with criminal activity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">The totality of these circumstances, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, was sufficient to arouse reasonable suspicion, in the eyes of an experienced law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>officer, that [Sellman] had committed or was planning to commit a crime. Indeed, Corporal Daughters asked another officer to check the parking lot, in the area where there had been thefts from cars, to see if any cars had been broken into. The concern that [Sellman] had broken into cars supported a reasonable suspicion that he was armed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYF\">(Citations omitted). Before this Court, Sellman contends in the alternative that, even if this Court finds that the officers had reasonable articulable suspicion to believe that he had committed theft from a vehicle, such a crime does not presume the use of a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Whether theft from a vehicle is a crime that could be presumed to involve the use of a weapon appears to be a matter of first impression for this Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The issue has not been thoroughly explored by other jurisdictions. The Majority declines to take a position with respect to the presumption of the use of a weapon, and reiterates that a determination of reasonable suspicion depends on the totality of the circumstances. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 562, 144 A.3d at 792-93. In declining to take a position, the Majority necessarily refrains from establishing new precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">A review of case law suggests, however, that theft from a car could be presumed to entail the use of a weapon or tools <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>that could present a danger to law enforcement officers. Indeed, it has been established that individuals have been known to utilize potentially dangerous instruments, such as screwdrivers, in perpetrating thefts from vehicles. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>525 Fed.Appx. 330, 331 (6th Cir.2013) (Law enforcement officers identified \u201ccommon automobile \u2018burglary tools\u2019 \u2014 gloves, a flashlight, and a screwdriver \u2014 in plain view near [the defendant\u2019s] seat.\u201d). In <em>Anderson v. State, </em>328 Md. 426, 440, 614 A.2d 963, 969 (1992), this Court noted that whether items that are not legislatively deemed weapons <em>per se </em>constitute \u201cweapons\u201d for the purpose of a conceal-and-carry analysis is \u201ca question of fact, [determined] by applying the common experience of persons in our society to the facts and circumstances in a given case.\u201d Although a screwdriver is not considered a weapon <em>per se </em>and has many perfectly legal uses, it can be employed as a weapon when wielded with intent to injure. <em>See United States v. Lavender, </em>224 F.3d 939, 941 (9th Cir.2000) (The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit categorized a screwdriver as a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d for the purpose of upholding a sentencing enhancement for a robbery conviction, noting that \u201c[t]here is no doubt that a screwdriver can be used to... caus[e] serious bodily injury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">In <em>United States v. Bullock, </em>510 F.3d 342, 347 (D.C.Cir.2007), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (\u201cthe D.C. Circuit\u201d) noted that instruments that are not considered weapons <em>per se </em>may still present a threat to law enforcement officers and, therefore, justify a <em>Terry </em>frisk. In <em>Bullock, </em>510 F.3d at 347, a law enforcement officer conducted a <em>Terry </em>frisk of the defendant during a traffic stop after forming reasonable suspicion that the defendant had stolen the vehicle. The D.C. Circuit upheld the permissibility of the frisk, concluding that, \u201c[l]ike burglary, car theft is a crime that often involves the use of weapons and other instruments of assault that could jeopardize [law enforcement] officer safety, and thus justifies a protective frisk under <em>Terry </em>to ensure officer safety.\u201d <em>Bullock, </em>510 F.3d at 347 (emphasis added). Although <em>Bullock </em>involved theft of a vehicle rather than theft from a vehicle, as in the current case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>instruments that are used in either circumstance are presumably the same. Thus, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Bullock </em>is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Sellman argues that this case is analogous to <em>Simpler v. State, </em>318 Md. 311, 321, 312-13, 568 A.2d 22, 26-27 (1990), in which this Court concluded that the minor offense of underage drinking did not justify a <em>Terry </em>frisk. I would conclude that this case is distinguishable from <em>Simpler. </em>As discussed above, theft from a vehicle, unlike underage drinking, may involve the use of instruments that could present a danger to law enforcement officers. Additionally, other courts have held that suspicion of a theft crime may justify a <em>Terry </em>frisk if the officer believes that his or her safety may be at risk in apprehending the individual. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Griffin, </em>696 F.3d 1354, 1359, 1357 (11th Cir.2012) (The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld the constitutionality of a <em>Terry </em>frisk of an individual who was suspected of theft from a clothing store.). <em>Simpler, </em>a case involving underage drinking, provides little guidance as to the resolution of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The Majority theorizes that a general concern about theft from cars in an area does not provide reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot and does not provide sufficient reasonable suspicion for a frisk. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 544-46, 144 A.3d at 781-83. Here, a concern about theft from cars was but one aspect of a myriad of factors giving rise to reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot and that Sellman was potentially armed and dangerous. As recognized by the Majority, Sellman was observed coming from a dark area on the side of the apartment building where there was no entrance; the apartment building was in a high-crime area; Sellman behaved nervously upon seeing a law enforcement vehicle and was picked up at a location around the corner, separately from the other occupants of the vehicle; during the stop, Sellman appeared nervous in the vehicle, looking straight ahead and never looking at Corporal Daughters; Corporal Daughters received information from Gillespie that Sellman lived in the apartment complex, while Sellman did not respond; and Sell-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>man provided a false name, \u201cMarcus Neal Saunders,\u201d for which there was no information or Motor Vehicle Administration record. Corporal Daughters\u2019s testimony was that, after gaining consent to search the vehicle, he decided to frisk Sellman based on the responses of the occupants in the car and the circumstances that he had observed. Although Corporal Daughters, indeed, testified that, prior to searching the vehicle, he wanted to be sure that no one in the car was armed, the record establishes that he did not testify that this was the sole or primary basis for frisking Sellman.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">At its core, the Majority opinion states that the law enforcement officers\u2019 observations of Sellman \u201crevealed innocent conduct\u201d and that the officers did not have \u201can objective reason to support\u201d the suspicion that Sellman was involved in criminal activity or was armed. Maj. Op. at 550-51, 144 A.3d at 786. To be sure, each factor observed by the officers \u2014 for example, nervousness, coming from a dark area, being in a high-crime area late at night, and Gillespie\u2019s statement that Sellman lived at the apartment complex, coupled with Sellman\u2019s failure to respond when Daughters asked if anyone in the vehicle lived at the apartment complex \u2014 does not constitute a crime in and of itself. It has never been required that reasonable suspicion be based on the observation of actual criminal activity. The entire underpinning of reasonable suspicion is that there are a totality of circumstances sufficient to give rise to the belief that criminal activity is afoot and an individual is armed and dangerous. In my view, such was the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Although the need to protect citizens from unwarranted stops and frisks is of critical importance to the credibility of law enforcement and, ultimately, to the safety of the community, properly applying the law to the facts and evaluating the existence of reasonable suspicion are equally important.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">In sum, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, I would conclude that, under the totality of the circumstances, the evidence is sufficient to establish that Corporal Daughters had reasonable articulable suspicion to believe that criminal activity was afoot and that Sellman presented a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>danger to the officers at the time of the frisk. Thus, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Special Appeals, affirming the circuit court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">For the above reasons, respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Judge Battaglia has authorized me to state that she joins in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-10\">. <em>Terry v.

Corporal Daughters and Officer Kramer did not testify as to the length of the overall stop. Rather, the officers testified that each component of the stop occurred quickly. For example, Corporal Daughters testified that explaining the reason for the stop to Gillespie took between thirty seconds and one minute, and running Gillespie's identification through the database took five minutes. At the hearing, the prosecutor estimated that between eight and ten minutes passed during the traffic stop prior to the frisk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b596-5\">. In his brief, Sellman contends that this Court's decision in <em>Ransome </em>should guide the analysis in this case. I would disagree. Indeed, the present case is distinguishable from <em>Ransome </em>in that Sellman's behavior (acting nervously toward the law enforcement officers after emerging from a dark area) was unusual. Although, in <em>Ransome, </em>373 Md. at 109-10, 105, 816 A.2d at 907, 904, this Court held that the defendant\u2019s nervousness, presence in a high-crime area, and appearance of having a bulge in his pocket did not establish reasonable suspicion that the individual was armed and dangerous, this Court specifically explained that the defendant was doing nothing unusual at the time the officers approached him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">Unlike the defendants in the cited cases, or indeed in <em>Terry, </em>[the defendant] had done nothing to attract [the law enforcement officers\u2019] attention other than being on the street with a bulge in his pocket at the same time [a law enforcement officer] drove by. He had not committed any obvious offense, he was not lurking behind a residence or found on a day care center porch late at night, was not without identification, was not a known criminal or in company with one, was not reaching for the bulge in his pocket or engaging in any other threatening conduct, did not take evasive action or attempt to flee, and the officer was not alone to face him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">By contrast, in this case, Sellman emerged from a dark area without an entrance outside a building of an apartment complex that was known to the law enforcement officers for violence and drug-related crime. He acted nervously as the officers passed by in the marked vehicle and, importantly, he subsequently provided a false name when questioned during the stop. Unlike the defendant in <em>Ransome, </em>Sellman's behavior was sufficiently unusual to establish reasonable suspicion that he could present a danger to the officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b599-6\">. As to the issue of crime that occurred in the apartment complex, the majority opinion minimizes the significance of Corporal Daughters's testimony that crimes occurred in the apartment complex in the time period leading up to November 12, the date of Sellman\u2019s frisk. The majority opinion states that Corporal Daughters testified about crime that had occurred in the apartment complex and that those crimes occurred \"at some unspecified time in the past.\u201d Maj. Op. at 545, 144 A.3d at 783. The majority opinion further states: \"There is no indication on the record of any reports of thefts from cars occurring that evening, that week, or even that month.\u201d Maj. Op. at 546, 144 A.3d at 783. But concerning crime in the apartment complex, the record reflects that Corporal Daughters was asked: \"[S]tarting on November 12 were there any problems in that area, up to that \u2014 leading up to the November 12[?]\u201d To this question, Corporal Daughters responded that there had been multiple thefts from automobiles, shootings, handguns recovered, and drug busts in the apartment complex. Thus, Corporal Daughters\u2019s description of the offenses was given in response to a question concerning the time period leading up to November 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
