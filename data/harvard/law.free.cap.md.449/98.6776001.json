Troy Robert Allen (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) was convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>after a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County (\u201ccircuit court\u201d) of sexual abuse of a minor household member, \u00a7 3 \u2014 602(b)(2) of the Md.Code (2002, Repl. Vol. 2012), Criminal Law Article (\u201cCrim. Law\u201d), two counts of third degree sex offense, Crim. Law \u00a7 3-307, three counts of second degree assault, Crim. Law \u00a7 3-203, and one count of fourth degree sex offense, Crim. Law \u00a7 3-308(b)(1). Pursuant to Petitioner\u2019s Motion for a New Trial, one of the convictions for third degree sex offense was stricken in favor of a finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Petitioner was sentenced to twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment (all but five years suspended) for sexual abuse of a minor, and twenty-one years\u2019 imprisonment (all suspended) for the re--maining offenses, to run consecutively. Petitioner was also required to serve five years of supervised probation upon his release, with the condition that he have no unsupervised contact with minors. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the circuit court erroneously prohibited unsupervised contact with his minor son during the probationary period. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, <em>Troy Robert Allen v. State of Maryland, </em>No. 0617, September Term, 2014, 2015 WL 5885165 (Md.App. October 7, 2015), held that the condition of probation was \u201csufficiently related\u201d to the \u201csexual assault of a child residing in [Petitioner\u2019s] household[,]\u201d and affirmed the judgments of the circuit court. This Court granted a Writ of Certiorari to determine whether the circuit court erred by imposing the no-unsupervised-contact with minors condition. For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgments of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">After dating for several months in 2012, Petitioner and his then-girlfriend (\u201cMarisa\u201d) began sharing a home in Salisbury, Maryland. At the time Petitioner and Marisa moved in together, Marisa had shared custody of her ten-year-old daughter from a prior relationship (\u201cB.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In March 2013, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Petitioner and Marisa had a son (\u201cF.\u201d), who resided in the home along with B.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The evidence at trial revealed several instances of B.\u2019s sexual abuse at the hands of Petitioner while B. was a member of his household during 2012-2013:</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">On one such occasion, B. and Petitioner were sitting on the couches in the living room of their home when B. noticed that Petitioner\u2019s penis was protruding from the waistband of his shorts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After Petitioner noticed that B. had seen his penis, Petitioner wrote \u201c[d]id you see it?\u201d on a piece of paper, which he later crumpled up. On a later occasion, B. was again sitting on a couch in the living room with Petitioner seated next to her, when Petitioner exposed his penis and asked her \u201cto touch it[J\u201d When. B. refused, Petitioner placed the tip of his penis on her left forearm. During both of these incidents, Marisa was not present in the living room, but was elsewhere in the home. B. did not inform Marisa at the time, because she was fearful that Petitioner would become angry.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The evidence at trial also revealed that, on two occasions, Petitioner squeezed the nipple area of B.\u2019s chest. During the first incident, Marisa, Petitioner and B. were grocery shopping, and Petitioner and B. were \u201chorse playing[]\u201d when Petitioner twisted B.\u2019s nipple. B. informed Marisa that \u201c[Petitioner] just pinched my boob[,]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Marisa confronted Petitioner by telling him: \u201cdon\u2019t ever touch her there again.\u201d Petitioner responded that he was sorry, but shortly thereafter told B. that \u201che was going to put his thing in [her] thing.\u201d On the second occasion, B. and Petitioner were alone in the kitchen of the residence and Petitioner \u201cturned [B.] and then twisted [her] boob.\u201d Marisa was located elsewhere in the home during this later incident, and B. did not inform her of the abuse at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>On August 1, 2013, Marisa asked Petitioner to leave their shared home in Salisbury, and on August 4, 2013, B. spoke with police regarding the aforementioned abuse. On that same date, Marisa text messaged Petitioner concerning B.\u2019s allegations, and Petitioner responded that \u201cI will not go down like this, I won\u2019t have that label on me when I know it will go away.\u201d Petitioner further stated that \u201che would take his life and that he was leaving town and going to get a bus ticket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">I. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In preparation for Petitioner\u2019s sentencing hearing, a psychologist employed with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cDHMH\u201d) prepared a mental health assessment, and the Department of Parole and Probation prepared a pre-sentence investigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">a. The mental health assessment</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Based on a two-and-a-half hour interview with Petitioner, along with the consideration of several documents, a licensed psychologist working with DHMH made several findings regarding Petitioner\u2019s account of the instant offense, Petitioner\u2019s background, and Petitioner\u2019s mental status. The psychologist also performed a structured risk assessment, and rendered conclusions and recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Concerning Petitioner\u2019s account of the instant offense, the psychologist noted that Petitioner \u201cwas very guarded and superficial in his discussion and had to be redirected to describe the events.\u201d According to the assessment, Petitioner stated that the occasions B. had seen his penis were \u201cinadvertent\u201d and \u201cnot purposeful.\u201d Petitioner remarked that \u201cwhen he sat on the couch he slouched so that his shorts or pants went low on his hips and that he put his hands in the waistband of his pants.\u201d Petitioner stated his belief that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u201ceveryone sits like that[,]\u201d and as a result, B. was able to view the tip of his penis. Petitioner reported that the incident at the grocery store was simply horseplay where he \u201cwas pinching\u201d and \u201caccidently got her chest.\u201d Petitioner reported that he was upset about the charges against him, and opined that \u201che does not believe that his crime is a sex offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Regarding Petitioner\u2019s background, he reported to the psychologist that \u201chis sexual fantasies and behavior have always been heterosexual ]\u201d and \u201c[h]e denied any sexual behavior or fantasies involving men.\u201d Petitioner reported that, after he graduated high school and moved to North Carolina, he began \u201c \u2018talking with girls\u2019 via text over the phone.\u201d According to Petitioner, these girls would send him pictures and he \u201cgot into a porn addiction[,]\u201d where he would use online dating sites to trade sexually explicit photos with \u201cfreakier girls.\u201d Petitioner informed the psychologist that he moved to Maryland in an attempt to stop this behavior, but began \u201cengaging in the ... phone exchanges[ ]\u201d when \u201chis relationship with his girlfriend [(Marisa)] worsened.\u201d The psychologist noted that, in an interview with police, Petitioner acknowledged using an internet chat room to exchange pictures with girls who were 15 and 16 years old. Petitioner stated \u201cthat his exhibitionist behavior and fantasies all involved texts and phone messages, and denied exhibitionism in person.\u201d According to the psychologist, Petitioner \u201cnormalized his behavior\u201d and his \u201clevel of insight was poor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Concerning Petitioner\u2019s mental status, Petitioner was diagnosed with \u201c[e]xhibitionist [disorder \u2014 pre-pubertal child victim\u201d and \u201csexual abuse of a child \u2014 perpetrator\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">Exhibitionist disorder is diagnosed when an individual obtains recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the exposure of genitals to an unsuspecting person and has acted on these urges with a non-consenting person. Through his behavior on the internet and by texting, [Petitioner] gained arousal and sexual satisfaction including ejaculation through sending pictures of himself to others. In the instant case he furthered this behavior by exposing himself to an unsuspecting and non-consenting person, the pre-pubertal victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>The risk assessment revealed that Petitioner exhibited a moderate risk of engaging in further acts of sexual violence. Using an actuarial assessment tool for quantifying the risk of sexual violence, the psychologist concluded that Petitioner was in the 78th percentile among adult male sexual offenders, with the 100th percentile being the most likely to reoffend. As a result, Petitioner\u2019s \u201crisk of sexual re-offending, relative to other sex offenders, [was] estimated at being almost twice that of other sex offenders.\u201d The assessment noted that \u201c[r]isk factors for re-offending in [Petitioner\u2019s] case include his young age, history of repetitive problematic sexual behavior, and his lack of awareness of the potential impact of his behavior on a very young victim.\u201d The assessment\u2019s conclusion remarked that \u201c[Petitioner] has a history of engaging in sexual behavior with young adolescents[,]\u201d and \u201chis lack of caution and inhibition in engaging in sexualized behavior in front of girls under 18 is problematic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">b. The pre-sentence investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The pre-sentence investigation revealed that, as of March 31, 2014, Petitioner also had pending charges in Worcester County, Maryland for sexual abuse of a minor household member, sexual abuse of minor, and two counts of indecent exposure. The Worcester County case involved B. and another ten-year-old female. The pre-sentence investigation recommended that Petitioner be sentenced according to the Maryland sentencing guidelines, and, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201chave no contact with the victim or her family,\u201d and \u201chave no unsupervised contact with minor females[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">c. The sentencing hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">At Petitioner\u2019s sentencing hearing, the State of Maryland (\u201cState\u201d) sought twenty-five years\u2019 incarceration (all but eight suspended) for the sexual abuse of a minor, consecutive suspended sentences on all remaining counts, and five years of supervised probation upon Petitioner\u2019s release. Among the conditions of probation requested by the State was that Petitioner have no contact with B., and \u201c[n]o unsupervised contact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>with minors.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s counsel objected to the no-unsupervised-contact condition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... Now, one of the problems is the unsupervised contact with minors....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">[H]e has his own son, [F.] Obviously, he needs to see him, should have contact with his son. And I think that the Court, any Court Order would need to be a little more fine line than just no contact with minors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">THE COURT: Well, I think it just has to be another adult there is what I\u2019m reading that to mean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, I understand that, but with regard to [F.], there shouldn\u2019t be another adult, if it\u2019s his son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">There\u2019s no reason for it. There\u2019s no basis in the law to be around his own son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">THE COURT: Well, except for that he has a conviction for child sex abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: I understand that, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-11\">THE COURT: And his son\u2019s a child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-12\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: \u2014a parent\u2019s right to be with their child is one of the preeminent rights in the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-13\">THE COURT: I agree with you, but it\u2019s not an absolute right, and where there has been a child \u2014 at this point, he is convicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-14\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-15\">THE COURT: And he is convicted of sex abuse of a child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-16\">So, I don\u2019t think the [c]ourt is precluded from imposing a no unsupervised contact with minor \u2014 with his own son. I mean, I don\u2019t know of any law or constitutional provision that disallows it. I grant you, it\u2019s a rarity that Courts shouldn\u2019t just go there without any basis. I agree with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-17\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: I understand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-18\">The court imposed a sentence of 25 years\u2019 incarceration (all but five suspended) for the charge of sexual abuse of a minor. The court imposed five years of supervised probation upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>release, with the condition that Petitioner have no unsupervised contact with minors. The court also imposed consecutive suspended sentences of ten years\u2019 incarceration for third-degree sex offense, ten years\u2019 incarceration for second-degree assault, and one year of incarceration for fourth-degree sex offense. The remaining two convictions for second-degree assault merged for sentencing purposes with the third-degree sex offense, and fourth degree sex offense. Petitioner filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">II. Proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">On appeal, Petitioner argued that, \u201cto the extent the no unsupervised contact condition relates to [his] interaction with his own infant son, the condition constitutes an illegal sentence that must be vacated.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to Petitioner, \u201cthere was no evidence presented which would have indicated that [he] presented any danger to either his son or to other children related to him by blood.\u201d Thus, \u201cthere was no rational basis for the imposition of the no unsupervised contact condition, which ... unreasonably infringed] on his fundamental [due process] right to parent his child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The Court of Special Appeals disagreed, and observed that trial courts have broad discretion in imposing a sentence, (quoting Md. Code (2001, Repl. Vol. 2008), \u00a7 6-221 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCrina. Proc.\u201d)). According to the Court of Special Appeals, this discretion is limited by the requirement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">conditions of probation must be reasonable and have a rational basis. They must not be the product of arbitrariness or capriciousness. Moreover, the conditions imposed must be clear, definite and capable of being properly comprehended and understood not only by the individual upon whom they are imposed but by those responsible for their enforcement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>(quoting <em>Watson v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 263, 274, 301 A.2d 26, 31-32 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The Court of Special Appeals acknowledged that several federal cases cited by Petitioner indicated that a sentencing court must find evidence which unambiguously shows that the defendant is a danger to his own children before restricting access to them, (citing <em>United States v. Lonjose, </em>663 F.3d 1292, 1303 (10th Cir.2011), and further discussing <em>United States v. Bear, </em>769 F.3d 1221, 1229 (10th Cir.2014), and <em>United States v. Wolf Child, </em>699 F.3d 1082, 1093 (9th Cir.2012)). However, the Court remarked that that those cases are not binding in Maryland, and those cases \u201care directly at odds with Maryland\u2019s approach to limiting the custody and visitation rights of individuals who have previously abused or neglected a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Regarding Maryland\u2019s approach, the Court observed that, under Md. Code (1984, Repl. Vol. 2012), \u00a7 9-101 of the Family Law Article (\u201cFam. Law\u201d), \u201can individual who has abused or neglected any child has no right to any unsupervised visitation unless he or she is able to persuade the court that there is no likelihood of further abuse or neglect.\u201d (emphasis omitted) (footnote omitted). The Court pointed out that \u00a7 9-101 \u201capplies regardless of whether the child abused or neglected was the child whose custody or visitation is currently in issue.\u201d (citing <em>In re Adoption No. 12612, </em>353 Md. 209, 234, 725 A.2d 1037, 1049-50 (1999)). Thus, according to the Court of Special Appeals, Maryland courts take a default position that a parent who has abused or neglected a child will be denied unsupervised contact with his or her own child.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Turning to the no-unsupervised-contact condition, the Court of Special Appeals observed that the condition did not impose an outright ban on contact, just unsupervised contact, and was limited to the five year period of active probation. The Court of Special Appeals also noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">[A] condition to the granting of probation which compels a defendant to give up a fundamental or constitutional right is not in and of itself unconstitutional or invalid. [A] court will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>not strike down conditions of release, even if they implicate fundamental rights, if such conditions are reasonably related to the ends of rehabilitation and protection of the public from recidivism. Such a condition cannot stand [only] if it is not related to the crime of which defendant has been convicted and if it has no reasonable relation to future criminality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">(quoting <em>Henson v. State, </em>212 Md.App. 314, 327-28, 69 A.3d 26, 34, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 Md. 314, 75 A.3d 319 (2013) (internal citations and quotations omitted)). The Court concluded that the condition of probation imposed \u201cwas sufficiently related to the crime for which [Petitioner] was convicted, <em>ie., </em>sexual assault of a child residing in his household.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The case at bar presents a dispute over the requirement that conditions of probation \u201cmust be reasonable and have a rational connection to the offense.\u201d <em>Meyer v. State, </em>445 Md. 648, 680, 128 A.3d 147, 166 (2015) (citation omitted). Petitioner contends that the no-unsupervised-contact condition was unreasonable and lacked a rational basis \u201c[b]ecause there was no evidence produced at trial or sentencing that [Petitioner] was a threat to his biological son and because the challenged condition unduly infringed on [his] fundamental right to parent his child[.]\u201d Petitioner cites to the decisions- of several Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal and out-of-state jurisdictions for the proposition that conditions of probation infringing upon the right to parent should be viewed with \u201cheightened scrutiny[.]\u201d In the case at bar, Petitioner contends that \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d could only be satisfied where the record established that he posed a threat to <em>\u201chis </em>child[.]\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The State responds that a sentencing judge\u2019s broad discretion to impose conditions of probation \u2014 notwithstanding the fundamental constitutional implications of such conditions \u2014 is only limited by the requirement that conditions must be \u201creasonably related to ... protecting the public and rehabilitating the defendant^]\u201d The State contends that the no-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>unsupervised-contact condition was reasonably related to Petitioner\u2019s \u201cpotential future criminality[ ]\u201d where: 1) Petitioner failed to recognize the inappropriate nature of his behavior; 2) studies have documented the phenomenon of <em>\u201ccrossover\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., where sex offenders abuse children of both genders, and also abuse relatives and non-relatives;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 3) the challenged condition was narrowly tailored to prohibit only <em>unsupervised </em>contact for a five year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">For the reasons expressed below, we decline Petitioner\u2019s request to strike the no-unsupervised-contact condition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We hold that Maryland courts are not required to apply a \u201cheightened\u201d level of scrutiny to conditions of probation impinging upon the fundamental right to parent. Instead, we take the position that the challenged condition was only required to be reasonable and rationally connected to the offense of conviction, and the aforementioned condition satisfied this standard where Petitioner had been convicted of sexually abusing a minor child in his household.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">I. Conditions of Probation must be Reasonable and Have a Rational Connection to the Offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Upon a finding of guilt, the court may \u201csuspend the imposition or execution of sentence and place the defendant on probation on the conditions that the court considers proper.\u201d Crim Proc. \u00a7 6-221; <em>Meyer, </em>445 Md. at 679, 128 A.3d at 166 (citing <em>DeLeon v. State, </em>102 Md.App. 58, 74, 648 A.2d 1053, 1060-61 (1994)). By exercising the authority to place a defendant on probation, the court engages in an act of clemency or leniency, whereby the defendant maintains his or her freedom. <em>Meyer, </em>445 Md. at 679, 128 A.3d at 166 (citing <em>Hanison-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>Solomon v.

State, </em>238 Md. 265, 275, 208 A.2d 575, 580 (1965) (\u201cProbation is a matter of grace, which aside from being an act of clemency extended to one who has committed a crime, is in substance and effect a bargain made by the people, through legislation and the courts, with the malefactor that he may be free as long as he conducts himself in a manner consonant with established communal standards and the safety of society.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">To further the goals of sentencing \u2014 \u201cpunishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation\u201d \u2014 the court has broad discretion to impose conditions that curtail the defendant\u2019s liberty while on probation. <em>Meyer, </em>445 Md. at 670, 128 A.3d at 160 (citation omitted); <em>Bailey v. State, </em>355 Md. 287, 294, 734 A.2d 684, 687 (1999). This discretion, although broad, is limited in several important respects: \u201ca condition of probation must not be vague, indefinite or uncertain[,]\u201d <em>Smith v.

In that case, Mr. Henson was found guilty \u201cof conspiracy to violate Md. Code (2003, 2010 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 13-401 and 13-602(a)(9) of the Election Law Article ( [\u201cElec.

In denying this argument, the Court of Special Appeals observed that trial judges are vested with \u201cvery broad discretion\u201d when imposing conditions of probation, and \u201ca condition to the granting of probation which compels a defendant to give up a fundamental or constitutional right is not in and of itself unconstitutional or invalid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>327-28, 69 A.3d at 34 (quoting <em>People v.

The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>adhered to the reasonableness standard, and noted that the condition \u201c \u2018cannot stand [only] if it is not related to the crime of which defendant has been convicted and if it has no reasonable relation to future criminality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, 69 A.3d at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The Court observed that several out-of-state and federal jurisdictions have upheld prohibitions on employment and political speech/association as a condition of probation. <em>Id. </em>at 328-30, 69 A.3d at 34-36 (citing <em>People v.

The Court thereafter held that the condition of probation was rationally related to Mr. Henson\u2019s election law violations, and that the condition was narrowly tailored, as it imposed \u201cno ... legitimate control over [Mr. Henson\u2019s] political activities[,]\u201d other than the work-related campaign restriction. <em>Id. </em>at 331, 69 A.3d at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Consistent with <em>Henson, </em>Petitioner acknowledges that conditions of probation should be reviewed for reasonableness. However, Petitioner discusses several Federal Circuit Court of Appeals decisions that have applied a \u201cheightened\u201d level of scrutiny to conditions of supervised release that infringe upon the fundamental right to parent. <em>See United States v. Myers, </em>426 F.3d 117, 123-24 (2d Cir.2005) (indicating that the challenged condition must \u2018involve[ ] no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary\u2019 for the protection of children, or the furtherance of another sentencing aim); <em>United States v. Wolf Child, </em>699 F.3d 1082, 1092 (9th Cir.2012) (noting that \u201cthe sentencing court, at the time it imposes the restrictive condition on the exercise of a particularly significant liberty interest, must itself point to the evidence in the record on which it relies and explain how on the basis of that evidence the particular restriction is justified.\u201d); <em>United States v. Bear, </em>769 F.3d 1221 (10th Cir.2014); <em>United States v. Lonjose, </em>663 F.3d 1292, 1303 (10th Cir.2011) (noting that a district court abuses its discretion where it imposes a condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>tion that infringes upon that right to parent \u201cin the absence of a record that \u2018unambiguously supports] a finding\u2019 that the defendant is a danger to his own family members.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Petitioner also discusses two out-of-state decisions that applied a form of heightened scrutiny to conditions of probation that interfere with the defendant\u2019s familial relations. <em>State v. Letourneau, </em>100 Wash.App. 424, 438, 997 P.2d 436 (2000) (remarking that \u201climitations on fundamental rights during community custody\u201d must be \u201creasonably necessary to accomplish the essential needs of the [S]tate.\u201d); <em>Simants v. State, </em>329 P.3d 1033, 1038-39 (Alaska Ct.App.2014) (noting that conditions of probation which infringe upon the defendant\u2019s \u201cfamilial associations\u201d are reviewed with \u201cspecial scrutiny\u201d\u2014 requiring that the condition be \u201creasonably related to the rehabilitation of the offender and protection of the public\u201d and \u201cnarrowly tailored to avoid unnecessary interference with the [the defendant\u2019s] family relationships.\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">According to Petitioner, the aforementioned cases establish that \u201ca sentencing court may not impose a condition that impinges upon a defendant\u2019s right to parent unless there is evidence in the record that demonstrates the defendant is in fact a danger to his children.\u201d Applying this standard, Petitioner contends that the no-unsupervised-contact condition must be stricken because none of the testimony detailed incidents involving F. or other children related to Petitioner by blood. Petitioner proffers that none of the activities detailed in the mental health <em>assessment </em>\u2014 ie., addiction to pornography and sending explicit photos via the internet/text message \u2014 involved boys of any age, and notes that he only reported sexual fantasies of a heterosexual nature. Petitioner contends that the DHMH psychologist \u201cwas not concerned with his sexualized behavior generally but that she was instead concerned about that behavior in front of girls under the age of eighteen.\u201d Petitioner similarly highlights that the presentence investigation only recommended that he not have unsupervised contact with minor females, but was silent about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>contact with his minor son. Accordingly, Petitioner contends that the no-unsupervised-contact condition was not reasonably related to the protection of minors, including F.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">We disagree. While the reasonableness standard required that the record justify the no-unsupervised-contact condition, Petitioner erroneously contends that the condition could not include his own child, unless the victim of the defendant\u2019s abuse was the same gender as his child, and/or was a blood relative of Petitioner. Although some of the cases discussed by Petitioner seem to impose such a requirement, we decline to read such a requirement into Maryland\u2019s reasonableness standard. Furthermore, notwithstanding the disparities in gender and blood relation between B. and F., the no-unsupervised-contact condition was reasonably related to the protection of minors, including F.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">a. The reasonableness standard did not require the sentencing court to tailor the no-unsupervised-contact condition to the specific attributes of Petitioner\u2019s victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Several jurisdictions adhere to a reasonableness standard where a condition of probation infringes upon a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to parent. <em>See State v. Jones, </em>49 Ohio St.3d 51, 53, 550 N.E.2d 469 (1990); <em>State v. Strickland, </em>169 N.C.App. 193, 609 S.E.2d 253 (2005); <em>Perkins v. State, </em>317 P.3d 584, 588 (Wyo.2014); <em>Com. v. Dewey, </em>57 A.3d 1267, 1270 (Pa.Super.2012). However, the reasoning of the Court of Appeals of North Carolina \u2014 in declining to require that conditions of probation be narrowly tailored to protection of the type of victim abused \u2014 is particularly persuasive. <em>State v. Strickland, </em>169 N.C.App. 193, 609 S.E.2d 253 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In <em>Strickland, </em>the defendant was convicted of several counts of taking indecent liberties with a child after he had sexual intercourse with the minor sister of his wife, who was residing in his home at the time. <em>Id. </em>at 194, 609 S.E.2d 253. The defendant was given a suspended sentence and placed on 36 months of supervised probation, with the condition that he not reside in a household with a minor. <em>Id. </em>at 195, 609 S.E.2d 253. In light of the defendant\u2019s convictions, that condition was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>required by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1343(b2)(4), providing that a defendant may \u201cnot reside in a household with a minor child if the offense is one in which there is evidence of sexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant\u2019s probation was subsequently revoked and his sentences were activated, after he was found to be residing with his minor son, who was conceived as a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct. <em>Id. </em>The defendant appealed the revocation of his probation, contending that the aforementioned condition \u201cdeprived [him] of his constitutional rights to parent and care for his minor child without any showing that [he] was unfit or that the child was endangered.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The Court of Appeals of North Carolina noted that \u201c[t]he restriction on [defendant\u2019s] association rights is valid if (1) primarily designed to meet ends of rehabilitation and protection of the public, and (2) reasonably related to such ends.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196, 609 S.E.2d 258 (citation omitted). The Court thereafter rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1343(b2)(4) was unconstitutional as applied to him because he posed no threat to his own child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">Defendant argues that his crime arose out of his sexual contact with his thirteen-year-old sister-in-law, who was not a blood relative, and that there was no evidence that he had ever abused his own children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">No court in our jurisdiction has directly addressed the constitutionality of a condition of probation preventing a defendant from residing with his own child on similar facts, so we look outside of North Carolina for guidance. In <em>Commonwealth v. LaPointe [Lapointe ], </em>the Supreme Court of Massachusetts stated: \u201cWe reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the condition prohibiting him from residing with his son M.L. is invalid because the defendant \u2018has no history of any sexual relations with males (adults or children),\u2019 .... Irrespective of gender, as a minor, M.L. could be considered a potential target of the defendant. The judge acted reasonably in providing M.L. with some measure of protection.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. LaPointe [Lapointe ], </em>435 Mass. 455, 759 N.E.2d 294, 299 (2001). We believe the same logic counsels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>caution in allowing defendant to reside with his own child when he has been convicted of taking indecent liberties with a minor not his child, particularly, as here, when defendant took advantage of the fact that he was residing with the minor victim to facilitate the abuse. <em>See State v. Ehli, </em>681 N.W.2d 808 (N.D.2004). Further, the victim in the instant case was related to defendant through marriage. To the extent that defendant might feel tempted to sexually abuse a minor child when it and defendant are residing under the same roof, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A\u20141343(b2)(4) also serves the purposes of sentencing and probation of rehabilitation by removing defendant from the temptation to repeat his crimes. The limitations placed on defendant by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1343(b2)(4) further serve as a deterrent, as defendant will realize this is one consequence of his criminal acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">Defendant would have the courts make a detailed investigation in each case to the peculiar sexual desires of a child sex offender. The trial court would then be required to tailor the conditions of a defendant\u2019s probation to his particular form of predatory behavior. We expressly reject such an approach. In light of the fact that defendant repeatedly molested a child while living in the same household as his wife and mother-in-law, we hold that a restriction prohibiting defendant from residing in a household with any child, regardless of the gender or relationship of defendant to the child, is not unreasonable, or violative of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 197-98, 609 S.E.2d 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The reasonableness standard applied by the North Carolina Court of Appeals in <em>Strickland </em>\u2014 rejecting a standard where \u201c[t]he trial court would ... be required to tailor the conditions of a defendant\u2019s probation to his [or her] particular form of predatory behavior\u201d \u2014 is most consistent with the nature of parental rights and probation in Maryland. There is further sound policy supporting an approach similar to that in <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>We have recognized that the fundamental right to raise one\u2019s child is not absolute, and the right must frequently cede to the State\u2019s interest as <em>parens patriae </em>\u201cin caring for those, such as minors, who cannot care for themselves.\u201d <em>In Re Mark M., </em>365 Md. at 705-06, 782 A.2d at 343 (citing <em>Boswell v. Boswell, </em>352 Md. 204, 218, 721 A.2d 662, 669 (1998)). Fam. Law \u00a7 9-101 illustrates this principle by providing that a party to a child custody hearing that has previously abused a child shall be denied custody \u201c[ujnless the court specifically finds that there is no likelihood of further child abuse or neglect by the party[.]\u201d This Court has previously ruled that Fam. Law \u00a7 9-101 is not limited to scenarios where the child whose custody is in issue is also the child who has been abused. <em>In re Adoption No. 12612, </em>353 Md. at 238-39, 725 A.2d at 1052. Thus, as aptly noted by the Court of Special Appeals, Fam. Law \u00a7 9-101 represents a default position that a parent who \u201chas abused or neglected <em>a </em>child\u201d shall be denied \u201cunsupervised contact with <em>his or her own </em>child.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Regarding the nature of probation, this Court has acknowledged that probationers do not enjoy the breadth of constitutional rights that are enjoyed by law abiding citizens. <em>See Corbin v. State, </em>428 Md. 488, 504, 52 A.3d 946, 955 (2012) (\u201c[Probationers do not enjoy the same liberty rights as other citizens and have fewer legitimate expectations about privacy than law-abiding citizens.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Knights, </em>534 U.S. 112, 119, 122 S.Ct. 587, 591, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001) (\u201cInherent in the very nature of probation is that probationers \u2018do not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled.\u2019 \u201d). Rather, in exchange for an act of leniency by the court, the probationer voluntarily agrees to certain limitations on his or her rights, which the court is free to impose in its discretion. <em>See </em>Crim. Proc. \u00a7 6-221.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">While Maryland courts are accorded wide latitude to impose conditions of probation under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 6-221, the decisions from the federal circuits applying heightened scrutiny were reviewing conditions of supervised release imposed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(2). This distinction is notable be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>cause, unlike conditions of probation under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 6-221, conditions of supervised release must \u201cinvolve[ ] no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). The \u00a7 3553 factors include the \u201cdeterrence [of] criminal conduct[,]\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), the protection of the public \u201cfrom further crimes of the defendant[,]\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C), and the provision of \u201cneeded educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner[.]\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). Obviously, sentencing courts in Maryland need not comply with the \u201creasonably necessary\u201d provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d), and as a result, the \u201cheightened\u201d scrutiny analysis of the cases applying that statute are of limited relevance. <em>See </em>Crim Proc. \u00a7 6-221.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In addition, the very nature of probation in Maryland, as opposed to supervised release under the federal sentencing system, requires that conditions under each of these systems be treated differently. As noted above, \u201cprobation is considered to be a matter of grace and an act of clemency\u201d which generally takes the place of a term of incarceration. <em>See Meyer, </em>445 Md. at 679, 128 A.3d at 166 (citation omitted). To the contrary, supervised release is added to the court\u2019s sentence by being imposed \u201cafter imprisonment[.]\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(a). This distinction is important because a sentencing judge in Maryland, by imposing probation, is allowing the defendant substantially more liberties than he or she would otherwise enjoy while incarcerated; whereas a judge who imposes supervised release is imposing additional restrictions after incarceration. Accordingly, while heightened scrutiny may apply to a condition of supervised release that infringes upon the fundamental right to parent, there is little rationale for applying this heightened standard where a sentencing judge has allowed the defendant substantially more liberties by placing him or her on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Lastly, as a matter of sound policy, conditions of probation should not be subjected to the \u201cheightened\u201d scrutiny called for by Petitioner \u2014 requiring a sentencing court to tailor condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>tions of probation \u201cto the peculiar sexual desires of a child sex offender[.]\u201d <em>Strickland, supra. </em>The studies discussed by the State illustrate that sex offenders do not necessarily limit their criminal behavior to one specific \u201ctype\u201d of victim, and that offenders may abuse both relatives and non-relatives, and both males and females. <em>See </em>Levenson et al. and Simons, <em>supra. </em>While we do not opine on the frequency with which \u201ccrossover\u201d occurs, our holding allows the sentencing court, when faced with the protection of minors at the expense of parental rights, to exercise its discretion in furtherance of the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Accordingly, we adhere to the requirement that \u201cconditions of probation must be reasonable and have a rational connection to the offense[.]\u201d <em>Meyer, </em>445 Md. at 680, 128 A.3d at 166 (citation omitted). However, in doing so, we decline Petitioner\u2019s invitation to hold that this standard cannot be satisfied by a condition that restricts the defendant\u2019s contact with his children, unless the victim of the defendant\u2019s abuse is the same gender as the defendant\u2019s children, and/or is a blood relative of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">b. The no-unsupervised-contact condition was reasonably related to the protection of children and Petitioner\u2019s future criminality.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">In applying this standard, we believe that the no-unsupervised-contact condition was reasonably related to the protection of children, including F. Petitioner\u2019s focus on the gender of his victim overlooks the fact that B. was the half-sister of F., and that Petitioner took advantage of his living arrangement with B. to commit the sexual abuse for which he was convicted and sentenced. In light of the mental health assessment, which \u201cgave [the sentencing court] a lot of concern\u00ed,]\u201d there was a deterrent value in preventing the Petitioner from occupying such a position with respect to F. According to that assessment, Petitioner failed to recognize the inappropriate nature of his behavior, and repeatedly attempted to minimize his actions. Regarding the exposure of his penis, Petitioner reported that B. may have inadvertently seen the tip of his penis because he routinely sits on the couch with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>hands down the front of his pants. Petitioner opined that \u201ceveryone sits like that.\u201d Regarding the incidents of grabbing B.\u2019s chest, Petitioner attributed this to \u201chorsing around.\u201d In general, Petitioner expressed that he was upset with the charges against him, and revealed that \u201che does not believe that his crime was a sex offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The aforementioned evidence indicates that the no-unsupervised-contact-condition was reasonably related to the protection of F. Contrary to Petitioner\u2019s arguments in this Court and the Court of Special Appeals, the sentencing court did not abuse its discretion by neglecting to tailor the condition to the specific attributes of Petitioner\u2019s victim, <em>i.e., </em>by imposing a condition of no-unsupervised-contact with minor females, or all non-blood-related minors. As we noted above, such a requirement would place the sentencing court in the precarious position of trying to delineate \u201cthe peculiar sexual desires of a child sex offender\u201d where those desires may change and evolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Lastly, assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that we did apply a heightened scrutiny standard, the no-unsupervised-contact condition was narrowly tailored in the sense that it prevented only <em>unsupervised </em>contact with F., and only lasted during Petitioner\u2019s five year probationary term. These limiting characteristics distinguish the no-unsupervised-contact condition from those reflected in the cases discussed by Petitioner, <em>cf. Wolf Child, </em>699 F.3d at 1089 (striking a condition of supervised release that prohibited the defendant from \u201cresiding] in the home, residence, or be[ing] in the company of any child under the age of 18[ ]\u201d \u201cwithout the prior written approval of the United States Probation [Office]); <em>Lonjose, </em>663 F.3d at 1303 (striking a condition of supervised release requiring prior written permission by the United States Probation Office before the defendant could have contact with his son), and make the present condition more similar to conditions which have been upheld by other jurisdictions. <em>See Strickland, </em>169 N.C.App. at 196-97, 609 S.E.2d 253 (upholding a condition of probation preventing the defendant from residing with his son, where the condition was limited to a 36 month probationary period, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>and \u201cdid not prevent the defendant from visiting his child[.]\u201d); <em>State v. Corean, </em>651 A.2d 319, 321 (Me.1994) (holding that a prohibition on all contact with a probationer\u2019s children was an abuse of discretion, but approving of a prohibition on unsupervised contact only). Accordingly, we hold that the sentencing court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a reasonable and narrowly-tailored condition of probation that prohibited unsupervised contact with minors, including Petitioner\u2019s son.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS ARE AFFIRMED.

State, </em>209 Md.App. 600, 606-07, 61 A.3d 87, 90 (2013) (upholding a condition of probation that prohibited the defendant from having contact with his wife, reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>ing that \"[b]y perpetrating an act of domestic violence against his wife, appellant subordinated his rights to the State's interest in punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation omitted) (emphasis omitted). The Court of Special Appeals has also considered the propriety of a condition of probation that limited the defendant\u2019s contact with his son, by prohibiting contact with the defendant's girlfriend/victim. <em>See Douglas v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 666, 675-76, 747 A.2d 752, 757(2000) (upholding the condition without discussion of fundamental parental rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">This Court has also commented that a condition of probation prohibiting the defendant from having unsupervised contact with minors was legal where the defendant had been convicted of sexually abusing his niece and another child. <em>State v. Griswold, </em>374 Md. 184, 188, 821 A.2d 430, 433 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
