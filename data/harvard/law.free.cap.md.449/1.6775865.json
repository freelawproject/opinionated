We also consider whether, in affirming the judgment of the circuit court, the Court of Special Appeals applied the appropriate standard of review to the circuit court\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions. For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b33-14\">At approximately 6:03 p.m. on May 23, 2013, Deputy First Class Chad Atkins (\u201cDeputy Atkins\u201d) of the Frederick County Sheriffs Office, was patrolling Worthington Boulevard in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>unmarked police vehicle when he observed a speeding vehicle being driven by Petitioner. As a result, Deputy Atkins, a certified radar and laser operator, activated his radar equipment and determined that the vehicle was traveling at a speed of 50 miles per hour in a 35 mile per hour zone. Deputy Atkins subsequently stopped Petitioner for the traffic violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Deputy Atkins approached the passenger side of Petitioner\u2019s vehicle, subsequent to Petitioner rolling down the window. Petitioner was the sole occupant. During the suppression hearing, Deputy Atkins testified that upon initial contact with Petitioner, he detected the odor of marijuana emanating from the vehicle. He further testified that he could not recall whether his head crossed the window\u2019s threshold while speaking with Petitioner. Deputy Atkins was familiar with the smell of marijuana, having received over one hundred hours of police training in controlled dangerous substances \u2014 including the identification of marijuana \u2014 and completing approximately one hundred drug-related arrests. Deputy Atkins also testified that the weather was windy and the odor of marijuana \u201cquickly dissipated.\u201d Approximately two to three minutes after Deputy Atkins initiated the stop, he returned to his vehicle and requested a nearby K-9 dog unit. Corporal Eyler<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arrived approximately fifteen minutes later. Thereafter, Deputy Atkins returned to Petitioner\u2019s vehicle, and requested that he step out. While Deputy Atkins and Petitioner stood behind Petitioner\u2019s vehicle, Corporal Eyler began the K-9 dog scan.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">While Corporal Eyler conducted the scan, Deputy Atkins informed Petitioner that he detected the odor of marijuana emanating from his vehicle. Petitioner admitted- that there was pipe and a small amount of marijuana in the center console. Shortly thereafter, Corporal Eyler informed Deputy Atkins of a positive alert from Petitioner\u2019s vehicle. A search of the vehicle by Deputy Atkins revealed a film canister <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>containing 1.6 grams of marijuana, as well as a smoking device containing burnt marijuana residue in the center console. Petitioner was placed under arrest and later released with a criminal citation. Petitioner subsequently moved to suppress the evidence seized from his vehicle, asserting that Deputy Atkins conducted an unconstitutional search when he inserted his head into the passenger window and detected the odor of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Suppression Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Petitioner\u2019s suppression hearing was held before the circuit court on January 6, 2014. Deputy Atkins testified on behalf of the State regarding his initial contact with Petitioner. On cross-examination, defense counsel sought clarification regarding the moment Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana. The cross-examination proceeded, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So when you stopped him, you got out of your car, did you smell marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">[DEPUTY ATKINS]: Yes, on the initial contact. [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I said when you got out of your car did you smell marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">[DEPUTY ATKINS]: You mean before I went up to his car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yeah. Before, before you went up to his car did you smell marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-11\">[DEPUTY ATKINS]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Did you perform a sniff of his car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-13\">[DEPUTY ATKINS]: Did, what do you mean by sniff? [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Like a dog. I\u2019m saying did you specifically examine his car for, for the smell of marijuana? [DEPUTY ATKINS]: You mean did I walk around the car and just sniff at, at his car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I understand the answer may be no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>[DEPUTY ATKINS]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Ah, so the point at which you, you allege you smelled marijuana was when you kind of leaned in to get his, get his license and registration? [DEPUTY ATKINS]: If you call it leaning, it\u2019s when he rolled down his window and I made con \u2014 when I was speaking with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Do you recall how you, how you positioned yourself when you were speaking with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">[DEPUTY ATKINS]: Like I, I, I don\u2019t know how to explain it \u2018cause I do it on every single stop that I have. I, you know, put my head, he, they have the, they roll the window down and I have my head by their window. And\u2014 [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Do you recall if your head entered the window or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">[DEPUTY ATKINS]: I don\u2019t know if my head entered through the window [pane] or not. I wouldn\u2019t of, you know, it, I, I don\u2019t know. Honestly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. You wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find out that it did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-10\">[DEPUTY ATKINS]: If I had crossed where the window glass was? No\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Where the, where the pane\u2014 [DEPUTY ATKINS]: \u2014because sometimes\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: \u2014would have been\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-13\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-14\">THE COURT: Let, let him answer. One at a time. We have all morning to finish the (unclear \u2014 one word). Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-16\">[DEPUTY ATKINS]: No, I, the, wouldn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-17\">Following the parties\u2019 agreement regarding the admissibility and authenticity of the DVD traffic stop video, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>played in court. Although the point at which Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana was not clear from the video, the court acknowledged that Deputy Atkins\u2019 head appeared to cross the window pane into the interior of Petitioner\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Defense counsel subsequently moved to suppress the 1.6 grams of marijuana contained in a film canister in the center console of Petitioner\u2019s vehicle, arguing that an illegal search occurred in violation of the Fourth Amendment when Deputy Atkins inserted his head into the passenger window. Defense counsel further argued that the prolonged detention while awaiting arrival of the K-9 unit also violated the Fourth Amendment. The State countered that the traffic stop escalated to a narcotics investigation the moment Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana, providing, \u201cat a minimum,\u201d reasonable articulable suspicion to justify Petitioner\u2019s detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">After considering the evidence and arguments of counsel, the court rendered the following ruling:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">As this was a warrantless search the burden of course is on the State to show that the stop was reasonable and justified under the [FJourth [Ajmendment because of course as a general rule the [Fjourth [Ajmendment prohibits searches and seizures without a warrant except in a certain specific number of [ ] exceptions....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">In this case the [cjourt finds the following facts. On the date in question Deputy Atkins was on routine patrol in Frederick County, Maryland. While on routine patrol he observed a vehicle being driven by a person who we later discovered to be [Petitioner] that was, appeared to be, to him to be exceeding the posted speed. Deputy Atkins was going in the opposite direction on Worthington Boulevard in Urbana and he did a U-turn and pulled the vehicle over. He approached the vehicle on the passenger side of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>vehicle. The window was rolled down. [Petitioner] was in the driver\u2019s side, he was the only person in the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-4\">Deputy Atkins asked for his of course license and registration and during that process his, from the video his head appeared to have intruded somewhat into the window space, into the interior of [Petitioner\u2019s] car. The testimony of Deputy Atkins was that he didn\u2019t recall whether his head went in the vehicle or not. <em>It was very possible [Deputy Atkins\u2019] head would have broken the [pane] and it was at some point, it was not clear whether it was when his head was inside or when the window was rolled down, lie-smelled what he believed based on his training and experience smelled like marijuana. </em>But he also testified that it dissipated rather quickly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">Based on those factors what Deputy Atkins chose to do at that time was to not conclude that there was probable cause to conduct [] a search of [Petitioner\u2019s] vehicle. Although case law clearly indicates that the test, that the police officer\u2019s, trained police officer\u2019s smelling of an odor of marijuana can perform the basis of probable cause to do a warrantless search and of course one of the exceptions permitted in the [F]ourth [A]mendment is if the officer has probable cause to search or arrest for an offense committed in his presence, which of course probable cause of a strong odor of marijuana would be evidence, probable cause that [Petitioner] was in possession of marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">But [Deputy Atkins] was not, it wasn\u2019t a strong odor so he was not convinced. But it did create an articulable suspicion which was reasonable under the circumstances to detain [Petitioner] for further investigation until a K-9 unit could arrive. That further detention was approximately 15 minutes. I think that was [Deputy Atkins\u2019] testimony on the stand and in reviewing the time frames on the, um, on the video that was very close. I think the, actually got back to the car at like four minutes after the, the stop was initiated and I think the dog came at about, and started the search about 20 minutes after the stop. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>So that was close. So the question is was that a sufficient basis, a sufficient articulable reason to detain [Petitioner] for that period of time and the [c]ourt does find that is a sufficient articulable justification for the further detention of [Petitioner]. This was not one of the cases where it was just because it was some other reason and that they were trying to justify the stop based on it took a long time to get the tickets written or the information back from the Motor Vehicle Administration. That was not the reason offered by the State. But it was because of the odor of marijuana that [Deputy Atkins] smelled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-4\">And quite frankly the [c]ourt, ah, commends [Deputy Atkins] for not arresting [Petitioner], but to make sure that what he, that there was probable cause before he arrested [him]. Or eventually charged him. I believe the testimony was he charged him on a, um, on a citation and, and never did officially put [Petitioner] into handcuffs. Which again, the [c]ourt finds based on all the circumstances is, was certainly appropriate under this circumstance....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Following the denial of his suppression motion, Petitioner pled not guilty to an agreed statement of facts. The court found Petitioner guilty of possession of marijuana, and subsequently sentenced him to thirty days, all suspended, in addition to one year of probation, a $200 fine, and $145 in court costs. Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the judgment. <em>See Terrance Jamal Grant v. State of Maryland, </em>No. 2742 Sept. Term, 2013, 2015 WL 5822270 (Md.Ct.Spec.App. July 24, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Court of Special Appeals\u2019 Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">On appeal, Petitioner averred that the court\u2019s indication that when Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana was \u201cnot clear,\u201d reflected an unambiguous explicit factual finding. Therefore, the State failed to satisfy its \u201cburden to justify the warrantless search and arrest[,]\u201d and the circuit court erred in denying Petitioner\u2019s suppression motion. In contrast, the State argued that the court\u2019s statement was ambiguous and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>not an explicit finding, and therefore, based on the supplemental rules of appellate review, the court may resolve ambiguities and draw inferences from the evidence in favor of the prevailing party, here, the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The Court of Special Appeals adopted the State\u2019s argument, concluding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">[T]he [circuit] court\u2019s statement reflected the ambiguous nature of the evidence. As we have previously explained, we resolve any ambiguity by looking to the officer\u2019s testimony that he smelled the marijuana upon \u2018initial contact.\u2019 This can be interpreted to mean that Deputy Atkins detected the tell-tale odor of marijuana before he placed his head in the vehicle\u2019s window. If this was the case, and we must interpret the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, then there was no warrantless search of [Petitioner\u2019s] vehicle. Although there existed, at that moment, probable cause for Deputy Atkins to arrest [Petitioner] and search the vehicle he did not do so. Instead, he took the extra precaution of calling for a K-9 [dog unit] to respond to the scene to confirm his reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. Then he placed [Petitioner] [] under arrest and searched the vehicle. Under the totality of the circumstances, the stop and search were reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-7\"><em>Grant, </em>2015 WL 5822270, at *7. We thereafter, granted certio-rari.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">The well-established standard of review for motions to suppress is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-10\">Our review of a circuit court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence under the Fourth Amendment, ordinarily, is limited to the information contained in the record of the suppression hearing and not the record of the trial. When there is a denial of a motion to suppress, we are further limited to considering facts in the light most favorable to the State as the prevailing party on the motion. Even so, we review legal questions <em>de novo, </em>and where, as here, a party has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>raised a constitutional challenge to a search or seizure, we must make an independent constitutional evaluation by reviewing the relevant law and applying it to the unique facts and circumstances of the case. We will not disturb the [circuit] court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><em>State v. Wallace, </em>372 Md. 137, 144, 812 A.2d 291, 295 (2002) (internal citations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">I. The circuit court erred in denying Petitioner\u2019s suppression motion</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The arguments advanced by the parties are similar to those raised before the Court of Special Appeals, <em>supra, </em>and ultimately require us to decide whether the State satisfied its burden of proving that Deputy Atkins conducted a lawful search. We hold that the circuit court erred in denying Petitioner\u2019s suppression motion where the evidence was unclear regarding the timing of Deputy Atkins\u2019 detection of the odor of marijuana. In the absence of a finding that Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana <em>before </em>he inserted his head into the passenger window, the State did not satisfy its burden regarding the lawfulness of the search. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">A. When Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana was dispositive</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">Resolution of the suppression motion hinged upon a factual determination of when Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana \u2014 before or after he inserted his head into the passenger window. This determination was critical to ascertaining whether an unlawful search occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">In addressing the constitutionality of Deputy Atkins\u2019 conduct, we first acknowledge that only the events occurring after the traffic stop are relevant to our Fourth Amendment analysis. Because Deputy Atkins had probable cause to stop and temporarily detain Petitioner\u2019s vehicle as a result of a speeding violation, the initial traffic stop was constitutional. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 1772, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996) (acknowledging that an officer may have probable cause to stop and temporarily detain a vehicle after a traffic violation); <em>Byndloss v. State, </em>391 Md. 462, 480, 893 A.2d 1119, 1130 (2006) (\u201cAs a general matter, the decision to stop an automobile is reasonable where the police have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">i. The interior of Petitioner\u2019s vehicle was protected by the Fourth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The Fourth Amendment guarantees individuals the right \u201cto be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.... \u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. This constitutional mandate is also applicable to the states, through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Corbin v.

State, </em>371 Md. 93, 105, 807 A.2d 13, 20 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Although not as substantial as the privacy interest that exists in one\u2019s home, Fourth Amendment protection extends to the interior of a vehicle. <em>See New York v. Class, </em>475 U.S. 106, 108, 114-15, 106 S.Ct. 960, 966, 89 L.Ed.2d 81 (1986) (\u201cWhile the interior of an automobile is not subject to the same expectations of privacy that exist with respect to one\u2019s home, a car\u2019s interior as a whole is nonetheless subject to Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable intrusions by the police.\u201d); <em>Arizona v.

Ryles, </em>988 F.2d 13, 15 (5th Cir.1993) (officer\u2019s action in inserting his head into the interior of a van through an open window constituted a Fourth Amendment search, albeit a reasonable one, due to a series of suspicious conduct by the defendant.); <em>accord, e.g., State v.

LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise On The Fourth Amendment, \u00a7 2.5(c) (5th ed. 2015), Lafave opines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">Sometimes the police detect the contents of a vehicle by the sense of smell.... \u2018This olfactory impression ... comes under the plain view doctrine which applies to all sensory impressions gained by an officer who is legally present in the position from which he gains them.\u2019 In <em>United States v. Martinez-Miramontes, </em>[494 F.2d 808 (9th Cir.1974) ], where a customs agent approached a parked car and, by sniffing around a crevice where the trunk closed, detected the odor of marijuana, the court concluded that this degree of scrutiny was not objectionable: \u2018We find no distinction of substance between leaning down and turning the head to look inside a motor vehicle to see articles which then come within the \u2018plain view\u2019 doctrine ... and leaning down and sniffing to detect the odor of marijuana.\u2019 But if the officer leans into an open window to detect the odor, then there <em>has </em>been a search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">(internal footnotes omitted). <em>See also Cruz v. State, </em>168 Md.App. 149, 167-68, 895 A.2d 1076, 1086-87 (2006) (noting that a K-9 dog\u2019s handler who intentionally directs or instructs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the K-9 to scan a vehicle\u2019s interior constitutes a search in violation of the Fourth Amendment); <em>accord, e.g., United States v.

Probable cause was required before Deputy Atkins inserted his head into Petitioner\u2019s vehicle</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Applying these general principles of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence to the case at bar, we hold that Deputy Atkins conducted a search \u2022within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when he inserted his head into the constitutionally-protected area of Petitioner\u2019s vehicle, without the benefit of a warrant or other justification.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Class, </em>475 U.S. at 108, 114-15, 106 S.Ct. at 966.

Montoya de Hernandez, </em>473 U.S. 531, 537, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 3308, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985). \u201cWhat is reasonable depends upon all of the circumstances surrounding the search or seizure and the nature of the search or seizure itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Therefore, \u201c[t]he permissibility of a particular law enforcement practice is judged by \u2018balancing its intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>409 Md. 415, 427, 975 A.2d 877, 884 (2009) (\u201cIn assessing whether a search or seizure was reasonable, [t]he touchstone of our analysis under the Fourth Amendment is always the reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen\u2019s personal security.\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">There is a split of authority regarding whether an officer\u2019s physical intrusion into a vehicle\u2019s interior, in the absence of probable cause or the existence of a warrant, constitutes an unreasonable \u201csearch\u201d that is violative of the Fourth Amendment. On one hand, courts have held that this intentional act is unreasonable, in the absence of probable cause, reasonable suspicion, or other justification. In <em>United States v. Montes-Ramos, </em>347 Fed.Appx. 383, 385, 389-90 (10th Cir.2009), the Tenth Circuit held that although the officer\u2019s initial stop of the appellant\u2019s vehicle was constitutional, the officer conducted an unlawful search when he placed his head into the front passenger-side door by approximately two inches, at which point he smelled marijuana, to further investigate his \u201chunch\u201d that the appellant was transporting drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Similarly, in <em>Davis v. State, </em>68 Ark. App. 346, 8 S.W.3d 36, 38-39 (1999), an Arkansas appellate court held that despite the legality of the initial stop, the officer subsequently conducted an unlawful search. The court explained that the officer \u201chad no suspicion, reasonable or otherwise, that appellant\u2019s vehicle contained contraband until after he \u2018stuck [his] head\u2019 into appellant\u2019s truck and smelled marijuana.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Podgurski, </em>436 N.E.2d at 151-53, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts similarly held that an officer\u2019s conduct constituted an unlawful search. While responding to a tip of \u201csuspicious activity\u201d occurring in a stationary cargo van, the officer approached the van and placed his head into the windowless, rear interior of the van. <em>Id. </em>at 151. The court held that the officer\u2019s observation of illegal activity did not occur until he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>\u201cstuck his head inside\u201d the rear window, reasoning that \u201c[p]ri- or to entering the van, the officer made no attempt to question or communicate with the defendants in any way,\u201d and that the record did not \u201cdisclose that he was warranted in taking reasonable precautions for his safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">An Oregon appellate court in <em>Hendricks, </em>948 P.2d 740, reached a similar conclusion. While facilitating a traffic stop for a speeding violation, the state trooper inserted his head into the driver-side window of the defendant\u2019s truck. <em>Id. </em>at 741. The court observed that it was \u201cundisputed that [the state trooper] did not suspect [the] defendant of engaging in criminal conduct\u201d prior to his physical intrusion. <em>Id. </em>at 743. In reversing the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the court held that the state trooper \u201cwas allowed to observe and smell what he otherwise would not have been able to observe or smell from a lawful vantage point[,]\u201d which constituted a search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Conversely, other courts have focused on the totality of the circumstances surrounding an officer\u2019s physical intrusion into a vehicle\u2019s interior, and held that this intentional act was reasonable. In <em>United States v. Pierre, </em>958 F.2d 1304, 1307 (5th Cir.1992), the Fifth Circuit held that a border patrol agent\u2019s act of \u201cduck[ing] [his] head in [the window] to get a clear view of the back seat\u201d during a routine checkpoint stop, was not a search violative of the Fourth Amendment. After the patrol agent\u2019s physical intrusion, he detected the odor of freshly burned marijuana. <em>Id. </em>The court reasoned that the patrol agent\u2019s actions were justified because passengers of vehicles at fixed checkpoints near state borders \u201cdo not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in not being stopped and questioned about their citizenship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1309. The court further reasoned that the physical features of the two-door, tinted window vehicle made it difficult for the patrol agent to communicate with the backseat passenger, which posed a threat to the agent\u2019s safety. <em>Id. </em>at 1309-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Similarly in <em>United States v. Winters, </em>221 F.3d 1039 (8th Cir.2000), the Eighth Circuit shared a similar concern for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>officer\u2019s safety during an investigatory stop. After observing the defendant speeding, a state trooper activated his emergency equipment and pursued. <em>Id. </em>at 1040. The defendant continued driving for several hundred yards, before turning into a nearby driveway and driving into a snow bank. <em>Id. </em>Upon exiting his vehicle, the defendant started to walk away until the state trooper instructed him to stop. <em>Id. </em>The state trooper subsequently asked the defendant for his license, registration, and proof of insurance, at which point, the defendant informed the trooper that his license had been suspended. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Once he returned to his vehicle, the defendant searched for his registration and insurance, when his hands seemed to \u201cdisappear\u201d under the driver\u2019s seat. <em>Id. </em>After performing a similar search on the passenger side, the defendant informed the state trooper that he did not have car insurance. <em>Id. </em>As the defendant continued to search for other documentation, the trooper observed that the defendant had access to a baseball bat on the passenger side of his vehicle. <em>Id. </em>While cautioning the defendant against reaching under the passenger seat, the state trooper placed \u201chis head inside the open driver\u2019s-side door\u201d and detected the odor of raw marijuana. <em>Id. </em>Based on these facts, the court held that there was a \u201clegitimate concern for safety,\u201d in which \u201can officer can take steps reasonably necessary to protect his personal safety and to maintain the status quo.... \u201d during an investigatory stop. <em>Id. </em>at 1041-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">A Washington appellate court in <em>Larson, </em>946 P.2d 1212, addressed a similar factual scenario. In <em>Larson, </em>a state trooper who observed the defendant speeding on a freeway, activated his emergency equipment and began to pursue the defendant\u2019s truck. <em>Id. </em>at 1213. The defendant failed to pull over or slow down, but the state trooper observed the defendant \u201cleaning forward and making movements toward the floorboard of his truck.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After traveling some distance, the defendant exited the freeway and stopped in a hotel parking lot. <em>Id. </em>Once stopped, the defendant exited his truck and the state trooper patted his outer clothing. <em>Id. </em>Thereaf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ter, the state trooper \u201cstuck his head in the cab of the truck through the open door to visually inspect the area around the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">The court held that the state trooper\u2019s search was reasonable under the circumstances because it was necessary for his safety. <em>Id. </em>at 1215-16. The court reasoned, \u201cthe purpose of such a search [was] to discover whether the suspect\u2019s furtive gesture hid a weapon[ ]\u201d and thus, \u201c[t]he scope of the search ... [was] limited to the area of the vehicle defined by the suspicious movements observed by the officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citation omitted) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Likewise, in <em>State v. Aubin, </em>622 A.2d 444, 445-46 (R.I.1993), the Supreme Court of Rhode Island held that an officer\u2019s leaning into the defendant\u2019s vehicle where he subsequently discovered a gun between the defendant\u2019s feet, was not viola-tive of the Fourth Amendment. The court explained that the officer\u2019s conduct \u201cwas at most a mere inconvenience to defendant....\u201d in what the court described as \u201can inherently dangerous situation[,]\u201d given that the defendant\u2019s vehicle was suspiciously parked on a sidewalk around 3:15 a.m. and the defendant\u2019s companion fled the scene when officers approached the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The circumstances presented in the case at bar are readily distinguishable. For reasons we shall explain, we hold that Deputy Atkins\u2019 search exceeded the scope of the limited investigatory purposes of the traffic stop. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 682, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 1573, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985) (noting that the dual inquiry for evaluating the reasonableness of an investigative stop involves examination of \u201c \u2018whether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception, and <em>whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u2019 </em>\u201d) (emphasis added and citation omitted); <em>Byndloss, </em>391 Md. at 480, 893 A.2d at 1130 (\u201c[T]he detention of a person \u2018must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Petitioner directs this Court\u2019s attention to the Oregon appellate court\u2019s opinion in <em>Hendricks, </em>948 P.2d 740, discussed <em>supra, </em>for the proposition that an officer\u2019s warrantless physical intrusion into a vehicle during a traffic stop constitutes an unlawful search that warrants suppression of seized evidence. The court\u2019s reasonableness analysis is instructive. In <em>Hendricks, </em>the defendant appealed a conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII), following a trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a traffic stop. <em>Id. </em>at 741. The appellate court recited the following relevant facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">[The state trooper] stopped defendant for a lane violation. He ran a record check on defendant and discovered that defendant had a number of prior DUII violations. He wrote out the citation for the lane violation and then leaned into the open driver-side window of defendant\u2019s truck to deliver the citation to defendant. When he inserted his head into the truck, [he] smelled a strong odor of alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath. He then looked at defendant more carefully and observed that defendant\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and watery. [He] asked defendant how much he had to drink that day, and defendant responded that he had four beers. [He] then asked defendant if he could look into defendant\u2019s eyes. Defendant agreed, and [the state trooper] conducted a Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. [The state trooper] requested that defendant step out of the truck to perform other field sobriety tests, and defendant agreed. At the conclusion of the tests, [he] arrested defendant for DUII.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-6\"><em>Id. </em>Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress the results of the field sobriety tests, asserting that they were the fruits of an illegal search because the state trooper unlawfully inserted his head into his truck. <em>Id. </em>The court denied the motion, reasoning that under the totality of the circumstances, \u201c[the state trooper] leaning his head\u201d into the vehicle did not constitute a search. <em>Id. </em>The court gave credence to the state trooper\u2019s testimony that he was \u201chanding [defendant] a ticket, leaned in to give it to him, and explain. And while there, just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>stumbled upon these other things.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress, because the state trooper conducted a search at a point where he \u201clacked reasonable suspicion to investigate anything other than the lane violation for which defendant was stopped[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The appellate court agreed, concluding that because the defendant had a clear protected privacy interest in his truck, the state trooper\u2019s actions constituted an unlawful intrusion that \u201callowed [him] to observe and smell what he otherwise would not have been able to observe or smell from a lawful vantage point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 743. The court further explained, \u201cbecause it is undisputed that [the state trooper] did not suspect defendant of engaging in criminal \u2022 conduct before [placing his head into the truck], it necessarily follows that [he] exceeded the scope of the traffic stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, the court reversed the denial of the defendant\u2019s suppression motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">We are also persuaded by the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reasonableness analysis in <em>Ryles, </em>988 F.2d 13, <em>supra. </em>In <em>Ryles, </em>988 F.2d at 14, a state trooper noticed a van changing lanes on a rural highway without signaling. As a result of the traffic violation, the state trooper ordered the van to pull onto the highway shoulder, at which point, Ryles immediately exited the van and approached the state trooper. <em>Id. </em>Ryles admitted that he was the driver of the van, in which there were passengers, that he did not have a driver\u2019s license, and that he was unaware whether the van was insured. <em>Id. </em>During this exchange, the state trooper detected the odor of alcohol on Ryles\u2019 breath. <em>Id. </em>After asking Ryles whether any of the passengers in the van possessed a driver\u2019s license, the trooper approached the driver\u2019s door and immediately smelled burnt marijuana. <em>Id. </em>A subsequent warrantless search of the van yielded cocaine and a weapon, which led to Ryles\u2019 conviction and sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">On appeal, the parties disputed whether the state trooper opened the driver\u2019s side door or inserted his head into an open window before he detected the odor of marijuana. <em>Id. </em>at 15. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>During the suppression hearing, the lower court failed to render a finding regarding whether the trooper detected the odor before he entered the van and the trooper could not recall whether he placed his head into the van. <em>Id. &amp; </em>n. 4. A passenger in the vehicle testified that the state trooper opened the van\u2019s door and stuck his torso inside. <em>Id. </em>at n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The Fifth Circuit held that the state trooper\u2019s actions constituted a \u201csearch,\u201d regardless of when he detected the odor of marijuana, because the state trooper \u201cintruded inside a space that, under most circumstances, is protected by a legitimate expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, the court affirmed Ryles\u2019 conviction and sentence, reasoning that the search was reasonable under the circumstances. The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">In the particular factual context of the instant case, we do not believe that [the state trooper] would have been unreasonable either in placing his head inside the interior of the van through an open window or in opening the driver\u2019s door and placing his torso inside, even assuming he did not smell marijuana before the intrusion. <em>Our conclusion is based on the reason behind [state trooper\u2019s] actions. After pulling over a van in the wee hours of the morning on a relatively deserted Texas highway, Washington was immediately approached by the driver, who smelled of alcohol and admitted that he had no driver\u2019s license. Even though Ryles was not intoxicated, he still could not lawfully drive the van. </em>At ... Ryles\u2019 own suggestion, [the state trooper] approached the van to inquire whether anyone else in the van was licensed and could drive the vehicle away. <em>Although he did not say so at the suppression hearing, we believe that [the state trooper] would have considered it necessary to determine whether the passenger who would ultimately be driving the van was impaired by alcohol-since, after all, Ryles had alcohol on his breath. Even assuming that he walked up to the driver\u2019s door and opened it without knocking, [the state trooper] would only have been attempt</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>ing to assure that the van would be driven safely. We can hardly say that this would have been unreasonable.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 15 (emphasis added and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Both <em>Hendricks </em>and <em>Ryles </em>support our conclusion that Deputy Atkins\u2019 search was unreasonable if he did not detect the odor of marijuana or observe suspicious behavior prior to inserting his head into the vehicle\u2019s passenger window. Similar to <em>Hendricks, </em>but distinguishable from <em>Ryles, </em>the record does not reflect the existence of any suspicious activity beyond the speeding violation. The record does not reflect the existence of exigent circumstances, where Deputy Atkins feared for his safety or the safety of others, suspected flight, destruction of evidence, or similar circumstances. Petitioner did not delay in stopping his vehicle or attempted to maneuver a detour. <em>Cf. Winters, </em>221 F.3d at 1040; <em>Larson, </em>946 P.2d at 1213. He did not engage in furtive movement giving rise to reasonable suspicion. <em>Cf. Pierre, </em>958 F.2d at 1310; <em>Larson, </em>946 P.2d at 1213. He did not abscond after the stop, have fleeing passengers, or demonstrate any other suspicious behavior. <em>Cf. United States v. Martinez-Miramontes, </em>494 F.2d 808, 809-10 (9th Cir.1974); <em>Winters, </em>221 F.3d at 1040; <em>Aubin, </em>622 A.2d at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">In contrast, the record before us only reveals that Petitioner was stopped for a routine traffic violation. Therefore, in the absence of a factual finding that Deputy Atkins detected the odor before his head crossed the passenger window, Deputy Atkins did not have probable cause or reasonable articulable suspicion that Petitioner was in possession of a controlled dangerous substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">We also observe that other exceptions to the warrant requirement are inapplicable under the circumstances presented. The automobile exception permits an officer to conduct a warrantless search of a vehicle, that exception is triggered after an officer establishes probable cause to believe that a vehicle contains contraband or evidence of criminal activity. <em>Carroll, </em>267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, <em>supra. </em>Likewise, \u201codor is a valid consideration\u201d in establishing probable cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>and may constitute an exception to the warrant requirement under the plain view doctrine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Bailey v. State, </em>412 Md. 349, 376, 987 A.2d 72, 88 (2010). In the case at bar, the absence of a factual finding that Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana before inserting his head into the vehicle negates each of these exceptions because 1) an officer must establish probable cause prior to commencing a search, and 2) the plain view doctrine requires that an officer be lawfully within the area where he or she detects the odor of contraband. <em>See Wengert v. State, </em>364 Md. 76, 88, 771 A.2d 389, 396 (2001) (invoking the plain view doctrine first requires that the police officer\u2019s initial intrusion was lawful or the officer was otherwise lawfully \u201cin a position from which he or she can view a particular area ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">B. Where the evidence regarding Deputy Atkins\u2019 detection of marijuana was \u201cnot clear\u201d, the exclusionary rule must apply</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In denying Petitioner\u2019s suppression motion, the circuit court made the following observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">The testimony of Deputy Atkins was that he didn\u2019t recall whether his head went in the vehicle or not. It was very possible [Deputy Atkins\u2019] head would have broken the [pane] and it was at some point, it was not clear whether it was when his head was inside or when the window was rolled down, he-smelled what he believed based on his training and experience smelled like marijuana. But he also testified that it dissipated rather quickly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The warrantless search in the case at bar was only lawful if Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana <em>before </em>inserting his head into the vehicle, and the aforementioned statements accurately reflect the ambiguity of the evidence on this subject. This ambiguity was paramount at the suppression hearing because, where evidence of a lawful warrantless search is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u201cinconclusive[,]\u201d the defendant must prevail.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Epps v. State, </em>193 Md.App. 687, 704, 1 A.3d 488, 498 (2010) (citation omitted). Therefore, where the evidence of Deputy Atkins\u2019 detection of marijuana odor was \u201cnot clear[,]\u201d the State failed to meet its burden of showing that Deputy Atkins\u2019 warrantless search was lawful. <em>See Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 455, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2032, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971); <em>Southern, </em>371 Md. at 105, 807 A.2d at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Since the State did not satisfy its burden that Deputy Atkins discovered the 1.6 grams of marijuana by virtue of a lawful search, the seizure was subject to the exclusionary rule. <em>Cf. Wengert, </em>364 Md. at 96, 771 A.2d at 401 (\u201cBecause we hold that the initial search was lawful, there was no fruit of any poisonous tree. All of the items were lawfully seized.\u201d). The exclusionary rule provides that \u201cevidence seized during an unlawful search could not constitute proof against the victim of the search.\u201d <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 484, 83 S.Ct. 407, 416, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963); <em>Kelly v. State, </em>436 Md. 406, 421, 82 A.3d 205, 213 (2013) (\u201cThe remedy for an unlawful search is the suppression of evidence obtained as a result of that search.... This remedy is known as the \u2018exclusionary rule.\u2019 \u201d). The exclusionary prohibition is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>not only limited to direct evidence, but also extends to indirect products of unlawful invasions. <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 484, 83 S.Ct. at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Therefore, the circuit court erred in denying Petitioner\u2019s suppression motion because without satisfying its burden of proof, the State did not establish that the evidence was admissible against Petitioner. <em>See Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1691, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961) (\u201cWe hold that all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inadmissible in a state court.\u201d); <em>King v. State, </em>434 Md. 472, 490, 76 A.3d 1035, 1046 (2013) (\u201c[T]he application of [the exclusionary rule] [prohibiting the use of illegally obtained evidence] is appropriate when the Constitution or a statute requires it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">II. The Court of Special Appeals did not apply the appropriate standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The Court of Special Appeals relied upon the supplemental rule of interpretation to draw the inference that Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana before his head crossed the window\u2019s threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Petitioner asserts that the Court of Special Appeals \u201capplied an incorrect standard of review to the [circuit court\u2019s] factual findings and legal conclusions by affirming the denial of Petitioner\u2019s suppression motion[.]\u201d Specifically, Petitioner argues that the intermediate appellate court affirmed the denial of his suppression motion based upon \u201can inference\u201d that Deputy Atkins detected the smell of marijuana before inserting his head into the passenger window, which was \u201cinconsistent with the [circuit] court\u2019s factual finding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Conversely, the State asserts that the supplemental rule of interpretation controls and resolves the ambiguous or incomplete fact-finding. Thus, in applying the rule to the case at bar, and when construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, the State asserts that \u201cthe record supports a reasonable inference\u201d that Deputy Atkins detected the odor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>marijuana \u201cbefore his head entered the window [of Petitioner\u2019s vehicle].\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">To guide our analysis, we reiterate the applicable standard of review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">When we review a [circuit] court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to suppress evidence alleged to have been seized in contravention of the Fourth Amendment, we view the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing, and the inferences fairly [deduced] therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed on the motion. We defer to the [circuit] court\u2019s fact-finding at the suppression hearing, unless the [circuit] court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. Nevertheless, we review the ultimate question of constitutionality <em>[de novo] </em>and must \u2018make our own independent constitutional appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-7\"><em>Corbin, </em>428 Md. at 497-98, 52 A.3d at 951 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Contrary to these well-established principles, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the denial of Petitioner\u2019s suppression motion by applying the supplemental rule of interpretation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The intermediate appellate court indicated that \u201cthe [circuit] court\u2019s statement reflected the ambiguous nature of the evidence[,]\u201d and, as a result, the court interpreted the alleged ambiguity \u201cto mean that Deputy Atkins detected the tell-tale odor of marijuana before he placed his head in the vehicle\u2019s window.\u201d In reliance on this inference, the court construed the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, and held that \u201cthere was no warrantless search of [Petitioner\u2019s] vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>However, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 inference that Deputy Atkins detected the odor of marijuana prior to inserting his head into the passenger window of Petitioner\u2019s vehicle, was inconsistent -with the evidence of record, specifically, Deputy Atkins\u2019 testimony and the circuit court\u2019s \u201cnot clear\u201d statement. Deputy Atkins testified that he could not recall the exact moment he detected the odor of marijuana upon his initial contact.
