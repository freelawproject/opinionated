Spangler, </em>which we previously discussed in <em>McQuitty v. Spangler, </em>410 Md. 1, 976 A.2d 1020 (2009) <em>(\"McQuitty </em>I\u201d), and <em>McQuitty v. Spangler, </em>424 Md. 527, 36 A.3d 928 (2012) <em>(\u201cMcQuitty II </em>\u2019\u2019).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, we explore whether the definition of \u201cwrongful act\u201d under the Maryland wrongful death statute, Md. Code (2006, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-901 through 3-904 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.\u201d); specifically, \u00a7 3-901(e), precludes beneficiaries from maintaining a wrongful death action when the decedent obtained a personal injury judgment predicated on the same underlying facts during his lifetime. We also focus on whether a decedent\u2019s release of one joint tort-feasor in a personal injury action for any and all future claims in connection with the tortious conduct, also precludes the decedent\u2019s beneficia-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>r\u00edes from pursuing a wrongful death action against all joint tort-feasors based on the same underlying facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">For the reasons expressed below, we hold that Maryland\u2019s wrongful death statute creates a new and independent cause of action for a decedent\u2019s beneficiaries, and thus, a judgment on the merits in a decedent\u2019s personal injury action during his or her lifetime does not bar a subsequent wrongful death action by the beneficiaries. Additionally, we hold that pursuant to the Maryland Uniform Contribution Among Tort-Feasors Act, Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-1404, a release by the injured person of one joint tort-feasor, whether before or after judgment, does not discharge the other tort-feasors unless the release so provides. Thus, where the language of a release unambiguously reveals an intent to release only one joint tort-feasor, the release does not preclude a subsequent wrongful death action against other tort-feasors that were not parties to the release. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AEu\">Prior Proceedings<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Respondents, Peggy and Gary McQuitty (\u201cthe McQuittys\u201d), on behalf of their minor child, Dylan, successfully sued Ms. McQuitty\u2019s obstetrician and primary care physician, Donald Spangler (\u201cDr. Spangler\u201d), along with his practice group, Glowacki, Elberfeld &amp; Spangler, P.A. (collectively \u201cPetitioners\u201d), for failing to secure Ms. McQuitty\u2019s informed consent<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for treatment. As a result, Ms. McQuitty suffered complete placental abruption, causing severe injuries to Dylan during his birth in May of 1995, and eventually, a severe condition of cerebral palsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The original complaint also included co-defendants, Franklin Square Hospital, where Dylan was born, and Dr. Spangler\u2019s partner, Harrold Elberfeld (\u201cDr. Elberfeld\u201d). Dr. Elberfeld and Franklin Square Hospital moved for summary judgment on liability and damages, which was subsequently granted by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County in March of 2004 \u2014 on the same date Dr. Elberfeld settled with the McQuittys. Franklin Square Hospital also settled with the McQuittys prior to trial, notwithstanding the summary judgment ruling in its favor. The settlements were entered on the record and the case proceeded on the informed consent claim against Petitioners as sole defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Prior to trial, Petitioners moved for summary judgment. Dr. Spangler alleged that he did not have a duty to obtain the informed consent of Ms. McQuitty regarding a placental abruption, \u201cbecause he did not conduct or propose an \u2018affirmative invasion of her physical integrity.\u2019 \u201d <em>McQuitty II, </em>424 Md. at 532, 36 A.3d at 931 (quoting <em>McQuitty I, </em>410 Md. at 13-14, 976 A.2d at 1027-28). The motion was denied, and the trial ensued. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Dylan and awarded $13,078,515 in damages, including $8,442,515 in future medical expenses. Petitioners filed a Motion for Remittitur and a Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d), raising the same argument in support of their motion for summary judgment. The circuit court granted Petitioners\u2019 motion for JNOV, which was affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals in an unpublished opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">In <em>McQuitty I, </em>410 Md. at 33, 976 A.2d at 1039, this Court reversed the grant of the JNOV, and remanded with instructions that the circuit court consider Petitioners\u2019 unresolved Motion for Remittitur. On September 26, 2009, prior to the resolution of the remittitur, Dylan died and the McQuittys were named as personal representatives of the Estate. Thereafter, Petitioners filed various post-trial motions, seeking a new trial or a reduction in the award for future medical expenses, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Dylan\u2019s death was a \u201csignificant event\u201d that affected the equities of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The circuit court denied Petitioners\u2019 motion to revise the judgment, but denied in part and granted in part Petitioners\u2019 Motion for Remittitur. As a result, the court reduced the initial jury award, pursuant to the statutory cap on non-economic damages of $500,000 under Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 11\u2014 108(b)(2)(i), and also reduced the judgment by fifty percent to reflect Dr. Elberfeld\u2019s <em>pro rata </em>share of liability, as a result of the joint tort-feasor release from the McQuittys, in compliance with the Uniform Contribution Among Tort-Feasors Act, under Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-1404.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The circuit court also denied Petitioners\u2019 requests to permit the periodic payment of future economic damages under Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 11 \u2014 109(c), which would have reduced the jury\u2019s award by the Franklin Square Hospital\u2019s settlement amount. The court ultimately reduced the judgment to $5,039,257.50, plus post-judgment interest calculated from the date of the entry of judgment, on September 27, 2006, plus costs. Petitioners subsequently filed a renewed motion for a new trial and a motion to alter, amend, or revise the judgment, which were both denied. Thereafter, Petitioners noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, but this Court granted <em>certiorari, </em>prior to that proceeding. In <em>McQuitty II, </em>424 Md. at 529-30, 36 A.3d at 929-30, we affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment. Subsequently, on March 23, 2012, Petitioners satisfied the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Respondents\u2019 Wrongful Death Action</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">On May 17, 2012, Respondents filed a wrongful death action against Petitioners, under the Maryland wrongful death statute, Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-901 <em>et seq., </em>to recover damages based upon the same underlying facts in the personal injury action regarding Dr. Spangler\u2019s failure to obtain informed consent. On August 1, 2012, Petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss Respondents\u2019 action. Following a December 6, 2012 hearing, the motion was granted. The circuit court concluded that Respondents\u2019 wrongful death action was precluded by the judgment in Dylan\u2019s favor \u201cbecause Dylan no longer had a right to bring another claim against [] [Petitioners] at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>time of his death.\u201d Subsequently, on January 4, 2013, Respondents appealed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">While the matter was pending before the Court of Special Appeals, this Court issued its opinion in <em>Mummert v. Alizadeh, </em>435 Md. 207, 77 A.3d 1049 (2013), which concerned similar issues to those presented here regarding the definition of \u201cwrongful act\u201d under Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-901(e). In <em>Mummert, </em>the decedent\u2019s husband and three children brought a wrongful death action against the decedent\u2019s physician, based on a failure to timely diagnose the decedent\u2019s colorectal cancer. <em>Id. </em>at 210-11, 77 A.3d at 1051. The physician filed a motion to dismiss the wrongful death action because the statutory three-year period in the wrongful death statute had expired relative to the decedent\u2019s personal injury action prior to her death. <em>Id. </em>The motion was subsequently granted. <em>Id. </em>at 211, 77 A.3d at 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Accordingly, the narrow question before this Court in <em>Mummert </em>was whether the decedent\u2019s failure to file a personal injury claim in her lifetime within the limitations period, precluded her wrongful death beneficiaries from filing a wrongful death action based upon the same negligent act after her death. <em>Id. </em>at 212, 77 A.3d at 1051-52. In reversing the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of the action, we held that, in enacting the wrongful death statute, the General Assembly \u201cdid not intend to define \u2018wrongful act\u2019 so as to render a wrongful death claim contingent on the decedent\u2019s ability to file timely a tort claim prior to death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210, 77 A.3d at 1051. We also held that the \u201cstatute of limitations for bringing tort claims against health care providers in instances of alleged medical negligence does not apply to a claim for wrongful death.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In so holding, we reaffirmed the independent nature of wrongful death actions established in <em>Stewart v. United Elec. Light &amp; Power Co., </em>104 Md. 332, 65 A. 49, 53 (1906), which provided that a wrongful death action was enacted to allow surviving relatives and beneficiaries \u201cwho [were] wholly dependent on the decedent, to recover damages for his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>own loss accruing from the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Mummert, </em>at 219-20, 77 A.3d at 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">We also observed that a wrongful death action, was, in some respects, derivative of a decedent\u2019s personal injury claim, and thus, where certain defenses would bar a decedent\u2019s claim, they would similarly bar a wrongful death action brought by the decedent\u2019s surviving relatives. <em>Id. </em>at 222, 77 A.3d at 1057. We noted that the defenses which generally bar subsequent actions, such as contributory negligence, assumption of the risk, parental immunity, and lack of privity of contract, were distinguishable from the statute of limitations at issue, because where the former defenses applied, \u201cthe decedent did not have a viable claim from the <em>outset.\u201d Id. </em>221, 77 A.3d at 1057 (emphasis added). We opined that the limitations defense barred an otherwise viable claim of the decedent, only due to a lapse of time, which made barring a wrongful death action under those grounds illogical since the action would be \u201ctime-barred before it can accrue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226-28, 77 A.3d at 1060-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We also distinguished cases in which a wrongful death action was barred by a decedent\u2019s release of his negligence action. Citing with approval the holding in <em>State, ex rel. Melitch v. United Rys. &amp; Electric Co. of Baltimore, </em>121 Md. 457, 88 A. 229 (1913), we held that a release is distinguishable because \u201ca decedent who executes a release has acted affirmatively and purposefully to extinguish the underlying claim.\u201d <em>Mummert, </em>at 221-22, 77 A.3d at 1057. We reasoned that in a statute of limitations defense, \u201cthere may be no evidence necessarily that the decedent intended to allow the statute of limitations to run[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Petitioners, thereafter, relied on <em>Mummert </em>in their brief to the Court of Special Appeals, asserting that the narrow holding regarding the limitations defense, did not preclude their <em>res judicata </em>defense that Dylan\u2019s pursuit of a judgment during his lifetime extinguished Respondents\u2019 wrongful death action under the express provisions in the wrongful death statute. On November 21, 2013, the Court of Special Appeals directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the parties to file memoranda addressing the application of <em>Mummert. </em>In those filings, both parties disputed whether <em>Mummert </em>was dispositive of the matter before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Court of Special Appeals Opinion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">In the unreported opinion filed on August 7, 2015, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s judgment granting Petitioners\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Respondents\u2019 wrongful death action; remanded the case for further proceedings; and held that that Respondents\u2019 wrongful death action was not barred by a judgment in Dylan\u2019s personal injury action. <em>McQuitty v. Spangler, </em>No. 2375 Sept. Term 2012, 2015 WL 5822059 (Md.Ct.Spec.App. Aug. 7, 2015). The Court concluded that both parties overstated the impact of its holding on the circumstances presented. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">First, <em>Mummert </em>does not mandate a holding in favor of [Respondents]. The <em>Mummert </em>Court held that not <em>all </em>defenses to a decedent\u2019s personal injury claim would bar a subsequent wrongful death action, but did not hold that <em>every </em>such defense lost its preclusive effect. The only defense vis-a-vis the decedent\u2019s claim that <em>Mummert </em>expressly removed from the arsenal of the wrongful death defendant is the expiration of the limitations period in the decedent\u2019s personal injury claim. The Court restricted its holding to the facts before it, and made no specific comment on which other defenses, if any, may no longer preclude subsequent wrongful death actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">The fact that some defenses vis-a-vis a decedent\u2019s claim maintain their preclusive effect after <em>Mummert, </em>however, does not compel a holding for [Petitioners]. Instead, <em>Mum-mert </em>raises the following question relevant to the matter <em>sub judice: </em>Is a judgment in favor of the decedent in his personal injury action similar to the defenses that <em>Mum-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>mert </em>upheld, namely, defenses barring such personal injury action from the outset? In answering that question, we are unpersuaded by [Petitioners] analogy of a pre-existing judgment in favor of Dylan to the defenses upheld in <em>Mummert, </em>and conclude instead that the rationale expressed by the Court of Appeals in that case supports a holding in favor of [Respondents].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-5\"><em>McQuitty, </em>2015 WL 5822059, at *7 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">On that premise, the Court also concluded that a successful judgment in favor of a decedent in a personal injury action was distinguishable from the defenses recognized in <em>Mum-mert, </em>as barring a subsequent wrongful death action. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">A judgment in Dylan\u2019s favor on his personal injury claim is not a bar to that claim \u2014 it is the ultimate validation of the claim. The preclusive effect of such judgment flows from the principles of <em>res judicata. </em>Here, <em>res judicata </em>does not bar [Respondents\u2019] wrongful death action, because <em>res judi-cata </em>only applies to actions between the same plaintiffs and defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-8\"><em>Id. </em>at *7-8. As a result, the Court rejected Petitioners\u2019 argument that Dylan\u2019s \u201caffirmative and purposeful conduct\u201d in pursuing a judgment against them barred Respondents\u2019 wrongful death action, and reasoned that Dylan\u2019s pursuit of his claim was not a release or settlement. <em>See id. </em>The Court also disagreed with Petitioners contention that permitting the wrongful death action would result in double recovery. <em>See id. </em>at *8. The Court opined that the potential for overlapping damages should not \u201cabsolutely bar\u201d subsequent wrongful death actions, because any overlap could be resolved on a case-by-case, damages-by-damages basis in the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>at *9. The Court, nonetheless, concluded that the risks associated with a double recovery did not exist in the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">Although Dylan recovered damages for the loss of future earnings, [Respondents] cannot recover damages for those earnings in a wrongful death action, because \u2018[p]arents may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>recover a pecuniary value for the loss of an employed deceased minor child\u2019s future earnings, at least to the date the deceased would have become an adult, had he/she lived.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6\"><em>Id. </em>at *10 (citations omitted). In support of this conclusion, the Court observed that Dylan was not employed at the time of his death, and that the only other damages recoverable by Respondents in their wrongful death action were solatium damages,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which were personal to them and not recoverable by Dylan. <em>See id. </em>We, thereafter, granted <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">When this Court reviews a circuit court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, we \u201cmust assume the truth of, and view in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, all well-pleaded facts and allegations contained in the complaint, as well as all inferences that may reasonably be drawn [therefrom.]\u201d <em>McHale v. DCW Dutchship Island, LLC, </em>415 Md. 145, 155, 999 A.2d 969, 975 (2010) (quoting <em>RRC Northeast, LLC v. BAA Md., Inc., </em>413 Md. 638, 643, 994 A.2d 430, 433 (2010)). We analyze the circuit court\u2019s decision to determine whether it was legally correct, and \u201corder dismissal only if the allegations and permissible inferences, if true, would not afford relief to the plaintiff, <em>i.e., </em>the allegations do not state a cause of action for which relief may be granted.\u201d <em>McHale, </em>415 Md. at 155, 999 A.2d at 975 (quoting <em>RRC Northeast, </em>413 Md. at 643, 994 A.2d at 433).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">I. Relevant provisions of Maryland\u2019s current wrongful death statute</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Maryland\u2019s -wrongful death statute allows the maintenance of an action \u201cagainst a person whose wrongful act causes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>death of another.\u201d Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-902(a). \u201cWrongful act\u201d is defined as \u201can act, neglect, or default including a felonious act which would have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages if death had not ensued.\u201d Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-901(e). The primary beneficiaries of a wrongful death action are the spouse, parent, and child of the decedent. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(a)(l). However, relatives by blood or marriage who substantially relied upon the decedent, are also eligible claimants. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(b). Where the decedent is a spouse, minor child, parent of a minor child, or an unmarried child that is not a minor, the wrongful death statute provides damages for \u201cpecuniary losses,\u201d if any, in addition to damages for \u201cmental anguish, emotional pain and suffering, loss of society, companionship, comfort, protection, marital care, parental care, filial care, attention, advice, counsel, training, guidance, or education where applicable.... \u201d Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(c)-(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">II. Maryland\u2019s wrongful death statute creates a new and independent cause of action for a decedent\u2019s beneficiaries</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The determinative issue in the case at bar is whether, under the definition of \u201cwrongful act\u201d in Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-901(e), a wrongful death action is derivative, or independent of, a decedent\u2019s prior personal injury claim, where the decedent obtained a judgment based on the same underlying facts. Thus, a resolution requires this Court to revisit the interpretation of the language contained in Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-901(e), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">Wrongful act\u2019 means an act, neglect, or default including a felonious act which would have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages if death had not ensued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Petitioners argue that Respondents\u2019 wrongful death action is derivative of Dylan\u2019s personal injury action and therefore, barred by <em>res judicata, </em>since Dylan would not be entitled to a double recovery if death had not ensued. Conversely, Respondents allege that their wrongful death action is a new and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>independent cause of action, only subject to the condition that Dylan possessed a viable claim at the outset, and therefore, not subject to a <em>res judicata </em>defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We hold that the Maryland wrongful death statute provides a new and independent cause of action, which does not preclude a subsequent action brought by a decedent\u2019s beneficiaries, although the decedent obtained a personal injury judgment based essentially on the same underlying facts during his or her lifetime. The parties\u2019 arguments focus primarily on the definition of \u201cwrongful act,\u201d specifically the phrase, \u201cif death had not ensued.\u201d To discern the meaning of this phrase, we apply the long-standing canons of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u201c \u2018The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the [General Assembly].\u2019 \u201d <em>Rosemann v. Salsbury, Clements, Bekman, Marder &amp; Adkins, LLC, </em>412 Md. 308, 314, 987 A.2d 48, 52 (2010) (citation omitted). \u201c \u2018Statutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314-15, 987 A.2d at 52 (citations omitted). We, therefore, \u201c \u2018[n]either add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain language of the statute; nor [do we] construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315, 987 A.2d at 52 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Moreover, this Court \u201creads the statute as a whole to ensure that none of its provisions are rendered meaningless[,] and [ ] will not construe a statute to reach a result \u2018that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201cIf the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need look no further than the language of the statute to ascertain the [General Assembly\u2019s] intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). However, \u201c[w]hen the language of the statute is subject to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous and we usually look beyond the statutory language to the statute\u2019s legislative history, prior case law, the statutory purpose, and the statutory structure as aids in ascertaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>[General Assembly\u2019s] intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Under these circumstances, \u201cwe also consider the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315, 987 A.2d at 52-53 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">We also note an additional consideration that is relevant to the issues presented \u2014 that \u201c[statutes in derogation of the common law are strictly construed, and it is not to be presumed that the [General Assembly] by creating statutory assaults intended to make any alteration in the common law other than what has been specified and plainly pronounced.\u201d <em>Cosby v.

Proc. \u00a7 3-901(e) of the Maryland wrongful death statute</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Without extensive discussion, we acknowledge here, as in <em>Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 218, 77 A.3d at 1055, that when read within the context of the statutory scheme, the language of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-901(e) is ambiguous because a plain reading of the statute could lead to more than one interpretation. <em>See, e.g., Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 218, 77 A.3d at 1055 (noting that the parties\u2019 \u201cdueling interpretations\u201d regarding the plain meaning of \u00a7 3-901(e), \u201cserve quintessential^ to highlight the ambiguity in the statute\u2019s language[ ]\u201d) (citing <em>Reier v. State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>397 Md. 2, 26-27, 915 A.2d 970, 985 (2007)) (\u201cIt strikes us that the competing parties\u2019 argument present \u2018two ... reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute,\u2019 making the statute ambiguous.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">This ambiguity is reflected in the parties\u2019 arguments. Petitioner contends that the definition of a wrongful act, specifically as it pertains to the phrase \u201cif death had not ensuedf,]\u201d leads to a conclusion that \u201ca settlement and/or judgment in a personal injury matter in one\u2019s lifetime\u201d bars subsequent pursuit of a wrongful death claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Respondents disagree, <em>see supra, </em>and on related grounds, aver that \u201c[bjecause Dylan had a viable claim from the outset,\u201d Petitioners\u2019 interpretation of the statute \u201cwould lead to illogical and absurd results.\u201d Specifically, Respondents assert that \u201cif Dylan had died before the entry of judgment in his favor on September 29, 2006,\u201d their wrongful death action \u201ccould have proceeded without the bar of <em>res judicata.\u201d </em>In Respondents\u2019 view, an argument that \u201cDylan lived to see his personal injury claims vindicated by a jury forfeited [their] right to recover their own separate and distinct damages arising from his death[,j leads to an outcome that is \u201centirely inconsistent with the purpose of the [wjrongful [djeath statute.\u201d We, therefore, look beyond the statutory language of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-901(e) to other sources in ascertaining legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">i. Legislative History</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In 1852, Maryland enacted the wrongful death statute to remedy the common law\u2019s unaccommodating treatment of a tort victim\u2019s family. <em>See Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 214-15, 77 A.3d at 1053; <em>Walker v. Essex, </em>318 Md. 516, 569 A.2d 645, 648 (1990). Previously, common law denied tort recovery for injury once the tort victim had died and any new and independent cause of action by the victim\u2019s beneficiaries were not recognized. <em>Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 214-15, 77 A.3d at 1053; W. Page Keaton, <em>Prosser and Keaton on Torts, </em>\u00a7 127, at 945 (5th ed. 1984). The Maryland statute adopted language strongly resembling England\u2019s Fatal Accidents Act, otherwise known as the Lord Campbell\u2019s Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>[Wjhensoever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default, and the act, neglect or default is such as would (if death had not ensued,) have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, then and in every such case the person who would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">1852 Md. Laws ch. 299; <em>see also </em>Richard J. Gilbert <em>&amp; </em>Paul T. Gilbert, <em>Maryland Tort Law Handbook, </em>\u00a7 13.0 at 160 (3rd ed. 2000) (\u201cMaryland followed the English lead with 1852 Maryland Laws, ch. 299, a virtual copy of the English Act.\u201d). Further iterations of the statute remained virtually unchanged for nearly a century.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 215, n. 4, 77 A.3d at 1054, n. 4. In the 1970 Replacement Volume, <em>see </em>Md. Code (1957, 1970 Repl. Vol.), Article 67 \u00a7 1, language was added to the statute to address wrongful deaths caused by vessels, and cases where the tort-feasor was deceased. However, the language relevant to the case at bar remained unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In 1973, the General Assembly moved the statute from Article 67 to Title 3, Subtitle 9 of the Court and Judicial Proceedings Article. The 1973 iteration provided, in relevant part, that, \u201c[a]n action may be maintained against a person whose wrongful act causes the death of another,\u201d defining the phrase \u201cwrongful act\u201d as \u201can act, neglect, or default ... which would have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages if death had not ensued.\u201d <em>See </em>Cts. &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Jud. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 3-901(e) and 3-902(a). Other revisions were for organizational and stylistic purposes, which did not alter the meaning of the statute. <em>See Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 216, 77 A.3d at 1054 (citing 1973 Md. Laws Spec. Session. 169, Revisor\u2019s Note; Williams H. Adkins, II, <em>Code Revision in Maryland: The Court and Judicial Proceedings Article, </em>34 Md. L. Rev. 7, 30 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">The most substantive revisions to the 1852 iteration of the statute involved enlarging the statutory limitations provisions from the original twelve months, to eighteen months, then to two years; and finally to the current three-year statutory period. <em>See </em>Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(g)(1); <em>Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 216, 77 A.3d at 1054 (citing <em>Waddell v. Kirkpatrick, </em>331 Md. 52, 55-56 &amp; n. 4, 626 A.2d 353, 354-55 &amp; n. 4 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">As the foregoing reflects, there was no indication that subsequent revisions to the statute were intended to alter the meaning of the phrase \u201cif death had not ensued.\u201d Additionally, we acknowledge that apart from this background, there is no legislative history indicating whether the phrase precludes beneficiaries from maintaining a wrongful death action when the decedent obtained a personal injury judgment based on the same, or similar, underlying facts during his or her lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">ii. General Statutory Purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The wrongful death statute allows the decedent\u2019s beneficiaries or relatives to recover damages for loss of support or other benefits that would have been provided, had the decedent not died as a result of another\u2019s negligence. <em>See </em>1852 Md. Laws ch. 299; Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(a)(1)-(b). <em>See also Eagan v. Calhoun, </em>347 Md. 72, 82, 698 A.2d 1097, 1102 (1997) (a wrongful death action allows \u201ca spouse, parent, or child, or a secondary beneficiary who was wholly dependent on the decedent, to recover damages for his or her own loss accruing from the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. Streidel, </em>329 Md. 533, 620 A.2d 905 (1993)); <em>Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 219, 77 A.3d at 1056 (\u201cThe purpose of the act was to compensate the families of the decedents, as opposed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>estates of the decedents[.]\u201d); <em>Georgia-Pac. Corp. v. Benjamin, </em>394 Md. 59, 79, 904 A.2d 511, 523 (2006) (\u201cA wrongful death action is designed to compensate the family of a decedent who died due to the \u2018wrongful act, neglect, or default on another person.\u2019 \u201d) (footnotes and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Thus, Maryland has historically adhered to the minority view<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that the wrongful death statute created a new and independent cause of action, distinguishable from a decedent\u2019s own personal injury action during his or her lifetime, or a survival action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Stewart v. United Elec. Light &amp; Power Co., </em>104 Md. 332, 65 A. 49, 53 (1906), this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Art\">It is the settled law of Maryland that the act of 1852 created a new cause of action. In <em>[Tucker v. State, Use of Johnson], </em>89 Md. 479, 43 Atl. 778, 44 Atl. 1004, 46 L.R.A. 181, this [Cjourt, in speaking of that statute, said: \u2018By it the jury may give such damages as they may think proportioned to the injury resulting from such death, and not such as the injured person could have recovered if he has survived. The injury for which the equitable plaintiffs are compensated is the pecuniary loss sustained by reason of the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>the person through the wrongful act, neglect, or default of the defendant. The statute, therefore, properly speaking, was not passed, as is sometimes said of it, to remove the operation of the common-law maxim, \u2018Actio personalis mori-tur cum persona,\u2019 as it has not undertaken to keep alive an action which would otherwise die with the person, but, on the contrary, has created a new cause of action for something for which the deceased person never had, and never could have had, the right to sue; that is to say, the injury resulting from his death.\u2019 This view is sustained by the great weight of the English cases which arose under Lord Campbell\u2019s act; and that act from which ours was copied preceded the adoption of ours but six years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">While Petitioners acknowledge that a wrongful death claim is an independent cause of action, they nonetheless, aver that the claim is simultaneously \u201cconditioned upon the decedent\u2019s ability to maintain a claim,\u201d had death not ensued. Petitioners emphasize this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Stewart, supra </em>and <em>Melitch, </em>121 Md. 457, 88 A. 229, as support for the dismissal of Respondents\u2019 wrongful death action. However, Petitioners\u2019 reliance on these cases is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In <em>Stewart, </em>this Court addressed whether a decedent\u2019s survival action resulting from the defendants\u2019 negligence survived after the decedent\u2019s death. 104 Md. 332, 65 A. at 50. Petitioners aver that while this Court recognized in <em>Stewart </em>that wrongful death actions and survival actions were independent and could be maintained simultaneously upon the death of the decedent, which excluded settlements obtained by the decedent during his lifetime, <em>see </em>104 Md. 332, 65 A. at 54; this Court\u2019s statement that a wrongful death action was permissible only \u201cunder certain conditions,\u201d <em>see </em>104 Md. 332, 65 A. at 50, includes compliance with the definition of \u201cwrongful act.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Petitioners overstate this Court\u2019s observation that a wrongful death action was permissible only \u201cunder certain conditions[ ]\u201d to mean compliance with the phrase \u201cif death had not ensued.\u201d In its full context, this Court stated that the wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ful death statute provided a right of action \u201cunder certain conditions to designated relatives of a deceased person, but not to his personal representatives, when death has been caused by a wrongful act or by negligence.\u201d 104 Md. 332, 65 A. at 50. In our view, this conclusion was limited to an acknowledgment that the wrongful death statute confers a right of action to a decedent\u2019s beneficiaries, not a decedent\u2019s personal representatives, as contemplated in a survival action.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Similarly, in <em>Melitch, </em>the issue before the Court was whether the decedent\u2019s release of liability in a personal injury action during his lifetime, constituted a bar to recovery in a subsequent wrongful death action brought by his wife. 121 Md. 457, 88 A. 229. This Court ultimately held that the release barred future recovery. <em>Id. </em>(holding that Melitch \u201cby deed, for a valuable consideration, released the defendant from all and every claim and demand which he might or could possibly have for or on account of his injuries.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">After examining several cases from other jurisdictions that construed the meaning of similar wrongful death statutes, 121 Md. 457, 88 A. at 229-30, this Court interpreted the Maryland statute to mean \u201cthat liability of the wrongdoer exists where the deceased could have recovered if death had not ensued[ ]\u201d which \u201cclearly exclude[d] the idea that where the decedent receives satisfaction for his injuries, the condition requisite to the right of surviving relatives may exist notwithstanding.\u201d 121 Md. 457, 88 A. at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Although acknowledging a wrongful death action as an independent claim, this Court considered a decedent\u2019s release, settlement, <em>or </em>prior judgment in a personal injury action, within the scope of statutory language, and barred a subsequent wrongful death action. 121 Md. 457, 88 A. 229, 230-31. <em>See also </em>121 Md. 457, 88 A. at 231 (acknowledging the \u201csettled rule of law of Maryland to be that the Act of 1852 created a <em>new </em>cause of action,\u201d but also \u201cthat the right of the relatives named in the statute to recover \u2018is contingent upon the death of the injured person without having his claim for damages satisfied.\u2019 \u201d). However, we observe that the <em>Melitch </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>holding, as it pertains to the effect of a prior judgment in a decedent\u2019s personal injury action, is contrary to longstanding Maryland law that a subsequent wrongful death action brought by a decedent\u2019s beneficiaries is not barred by the disposition of a decedent\u2019s personal injury claim. See <em>Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 219-20, 77 A.3d at 1056; Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 46 cmt. b; <em>Stewart, </em>104 Md. 332, 65 A. 49, 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Moreover, because the existence of a prior personal judgment was not dispositive of the issue before the Court in <em>Melitch, </em>Petitioners essentially rely upon dicta,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to support their argument that a final judgment in a decedent\u2019s personal injury claim defeats a subsequent wrongful death action. Accordingly, while we do not overrule <em>Melitch, </em>we acknowledge that the Court\u2019s opinion in that regard is distinguishable from circumstances before us, and does not sustain Petitioners\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">We are similarly not persuaded by Petitioners\u2019 argument that Dylan\u2019s \u201c[ajffirmative and [pjurposeful [cjonduct\u201d in pursuing a personal injury action during his lifetime, bars Respondents\u2019 wrongful death claim. Specifically, Petitioners allege that \u201cDylan\u2019s affirmative and purposeful conduct in successfully [pursuing] a $13 million dollar verdict operates to extinguish Respondents\u2019 wrongful death claims now.\u201d In reliance on the out-of-state cases cited by this Court in <em>Mel-itch, </em>Petitioners ask that we analogize a decedent\u2019s prior release or settlement of a personal injury action, with a decedent\u2019s judgment obtained after a full adjudication of the merits. We decline to adopt Petitioners\u2019 reasoning, since it is contrary to this Court\u2019s view that the wrongful death statute creates a new and independent cause of action for a decedent\u2019s beneficiaries that is not barred by a judgment in a decedent\u2019s personal injury action during his or her lifetime on the same underlying facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Petitioners also rely upon <em>Eagan, </em>347 Md. at 82, 698 A.2d at 1102, <em>Bushey v. Northern Assur. Co. of America, </em>362 Md. 626, 766 A.2d 598 (2001); <em>Wooldridge v. Price, </em>184 Md.App. 451, 966 A.2d 955 (2009); and <em>Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 222, 77 A.3d at 1058, and assert that \u201clongstanding jurisprudence in this State confirms that while a -wrongful death action is a separate and distinct cause of action, it still must satisfy the statutory precondition that the [decedent] be able to maintain an action and [recover] damages if death had not ensued.\u201d Specifically, Petitioners aver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">Given that Dylan [ ] had obtained a judgment against Dr. Spangler for lack of informed consent on September 27, 2006, principles of <em>res judicata </em>would preclude him from maintaining a second action for the same alleged misconduct against Dr. Spangler if death had not ensued. As a result, there is no viable wrongful death action under Maryland\u2019s wrongful death statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">We disagree. As an initial matter, the cases cited by Petitioners do not support their interpretation of Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-901(e). Our reasoning in <em>Eagan, </em>is inapplicable to the case at bar. The issue there was whether a wrongful death action brought by the deceased mother\u2019s children, against the tort-feasor (the children\u2019s father) was barred under the doctrine of parental immunity. 347 Md. at 74, 81-82, 698 A.2d at 1098, 1102. Although we acknowledged that a wrongful death claimant \u201cis ordinarily subject to any defense that is applicable to him or her, whether or not it would have been applicable to the decedent,\u201d we also observed that a wrongful death action was a new and independent cause of action, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">While certainly based on the death of another person, it is not brought in a derivative or representative capacity to recover for a loss or injury suffered by that person but, rather, is brought by a spouse, parent, or child, or a secondary beneficiary who was wholly dependent on the decedent, to recover damages for his or her own loss accruing from the decedent\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 82, 698 A.2d at 1102. <em>See also Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 220, 77 A.3d at 1056 (noting that <em>Eagan </em>\u201cserves actually to highlight the distinction between the decedent\u2019s claim and a subsequent wrongful death claim[ ]\u201d). On unrelated grounds, we nonetheless held that the doctrine did not bar a wrongful death action filed on behalf of an unemancipated minor against a parent when the matter is based on the murder or voluntary manslaughter by that parent of the child\u2019s other parent. <em>Eagan, </em>347 Md. at 74, 698 A.2d at 1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The reasoning in <em>Bushey </em>was similarly limited in scope. In that case, we addressed in relevant part, whether the parental immunity doctrine barred the parents\u2019 claim against the estate of one of their deceased daughters. 362 Md. 626, 629, 644, 766 A.2d 598, 599, 607-08 (2001). In the underlying matter, the parents sued the estate of the deceased daughter, whose negligence resulted in a fatal car accident causing the death of both daughters. <em>Id. </em>Although, as Petitioners acknowledge, we discussed the definition of \u201cwrongful act\u201d under Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-901(e), and observed that courts must examine the relationship between the decedent and tort-feasor to determine the sustainability of a tort action, that was the extent of the reference. <em>See id. </em>at 646, 766 A.2d at 608-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Ultimately, our holding was predicated on the facts of the case and the application of the parental immunity doctrine. <em>See generally id. </em>Petitioners\u2019 reliance on the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 analysis in <em>Wooldridge, </em>is also attenuated, given that the Court addressed in relevant part, whether the contributory negligence of the decedent barred a wrongful death beneficiary\u2019s subsequent wrongful death and survival action. 184 Md.App. 451, 454, 966 A.2d 955, 957 (2009). Contributory negligence on the part of Dylan or Respondents is not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Additionally, although in <em>Mummert, </em>this Court observed the derivative nature of a beneficiary\u2019s subsequent wrongful death action vis-\u00e1-vis a decedent\u2019s personal injury claim, we ultimately upheld the long-standing principle in Maryland that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>wrongful death claim is a new and independent cause of action. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">It is not wholly incorrect to state that a wrongful death claim is derivative of the decedent\u2019s claim in some sense. The two actions stem from the same underlying conduct, which must have resulted in the decedent having a viable claim when she was injured. <em>That connection, however, does not compel the conclusion that all defenses applicable to the decedent\u2019s claim prior to her death would preclude necessarily maintenance of a wrongful death claim after the decedent\u2019s death. </em>That the [General Assembly\u2019s] purpose was to create a new and independent cause of action when it passed the wrongful death statute suggests that it did not intend for a statute of limitations defense against the decedent\u2019s claim to bar consequently a subsequent wrongful death claim....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">Because we have long held that Maryland\u2019s wrongful death statute created a new and independent cause of action, we are inclined to find more persuasive the reasoning of those other courts\u2019 cases holding that a wrongful death claim is not contingent on the decedent\u2019s ability to bring a timely claim before death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">435 Md. 207, 222, 226, 77 A.3d 1049, 1058, 1060 (emphasis, added); <em>see also id. </em>at 228, 77 A.3d at 1061 (acknowledging the \u201c[General Assembly\u2019s] purpose of creating a new and independent cause of action when it passed the Maryland wrongful death statute[.]\u201d). Although we acknowledge the narrow holding of <em>Mummert </em>regarding a statute of limitations defense to a wrongful death action, <em>Mummert </em>is consistent with longstanding Maryland wrongful death jurisprudence, and remains authoritative.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Adopting Petitioners\u2019 interpretation of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-901(e) would require this Court to ignore long-standing Maryland law. Although Dylan\u2019s judgment obtained against Dr. Spangler in his personal injury action would preclude <em>him </em>from maintaining a second action based on the same underlying conduct, under principles of <em>res judicata, </em>this reasoning is not applicable to a subsequent wrongful death action by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Respondents. <em>See, e.g., Binnix v.

Caselaw supporting majority and minority views of similar wrongful death statutes</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">As noted <em>supra, </em>there is a split of authority regarding whether a decedent\u2019s personal injury action is derivative or independent of a subsequent wrongful death action by the decedent\u2019s beneficiaries. A majority of jurisdictions have held that a wrongful death action is derivative of a decedent\u2019s personal injury action, and thus, a judgment in favor of the decedent, or a release of liability prior to the decedent\u2019s death, bars a subsequent action. <em>See, e.g., Varelis v.

Consequences of interpreting a wrongful death action under \u00a7 3-901(e) as a derivative action</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Similarly, interpreting a wrongful death action under Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-901 (e) as derivative of a decedent\u2019s personal injury claim would also lead to a result that is inconsistent with the purpose of the statute. As noted <em>supra, </em>the purpose of the wrongful death statute is to allow the decedent\u2019s beneficiaries or relatives to recover damages for loss of support or other benefits that would have been provided, had the decedent not died as a result of another\u2019s negligence. <em>See </em>Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(a)(l)-(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The Superior Court of New Jersey\u2019s assessment of the purpose of its wrongful death statute<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in <em>Gershon, </em>845 A.2d 720, 725-26, <em>supra, </em>is instructive. Although the wrongful death action at issue hinged upon the decedent\u2019s exculpatory release prior to his death, in emphasizing the remedial nature of the statute, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">[T]he Wrongful Death Act is remedial legislation and must be liberally construed to effectuate its purpose of creating a right of recovery for the economic loss caused by the death of a family member. The class of litigants in a wrongful death case often includes minor children, dependent upon the decedent for economic support....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">The emphasized language limiting the right to bring a wrongful death claim only in situations in which the decedent, had he or she lived, would have been entitled to bring an action for damages, pertains only to the character of the injury, and is not intended as a procedural or jurisdictional requirement....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">A wrongful death action can only be brought for the benefit of decedent\u2019s heirs. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-4. The action is commenced by either an administrator ad prosequendum of the decedent or an executor, if the decedent dies testate. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-2. As a matter of law, a wrongful death action does not accrue to the decedent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">Thus, although actions brought under the Survivor Act and the Wrongful Death Act arise from the death of the decedent, \u2018they serve different purposes and are designed to provide a remedy to different parties.\u2019 Wrongful death damages are intended to compensate the statutorily recognized class of claimants for the pecuniary losses caused by the death of the decedent as a result of the tortious conduct of others....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-9\"><em>Id. </em>(case citations omitted). The Supreme Court of Ohio in Thompson, adhered to a similar line of reasoning. In holding that the decedent\u2019s recovery in a personal injury action did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>bar a subsequent wrongful death action by his beneficiaries, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">Because a wrongful death action is an independent cause of action, the right to bring the action cannot depend on the existence of a separate cause of action held by the injured person immediately before his or her death. To conclude otherwise would convert the wrongful death action from an independent cause of action to a derivative action, one dependent on a separate cause of action. Moreover, the wrongful death action does not even arise until the death of the injured person. It follows, therefore, that the injured person cannot defeat the beneficiaries\u2019 right to have a wrongful death action brought on their behalf because the action has not yet arisen during the injured person\u2019s lifetime. Injured persons may release their own claims; they cannot, however, release claims that are not yet in existence and that accrue in favor of persons other than themselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\"><em>Thompson, </em>637 N.E.2d at 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">We agree with the <em>Gershon </em>court\u2019s reasoning that the phrase \u201cif death had not ensued\u201d pertains only to the character of the injury, and was not intended to be a procedural or jurisdictional prerequisite to a subsequent wrongful death action. A contrary interpretation would effectively negate the statute\u2019s purpose to compensate eligible beneficiaries for the pecuniary, and related losses, caused by the death of the decedent resulting from the tortious conduct of others. Additionally, as observed in <em>Thompson, </em>because a wrongful death action is operative only after the injured party\u2019s death for the benefit of the surviving beneficiaries, it is unreasonable to read the statutory language as allowing a decedent\u2019s personal injury action to essentially \u201cdefeat\u201d the beneficiaries\u2019 right to pursue a wrongful death action on their behalf, when the right to claim has not been triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">It is difficult to reconcile Petitioners\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 3-901(e). In our view, the General Assembly did not intend to bar a wrongful death action simply because a decedent pursued a personal injury action during his or her lifetime, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>that interpretation would contravene the independent nature and purpose of a wrongful death claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">B. Defenses to a wrongful death action</p>\n<p id=\"Am\">i. <em>Res Judicata </em>defense</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We recognize the potential <em>res judicata </em>implications of our holding, particularly because wrongful death actions are often based upon essentially the same underlying facts of a decedent\u2019s personal injury action. For these same reasons, there is a dispute regarding the application of <em>res jiidicata </em>principles to the case at bar. Petitioners aver that <em>res judicata </em>is pivotal \u201cgiven that Dylan is precluded form maintaining a second action against Dr. Spangler ...\u201d under the doctrine, \u201cwhich, in turn, bars Respondents from bringing a wrongful death claim ...\u201d under the express language of the wrongful death statute. Respondents disagree, and assert that the formulation of the wrongful death statute \u201cmoots the issue of the character of Dylan\u2019s judgment at the time of his death\u201d because \u201cthe test of whether a \u201cwrongful act\u2019 existed ... begins and ends with whether Dylan had a viable claim from the outset[.]\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>consists of three elements: \u201c(1) the parties in the present litigation are the same or in privity with the parties to the earlier litigation; (2) the claim presented in the current action is identical to that determined or that which could have been raised and determined in the prior litigation; and (3) there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cochran v. Griffith Energy Servs., Inc., </em>426 Md. 134, 140, 43 A.3d 999, 1002 (2012) (citations omitted). Thus, the doctrine \u201cbars the relitigation of a claim if there is a final judgment in a previous litigation where the parties, the subject matter and causes of action are identical or substantially identical as to issues actually litigated and as to those which could have or should have been raised in the previous litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>On its face, the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>appears applicable to the circumstances presented in the case at bar. First, the parties in the present litigation, Petitioners and Respondents, are the same, and Respondents are also in privity with Dylan, as the parents and representatives of the Estate in Dylan\u2019s personal injury action. Secondly, the claim presented in Dylan\u2019s personal injury action regarding the lack of informed consent, was also raised in Respondents\u2019 wrongful death action. Finally, there was a final judgment regarding the merits in Dylan\u2019s personal injury action on September 27, 2006.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, as we explained in <em>Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 220-21, 77 A.3d at 1057, a <em>res judicata </em>defense is not relevant to a wrongful death action because the test of whether the action is barred depends only upon whether the decedent had a viable claim at the outset of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Specifically, we observed that Maryland recognized only certain defenses, which barred a decedent\u2019s personal injury claim, and in turn, precluded a wrongful death action by a decedent\u2019s beneficiaries. <em>Id. </em>These defenses included contributory negligence, <em>see, e.g., Frazee v. Balt. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>255 Md. 627, 258 A.2d 425 (1969); assumption of the risk, <em>see, e.g., Balt. &amp; Potomac R.R. v. State ex rel. Abbott, </em>75 Md. 152, 23 A. 310 (1892); parental immunity, <em>see, e.g., Smith v. Gross, </em>319 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Md. 138, 571 A.2d 1219 (1990); and a lack of privity of contract between a decedent and a manufacturer, <em>see, e.g., State ex rel. Bond v. Consol Gas, Elec. Light &amp; Power Co., </em>146 Md. 390, 126 A. 105 (1924). We further observed that the statute of limitations defense at issue in the case, was distinguishable from the commonly-recognized defenses, because where the latter defenses applied, \u201cthe decedent did not have a viable claim at the outset.\u201d <em>Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 221, 77 A.3d at 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Thus, similar to a statute of limitations defense, <em>res judicata </em>is distinguishable from other defenses that bar a subsequent wrongful death action because a <em>res judicata </em>defense demonstrates the existence of a viable claim at the outset. Accordingly, because it is undisputed that Dylan possessed a viable claim against Petitioners from the outset of his personal injury action, any potential <em>res judicata </em>defense fails. <em>See also </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 46 cmt. b, <em>supra </em>(recognizing that in jurisdictions where \u201cthe claim for wrongful death is treated as wholly \u2018independent,\u2019 [as in Maryland,] the decedent\u2019s disposition of his personal injury claim would have no effect on the wrongful death claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Furthermore, we acknowledge that in addition to having a viable claim at the outset, the only conditions precedent to bringing a wrongful death action include: 1) that death ensued as a result of a wrongful act by a tort-feasor(s), <em>see </em>Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-901(e), \u00a7 3-902(a); 2) that the beneficiaries have standing to sue, <em>see </em>Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(a)(1)-(b); and 3) that the action is within the statutory limitations period, <em>see </em>Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. 3-904(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">ii. Risk of Double Recovery</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The parties also dispute the risk of double recovery, which was, in substantial part, the basis of Petitioners\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Respondents\u2019 wrongful death action.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>However, because the damages recovered in a wrongful death action compensate for losses incurred by a decedent\u2019s beneficiaries <em>only after </em>death ensued, and are distinguishable from damages recovered by a decedent in a personal injury action, we hold that double recovery is <em>generally </em>not at risk. Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">Damages awarded in proportion to resulting injury</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">(c)(1) In an action under this subtitle, damages may be awarded to the beneficiaries proportioned to the injury resulting from the wrongful death. (2) Subject to \u00a7 11-108(d)(2) of this article, the amount recovered shall be divided among the beneficiaries in shares directed by the verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">Death of spouse, minor child, parent of minor child, or unmarried children</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">(d) The damages awarded under subsection (c) of this section are not limited or restricted by the \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d or \u201cpecuniary benefit\u201d rule but may include damages for mental anguish, emotional pain and suffering, loss of society, companionship, comfort, protection, marital care, parental care, filial care, attention, advice, counsel, training, guidance, or education where applicable for the death of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">(1) A spouse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\">(2) A minor child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-11\">(3) A parent of a minor child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-12\">(4) An unmarried child who is not a minor child if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-13\">(i) The child is 21 years old or younger; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>(ii) A parent contributed 50 percent or more of the child\u2019s support within the 12-month period immediately before the date of death of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The damages awarded to a decedent\u2019s beneficiaries are apportioned according to the harm resulting from a wrongful death. Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(c)(1). The damages awarded are limited to pecuniary losses and solatium damages, which are not awarded in a personal injury action, but are personal to a decedent\u2019s beneficiaries and relatives after death has ensued. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Based on this premise, states adhering to the minority view have held that an overlap in damages could not legally arise, given that the type of damages in a personal injury action and a wrongful death action, co-exist for independent reasons. <em>See Stewart, </em>104 Md. at 332, 65 A. at 52 (\u201cUnder the [Lord Campbell\u2019s Act] the damages recoverable are such as the equitable plaintiffs have sustained <em>by the death </em>of the party injured.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>see, e.g., DeHart v. Ohio Fuel Gas Co., </em>84 Ohio App. 62, 85 N.E.2d 586, 589 (1948) (\u201cThe rights of the next of kin begin where those of the injured person end, and are rights over which he could have no control.\u201d); <em>accord, Blackwell v. Am. Film Co., </em>209 P. at 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Moreover, to the extent that there is a risk of double recovery, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the problem can be resolved by assessing the damages awarded in a personal injury and subsequent wrongful death action on a case-by-case basis at the trial level to ensure proper allocation. <em>See McQuitty, </em>2015 WL 5822059, at *9. Alternatively, although beyond the point of consideration in the case at bar, duplica-tive damages can also be avoided by consolidating the actions and bringing both claims simultaneously. <em>See Prosser &amp; Keaton, </em>\u00a7 127 at 958 (noting that some \u201cstatutes may require consolidation of the two actions\u201d to avoid any potential risk of double recovery).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>C. Public policy considerations</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Petitioners, with the support of Amici Curiae,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> raise several public policy arguments. Specifically, Petitioners assert that affirming the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment would result in an influx of lawsuits, the value of current personal injury cases would increase and make settlement more difficult; there would be a potential for duplicative damages; and finally, the intermediate appellate court\u2019s judgment effectually \u201cusurp[s] the power of the [General Assembly].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Beyond Petitioners\u2019 contention that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment would cause an increase in lawsuits and the current value of personal injury cases, these assertions have not been substantiated with any credible evidence. Additionally, as concluded <em>supra, </em>a risk of double recovery is generally not likely, given the distinct purpose of damages in both actions. Nonetheless, to the extent that duplicative damages exist in the case at bar, the circuit court should assess and properly allocate such damages on remand. <em>See McQuitty, </em>2015 WL 5822059, at *9.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Moreover, Petitioners\u2019 contention that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment \u201cusurps\u201d legislative powers is also unavailing. Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertion, the Court did not \u201cengage[ ] in a rewriting\u201d of the wrongful death statute, by \u201ceffectively erasing the \u2018if death had not ensued\u2019 provision.\u201d Rather, the Court simply adhered to the long-standing tradition in Maryland that the wrongful death statute created a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>new and independent cause of action for a decedent\u2019s beneficiaries. We do not characterize the Court\u2019s deference in this regard as overstepping its judicial function, but instead, consider its judgment to be in furtherance of its function in interpreting the law and legislative intent that is consistent with the statutory scheme and Maryland wrongful death jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">III. The Elberfeld release does not bar Respondents\u2019 wrongful death action<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Because the release was a covenant between Dylan and Dr. Elberfeld, and the language of the release unambiguously revealed an intent to release only Dr. Elberfeld, the release does not preclude Respondents\u2019 wrongful death action against Petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Petitioners assert that if this Court rules that Dylan\u2019s personal injury action did not bar Respondents\u2019 wrongful death action, Respondents, are nonetheless, barred by the Elberfeld release executed between Dylan, and former co-defendant, Dr. Elberfeld. Petitioners allege that the covenant not to sue in paragraph eight of the Elberfeld release was not limited to a future claim against Dr. Elberfeld, but \u201crather, ... was an attestation that Respondents \u2018will not maintain <em>any </em>potential action for wrongful death.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original). Accordingly, Petitioners aver that because the Elberfeld release \u201cextinguished <em>all </em>future claims of wrongful death beneficiaries, known and unknown,\u201d the holding in <em>Melitch, </em>where decedent\u2019s settlement of his claim during his lifetime barred a subsequent wrongful death action, applies, and sim\u00e1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>larly bars Respondents\u2019 wrongful death action, (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">We disagree. Historically at common law, release of one joint tort-feasor operated as a release of all joint tort-feasors.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See Morgan v. Cohen, </em>309 Md. 304, 315-16, 523 A.2d 1003, 1008 (1987); <em>Swigert v. Welk, </em>213 Md. 613, 619, 133 A.2d 428, 431 (1957). However, the Maryland version of the Uniform Contribution Among Tort-Feasors Act altered the common law so that a release of one joint tort-feasor, did not discharge all. <em>See </em>Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-1404; <em>Morgan, </em>309 Md. at 315-16, 523 A.2d at 1008; <em>Martinez v. Lopez, </em>300 Md. 91, 102, 476 A.2d 197, 202 (1984); <em>Swigert, </em>213 Md. at 619, 133 A.2d at 431. Specifically, Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-1404 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">A release by the injured person of one joint tort-feasor, whether before or after judgment, does not discharge the other tort-feasors <em>unless the release so provides, </em>but it reduces the claim against the other tort-feasors in the amount of the consideration paid for the release or in any amount or proportion by which the release provides that the total claim shall be reduced, if greater than the consideration paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">In construing the meaning of a release, this Court adheres to principles of contract interpretation. <em>See Hashmi v. Bennett, </em>416 Md. 707, 723, 7 A.3d 1059, 1068 (2010); <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Cook, </em>386 Md. 468, 495, 872 A.2d 969, 985 (2005). Therefore, \u201c[a] release is to be construed according to the intent of the parties[,] the object and purpose of the instrument, [which] will control and limit its operation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496, 872 A.2d at 985. Maryland also follows the objective law of contract interpretation and construction. <em>Id.; Calomins v. Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 435, 727 A.2d 358, 363 (1999). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>explained this principle in <em>Owens-Illinois, </em>386 Md. at 496, 872 A.2d at 985, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIU\">A court construing an agreement ... must first determine from the language of the agreement itself what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have meant at the time it was effectuated. In addition, when the language of the contract is plain and unambiguous there is no room for construction, and a court must presume that the parties meant what they expressed. In these circumstances, the true test of what is meant is not what the parties to the contract intended it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant. Consequently, the clear and unambiguous language of an agreement will not give away [ ] to what the parties thought that the agreement meant or intended it to mean....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4D\">(quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Petitioners\u2019 argument that the Elberfeld release applied to all tort-feasors, rests upon an isolated reading of the release. A plain reading of the preface of the release, in tandem with paragraphs three, seven, and eight of the release, unambiguously reveals that Dylan did not \u201crelease or in any way discharge\u201d Petitioners from further claims in connection with the underlying action. The relevant provisions states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">For and in consideration of the sum of ($999,000) the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, for ourselves and our heirs, representatives, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, we, Peggy McQuitty and Gary McQuitty, individually, and as parents and next friends of the minor Plaintiff, Dylan McQuitty (hereinafter Plaintiff) do hereby remise, release and forever discharge Harold Elberfeld, M.D., and his personal agents, servants and/or employees, only, (hereinafter Defendant), his predecessors and/or successors in interest, and his insurance company Zurich American (Zurich) (hereinafter referred to collectively as \u201cReleasees\u201d) and, subject to the terms of paragraph # 3, any other persons or entities for whom Releasees could be legally responsible, as applicable, whether or not named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>herein, of and from all, and all manner of, actions and causes of actions, suits, debts; accounts, bonds, covenants, contracts, agreements, judgments, claims and demands of whatsoever kind, in law or in equity, known or unknown, foreseen and unforeseen, which we now have or may hereafter have, arising out of an incident and management of a pregnancy and the birth of the Plaintiff more fully described in the pleadings in this case known as <em>Dylan McQuitty, minor, by and through his Parents and Next Friends Peggy McQuitty and Gary McQuitty v.

Plaintiff covenants that his heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns will not maintain any potential action for survival to include, but not necessarily limited to, funeral expenses....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In <em>Mummert, </em>435 Md. at 222, 77 A.3d at 1057, we observed that \u201cwhether a release by the decedent bars a wrongful death claim by [the decedent\u2019s] beneficiaries depends in part on the sweep of the language of the particular release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Here, the \u201csweep of the language\u201d in the Elberfeld release does not preclude Respondents\u2019 wrongful death action. The relevant provisions of the release reveals that Dylan executed a covenant with Dr. Elberfeld, and that in consideration of the monies paid by Dr. Elberfeld, that neither Dylan nor his beneficiaries would \u201cjoin or attempt to join\u201d Dr. Elberfeld, his agents and assigns, in any future 'wrongful death or survival action arising out of the lawsuit. The release does not reflect that Petitioners offered any consideration towards the settlement, and Petitioners\u2019 inclusion on the release was for the sole purpose of excluding them from any benefit therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Thus, we are not persuaded that the Elberfeld release was a general release because the \u201ccovenant not to sue\u201d in paragraph eight did not clearly define the recipient at the time the covenant was made. The release unambiguously reveals that the clearly defined recipient was Dr. Elberfeld, which did not constitute a release of all joint tort-feasors. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS AFFIRMED.

Respondents further allege that because Petitioners moved to vacate, amend or revise the judgment after the case was on remand, the circuit court was able to reduce the judgment in accordance with the Maryland cap on non-economic damages and the joint tort-feasor settlement only after that time. At that point, Respondents aver that the judgment in favor of Dylan's Estate became a final and appealable judgment. Petitioners counter that Respondents suddenly take a position regarding the date of final judgment, which the record reveals is inconsistent with the position they maintained throughout the litigation, and with this Court's own recognition of the date of final judgment. We agree, and without extensive discussion, conclude that Respondents argument is unpersuasive, in light of our opinion in <em>McQuitty II, </em>in which we acknowledged that the final date of judgment was September 27, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b93-8\">.
