Revenue Act of 1948, Pub. L. No. 80-471, 62 Stat. 110, 117 (1948). At its inception, the marital deduction essentially excluded the lesser of the value of property transferred to the surviving spouse from the taxable estate or one half of the adjusted gross estate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Changes to the computation of the marital deduction occurred over the years but the most significant for our purposes occurred in 1981 through the Economic Recovery Tax Act, under which the marital deduction was increased by enabling the total value of an estate to be transferred to a surviving spouse without adverse federal estate tax consequences. Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, Pub. L. 97-34, 95 Stat. 172 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>(1981). <em>See also </em>George M. Schain, <em>Marital Trust v. QTIP: Advice for Estate Planners, </em>49 Mo. L. Rev. 741 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Essentially, then, an estate can avoid adverse tax consequences upon the death of the testator through the use of the marital deduction, because the marital deduction \u201creflects a strongly held policy that it is inappropriate to assess transfer taxes on transfers of property between spouses.\u201d William M. McGovern, et al., <em>Wills, Trusts and Estates Including Taxation and Future Interests </em>719 (4th ed. 2010). Federal estate taxes may be reduced when property is transferred to the surviving spouse upon the death of the decedent, but the value of the property conveyed that remains at the time of the death of the surviving spouse is subject to federal estate tax.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2044. <em>See also </em>Angela M. Vallario, <em>The Fundamentals of Estate Planning </em>251 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">To qualify for the marital deduction, the property must be that which would have been includable in the gross estate of the decedent and which passes, or has passed, to the surviving spouse by operation of law or otherwise.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(a). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>\u201cTerminable\u201d property interests, interests given to a surviving spouse for a limited time, however, do not qualify for the marital deduction, unless the interest qualifies as one of the exceptions provided in Section 2056 of the Internal Revenue Code,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> including the Qualified Terminable Interest Property (QTIP), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(7), or that property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">(I) which passes from the decedent,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">(II) in which the surviving spouse has a qualifying income interest for life, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">(III) to which an election!<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>] under this paragraph applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(i). To constitute a \u201cqualifying income interest for life\u201d the terms of the property transfer must provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">(I) the surviving spouse is entitled to all the income from the property, payable annually or at more frequent intervals, or has a usufruct!<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>] interest for life in the property, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-10\">(II) no person has a power to appoint any part of the property to any person other than the surviving spouse. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Subclause (II) shall not apply to a power exercisable only at or after the death of the surviving spouse. To the extent provided in regulations, an annuity shall be treated in a manner similar to an income interest in property (regardless of whether the property from which the annuity is payable can be separately identified).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(ii). Treatment of property as QTIP property requires that the executor elect the property for treatment as QTIP property on the federal tax return for the estate, a decision that is irrevocable. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Property elected for QTIP treatment may qualify for the marital deduction, whether it is transferred outright or placed in a trust. Tax Reg. \u00a7 20.2056(a)-l. A properly structured QTIP trust, one that meets the requirements of Section 2056(b)(7)(B), qualifies the property in trust for inclusion in the marital deduction, yet allows the testator to specify a different beneficiary for the remainder of the QTIP trust assets upon the death of the surviving spouse. 26 U.S.C \u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(i)-(ii). <em>See also </em>Vallario, <em>supra, </em>at 261. The QTIP Trust qualifies for the marital deduction when the surviving spouse is entitled to all of the income of the trust for life, the income is paid to the surviving spouse at least annually and no one has the power to appoint any part of the property to any person other than the surviving spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In addition, unlike a traditional life estate, the surviving spouse, who is the beneficiary of a QTIP Trust, not only receives the income from the Trust but also may request that the trustee disburse principal from the Trust to meet the surviving spouse\u2019s needs.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Tax Reg. \u00a7 20.2056(b)-7(d)(6). It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>possible, therefore, that distributions of principal for the benefit of the surviving spouse could have depleted the Trust such that only minimal assets are left for the remainderman identified by the testator.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Any property used to pay federal estate taxes, however, will not qualify for the marital deduction. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(4)(A). If property allocated to the marital deduction is used to pay federal estate tax, the marital deduction is reduced by the amount of the payment made, thereby increasing the federal estate tax imposed on the estate. <em>Id. See also </em>Jerome A. Manning, Manning on Estate Planning 14-18 (7th ed. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">One way to protect the marital deduction from adverse tax consequences and receive the full federal estate tax benefit for property transferred to the surviving spouse is to use a \u201csavings clause\u201d in the will. That type of savings clause, often referred to as an \u201cinterpretive aide savings clause\u201d, restricts actions taken by the personal representative that could reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the tax benefit of the marital deduction and assists with the interpretation and explanation of the testator\u2019s intent with respect to preventing adverse tax consequences. <em>See </em>Eugene Lyle Stoler, <em>Savings Clauses, </em>The CPA Journal, 25 (April 1999); Charles A. Redd, <em>What Types of Savings Clauses will Preserve the Marital Deduction?, </em>14 Est. Plan. 72 (1987). The interpretive aide savings clause \u201cattempts to elucidate the testator\u2019s or grantor\u2019s prevailing intentions with regard to securing the marital deduction,\u201d Redd at 72, and is \u201ca provision that takes away a power or changes a provision that is expressly given elsewhere in the instrument and is, therefore, in direct conflict with that other express power or provision.\u201d Stoler at 25; <em>see also </em>William Parsons, <em>Lifetime and Testamentary Estate Planning, </em>74 (9th ed. 1983). The interpretive aide savings clause, therefore, can express the testator\u2019s intent that any authority granted to the personal representative is void should it reduce the efficacy of the marital deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The Internal Revenue Service has recognized the validity of an interpretive aide savings clause in Rev. Rui. 75-440 (1975). Addressed in Revenue Ruling 75-440 was a situation in which a will provided for both a marital trust and a residuary trust and granted authority to the trustees to invest trust principal in non-income producing life insurance. The will also included a savings clause that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, any power, duty, or discretionary authority granted to my Fiduciary hereunder shall be absolutely void to the extent that either the right to exercise or the exercise thereof, shall in any way affect, jeopardize or cause my estate to lose all or any part of the tax benefit afforded my estate by the Marital Deduction under either Federal or State Laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arj\"><em>Id. </em>at 2. Since life insurance policies are not income producing property and often require that premiums be paid, a beneficiary of a marital trust that owned such property would not be entitled to all of the income, thereby eviscerating the marital deduction. <em>Id. </em>The trusts in question permitted such investment, and the question was whether that permission applied to the marital trust and, therefore, disqualified it from inclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>in the marital deduction. The Revenue Ruling concluded, however, that the interpretive aide savings clause in the will was helpful to interpret the testator\u2019s intent not to authorize the trustees to invest marital trust assets in non-income producing life insurance in order to qualify for the marital deduction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\">The savings clause is not a savings clause in the strict sense of the term, but is an aid in determining the testator\u2019s intent; that is, the existence of a savings clause that would \u2018void\u2019 a disqualifying power given to the trustees of the marital deduction trust is relevant here only because it helps indicate the testator\u2019s intent not to give those trustees a disqualifying power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 3. As a result, the marital deduction under Section 2056 was allowed with respect to the marital trust.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Mr. Clancy\u2019s Will, executed June 11, 2007, contained fourteen items that named his personal representative, instructed with respect to the payment of estate taxes, left Mr. Clancy\u2019s personal and real property to Mrs. Clancy and, with respect to the remainder of his estate, created three residuary trusts: a Marital Trust for the benefit of Mrs. Clancy representing one third of the residuary; a Family Trust for the benefit of Mrs. Clancy and their minor child equal to one half of the residue that remained after the creation of the Marital Trust; and the final, two Older Children\u2019s Trusts into which the remaining one half of the residue after the creation of the Marital Trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>was to be deposited.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyB\">ITEM THIRD</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">A.

Judge Garrett determined that the Savings Clause in the Will, as amended by the Second Codicil, constituted a \u201cvalid interpretive aid savings clause\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">In my view, the Savings Clause is a valid interpretive aid savings clause. The Savings Clause is applicable to the entire will and is not dependent on a court ruling or IRS determination. Instead, it is a clear expression of the testator\u2019s intent to have the Family Trust qualify for the marital deduction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">He noted that, generally, there are two types of savings clauses designed to preserve the marital deduction, (1) \u201ccondition subsequent\u201d savings clauses; and (2) \u201cinterpretive aid\u201d savings clauses, and that an interpretive aid savings clause was \u201cdesigned to stand on its own with the purpose of clarifying the testator\u2019s intent in the event of a perceived ambiguity or contradiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Judge Garrett concluded, as a result of the singular focus of the Second Codicil on qualifying the Family Trust for the marital deduction, that the Savings Clause reflected Mr. Clancy\u2019s predominant intent that the Family Trust be free of any Federal estate tax liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">In exercise of our jurisdiction to construe a will, incidental to the administration of the Estate, this Court finds that the Will restricts the [Personal Representative] from requiring the Family Trust to contribute to the payment of estate taxes. Although the Tax Clause and division of the residuary trusts provide some evidence that the Testator intended the Family Trust to share in the estate tax liability with the Older Children\u2019s Trust, this Court finds the express lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>guage of the Savings Clause as the clearest and the predominant evidence of the Testator\u2019s intent, which can only be achieved if the Family Trust is free of estate tax liability. This court also finds that the plain language of the Savings Clause, which prevents the [Personal Representative] from taking any action that would prevent the Family Trust from receiving the benefit of the marital deduction, necessarily includes restricting the payment of estate taxes as each payment of estate tax causes a recalculation of the estate tax and a loss of the marital deduction. ... Furthermore, this court finds that the overwhelming purpose of the Second Codicil is to qualify the Family Trust for the marital deduction and reduce the overall estate tax liability. This Court is also bound by the rule, where if there is a conflict between a will and a codicil, \u201cthe codicil as the last expression of the testator\u2019s will and intention must be given effect.\u201d <em>Wiesenfeld v.

When construing a will, our emphasis, as well as that of the Orphans\u2019 Court, is ascertaining and effectuating the intent of the testator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">When construing a will, the \u201cparamount concern of the court is to ascertain and effectuate the testator\u2019s expressed intent.\u201d In other words, the search is not for the testator\u2019s \u201cpresumed [intention] but for his <em>expressed intention. </em>\u201d Generally, that intent is \u201cgathered from the four corners of the will with the words of the will given their \u2018plain meaning and import.\u2019 \u201d Words having legal significance, however, \u201cwill be construed in that sense unless the will clearly indicates otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 649, 919 A.2d at 645 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Mr. Clancy\u2019s Older Children assert that their father intended that federal estate taxes should be paid out of the residuary estate, including that which was allocated to the Family Trust, when he executed his Will, because ITEM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>THIRD of the Will directed that, \u201cAll estate, inheritance, legacy, succession and transfer taxes ... shall be paid by my personal representative out of my residuary estate[.]\u201d They argue that federal estate taxes can be paid out of the Family Trust and still preserve the property allocated to that trust for the marital deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Mrs. Clancy does not dispute that ITEM THIRD of the Will says what it says, but asserts that the Savings Clause expressly excepts any property from the residuary estate allocated to the marital deduction from having to bear the burden of estate taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The parties\u2019 disagreement, then, centers on the impact of the Second Codicil\u2019s qualification of the Family Trust for the marital deduction and, moreover, the interpretation of the restrictions in the Savings Clause as amended by the Second Codicil, juxtaposed against ITEM THIRD of the Will, which indicated that federal estate taxes are to be paid from the residuary estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\"> When construing a will and any codicils, \u201c[t]he will and codicils must be construed as one instrument, and effect must, if possible, be given to every part of them.\u201d <em>Lederer v.

All the parties also agree that the Second Codicil contained a Savings Clause that amended the Savings Clause in the Will to restrict the actions of the personal representative and trustee to qualify the portion of the residuary trust allocated to the Family Trust for the marital deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The Second Codicil did not, however, specifically address, in any way, the Will provision that instructed that taxes were to be paid out of the residuary estate of which the Family Trust was a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">To resolve the ambiguity and apparent conflict, we rely on the interpretive aide of the Savings Clause to elucidate Mr. Clancy\u2019s intent. In so doing, we determine, as did the Orphans\u2019 Court, that the Savings Clause contained in the Second Codicil which prevented the personal representative from exercising any \u201cauthority, power, or discretion\u201d to disqualify any portion of the Family Trust from the marital deduction, such as the payment of federal estate taxes, \u201ctrumps\u201d ITEM THIRD of the Will relating to payment of taxes from the residuary estate. We reach this conclusion for a number of reasons, the first of which is because of the decisions in similar circumstances by other courts, as well as the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s decision in Revenue Ruling 75-440.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In <em>Northeastern Pennsylvania Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. U.S., </em>360 F.Supp. 116 (M.D.Pa.1973), the federal district court judge determined that a marital trust created by the will was not intended to bear the burden of any estate taxes based on a savings clause in the will which intended to retain the \u201cmaximum marital deduction.\u201d The will provisions in issue provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AegU\">(1) that the inheritance and estate taxes are to be paid from the residuary estate; (2) that the residuary estate is to be held in trust for decedent\u2019s wife, son and grandchildren, with 50% of the residue to be placed in the trust for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>wife, 25% for his son and 25% for his grandchildren; and (3) that notwithstanding any other provision of the will, the Executor shall not have any duties or authority if or to the extent that such would disqualify the wife\u2019s trust from the maximum marital deduction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 117. The will\u2019s savings clause stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">I provide and direct that notwithstanding any other provisions contained herein, ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">(b) That the Executor and trustee shall not have any rights, powers, privileges, duties, authority, immunities, or discretion, given by any other provision of this, my Last Will and Testament, if or to the extent that such would disqualify Trust A [the Marital Trust] for the maximum marital deduction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 119. The Internal Revenue Service had assessed a deficiency because of the exclusion under the marital deduction of property conveyed to the spouse. The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service contended that the testator intended that the residue be split between trusts for his spouse, son and grandchildren after the payment of the estate taxes. <em>Id. </em>at 118. The federal district court judge disagreed and in language equally applicable to the instant case stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">If the executor were to charge the taxes generally to the residue, the wife\u2019s share in residue would bear a portion of the taxes which would disqualify it from the maximum marital deduction. Such payment of taxes from the residue would be in direct conflict with \u00b6 VIIIA3(b), and the testator has directed that in such an event HVIIIA3(b) prevails. Likewise, if the ratio of 2:1:1 of the minimum monthly payments were interpreted to require the executor to set up corpora in a ratio of 2:1:1 by charging the death taxes generally to residue before computing the distributive shares, the conflicting direction to obtain the maximum deduction for the marital trust would take precedence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">The direction to obtain the maximum marital deduction is the clearest and the predominant evidence of Rodgers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>intent. His primary objective can be achieved here only if the wife\u2019s residuary share is free of federal estate tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Our determination that the Savings Clause in the Second Codicil clarifies Mr. Clancy\u2019s intention that the Family Trust not be charged with any federal estate taxes also is supported by Revenue Ruling 75-^40, <em>supra. </em>In that case, the Service concluded that its savings clause that provided that, \u201cNotwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, any power, duty, or discretionary authority granted to my Fiduciary hereunder shall be absolutely void to the extent that either the right to exercise or the exercise thereof, shall in any way affect, jeopardize or cause my estate to lose all or any part of the tax benefit afforded my estate by the Marital Deduction under either Federal or State Laws.\u201d, Rev. Rui. 75-440 at 2, operated to void any power given to the trustees that would disqualify the marital deduction. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The savings clause, as interpreted by the Service, permitted it to displace the provision of the will that had directed estate taxes to be paid from the residuary estate of which the marital property qualifying for the deduction was a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Were the Family Trust in the instant case to bear the burden of any portion of the payment of the federal estate tax, that payment would reduce the marital deduction as noted in the tax regulation:<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>In the determination of the value of any property interest which passed from the decedent to his surviving spouse, there must be taken into account the effect which the Federal estate tax, or any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance tax, has upon the net value to the surviving spouse of the property interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Tax Reg. \u00a7 20.2056(b) \u2014 4(c)(1). The Regulation itself indicates the effect on the benefit from payment of estate taxes out of property allocated to the marital deduction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">For example, assume that the only bequest to the surviving spouse is $100,000 and the spouse is required to pay a State inheritance tax in the amount of $1,500. If no other death taxes affect the net value of the bequest, the value, for the purpose of the marital deduction, is $98,500.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Tax Reg. \u00a7 20.2056(b)-4(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">The Savings Clause in the Second Codicil, nevertheless, explicitly directs that the personal representative not act to adversely impact the benefit of the marital deduction of the Marital Trust and the Family Trust. To burden the Family Trust with payment of federal estate taxes at the time of Mr. Clancy\u2019s death when the property is conveyed in trust for the benefit of Mrs. Clancy would be in direct derogation of Mr. Clancy\u2019s intent manifested in the Savings Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The Older Children, however, rely on <em>Estate of James A. Fine v. C.I.R., </em>90 T.C. 1068 (1988), to bolster their argument that a savings clause does not necessarily avoid payment of federal estate taxes from the marital share. In <em>Fine, </em>the testator died leaving a will that directed in Articles One and Two the prompt payment of \u201cdebts and funeral expenses\u201d and the payment of estate taxes out of the residuary estate \u201cwithout apportionment.\u201d 90 T.C. at 1070. Article Three of the will directed that one-half of the residuary was to go to the testator\u2019s surviving wife and the remainder of the residuary divided into three equal shares to other beneficiaries. <em>Id. </em>Subsection 17 of Article IV stated, \u201cAny power, duty or discretionary authority granted to the Executor shall be void to the extent that its exercise shall cause my estate to lose all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>or any part of the tax benefit afforded by the marital deduction under federal or state laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The wife had argued that the marital share should not be burdened by the payment of federal estate tax which would reduce the benefit of the marital deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The court concluded that the testator\u2019s will expressly provided that estate taxes were to be paid out of the residuary estate, without reference to the Virginia apportionment statute which would have maximized the marital deduction and limited payment of estate taxes by the marital share. 90 T.C. at 1075. The court also concluded that the limitation of the personal representative\u2019s discretion contained as a part of Article IV did not affect the payment of estate taxes because the Virginia apportionment statute was inapplicable pursuant to the terms of the will. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\"><em>Fine, </em>however, is unavailing in the instant case because Mr. Clancy in the Second Codicil\u2019s Savings Clause expressly prohibited his Personal Representative from adversely affecting ability of the Family Trust to benefit from the martial deduction, when it stated \u201cnor shall any payment or distribution by my personal representative or my trustee be limited or restricted by any provision of this Will, such that, in any such event, my estate would be prevented from receiving the benefit of the marital deduction as hereinbefore set forth.\u201d The Savings Clause also expressly applied to Mr. Clancy\u2019s Will in its entirety when in the second sentence of the Savings Clause it specified that <em>\u201cAnything in this Will </em>to the contrary notwithstanding, and whether or not any reference is made in <em>any other provision </em>of this Will .... \u201d (emphasis added). The restriction on the power granted to Mr. Clancy\u2019s Personal Representative contained in the Second Codicil Savings Clause applies to all provisions of the Will, including ITEM THIRD, which provides for payment of federal estate taxes out of the residuary.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">In addition, the Older Children point to <em>Estate of Posner v. C.I.R., </em>87 T.C.M. CCH 1288 (T.C.2004), for the proposition that a savings clause would be ineffective were it to rewrite a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>will. In <em>Posner, </em>the surviving spouse, who had received the benefit of a marital deduction for federal estate tax purposes for property conveyed to her when her husband subsequently died, having disinherited two of her three children. The two children, then, disputed the efficacy of their disinheritance in the mother\u2019s will and sought to \u201cresurrect\u201d their father\u2019s will, which had divided his residuary estate among the three children. Resolution of the issue depended upon whether the husband\u2019s will had granted his wife an <em>inter vivos </em>or a testamentary power of appointment over the marital property that qualified for the marital deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The Tax Court, in deciding that Mrs. Posner had no general power of appointment, found notable that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">... Mr. Posner\u2019s will contains no language referring to a \u201cgeneral power of appointment\u201d and, indeed, contains no substantive dispositions of the marital trust property. Item II of Mr. Posner\u2019s will does not expressly provide for the disposition of income or principal of the marital trust, and it contains no direction regarding the distribution of principal upon termination of the trust. It refers only to the Federal estate tax marital deduction. Item XIV also refers to the marital deduction but contains no language that we might reasonably interpret to grant decedent a general power of appointment. The references to the marital deduction alone in items II and XIV are insufficient to create a general power of appointment in decedent\u2019s favor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 7. (internal citation omitted). The clause to which the Older Children in the present case point to as ineffective in <em>Posner </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">... my Trustee shall not have or exercise any authority, power or discretion over the Marital Trust or the income thereof, or the property constituting the same, nor shall any payment or distribution by my Trustee be limited or restricted by any provision of this Will, which would in any way ... affect the right of my said wife to all income therefrom or her right to dispose of the principal and income thereof in the amount and to the extent necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>qualify the Marital Trust for the marital deduction for Federal estate tax purposes under the provisions of the law applicable to my estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The distinguishing characteristics of Mr. Posner\u2019s will, however, compared to Mr. Clancy\u2019s Will in the instant case is that Mr. Clancy did everything in his Will and Second Codicil that Mr. Posner did not. In order to qualify the Family Trust for the QTIP election, Mr. Clancy directed that Mrs. Clancy had a qualifying income interest for life, that she was entitled to all of the income from the property payable annually, that no person had the power to appoint any part of the property to anyone other than her as well as that Mrs. Clancy was provided with the power to request distribution of corpus from the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">We agree with the Older Children that it is clear that a testator could direct that the burden of inheritance taxes could be placed on legatees who otherwise would not have to pay such taxes,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> as well as payment of estate taxes on the marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>share,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> as the Older Children have asserted. Mr. Clancy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>however, in his estate documents did not burden the marital share with payment of federal estate taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Moreover, were the Family Trust to bear the burden of federal estate taxes, at the time of Mr. Clancy\u2019s death, the corpus of that trust would be subject to imposition of federal estate taxes twice, at the time of Mr. Clancy\u2019s death as well as when Mrs. Clancy died. The establishment of the QTIP Trust in Mr. Clancy\u2019s Will insures that the Younger Child will have to pay estate taxes when Mrs. Clancy dies. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2044. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Certainly, as each party agrees, Mr. Clancy intended to minimize the impact of federal estate taxes in the entirety of his Will, an intent that would be eviscerated by double taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Finally, the Older Children question having the burden of federal estate taxation being placed on them, to the benefit of Mrs. Clancy. Mr. Clancy, however, clearly intended, by the establishment of the QTIP Trust, to benefit Mrs. Clancy to the detriment of the Younger Child, whose remainder could be diminished by Mrs. Clancy\u2019s invasion of corpus for need. As a result, all of Mr. Clancy\u2019s children are burdened for the benefit of Mrs. Clancy and to avoid federal estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">In conclusion, we hold that the property conveyed in the Family Trust as identified in Mr. Clancy\u2019s Will and Second Codicil cannot be burdened by the payment of federal estate taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE ORPHANS\u2019 COURT AFFIRMED; COSTS IN THIS COURT TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Barbera, C.J., Greene and McDonald, JJ., dissent</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-14\">. <em>Gregory v.

Necessarily, therefore, the testator must have intended that the amount of the residuary shares to be distributed would be determined based on the value of the residuary estate after the taxes had been paid, off the top, out of the estate; it was the clear intention of the testator that each individual share of the residuary estate be determined after the taxes were paid on the entire estate, albeit from the residuary estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 655, 919 A.2d at 648-49.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b632-5\">. In <em>Second Nat\u2019l Bank of New Haven v. U.S., </em>351 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir.1965), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals determined that a will, modified by a codicil designed to qualify the Wife's one-third interest in the residuary for the marital deduction, did not also exempt the Wife\u2019s share from liability for federal estate taxes. The court concluded that the language of the will stating, \"The provisions of any statute requiring the apportionment or proration of such taxes among the beneficiaries of this will or the transferees of such property, or the ultimate payment of such taxes by them, shall be without effect in the settlement of my estate\", <em>id. </em>at 491, expressed the testator\u2019s intention that the Connecticut appropriation statute did not apply, and that estate taxes were to be paid out of the residuary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">It would be difficult to conceive of a clearer direction expressing the thought that death taxes, together with debts and funeral expenses, were to be paid out of the estate. The first sentence of Article One (T direct my executors to pay out my just debts and funeral expenses and any death taxes * * *') has been held in cases where similar language was construed not only to shift the tax burden to the residue as an expense of administration, but also as the equivalent of a direction against proration among the residuary legatees. The \u2018inclusion of them (taxes) in the same classification as debts, funeral expenses * * *\u2019 is an expression of \u2018an intention that they should be paid out of the estate in the same way and from the same funds as these other charges.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 492-93 (internal citations omitted). The court reached the conclusion that \"while the codicil shows a desire to qualify one-third of the residue as a marital deduction\u201d, \"[i]t does not disclose an intention to have this part of the residue in effect tax free and grossly disproportionate to the other two-thirds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in <em>First Nat. Bank of Atlanta, </em>634 F.2d 212 (5th Cir.1981), interpreted a testator\u2019s intention in a will that provided for the payment of estate taxes out of a residuary that was divided into two trusts, one a marital trust, and the other a family trust. The court determined liability for the payment of estate taxes could be borne, in part, by the marital trust. 634 F.2d at 213. The will in Item Three provided that the residue of the estate was to be divided equally between a marital trust and a family trust:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">If my wife survives me, I direct my Executors (after paying all of the above bequests, and after paying all debts, taxes and expenses other than Estate Taxes) to divide the residue of my estate into two parts, which (after adjusting for the insurance and other property payable to my wife hereinafter mentioned) shall be equal in size. I hereby designate these as Parts A and B. There shall be regarded as a portion of my estate assigned to Part A, for the purpose of this calculation only, the following: (1) any insurance on my life which is so payable to my wife as to be lawfully the subject of a marital deduction for Federal Estate Tax purposes, and (2) the value of any other property passing to my wife either outside this Will or under any other Item of this Will in such manner as to qualify as a part of such marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>deduction.... There shall not be included in Part A any property as to which such a marital deduction would not be allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-8\"><em>Id. </em>Item Seven of the will addressed the payment of taxes and stated, \"All estate taxes shall be paid from the residue of my estate, and no claim shall be made against any life insurance beneficiaries for payment of any pro rata part of such taxes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There was no savings clause in the will. The Fifth Circuit recognized that, \"there is no provision for payment of estate taxes only out of the non-marital portion of the estate, even if the residue were to be divided prior to payment of such taxes\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 214, and the value of the interest passing to the surviving spouse then, for which the marital deduction was allowed, was the net value of the property interest after the payment of estate taxes charged against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">In <em>Estate of Avery v. C.I.R., </em>40 T.C. 392 (1963), the United States Tax Court held that the value of the marital deduction was reduced by payment of estate taxes. In that case, the will first instructed that all debts and funeral expenses be paid as soon as practicable and then directed that all estate taxes be paid out of the \"general assets of my estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393. The Fifth Item of the will devised the \"rest, residue and remainder\u201d equally to the testator's surviving wife, son and daughter. <em>Id. </em>at 394. There was no savings clause. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue argued that the residue, from which the surviving spouse\u2019s one-third was distributed, was that which remained after estate taxes were deducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">The Tax Court agreed, concluding that, \u201cThere is nothing in the will to support the conclusion that the burden of the tax was to fall on the son and daughter and to be borne only by their shares of the estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399. The court found that the directive in Item Second of the will that \"Such taxes as my Executors are hereby directed to pay shall not be charged against or deducted from any such gift, devise and bequest upon or by reason of which such taxes are assessed and paid\u201d, referred to only to the specific bequests and not to the distribution of the residue. <em>Id. </em>With respect to the marital share, the court concluded that it had to bear the burden of estate taxes as a result of the specific provision in the will that required the payment of taxes from the general assets and, necessarily, from the residue before any distribution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Dissenting Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Ae5s\">McDonald, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Amk\">which Barbera, C.J., and Greene, J., join</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">The Majority opinion appears to be based on the premise that the pre-eminent value for any testator is the avoidance of taxes. Perhaps there are people like that. If so, one would expect them to have bought a Yugo years ago and scrupulously maintained it to minimize and thereafter avoid the automobile excise tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">In fact, while paying no more taxes than necessary is significant, most people have other values that also inform important decisions for their lives \u2014 and for their heirs. In the purchase of a car, for example, interests in function, reliability, comfort, and safety may dissuade a person from purchasing the cheapest \u2014 and least taxed \u2014 car, although that may mean paying more in tax. So also is the case in devising an estate plan. As this Court has observed, \u201c[mjinimizing estate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>inheritance taxes for beneficiaries ... may not always be the ultimate driving force behind the testator\u2019s decisions regarding the provisions contained in his or her will.\u201d <em>Noble v. Bruce, </em>349 Md. 730, 757, 709 A.2d 1264 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">There appears to be no dispute that the estate plan implemented by Mr. Clancy\u2019s 2007 will (1) provided for the payment of certain expenses and made specific bequests of real and personal property to his wife from his second marriage (\u201cMrs. Clancy\u201d), (2) set aside a portion of his estate for Mrs. Clancy free of estate taxes (\u201cthe Marital Share\u201d), (3) then provided for the payment of taxes, and (4) finally divided the rest of his estate evenly between a trust benefitting Mrs. Clancy (and ultimately their minor child) (\u201cthe Family Trust\u201d) and trusts benefitting the children from his first marriage (\u201cthe Older Children\u2019s Trusts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">What is in dispute is the effect on that estate plan of an amendment of that will, known as the Second Codicil. In the view of Mr. Clancy\u2019s Personal Representative,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that amendment had the effect of achieving a significant reduction in tax liability (from $26 million to $15.7 million) while retaining the equal distribution (50% - 50%) of the residual of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The reading of the will urged by Mrs. Clancy would achieve a smaller additional tax reduction (from $15.7 million to $11.8 million), but would cast aside the plan for equal distributions from the residual despite the fact that the language of the will directing equal distributions was not amended \u2014 and skew the distributions from the residual in her favor (63% - 37%).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The Majority opinion opts for Mrs. Clancy\u2019s interpretation of the will \u2014 an interpretation in which an amended savings clause is construed to contradict basic terms of the original will that remained unchanged. However, we ordinarily read provisions of wills to be consistent unless there is no way to do so. In my view, the savings clause can be read consistently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>with the original will to achieve the tax savings for which codicil was intended without discarding the basic estate plan. Accordingly, I would adopt the reading of the will offered by Mr. Clancy\u2019s Personal Representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The following supplement to the Majority opinion\u2019s background information will aid in understanding this dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">\n<em>Gross Estate, Marital Deduction, and Taxable Estate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">A <em>gross estate </em>refers to the total dollar value of all property and assets in which an individual had an interest at the time of the individual\u2019s death. Federal estate taxes are assessed on the basis of the <em>taxable estate, </em>which is the gross estate minus any allowable deductions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The primary deduction relevant here is the <em>marital deduction. </em>The value of the marital deduction generally is the full value of all property in the gross estate that passes from the decedent to a surviving spouse, provided that the interest passing to the spouse does not terminate or fail. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056. A property interest that <em>does </em>terminate, and ordinarily would not qualify for the marital deduction, may still qualify for the marital deduction if it is \u201cqualified terminable interest property\u201d (\u201cQTIP\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">\n<em>QTIP and Savings Clauses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">To qualify a trust as a QTIP trust, the property must pass from the testator to that trust, the surviving spouse must have a qualifying income interest for life, and the necessary election must be made by the personal representative. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(i). A surviving spouse has a qualifying income interest for life if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>(I) the surviving spouse is entitled to all the income from the property, payable annually or at more frequent intervals, or has a usufruct[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] interest for life in the property, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\">(II) no person has a power to appoint any part of the property to any person other than the surviving spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(7)(B)(ii). In order to treat property as QTIP, the personal representative must make an irrevocable QTIP election on the appropriate tax return. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(7)(B)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Because wills often include provisions that may conflict with the QTIP requirements but that provide guidance for other trusts not intended to qualify as QTIP, a testator will often include a savings clause in order to ensure that a trust intended to qualify as QTIP in fact does so. <em>Cf. </em>Edward C. Renenger, <em>Can a State\u2019s Marital Deduction Savings Clause Reform a Defective Marital </em>Deduction? <em>Estate of Davis v. Commissioner, </em>57 Tax Law 615, 619 (2004) (\u201cThe requirements to meet the section 2056(b)(5) exception to the non-deductibility of terminable interests are rigorous ... [W]here the rules are often extremely technical and the stakes may be high, it is not surprising that advisers seek to minimize risks of disqualification. Using a marital deduction savings clause is one way to minimize such risks.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">\n<em>Apportionment of Obligation to Pay Taxes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">While the amount of federal estate tax is determined by federal law, the allocation of responsibility for paying that tax is determined by state law. <em>Riggs v. Del Drago, </em>317 U.S. 95, 97-98, 63 S.Ct. 109, 87 L.Ed. 106 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">In Maryland, the tax liability of an estate is generally apportioned among the interested parties under the apportionment statute. Maryland Code, Tax-General Article (\u201cTG\u201d), \u00a7 7-308. By default, that apportionment is made \u201cin the proportion that the value of the interest of each person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>interested in the estate bears to the total value of the interests of all the persons interested in the [taxable] estate.\u201d TG \u00a7 7-308(b)(1). Stated differently, if a person has a 45% interest in the taxable estate, then that person must pay 45% of the estate tax due. Therefore, under the apportionment statute, a surviving spouse who receives property that qualifies for the marital deduction would not pay estate taxes based on the property covered by the marital deduction because that share is not part of the taxable estate. <em>See </em>TG \u00a7 7 \u2014 308(e)(1) (in apportioning liability for federal estate tax, allowance is to be made for any exemptions or deductions). Similarly, under the apportionment statute, responsibility for paying those taxes would not be allocated to a QTIP trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">\n<em>Opting Out of AppoHiomnent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">A testator, however, may customize how the estate taxes are paid, as is evident by the fact that the testator may, in the will, opt out of the general apportionment scheme.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> TG \u00a7 7-308(k); <em>Pfeufer v. Cyphers, </em>397 Md. 643, 655, 919 A.2d 641 (2007) (\u201cthe intent of the testator, as ascertained from the language of the will, controls the source of the funds to be used to pay inheritance taxes so long as there is no conflict with the applicable statute, other law or public policy.\u201d); <em>see also Johnson v.

A testator may specify the portion of the estate\u2019s assets from which estate taxes are to be paid even when that customization may result in taxes being paid from a portion of the estate that would otherwise qualify for a deduction in the computation of the tax. <em>See Pfeufer, </em>397 Md. at 660, 919 A.2d 641; <em>accord Second Nat\u2019l Bank of New Haven v.

When interpreting a will, a court must ascertain and effectuate the testator\u2019s expressed intent, as gathered from an examination of the will and codicils as a whole, as if they were one complete document. <em>Id.; McIntyre v. Byrne, </em>217 Md. 71, 77, 141 A.2d 692 (1958) (\u201c[t]he primary object in construing a will is to ascertain the intention of the testator from the whole instrument\u201d); <em>Associated Professors of Loyola College of City of Baltimore v. Dugan, </em>137 Md. 545, 113 A. 81 (1921). In general, we interpret a will so as to harmonize its provisions and avoid conflicts, such that the interpretation gives effect to each provision wherever possible. <em>McIntyre, </em>217 Md. at 77, 141 A.2d 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">Resolution of this case thus begins with the text of the will and codicils. As the Majority opinion sets forth, the will provides that a portion of the estate is \u201cset apart\u201d (the \u201cMarital Share\u201d) before the payment of taxes to fund a Marital Trust. Majority op. at 589-93, 144 A.3d at 810-12 (Item Third, Item Sixth (A)). The will then provides that, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>the Marital Share is set apart, estate and related taxes are to be paid out of the residuary estate, subject to limitations not relevant here. <em>Id. </em>(Item Third). There appears to be no dispute among the parties that, in directing how estate taxes are to be paid, Mr. Clancy opted out of the apportionment statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The will then provides that \u201cone-half of the remainder of my residuary estate shall be paid over and distributed to my trustee as [the Family Trust]\u201d and \u201cthe other one-half of the remainder of my residuary estate shall be\u201d paid over and distributed to the trustee as the Older Children\u2019s Trusts. <em>Id. </em>(Item Sixth (B), (C)). Unlike the provision concerning the part of the estate (the Marital Share) used to fund the Marital Trust, the parts of the estate used to fund the Family Trust and the Older Children\u2019s Trusts are not to be \u201cset apart\u201d before the payment of taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The will also contained a Savings Clause to ensure that the Marital Share would qualify for the marital deduction when estate taxes are computed. It explicitly limited the Personal Representative\u2019s or trustees\u2019 authority to do anything that would prevent the estate \u201cfrom receiving the benefit of the marital deduction as hereinbefore set forth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Item Twel-veth (D)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The Second Codicil<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> amended the will in several respects to allow the Family Trust to qualify for the marital deduction when estate taxes are computed. For example, that codicil eliminated a provision of the will that terminated Mrs. Clan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>cy\u2019s interest if she remarried and also eliminated a provision of the will that allowed the trustee discretion to use the funds in the Family Trust for the benefit of the minor child during Mrs. Clancy\u2019s lifetime. <em>See </em>Majority op. at 593-95, 144 A.3d at 593-95 (amendments of Item Eighth). Consistent with those amendments, the Second Codicil also amended the Savings Clause to ensure that the Family Trust, like the Marital Share, would qualify for the deduction when taxes are computed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, with respect to the <em>payment </em>of taxes, the Second Codicil did <em>not </em>amend Item Third to provide that the Family Trust was to be set apart before the payment of taxes. Thus, the plain meaning of the text of the will, as amended by the Second Codicil, requires that the Marital Share and the funds intended for the Family Trust both qualify for the marital deduction when taxes are computed; however, the Marital Share is \u201cset apart\u201d from the funds used to pay those taxes while the one-half of the residuary estate used to fund the Family Trust is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">\n<em>Reconciling the Will and Second Codicil</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">In short, the will provides that the Family Trust and the Older Children\u2019s Trusts receive equal shares of the residual of the estate after payment of taxes. The Second Codicil provides that the estate should receive the benefit of the marital deduction with respect to both the Marital Share and the Family Trust in the computation of estate tax liability. If these two provisions can be reconciled, then ordinary principles of will construction require that we read them to be consistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>As an initial matter, we ought to expect that these two provisions can be reconciled. While the operative language in the amended Savings Clause comes from the Second Codicil, the original will contained nearly identical language. Here, there is no evidence of a textual conflict. All that the Savings Clause requires \u2014 both before and after its amendment by the Second Codicil \u2014 is that the estate \u201creceiv[e] the benefit of the marital deduction as hereinbefore set forth.\u201d In order to receive the benefit of the marital deduction, the estate\u2019s personal representative must file the appropriate form so as to qualify for QTIP treatment the property in which Mrs. Clancy will have a terminable interest \u2014 as relevant here, the Family Trust \u2014 and not exercise the various discretionary powers authorized under the will <em>(e.g., </em>Item Thirteenth) in a way that would undermine that election. Thus, the Savings Clause can be read to require merely that the Personal Representative fill out the appropriate form and abide by the other changes to the Family Trust to qualify the Family Trust for QTIP treatment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Doing so in no way conflicts with paying the taxes out of the residual before the Family Trust and Older Children\u2019s Trusts are funded and thereby maintaining the equal distributions specified in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">\n<em>The Majority Opinion\u2019s Approach</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ATe\">In adopting Mrs. Clancy\u2019s preferred interpretation the Majority opinion finds an \u201capparent conflict\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and resolves it by holding that the Second Codicil \u201ctrumps\u201d the specific directions in the will (in Item Third) concerning the payment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>taxes, even though the Second Codicil made no change to those directions. Majority op. at 599-600, 144 A.3d at 815-16. In my view, the Majority opinion is mistaken and there is no need to resort to such radical surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">The reasoning of the Majority opinion appears to be that the Savings Clause, by itself, mandates that the residual estate be distributed so as to obtain the <em>maximum </em>marital deduction with respect to the Family Trust, despite the fact that Item Third prescribes such treatment only for the Marital Share. This entails \u201csetting apart\u201d one-half of the residual destined for the Family Trust <em>before </em>the payment of taxes, with the result that the half of the residual devoted to the Older Children\u2019s Trusts absorbs all of the responsibility for payment of taxes. Thus, an amendment of the will that on its face affected only the <em>computation </em>of taxes is being construed to alter the directions in the will for the <em>payment </em>of taxes and radically changes the relative distributions to the beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In essence, the Majority opinion, without explanation, reads the Second Codicil as expressing Mr. Clancy\u2019s intent that the distribution of his estate maximize the marital deduction at all costs. There is simply no basis for this interpretation. The Second Codicil provides that the estate must receive \u201cthe benefit of the marital deduction as hereinbefore set forth,\u201d not \u201cthe benefit of the <em>maximum </em>marital deduction,\u201d so the text provides no support to the Majority opinion\u2019s reading. As justification for its interpretation, the Majority opinion relies on a case in which the \"will specifically provided that it was to preserve \u201cthe <em>maximum </em>marital deduction.\u201d <em>See </em>Majority op. at 599-600, 144 A.3d at 816 citing <em>Northeastern Pennsylvania Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. U.S., </em>360 F.Supp. 116, 117 (M.D.Pa.1973) (\u201cThe direction to obtain the <em>maximum </em>marital deduction is the clearest and the predominant evidence of Rodgers\u2019 intent.\u201d) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> By contrast, the Savings Clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>of the Second Codicil in this case does not specify that the estate should receive the <em>maximum </em>possible marital deduction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The Majority opinion also reasons that, if taxes are paid out of any part of the residual estate before the Family Trust is funded, estate tax will be paid on funds that might otherwise have become part of the Family Trust and would have had the benefit of the marital deduction. Majority op. at 601-02, 144 A.3d at 816-17. But that appears likely to happen any time a testator opts out of the apportionment statute and elects to allocate the payment of some part of the tax to assets that could otherwise fund a distribution that would qualify for the marital deduction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is telling that the testator here referred to the Marital Share being \u201cset apart\u201d before the payment of taxes, but did not use that language in relation to the funds intended for the Family Trust \u2014 nor amend Item Sixth in that respect as part of the Second Codicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Mrs. Clancy\u2019s interpretation \u2014 adopted by the Majority opinion \u2014 would skew the distribution of the residual estate significantly in her favor contrary to basic provisions of the will while reducing the estate\u2019s tax liability somewhat more than what it would otherwise be. It does so by interpreting the Savings Clause to effect a radical change in the estate plan without any explicit direction to do so. The Personal Representative\u2019s construction of the will and codicil would treat the Savings Clause for what it is \u2014 a savings clause \u2014 and maintain the equal distribution of the residual specified in the will, both originally and as amended, while achieving the significantly reduced tax liability that is the evident aim of the Second Codicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Even assuming that the Second Codicil <em>could </em>mean what the Majority opinion reads it to mean \u2014 which is far from clear \u2014 we ordinarily resolve textual ambiguities in favor of consistency, not inconsistency. Where there are two possible interpretations of a provision of a codicil, one which conflicts with the original will and one which does not, our precedents favor adoption of the interpretation that does not conflict. Thus, even if the Second Codicil were ambiguous, it ought to be interpreted to be consistent with the original will rather than to contradict it.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Chief Judge Barbera and Judge Greene have advised that they join this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\">. The interpretation that the Majority opinion ascribes to the Older Children is the construction placed on the will and the codicil by Mr. Clancy's Personal Representative. The Older Children also defend that interpretation of the will and the codicil.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b636-11\">. There can be other adjustments, but they are not relevant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b636-12\">. A testator may have various reasons for passing a terminable interest in a trust to a spouse. For example, the testator may want to require that someone other than the spouse administer the assets in the trust so that the spouse receives the income from the assets but cannot deplete those assets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b637-10\">. In this context, the term \u201cusufruct interest\u201d refers to a right to use the fruits or profits of the income resulting from the trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\">. This distinction between the computation of a tax and the payment of that tax is not unique. For example, one who receives the proceeds of a Roth IRA excludes those funds from the calculation of his or her income tax liability, but may well pay that liability with those funds. In the circumstance of the marital deduction, computation and payment of taxes are intertwined to the extent that funds used to pay estate taxes are not counted as part of the deduction. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(4)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b640-7\">. The Orphans' Court decision in this case discoursed at some length on whether the apportionment statute applied before accepting the proposition that the apportionment statute did not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\">. Specifically, it provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">[N]either my personal representative nor my trustee shall have or exercise any authority, power, or discretion over the Marital Share, nor shall any payment or distribution by my personal representative or my trustee be limited or restricted by any provision of this Will that would in any way prevent my estate from receiving the benefit of the marital deduction as hereinbefore set forth.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b640-10\">. There were two codicils to the will. The First Codicil is not at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\">. That portion of the Second Codicil provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">[NJeither my personal representative nor my trustee shall have or exercise any authority, power or discretion over the Marital Share or the Non-Exempt Family Residuary Trust or the income thereof, or the property constituting the Marital Share or the Non-Exempt Family Residuary Trust, nor shall any payment or distribution by my personal representative or my trustee be limited or restricted by any provision of this Will, such that, in any such event, my estate would be prevented from receiving the benefit of the marital deduction as hereinbefore set forth.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b642-6\">. The Majority opinion appears to acknowledge this. <em>See </em>Majority op. at 598, 144 A.3d at 815 (\"The Older Children and Mrs. Clancy, as well as the personal representative, all agree that the Second Codicil qualified the Family Trust for the QTIP election\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b642-7\">. At least, the Majority opinion sometimes appears to do so. On the other hand, the Majority opinion also states, \"The Second Codicil did not, however, specifically address, in any way, the Will provision that instructed that taxes were to be paid out of the residuary estate of which the Family Trust was a part.\u201d Majority op. at 599, 144 A.3d at 815. But if that were true, then there would be no conflict, and that provision of the original will concerning payment of taxes from the residual after the Marital Share is set aside should remain operative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b643-6\">. The Majority opinion also cites an IRS revenue ruling that is similarly distinguishable from this case. <em>See </em>Majority op. at 600-01, 144 A.3d at 816-17 (citing Rev. Rul. 75-440 (1975)). That ruling concerned a will that directed the creation of a trust in an amount equal to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>\"maximum marital deduction\u201d and gave further detailed directions as to the computation of that amount to ensure that the maximum amount was transferred to the trust. Consistent with those provisions, a savings clause in the will limited any action by the testator's Fiduciary that would \"lose all or any part of the tax benefit afforded my estate by the Marital Deduction.\u201d By contrast, the Savings Clause in Mr. Clancy's will does not contain language concerning the maximum marital deduction or the loss of \"any part\u201d of the marital deduction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\">. It is true, as the Majority opinion observes (Majority op. at 582-84, 144 A.3d at 805-06) that federal law has been amended over the years to remove a statutory cap on the maximum marital deduction. Of course, that does not mean there is no longer a \"maximum\u201d deduction for particular circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b644-8\">. For example, in <em>Estate of Fine v. Commissioner, </em>90 T.C. 1068 (1988), the will directed the payment of taxes out of the residual estate \"without apportionment\u201d and then provided for distribution of the remainder of the residual in specific shares to the testator's widow and other relatives. A savings clause limited the authority of the executor to do anything that would \"lose all or any part of the tax benefit afforded by the marital deduction.\u201d The Tax Court construed the will to provide for payment of taxes out of funds that could otherwise have funded the widow\u2019s share and therefore would have qualified for the marital deduction. The court also noted that the testator contemplated such a result in opting out of the state apportionment statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
