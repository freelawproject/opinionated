Code (1981, 2014 Repl. Vol., 2015 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 14-410 of the Health Occupations Article (\u201cHO\u201d) bars the admission of a Board of Physicians\u2019 consent order as evidence in a civil or criminal proceeding. Brenda Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d) filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim seeking compensation benefits from Delaware North Companies and its insurer (collectively \u201cDelaware North\u201d) for a full knee replacement. At issue was whether the injury Smith sustained at work caused her to need knee replacement surgery. During a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Smith presented the expert testimony of Dr. Kevin McGovern. To impeach Dr. McGovern\u2019s credibility, Delaware North sought to admit a consent order that Dr. McGovern entered into with the Maryland Board of Physicians (\u201cthe Board\u201d). Over a timely objection, the trial court admitted into evidence a portion of that consent order. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>conclude it was legal error to do so. HO \u00a7 14-410 serves generally as a statutory bar to the admission of a Board of Physicians\u2019 consent order into evidence in a civil or criminal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">On September 7, 2012, Smith slipped on the floor in the course of her employment as a cook at Camden Yards. She landed on her left knee when she fell. A few weeks after the fall, Smith sought medical attention from Dr. Thomas Whitten. An MRI of her left knee revealed that she had torn the posterior horn of the medial meniscus<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that she had medial<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> compartment arthritis. Smith initially sought conservative treatment from Dr. Whitten in the form of cortisone shots. Dr. Whitten also recommended that Smith undergo an arthroscopic procedure. After Dr. Whitten\u2019s retirement, Smith transferred her care to Dr. Kenneth Tepper. Dr. Tepper recommended that Smith undergo unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Next, Smith visited Dr. Mark Cohen at Maryland Orthropedics, P.A. on November 11, 2013. Dr. McGovern, another practitioner at Maryland Orthropedics, P.A. saw Smith on February 18, 2014. Both Dr. Cohen and Dr. McGovern recommended Smith undergo a full left knee replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">On January 28, 2014, Smith filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim requesting an authorization for a total left knee replacement. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission denied her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>claim after it held a hearing on April 4, 2014. Smith filed a petition for judicial review of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission\u2019s denial of her claim in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and requested a jury trial. On November 24, 2014, Smith filed a \u201cMotion <em>In Limine </em>to Exclude Certain Testimony from Kevin McGovern, M.D.\u201d to prevent Delaware North from raising questions at trial about any professional disciplinary action taken against Dr. McGovern.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Smith also sought to exclude portions of Dr. McGovern\u2019s <em>de bene esse </em>deposition where defense counsel inquired into the disciplinary charges against Dr. McGovern.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She argued in her motion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>HO \u00a7 14-410 \u201cexpressly prohibits the introduction of such evidence in any collateral proceeding such as an appeal from a workers\u2019 compensation commission claim.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>On December 11, 2014, a jury trial was held in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to answer the question of whether Smith\u2019s knee replacement surgery was causally related to the accidental injury she suffered on September 7, 2012. Prior to jury selection, the trial judge heard the parties\u2019 arguments regarding Smith\u2019s \u201cMotion <em>In Limine </em>to Exclude Certain Testimony from Kevin McGovern, M.D.\u201d Smith argued that the admission of the consent order would violate HO \u00a7 14-410(a). The trial judge disagreed and stated, \u201cI do agree with [djefense counsel that the stating (sic) of the consent order in effect is a stipulation of the parties that it\u2019s okay to be used.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She explained, \u201cit\u2019s an exception to the medical review committee privilege<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as we\u2019re referring to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Once the trial judge determined that the consent order was admissible, she provided Smith with an opportunity to argue whether the admission of the consent order was \u201cmore substantially prejudicial than probative of the issue of whether Dr. McGovern is telling us facts that are relevant to Ms. Smith\u2019s case.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Smith noted that even though Dr. McGovern was on probation pursuant to the consent order, his license to practice medicine was still in good standing and that Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>McGovern was still qualified to treat patients and offer expert testimony. Smith then argued that questioning on the disciplinary action would confuse and mislead the jury about the merits of the case, which involved the narrow issue of whether Smith\u2019s workplace injury caused her need for knee replacement surgery. Therefore, Smith contended that the probative value of the consent order and disciplinary action was substantially outweighed by their prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The trial judge ruled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">[i]t appears to this [cjourt that the probative value of going into the disciplinary action against Dr. McGovern is outweighed by the prejudicial effect of the possible confusion of the jury. However, there\u2019s no question in my mind that the question about the status of his license, that should be asked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">Now, how far that question is allowed to go will depend on the answers Dr. McGovern gives. If I understand from the written submissions, Dr. McGovern\u2019s license is authorized only in the case that he obey the terms of the consent order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4O\">Thus, the trial judge granted, in part, Smith\u2019s \u201cMotion <em>In Limine </em>to Exclude Certain Testimony from Kevin McGovern, M.D.\u201d and excluded the portions of Dr. McGovern\u2019s <em>de bene esse </em>deposition that referenced the disciplinary charges against him. She, however, allowed \u201cthe Defense to introduce the consent order showing that there are restrictions on [Dr. McGovern\u2019s] license.\u201d In response, Smith asked that the admission of the consent order \u201cbe limited to the conclusions of law and the order that sets forth the conditions in [Dr. McGovern\u2019s] probation\u201d rather than the whole consent order which details the facts of each disciplinary charge against Dr. McGovern. The trial judge agreed with Smith and limited the submission of the consent order to the last six pages, excluding the first seventeen pages of the order. The last six pages of the consent order begin with the Board\u2019s \u201cConclusions of Law,\u201d which state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Board concludes as a matter of law that [Dr. McGovern\u2019s] actions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>inactions, as set forth above, constitute a failure to meet the appropriate standards for the delivery of quality medical care, in violation of H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a)(22); and a failure to keep adequate medical records, in violation of H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a)(40). The charges under H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a)(23), of willfully submitting false statements to collect fees for which services are not provided, and H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a)(19), of grossly overutilizing health care services, are dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APT\">These pages of the consent order also set forth the conditions of Dr. McGovern\u2019s two year probation<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and disclosed that the consent order \u201cis considered a PUBLIC DOCUMENT^]\u201d The page that contains Dr. McGovern\u2019s signature is entitled, \u201cCONSENT\u201d and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">I, Kevin McGovern, M.D., acknowledge that I am represented by counsel and have consulted with counsel before entering into this Consent Order. By this Consent and for the purpose of resolving the issues raised by the Board, I agree and accept to be bound by the foregoing Consent Order and its conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">I acknowledge the validity of this Consent Order as if entered into after the conclusion of a formal evidentiary hearing in which I would have had the right to counsel, to confront witnesses, to give testimony, to call witnesses on my own behalf, and to all other substantive and procedural protections provided by law. I agree to forego my opportunity to challenge these allegations. I acknowledge the legal authority and jurisdiction of the Board to initiate these proceedings and to issue and enforce this Consent Order. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>affirm that I am waiving my right to appeal any adverse ruling of the Board that I might have filed after any such hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">I sign this Consent Order after having an opportunity to consult with counsel, voluntarily and without reservation, and I fully understand and comprehend the language, meaning and terms of the Consent Order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">After the court addressed the parties\u2019 motions, a jury was selected and trial began. Smith was the first witness to testify. She testified on her own behalf as to the injuries she suffered and the recommendations of her doctors. Next, Smith presented expert witness testimony by playing a redacted version of Dr. McGovern\u2019s video deposition for the jury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Dr. McGovern testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: Now, you said you reviewed Dr. Cohen\u2019s notes prior to your examination of Ms. Smith; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">[Dr. McGovern]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: Did you also look at his impression and his diagnosis of what her injury was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">[Dr. McGovern]: Of course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-11\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: And what was his diagnosis of her injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-12\">[Dr. McGovern]: Aggravation of pre-existing medial compartment arthritis of her left knee related to the injury of September 7th, 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-13\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: And what were the \u2014 what was shown by the x-rays?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-14\">[Dr. McGovern]: That she had degenerative arthritis, severe in her left knee and moderate in her right knee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>[Plaintiffs Counsel]: And what were the results of the\u2014 when you reviewed the MRI, what were the results of Ms. Smith\u2019s MRI?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">[Dr. McGovern]: Again, it showed degenerative changes and it showed a tear of her medial meniscus in her left knee .... The menisci, the medial and lateral meniscus, the medial is on the inner part of the joint, the lateral is on the outer part of the joint. The medial part is the part of your knee that would touch your other knee if you put your knees together .... In this case[,] there\u2019s a tear in the back portion of the meniscus, the posterior horn of the meniscus, which is the most common place for menisci to tear when they tear. The medial is the most common place for it to tear. The lateral meniscus on the outside of the knee doesn\u2019t tear nearly as frequently as does the one on the inner aspect of the knee. And most meniscal tears are caused by some sort of twisting injury to the knee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: And Ms. Brenda Smith, she would\u2014 had both of those positive showings on the MRI as far as her left knee is concerned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">[Dr. McGovern]: It showed that she had a tear of the posterior horn of her medial meniscus as well as arthritis in her knee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: And as far as the arthritis is concerned, the MRI classified that as \u2014 how did the MRI classify that arthritis in the findings? Would it be correct to say that they said mild degenerative arthritic changes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">[Dr. McGovern]: Well, it says in the lateral meniscus\u2014 meniscus it shows mild degenerative change without definite tear. And then in the medial meniscus it shows mild degeneration of the meniscus. That is a little bit different than the arthritis itself. Again that\u2019s what they\u2019re talking about in the menisci being mildly degenerated. We know from the x-ray that she has fairly significant arthritis in her knee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: Can someone have arthritis and not need a knee replacement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>[Dr. McGovern]: Oh absolutely. You\u2019re looking at one right now, I have arthritis in one of my knees and I don\u2019t need a knee replacement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: And can arthritis in someone\u2019s knee, can that be aggravated by a trauma?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">[Dr. McGovern]: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: And can you just explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury how a trauma could aggravate pre-existing arthritis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">[Dr. McGovern]: Well, in a simplistic way, it\u2019s possible that that could just be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. At some point something happens that makes a joint become painful and symptomatic. In this particular case the mostly (sic) likely scenario is that she had arthritis in her knee. She had mild degeneration of her menisci, but when she had the fall she ended up tearing her medial meniscus [as] the result of the fall. That tear then aggravates and inflames the joint and causes the knee to become symptomatic, the arthritis to become symptomatic. In a young healthy person with no arthritis you could go in there with the arthroscope and repair or remove the damaged meniscus, and the symptoms would go away. But unfortunately once the knee is arthritic, such as this one, then taking care of the meniscus, fixing it or removing it doesn\u2019t solve the problem. Because the arthritis, once it becomes inflamed and symptomatic, stays symptomatic. So she would need something more significant than an arthroscopy for a torn meniscus, she would need a knee replacement to make her symptoms go away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: And what is your diagnosis as to after, you know, reviewing the history, reviewing the MRIs, looking at your notes, Dr. Cohen\u2019s notes, the x-rays, what is\" your diagnosis of what the cause of her current condition is and what\u2019s the cause of the need for the left knee replacement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">[Dr. McGovern]: Well, it\u2019s my belief that she had arthritis in her knee that wasn\u2019t symptomatic before this injury. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>this injury caused her to tear her medial meniscus which caused an aggravation of her arthritis and has caused her to remain symptomatic as a result of that. The only solution for her problem as a result of this injury of September 7th, 2012 now is to have the knee replacement. Nothing less than that will work. She\u2019s already had conservative treatment. She\u2019s had Cortisone shots and gel injections into her knee of lubricants, called viscosupplementation, none of which have solved her problem and none of which probably would. And at this point a knee replacement is the only thing that would resolve her symptoms she now has as a result of her injury of September 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: And that opinion is \u2014 diagnosis is based within a reasonable degree of medical probability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">[Dr. McGovern]: Yes or I would haven\u2019t (sic) said it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALv\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: Did you have the opportunity to review a letter from Dr. Cohen dated January 21st, 2014?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">[Dr. McGovern]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: In that letter did Dr. Cohen detail his opinion of Ms. Smith\u2019s left knee condition in that letter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXT\">[Dr. McGovern]: It did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: And what was his opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-10\">[Dr. McGovern]: The same as mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-11\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: Now, Ms. Smith was also diagnosed or I should say seen by a Dr. Becker; are you familiar with Dr. Becker?<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-12\">[Dr. McGovern]: I know who Dr. Becker is, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-13\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: And have you had a chance to look at his report and his addendum to his report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-14\">[Dr. McGovern]: I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-15\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: And what is your understanding of Dr. Becker\u2019s role in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>[Dr. McGovern]: He performed an independent medical evaluation for the defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: And in reviewing his report is there anything significant that you disagree with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">[Plaintiffs Counsel]: I think we disagree on the fact that she needs a knee replacement as a result of her injury. We agree that she has arthritis that was aggravated by the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">On cross-examination, defense counsel asked, \u201ccan you state to a reasonable degree of professional certainty whether or not Ms. Smith would have needed a knee replacement even if she hadn\u2019t slipped at work?\u201d Dr. McGovern responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">No, I can\u2019t say a hundred percent whether she would or wouldn\u2019t have. Again, she wasn\u2019t symptomatic before this injury. There\u2019s no way of knowing at what point she would or wouldn\u2019t become symptomatic in the future. There\u2019s a possibility she would have needed a knee replacement in the future with or without this injury, but I can\u2019t say when it would be or for sure it would be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">After Dr. McGovern\u2019s deposition was played, the trial judge admitted into evidence Dr. McGovern\u2019s curriculum vitae. The defense presented the testimony of its expert witness, Dr. Larry Becker, via video deposition. Next, the court admitted into evidence Dr. Becker\u2019s curriculum vitae and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission\u2019s Order resulting from the administrative proceeding. The trial judge also granted, over Smith\u2019s objection, defense counsel\u2019s request to move into evidence the last six pages of the Board\u2019s consent order against Dr. McGovern.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">The parties rested and the trial judge gave the jury a series of instructions on the law. After the jury instructions were given, the parties gave closing arguments. Defense counsel repeatedly mentioned the consent order in his closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">Bringing up this whole aggravation argument is what\u2019s meant to confuse you, because they have to come up with something different than their expert .... [Smith\u2019s Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>sel] would indicate that there\u2019s a piece of evidence [the consent order] that you\u2019ll review in conjunction with their expert from Dr. McGovern. Please read that document and decide whether you believe anything that individual told you today, because when he was asked about his medical license, he said everything was just fine. He wasn\u2019t truthful. He\u2019s on probation currently for ethical problems involved in workers\u2019 compensation claims and he\u2019s who they hired .... Dr. McGovern\u2019s disciplinary action, being on probation, I mean, look at the f\u00edne that was levied against him for unethical practices in workers\u2019 compensation claims, but yet you should believe him? His entire testimony should be disregarded .... Was Dr. McGovern\u2019s testimony consistent? Nope. The consent order shows the inconsistencies in his testimony about the status of his medical license. Whether the witness\u2019 testimony was contradicted by evidence. Once again, the order that you\u2019re going to read from the Maryland Board of Physicians completely contradicts and puts into question his truthfulness, his honesty, his integrity, his ethics. And they want you to believe this gentleman .... But just think in your own mind, would you or would you (sic) have a loved one go to a doctor for treatment that\u2019s been disciplined by the Maryland Board of Physicians, that\u2019s on probation for ethical problems, would you ever in your wildest dreams send your loved one to that provider? But yet they want you to rely upon him in this claim. It\u2019s insulting to this entire system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">And for that reason I would ask on behalf of my client that you affirm the decision of the Commission, [and] check the box \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">During rebuttal, Smith\u2019s counsel attempted to respond to the statements made by defense counsel during his closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">Now, I realize that defense counsel has submitted into evidence a disciplinary action against Dr. McGovern and it\u2019s \u2014 he is on probation .... So you think to yourself, you say, all right, Dr. McGovern got disciplined, he must have done something wrong, he is on probation. Well, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>people are on probation, when they are being disciplined .... You make sure you tow the line, you make sure you don\u2019t get in trouble, because if you do, you\u2019re going to have to \u2014 have the consequences, and Dr. McGovern is in that exact situation right now. So he\u2019s not making any mistakes. He\u2019s following the book, he\u2019s following the rules, because he is on probation and that\u2019s something to take into consideration when you weigh his credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">After jury deliberations, the jury returned and responded \u201cno\u201d to the question: \u201c \u2018Is Brenda Smith\u2019s knee replacement surgery causally related to the accidental injury suffered on September 7, 2012,\u2019 yes or no?\u201d Based on this jury verdict, the trial judge affirmed the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">On December 23, 2014, Smith filed a \u201cMotion for a New Trial.\u201d Initially, on April 1, 2015, another trial judge granted Smith\u2019s \u201cMotion for a New Trial\u201d but subsequently denied Smith\u2019s motion in an \u201cOrder Correcting and Replacing the Court\u2019s Prior Order\u201d on June 24, 2015. The court explained that HO \u00a7 14-410(a) \u201conly applies to civil trials involving tort actions for medical malpractice and thus is inapplicable to this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Smith noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals on July 9, 2015. Pending the appeal and prior to any proceedings in that court, we granted <em>certiorari, Smith v. Delaware North Companies, </em>446 Md. 290, 132 A.3d 193 (2016), to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">1. Does the privilege set forth under \u00a7 14-410 of the Health Occupations Article (\u201cH.O.\u201d) bar the admission of evidence of a Board of Physicians [cjonsent [ojrder to impeach a physician who is offering testimony as an expert witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-9\">2. Was the privilege set forth under \u00a7 14-410 intended to be strictly limited to medical malpractice actions?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">For the reasons stated below, we shall answer the first question in the affirmative and the second question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The issues before this Court arise out of the trial court\u2019s admission as evidence at trial of the consent order and its subsequent denial of Smith\u2019s motion for new trial. The trial court based both of these rulings on its interpretation of HO \u00a7 14-410. Questions of statutory interpretation are purely legal inquires, which we review <em>de novo. Reier v. State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>397 Md. 2, 26, 915 A.2d 970, 984 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to give effect to the legislative purpose or policy.\u201d <em>State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation v. Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>348 Md. 2, 13, 702 A.2d 690, 696 (1997). In ascertaining legislative intent, \u201cwe look first to the language of the statute, giving it its natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Scriber v.

The parties, however, offer competing interpretations of this statute. HO \u00a7 14-410 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">(a) Except by the express stipulation and consent of all parties to a proceeding before the Board, a disciplinary panel, or any of its other investigatory bodies, in a civil or criminal action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">(1) The proceedings, records, or files of the Board, a disciplinary panel, or any of its other investigatory bodies are not discoverable and are not admissible in evidence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">(2) Any order passed by the Board or disciplinary panel is not admissible in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">(b) This section does not apply to a civil action brought by a party to a proceeding before the Board or a disciplinary panel who claims to be aggrieved by the decision of the Board or the disciplinary panel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">The Statutory Privilege Pursuant to HO \u00a7 14-410</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">Smith argues that HO \u00a7 14-410(a) creates what she calls \u201cthe board proceedings privilege.\u201d The language of HO \u00a7 14-410 is clear and unambiguous. As Smith argues, the plain language of HO \u00a7 14-410(a) prevents the admission or discovery of, \u201cin a civil or criminal action!,] ... [t]he proceedings, records, or files of the Board, a disciplinary panel, or any of its other investigatory bodies\u201d and the discovery of \u201c[a]ny order passed by the Board or disciplinary panel.\u201d Smith is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>correct in her assertion that HO \u00a7 14-410 provides only two exceptions to this privilege. Pursuant to HO \u00a7 14-410(a): \u201cThe proceedings, records, or files of the Board, a disciplinary panel, or any of its other investigatory bodies\u201d and the discovery of \u201c[a]ny order passed by the Board or disciplinary panel\u201d may be used \u201cin a civil or criminal action\u201d if all parties to the Board proceeding or disciplinary panel <em>expressly stipulate and consent to its use. </em>HO \u00a7 14-410(b) provides a second exception: these privileged materials may also be used in \u201ca civil action brought by a party to a proceeding before the Board or a disciplinary panel who claims to be aggrieved by the decision of the Board or the disciplinary panel.\u201d The trial court\u2019s determination that \u201cthe [signing] of the consent order in effect is a stipulation of the parties that it\u2019s okay to be used\u201d does not fall under either statutory exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Both Dr. McGovern and the Board signed the consent order and these signatures indicate the parties\u2019 agreement to the terms of the order. As the consent order notes, by agreeing to the terms of the order, a physician acknowledges that he freely agrees to be bound by the terms of the consent order and is aware that he waives certain rights by settling the charges against him without an evidentiary hearing. Nowhere on the page entitled \u201cCONSENT\u201d or anywhere else in the consent order does it state that agreeing to the terms of the consent order also indicates consent to its admissibility or discoverability \u201cin a civil or criminal action.\u201d HO \u00a7 14-410. The plain language of HO \u00a7 14-410 requires \u201cthe express stipulation and consent of all parties to a proceeding\u201d before any \u201cproceedings, records or files of the Board\u201d or \u201c[a]ny order passed by the Board or disciplinary panel\u201d can be admitted \u201cin a civil or criminal action.\u201d It is clear that Dr. McGovern\u2019s signature on the \u201cCONSENT\u201d page does not rise to the level of an \u201cexpress stipulation and consent\u201d to anything other than agreement to be bound by the terms of the consent order. Thus, we conclude that the trial judge erred in ruling that the signing of the consent order constituted an exception to the privilege provided under HO \u00a7 14-410.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>As noted above, there are only two exceptions to the privilege set forth under HO \u00a7 14-410. Contrary to Delaware North\u2019s characterization of the consent order as permissible impeachment evidence, HO \u00a7 14-410 does not contain an exception for the use of \u201cproceedings, records or files of the Board\u201d or \u201c[a]ny order passed by the Board or disciplinary panel\u201d to be used to impeach the credibility of a witness. To read in an impeachment exception would impermissibly \u201creflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute\u201d and \u201cconstrue the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that ... extend its application.\u201d <em>Kushell v. Dep't of Nat. Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 576-77, 870 A.2d 186, 193 (2005) (quoting <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003)). Therefore, we hold that the plain language of HO \u00a7 14-410 bars the admission of the consent order to impeach the credibility of a physician who is offering testimony as an expert witness.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The Public Nature of the Consent Order</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Delaware North\u2019s contention that the consent order\u2019s classification as a public document removes it from the ambit of HO \u00a7 14-410 is also without merit. As previously discussed, HO \u00a7 14-410 provides two statutory exceptions. Neither of these exceptions allows parties to a disciplinary proceeding of the Board to waive the protections provided under HO \u00a7 14-410 by signing a document containing a public document disclosure. Although HO \u00a7 14-410(a) allows privileged materials to be used if all parties to the Board proceeding or disciplinary panel expressly stipulate and consent to <em>its use, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>contrary to Delaware North\u2019s belief, agreeing that a consent order is a public document does not amount to an express stipulation and consent as to the order\u2019s <em>use </em>at trial. To adopt Delaware North\u2019s view would invite a \u201cforced or subtle interpretation\u201d of the exception provided in HO \u00a7 14-410(a). <em>Fangman v. Genuine Title, LLC, </em>447 Md. 681, 691, 136 A.3d 772, 778 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London v. Cohen, </em>the Fourth Circuit addressed the same argument that Delaware North puts forth: agreeing to enter into a consent order which is a public document<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> renders the order and the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>circumstances of the order admissible in a court proceeding.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>785 F.3d at 893-94. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London </em>involved a physician who had entered into a consent order with the Board. 785 F.3d at 888-89. In the consent order, the physician agreed to a three-month suspension followed by a five-year period of probation. <em>Id. </em>The consent order also contained a provision providing that the consent order \u201cshall be a public document.\u201d <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>785 F.3d at 893. The physician\u2019s disability insurer then brought suit against the physician for misrepresentations he made on his insurance application regarding the disciplinary actions he faced. The Fourth Circuit reversed the magistrate judge\u2019s decision to admit the physician\u2019s consent order at trial. It explained that based on the plain language of HO \u00a7 14-410, \u201csolely by the \u2018express stipulation and consent of all parties to a proceeding before the Board\u2019 can a Board order be admitted into evidence in a civil proceeding like this one.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">It further concluded that the fact \u201c[t]he Consent Order states on its face that it \u2018shall be a public document\u2019 under the Maryland Public Information Act\u201d does not \u201csomehow render it admissible in a judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Fourth Circuit elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">[The Maryland Public Information Act] \u201callows generally for the inspection and receipt of copies of public records.\u201d <em>Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. v. Md. Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>439 Md. 262, [268,] 96 A.3d 105, 108 (2014). Each disciplinary order is also publicly available on the Internet. <em>See </em>Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. \u00a7\u00a7 14-411.1(b)-(d)(2) (requiring the Board to \u201ccreate and maintain a public individual profile\u201d on each licensed physician, available to the public on the Internet, which includes \u201c[a] description of any disciplinary action taken by the Board ... within the most recent 10-year period\u201d and \u201cincludes a copy of the public order\u201d). But nothing in either the Public Information Act or Title 14 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the Health Occupations Article requires that public documents be admissible in judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><em>Certain Underwriters at </em>Lloyd\u2019s, <em>London, </em>785 F.3d at 893-94 (footnote omitted). This logic is similarly applicable to the case <em>sub judice. </em>\u201cThat a document is public does not remove it from the purview of the rules of evidence, or a statute explicitly governing its admissibility.\u201d <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>785 F.3d at 894. Although Delaware North does not contend that the public nature of a document removes it \u201cfrom the purview of the rules of evidence,\u201d its argument ignores the fact that HO \u00a7 14-410 explicitly governs the admissibility of Dr. McGovern\u2019s consent order. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Delaware North also argues that HO \u00a7 14-410 does not bar the admission of the consent order into evidence because HO \u00a7 14-411 permits the disclosure of a physician\u2019s general licensure information. It refers specifically to HO \u00a7 14-411(c), which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent or limit the disclosure of: (1) General licensure, certification, or registration information maintained by the Board, if the request for release complies with the criteria of \u00a7 4-333 of the General Provisions Article; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">From this, Delaware North reasons that the trial court properly admitted the redacted consent order which it claims only disclosed the general licensure status of Dr. McGovern\u2019s medical license. Smith counters that HO \u00a7 14-411(c) is irrelevant and that HO \u00a7 14-411(c) does not override HO \u00a7 14-410. Smith further asserts that Delaware North\u2019s interpretation improperly makes the term \u201cdisclosure\u201d synonymous with the term \u201cadmission.\u201d The Board\u2019s disclosure of \u201c[gjeneral licen-sure, certification, or registration information\u201d does not equate to the \u201cadmission\u201d of the consent order. We agree with Smith that the issuance of the consent order itself does not constitute \u201c[gjeneral licensure, certification, or registration information\u201d but rather, \u201cit is evidence of discipline.\u201d Delaware North\u2019s interpretation renders HO \u00a7 14-410 nugatory. Under Delaware North\u2019s interpretation, consent orders would be admissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ble into evidence even though HO \u00a7 14-410(a)(2) plainly states: <em>\u201cAny order </em>passed by the Board or disciplinary panel is not admissible in evidence.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">HO \u00a7 14-411(c)(1) provides: \u201cNothing in this section shall be construed to prevent or limit the disclosure of ... [gjeneral licensure, certification, or registration information maintained by the Board.\u201d The request for the release of the \u201c[gjeneral licensure, certification, or registration information maintained by the Board\u201d must also \u201ccompl[yj with the criteria of \u00a7 4-333 of the General Provisions Article [ (\u201cGP\u201d).]\u201d GP \u00a7 4-333 is a provision within the Maryland Public Information Act (\u201cthe MPIA\u201d). It sets forth the information a custodian of a public record may or may not disclose with regard to \u201cthe licensing of an individual in an occupation or a profession.\u201d GP \u00a7 4-333.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The ambiguity in the otherwise plain language of HO \u00a7 14-411(c) arises in the following language because it is unclear whether it governs only disclosure of records by the Board or disclosure of records by anyone who makes a proper request under the MPIA, including parties to a civil or criminal action: \u201c[njothing in this section shall be construed to prevent or limit the disclosure of ... [gjeneral licensure, certification, or registration information maintained by the Board.\u201d When language is ambiguous \u201cwe must look to other indicia to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly, including the relevant statute\u2019s legislative history, the context of the statute within the broader legislative scheme, and the relative rationality of competing constructions.\u201d <em>Twigg v. State, </em>447 Md. 1, 24, 133 A.3d 1125, 1139 (2016) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The legislative history of HO \u00a7 14-411 provides valuable insight into the legislative intent of HO \u00a7 14-411(c). The predecessor statute to HO \u00a7 14-411(c)(1) was HO \u00a7 14-510.1(c). <em>See </em>1991 Md. Laws, Chap. 55. HO \u00a7 14-510.1(c) was enacted by Chapter 237 of the Acts of 1990 via Senate Bill 138. The Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee Bill Analysis on Senate Bill 138 (1990) (\u201cBill Analysis\u201d), indicates that the bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Authorizes <em>the Board </em>to disclose certain licensing information as provided in the State Government Article, including the name, address, business telephone number, educational and occupational background, and professional qualifications of a licensee, any orders and findings resulting from formal disciplinary actions against a licensee, and any evidence of financial responsibility of a licensee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">(emphasis added). The Bill Analysis further explains that \u201c[djuring the 1989 revision of the Board\u2019s statute, a provision to permit the Board to release information in accordance with the State Government Article was inadvertently omitted.\u201d This reveals that the Legislature intended HO \u00a7 14-411(c) to apply to <em>the Board\u2019s </em>disclosure of \u201c[g]eneral licensure, certification, or registration information maintained by the board\u201d when the Board receives a request pursuant to the MPIA. HO \u00a7 14-411(c) does not, as Delaware North contends, apply to the disclosure of the items set forth in HO \u00a7 14-411(c) by parties in a civil or criminal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">That HO \u00a7 14-411(c) applies only to <em>the Board\u2019s </em>disclosure of general licensure information comports with the principles of statutory construction because it allows HO \u00a7 14-411(c) and HO \u00a7 14-410 to be \u201cconstrued together and harmonized.\u201d <em>State v. Roshchin, </em>446 Md. 128, 141, 180 A.3d 453, 461 (2016). HO \u00a7 14-411(c) allows <em>the Board </em>to disclose general licensure information in the interest of public policy. <em>See Fioretti v. Maryland State Bd. of Dental Examiners, </em>351 Md. 66, 76, 716 A.2d 258, 263 (1998) (explaining that the purpose of the MPIA is \u201cto provide the public the right to inspect the records of the State government or of a political subdivision\u201d). Disclosure by the Board pursuant to HO \u00a7 14-411 does not interfere or prevent compliance with HO \u00a7 14-410 which prohibits, with limited exceptions, the admission in any civil or criminal action, \u201c[t]he proceedings, records, or files of the Board, [or] a disciplinary panel\u201d and \u201c[a]ny order passed by the Board or disciplinary panel\u201d in the interest of \u201cencourag[ing] physicians to cooperate during Board proceedings.\u201d HO \u00a7 14-410(a); <em>Certain Undeinmiters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>785 F.3d at 894.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>The Applicability of HO \u00a7 14-410 to All Civil and Criminal Actions</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">In the Circuit Court\u2019s order denying Smith\u2019s motion for a new trial, it concluded that HO \u00a7 14-410(a) \u201conly applies to civil trials involving tort actions for medical malpractice and thus is inapplicable to this case.\u201d Similarly, Delaware North argues that the trial court properly admitted the consent order because HO \u00a7 14-410 is applicable only where the civil action arises out of matters addressed by the Board. Delaware North cites <em>Unnamed Physician v. Comm\u2019n on Med. Discipline, </em>285 Md. 1, 400 A.2d 396 (1979), where this Court analyzed the predecessor statute to HO \u00a7 1-401, Art. 43, \u00a7 134A. Delaware North claims that this Court\u2019s conclusion regarding the legislative intent of HO \u00a7 1-401 in <em>Unnamed Physician </em>offers insight into the legislative intent of HO \u00a7 14-410. In <em>Unnamed Physician, </em>the Commission on Medical Discipline<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> issued <em>subpoenas duces tecum </em>to members of a hospital review committee in the course of its investigation into the medical practices of a physician. In the context of HO \u00a7 1-401, this Court concluded that \u201cit appears probable that the words \u2018civil action\u2019 were intended to mean a tort action for medical malpractice.\u201d <em>Unnamed Physician, </em>285 Md. at 12, 400 A.2d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Delaware North also cites <em>St. Joseph Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Cardiac Surgery </em>Assocs., P.A., 392 Md. 75, 896 A.2d 304 (2006) to support its interpretation that HO \u00a7 14-410 only applies to certain types of civil actions. It explains that St. <em>Joseph Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>which involved a dispute between physicians over the discovery of documents covered by the medical review committee privilege of HO \u00a7 1-401(d), stands for the proposition that the privilege of HO \u00a7 14-410 covers only \u201ca civil action <em>against the physician.\u201d </em>(emphasis in brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Delaware North\u2019s reliance on these cases is misplaced. Rather, both <em>Unnamed Physician </em>and <em>St. Joseph Med. Ctr., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>Inc. </em>support Smith\u2019s assertion that the privilege of HO \u00a7 14-410 applies to her appeal of a Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission decision. In fact, this Court explicitly stated in <em>Unnamed Physician </em>that \u201cjudicial review of the decision of an administrative agency is a civil action.\u201d 285 Md. at 9-10, 400 A.2d at 401. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission \u201cis an adjudicatory administrative agency.\u201d <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Swedo, </em>439 Md. 441, 452, 96 A.3d 210, 217 (2014). Therefore, Smith\u2019s case falls squarely within the plain meaning of \u201ca civil action.\u201d <em>Unnamed Physician, </em>285 Md. at 9-10, 400 A.2d at 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The Court of Special Appeals recently addressed the argument that HO \u00a7 14-410 \u201cdoes not apply to civil actions in which a physician is testifying as an expert\u201d in <em>Pepsi Bottling Grp. v.

Bell, </em>398 Md. 27, 33, 919 A.2d 716, 720 (2007). Delaware North claims that even if the court erred in admitting the redacted consent order, the admission of the order did not impact the outcome of the trial or prejudice Smith. To support this theory, Delaware North states that \u201cthe transcript shows that [the status of Dr. McGovern\u2019s medical license] was not even a fact focused on by either counsel for [Delaware North] or counsel for [Smith].\u201d It claims further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>that there was ample evidence aside from the redacted consent order to support the jury\u2019s verdict such as \u201cthe testimony of\" [Smith], the testimony of the physicians, and the evidentia-ry record.\u201d In response, Smith argues that the admission of the redacted consent order \u201cbadly impacted the jury\u2019s consideration of Dr. McGovern\u2019s expert testimony.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Smith notes as an alternative argument that the entire consent order should have been excluded under Md. Rule 5-403 because its prejudicial value outweighed its probative value. However, once the redacted consent order was admitted into evidence, defense counsel was free to comment on this evidence, and did, in fact, comment on this evidence at great length. As previously discussed, HO \u00a7 14-410 serves as a statutory bar to the admission of a consent order into evidence in any civil or criminal action. The trial court\u2019s admission of the consent order allowed the jury to consider evidence that the General Assembly explicitly precluded from consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Contrary to Delaware North\u2019s contention that the consent order was not \u201ceven a fact focused on\u201d at trial, Smith points to the transcript, which reveals at least four instances where defense counsel emphasized the consent order against Dr. McGovern as a reason for disregarding Smith\u2019s theory of causation. First, defense counsel tells the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">Please read that document [the consent order] and decide whether you believe anything that individual told you today, because when he was asked about his medical license .... He wasn\u2019t truthful. He\u2019s on probation currently for ethical problems involved in workers\u2019 compensation claims and he\u2019s who [Smith] hired.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Moments later, defense counsel stated: \u201cDr. McGovern\u2019s disciplinary action, being on probation, I mean, look at the f\u00edne that was levied against him for unethical practices in workers\u2019 compensation claims, but yet you should believe him? His entire testimony should be disregarded.\u201d The disciplinary charges against Dr. McGovern were rehashed when defense counsel told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>The consent order shows the inconsistencies in his testimony about the status of his medical license. Whether the witness\u2019 testimony was contradicted by evidence. Once again, the order that you\u2019re going to read from the Maryland Board of Physicians completely contradicts and puts into question his truthfulness, his honesty, his integrity, his ethics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Defense counsel concluded his closing argument by asking the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">[Wjould you have a loved one go to a doctor for treatment that\u2019s been disciplined by the Maryland Board of Physicians, that\u2019s on probation for ethical problems, would you ever in your wildest dreams send your loved one to that provider? But yet they want you to rely upon him in this claim. It\u2019s insulting to this entire system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">And for <em>that reason </em>I would ask on behalf of my client that you affirm the decision of the Commission, check the box \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Defense counsel not only emphasized the consent order and the underlying disciplinary charges Dr. McGovern faced but asked the jury to affirm the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission for \u201cthat reason,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the fact that Dr. McGovern had been disciplined by the Board. It is more than probable that the jury considered this inadmissible evidence as a result of defense counsel\u2019s repeated mention of the consent order and urging of the jury to render a verdict based on the disciplinary action. Because there is a high probability that the jury considered legally inadmissible evidence in rendering its verdict, we conclude that the admission of the consent order was prejudicial to Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">The plain language of HO \u00a7 14-410 generally prohibits the admission of, in any \u201ccivil or criminal action,\u201d the \u201cproceedings, records or files of the Board, a disciplinary panel, or any of its other investigatory bodies\u201d and \u201c[a]ny order passed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the Board of disciplinary panel.\u201d HO \u00a7 14-410(a). A physician\u2019s agreement to the terms of a consent order and the public nature of a consent order does not constitute \u201cexpress stipulation and consent\u201d to its use as evidence in a civil or criminal action. <em>Id. </em>The trial court erred as a matter of law in admitting a redacted version of the consent order when the order was subject to the statutory bar of HO \u00a7 14-410 and did not meet any of the exceptions provided therein. Defense counsel\u2019s repeated emphasis of the consent order and the underlying disciplinary action against Dr. McGovern made it more than probable that the jury considered the inadmissible evidence, causing prejudice to Smith\u2019s case. As a result, we conclude that a new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.

A consent order is a \"Final Order\u201d of the Board. <em>See </em>COMAR 10.32.02.02(B)(16).
