Kenneth Hart (\u201cHart\u201d), the defendant, was present throughout the two-day trial. On the second day of trial, after closing arguments and the administration of jury instructions, jury deliberations began at 7 p.m. After approximately three and a half hours of deliberation, the trial court received a jury note. The judge informed the prosecutor and defense counsel of the communication, and made arrangements for the sheriffs to bring Hart, who was in custody, to the courtroom. While they were waiting for Hart to arrive, defense counsel requested a \u201cpreview\u201d of the content of the jury note. The note indicated that the jury was deadlocked on a particular count and asked for guidance. Shortly thereafter, the judge was informed that Hart had been transported to a hospital due to a medical emergency. After the judge discussed the note with the prosecutor and defense counsel, the court summoned the jury foreperson to discuss the nature of the deadlock. Although Hart was not present, and despite objections from defense counsel, the judge accepted a partial verdict from the jury. Hart was found guilty on three counts. The trial court then declared a mistrial on the perceived deadlocked count on the basis of manifest necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">At a post-trial hearing, the trial court recognized its error in receiving the partial verdict in Hart\u2019s absence, and ordered a new trial for the counts on which Hart had been convicted. The trial judge concluded, however, that there was manifest necessity to declare a mistrial, and denied defense counsel\u2019s motion to dismiss the deadlocked count.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">For the reasons explained below, we disagree with the entry of a mistrial on the perceived deadlocked count. We hold that the trial court erred when it responded to the jury note without first conducting an adequate inquiry into the volun-tariness of Hart\u2019s absence from the court proceedings. Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>thermore, the trial judge erred in prematurely declaring a mistrial \u2014 an extraordinary remedy \u2014 -without first considering reasonable alternatives to the declaration, because Hart was involuntarily absent. These errors were not harmless, and resulted in prejudice to Hart. Because manifest necessity did not exist, under the unique facts of the case, a retrial on the particular count is barred on the grounds of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">As a result of a traffic stop, Hart was found to be in possession of controlled dangerous substances, including heroin, cocaine, and phencyclidine (\u201cPCP\u201d). Hart was indicted on several counts, which resulted in a two-day jury trial. On May 19, 2014, the trial commenced in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. After the State concluded its case-in-chief, Hart did not present any evidence, and rested his case. The trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury included the modified <em>Allen </em>charge on the jury\u2019s duty to deliberate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Four charges were submitted to the jury: Count 1: possession of heroin with intent to distribute; Count 2: possession of heroin; Count 3: possession of cocaine; Count 4: possession of PCP. At approximately 7 p.m., the jury began deliberations; a deputy sheriff took Hart into custody and escorted him to a holding area.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">At 10:21 p.m., the trial court received a written note from the jury. The judge summoned the prosecutor and defense counsel, and arranged for Hart to be brought to the courtroom. After a period of time, the court was still waiting for Hart\u2019s arrival. While the bailiff contacted the sheriffs to ascertain Hart\u2019s whereabouts, the following conversation ensued between the trial judge, prosecutor and defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>THE COURT: Do you want your client present when I tell you about the note?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I would love a preview first. I\u2019ll waive him for the preview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">THE COURT: You\u2019ll what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019ll fill \u2014 I\u2019ll fill him in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">THE COURT: Okay, here\u2019s a copy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">The jury note stated: \u201cAfter thorough deliberation the jury split on charge #1. No new information can help us reach consensus. What should we do?\u201d Meanwhile, continued efforts were made to have the sheriffs escort Hart to the courtroom. At approximately 10:48 p.m., the judge was informed that Hart was absent due to a medical emergency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-k\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m informed, your honor, or the court has just \u2014 the courtroom has been informed at this late hour, 10:48 or so, that Mr. Hart is experiencing medical problems and is likely en route by ambulance to the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">THE COURT: Yes, we received a note from the jury at approximately 10:21[p.m.,] which reads, \u201cAfter thorough deliberation the jury is split on charge number one. No new information can help us reach consensus. What should we do?\u201d While we were waiting for the sheriffs to bring the defendant and after repeated calls we just found out that there\u2019s a medical emergency. He\u2019s on his way to the hospital. What do you want to do about the note?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: This is certainly a situation of first impression for me. I have no information on his medical condition aside from a call from the sheriffs department saying he\u2019s en route with chest pains. Presumably he could be fine tomorrow morning. Maybe not. Maybe not at all. The jury has deliberated for nearly four hours, after two full days of trial. One of two things I would suggest at this point \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t have Mr. Hart by my side, which makes me apprehensive to make any moves on his behalf. But perhaps an inquiry as to how seriously they\u2019re deadlocked or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>THE COURT: Do you want me to bring the foreperson out and ask the foreperson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think that would at least give us some guidance, because my gut says ask them to come back in the morning and continue to deliberate, give them the <em>Allen </em>charge, find out what Mr. Hart\u2019s status is. I\u2019d hate to \u2014 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in a position to request a mistrial without him by my side and without his input.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">THE COURT: Counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: They haven\u2019t been asked to continue to deliberate yet. I\u2019ll defer to the court as to what we do. THE COURT: Well, I\u2019ll bring the foreperson out and ask him whether or not \u2014 if they can\u2019t come back tomorrow, you know, after having a good night\u2019s sleep, do they think that they can deliberate some more? Hi.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">JUROR 132: Hi.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">THE COURT: You can \u2014 you can just stand right there. We received your note. And it indicates that no new information can help [the jury] reach consensus. But what I was wondering is \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s been a long day. Do you think that after going home and maybe getting a good night\u2019s rest and coming back tomorrow you can start deliberating again with a clearer head, or do you think it\u2019s no use?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">JUROR 132: We had a very good process in there. And there was (sic) a couple of times where we initially took a minute and everyone just thought and thought. We went around the room three times, we gave everyone a chance to talk, and then we all answered each other. We voted three times going around. And at the end, there was (sic) people in the room who said there was no information that could change their mind. If you want to know, I can tell you what the vote count was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">THE COURT: No, not right now. But when you say information, are you saying information that could be gained from you all discussing it with each other or information that we could give?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>JUROR 132: I think either .... I think that there are people in the room who have unequivocal positions on each side. And they said there\u2019s nothing that could change their mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">THE COURT: Okay. And you don\u2019t think a good night\u2019s sleep would help. JUROR 132: No, I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The judge then asked the prosecutor and defense counsel if they had any questions for the foreperson. Each replied in the negative, and the foreperson returned to the jury room. The following exchange then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think the only thing that I am in a position to request at this moment is that they be excused for the night and read the <em>Allen </em>charge first thing in the morning, start deliberations again. If they pass a similar note suggesting that they\u2019re deadlocked, we can deal with it accordingly. But they haven\u2019t been read the <em>Allen </em>charge. And most importantly I don\u2019t know what Mr. Hart\u2019s situation [is]. And without him to give me his input related to his desires, I would be I think delinquent in my duties if I requested a mistrial on his behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your honor, I can just tell you from the State\u2019s perspective based on what I heard I don\u2019t think anything is going to change. The people who are set on their positions are going to, after coming back, anything actually going to change materially to make the posture change (sic) \u2014 so the State is not interested in that. But I\u2019ll defer to \u2014 in terms of coming back and letting them get the <em>Allen </em>charge and continue to deliberate, in light of what I heard. But I\u2019ll defer as to what ends up happening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">THE COURT: Okay. With respect to what you\u2019re referring to, the <em>Allen </em>charge, basically that\u2019s already been given in the jury instruction \u2014 [a] jury\u2019s duty to deliberate. They\u2019ve already got this. The foreperson came out. He indicated that, you know, they\u2019ve taken breaks, they\u2019ve gone over it, in response to my question, because the note wasn\u2019t clear where it says no new information could help. And the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>response to my question was whether he was talking about information from us or information from the deliberations, and he said both. So based on his responses to my questions I\u2019m not going to ask them to deliberate any further. I\u2019m reluctant right now to say a mistrial as to charge number one, because I don\u2019t know what the verdict sheet <em>says</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> .... </em>But I don\u2019t see that there\u2019s anything that would prohibit me from declaring a mistrial after we see the verdict sheet, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I mean, I\u2019ve stated my position. I think that they should be charged\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">THE COURT: No, I understand that. But I\u2019m just asking you at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your honor, I think we should look at the verdict sheet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Mr. Hart is not even in the building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">THE COURT: I understand that, but that\u2019s through no fault of the court. And we don\u2019t know what his circumstances are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I agree with that, but I don\u2019t want to \u2014 I mean, there\u2019s only a couple of options. He\u2019s either legitimately experiencing medical issues, which I think in light of him proceeding through this whole trial\u2014 and seemingly the stresses would at some point manifest and come to a head, and that would be appropriate with the timing associated with this, or he\u2019s faking it which, you know, I don\u2019t put any stock in whatsoever. But I don\u2019t think he should be punished by virtue of the fact that he\u2019s fallen ill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-11\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t see this as punishment. What do you see as punishment for it? I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Taking a partial verdict in his absence, not allowing him to consult with me about the issue of mistrial. Now I\u2019ve stated my position. And that may or may not be his position, but we don\u2019t know his position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aymc\">THE COURT: So are you suggesting that this could be open-ended? We\u2019ve got a verdict on at least some of the counts, and I\u2019m inclined to accept that and then based on the verdict sheet declare a mistrial on one and two or just\u2014 I don\u2019t know what it says. So let\u2019s bring the jury in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdH\">The court summoned the jury and received a partial verdict. The jury announced it was unable to reach a verdict as to Count 1; however, Hart was found guilty on the remaining possession counts. The jury was then hearkened, polled, and dismissed. Thereafter, the judge declared a mistrial as to Count 1, the perceived deadlocked count.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Nearly three months after the jury returned a partial verdict, on August 18, 2014, Hart filed, through counsel, a Motion to Dismiss Enumerated Counts and Motion for New Trial. He moved to dismiss Count 1 on the grounds of double jeopardy. He argued that the mistrial was not supported by manifest necessity because either the jury was not truly deadlocked, or Hart was involuntarily absent; without manifest necessity, a retrial is barred. At a hearing, on August 22, 2014, the trial judge affirmed her finding of manifest necessity based on the jury deadlock, and denied the motion to dismiss Count 1. The Court did, however, recognize its error in accepting the partial verdict in Hart\u2019s absence, and granted a new trial for the three counts on which Hart had been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">On August 26, 2014, Hart noted an interlocutory appeal to the Court of Special Appeals seeking review of the trial court\u2019s decision to deny Hart\u2019s motion to dismiss Count 1. Two days later, the trial court granted a stay of trial pending appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">On August 12, 2015, in an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss Count 1. It held, under Maryland Rule 4-231, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Hart had a right to be present at the declaration of the mistrial on Count 1; Hart neither waived his right to be present nor consented to the declaration of the mistrial, and none of the exceptions under Rule 4-231(b) existed. The intermediate appellate court determined that due to Hart\u2019s involuntary absence, manifest necessity did not exist to declare a mistrial, and therefore, double jeopardy barred retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The State filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court. We granted <em>certiorari </em>to answer the following questions, which we have rephrased:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">1. Did Defendant have a right to be present at the colloquy with the jury foreperson, and, if so, was that right waived by defense counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">2. Did Defendant have a right to be present at the declaration of the mistrial? If so, was it harmless error for the court to declare a mistrial when Defendant was involuntarily absent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">3. Assuming that the trial court committed reversible error in declaring a mistrial as to Count 1, is the appropriate remedy dismissal or retrial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-9\"><em>State v. Hart, </em>445 Md. 487, 128 A.3d 51 (2015). For the reasons stated below, we shall hold that Hart had a right to be present at the colloquy with the jury foreperson. Defense counsel, however, in his client\u2019s absence, consented to a limited discussion between the court, the prosecutor, defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>and the jury foreperson concerning the content of the jury note. Defense counsel did not waive Hart\u2019s right to be present for any other stage of the trial, and defense counsel\u2019s limited consent to an inquiry regarding the jury deadlock cannot be deemed a waiver of Hart\u2019s right to be present for the trial court\u2019s ultimate response to the jury note. Accordingly, the trial judge erred in declaring a mistrial in Hart\u2019s involuntary absence without first continuing the case. The declaration was premature and manifest necessity did not exist, because the defendant was involuntarily absent, and the judge did not adopt any reasonable alternatives to the declaration. In the absence of manifest necessity, double jeopardy bars a retrial of Count 1. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\"> When a violation of a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present is at issue, we apply the harmless error analysis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad-\">[T]he harmless error principle is fully applicable to a defendant\u2019s right to be present during a stage of the trial. Prejudice will not be conclusively presumed. If the record demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the denial of the right could not have prejudiced the defendant, the error will not result in a reversal of his conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\"><em>Noble v.

Rule 4-326 protects an important right, and therefore we employ the harmless error analysis when reviewing violations of the rule.\u201d) (citation omitted). In <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>we described harmless error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">We conclude that when an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u2018harmless\u2019 and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>excluded \u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u201cOnce error is established, the burden is on the State to show that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

We explained in <em>Simmons v. </em>State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">[O]ur cases make clear that we apply the abuse of discretion standard of review in cases of mistrial. \u201cIt is well-settled that a decision to grant a mistrial lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge and that the trial judge\u2019s determination will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Carter v.

That is, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>look to whether the trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion was \u201cmanifestly unreasonable, or exercised on untenable grounds, or for untenable reasons.\u201d <em>Stabb v.

State, </em>431 Md. 85, 95, 64 A.3d 197, 202 (2013); <em>Pinkney v. State, </em>350 Md. 201, 209, 711 A.2d 205, 209 (1998); <em>Stewart v. State, </em>334 Md. 213, 224, 638 A.2d 754, 759 (1994).

The <em>Williams </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Today, with the complexity of many criminal trials and the absolute right of counsel if there is a danger of incarceration, our system proceeds upon the assumption that it is primarily counsel\u2019s function to assert or waive most \u201crights\u201d of the defendant ... With respect to all criminal trials, or parts of trials, taking place after the issuance of our mandate in this case, an effective waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to be present at every stage of the trial will not always require a personal waiver by the defendant. Where the right of confrontation is not implicated, and where there is involved no other right requiring intelligent and knowing action by the defendant himself for an effective waiver, a defendant will ordinarily be bound by the action or inaction of his attorney ... [I]f the defendant himself does not affirmatively ask to be present at such occurrences or does not express an objection at the time, and if his attorney consents to his absence or says nothing regarding the matter, the right to be present will be deemed to have been waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">292 Md. at 218, 438 A.2d at 1309-10. Pursuant to Rule 4-231(c), waiver of a defendant\u2019s right to be present at a critical stage of trial may occur under the following conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">The right to be present ... is waived by a defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">(1) who is voluntarily absent after the proceeding has commenced, whether or not informed by the court of the right to remain; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">(2) who engages in conduct that justifies exclusion from the courtroom; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">(3) who, personally or through counsel, agrees to or acquiesces in being absent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Additionally, as explained in the Committee note to Rule 4-231, \u201c[ejxcept when specifically covered by this Rule, the matter of presence of the defendant during any stage of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>proceedings is left to case law and the Rule is not intended to exhaust all situations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the first issue presented is whether Hart had a right to be present at the colloquy with the jury foreperson, and, if so, whether that right was waived. The State argues that the Court of Special Appeals erred in addressing this issue, because it was not preserved for appellate review. Maryland Rule 8-131 (a) defines the scope of appellate review, and states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The issue before the Court of Special Appeals was the propriety of the trial court\u2019s denial of Hart\u2019s motion to dismiss Count 1 on the grounds of double jeopardy. In its unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">We hold that Hart had a right to be present when the trial court declared a mistrial on Count 1, and the declaration of a mistrial in his absence was in error. Because the entry of a mistrial in Hart\u2019s absence was erroneous in the first place, there could be no manifest necessity for declaration of the mistrial. As a result, retrial on that charge is barred by double jeopardy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">As part of its analysis, the intermediate appellate court necessarily had to explore the circumstances surrounding the trial judge\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial. It determined that \u201c[d]ue to the factual nature of the inquiries surrounding the trial court\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial,\u201d the declaration of a mistrial was not purely legal in nature. Finding no evidence of waiver or an applicable exception to the right to be present, under Rule 4-231(b)(1),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the intermediate appellate court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>that Hart\u2019s right to be present had been violated twice by the trial court \u2014 at the colloquy and at the declaration of the mistrial \u2014 when the judge proceeded in Hart\u2019s involuntary absence. To the extent that the issue regarding the propriety of the colloquy may have been unpreserved for appellate review, we hold that the Court of Special Appeals properly exercised its discretion to consider it. The colloquy was sufficiently interrelated with the issue concerning the declaration of the mistrial in Hart\u2019s absence. <em>See Unger v.

It is, moreover, well settled that any communications between a judge and the jury which pertain to the action constitute just such stages of trial at which the defendant is entitled to be present.

Defense counsel previewed the contents of the note, and, at 10:48 p.m., the trial judge stated on the record: \u201cWhile we were waiting for the sheriffs to bring the defendant and after repeated calls we just found out that there\u2019s a medical emergency.\u201d Without further inquiry into the voluntariness of Hart\u2019s absence, the judge turned to defense counsel, and stated: \u201cHe\u2019s on his way to the hospital. What do you want to do about the note?\u201d Defense counsel expressed apprehension about proceeding -without his client. Notwithstanding the reluctance, it was his suggestion to discuss the nature of the deadlock with the jury for the purpose of gathering information in order to formulate a proper response to the jury note, but reiterated that his ability to represent his client \u2014 by suggesting a proper response \u2014 was limited due to Hart\u2019s absence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think that [the colloquy] would at least give us some guidance, because my gut says ask them to come back in the morning and continue to deliberate, give them the <em>Allen </em>charge, find out what Mr. Hart\u2019s status is. I\u2019d hate to \u2014 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in a position to request a mistrial without him by my side and without his input.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the colloquy with the jury foreperson was a \u201cstage of the trial\u201d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>which Hart had a right to be present. We disagree, however, that Hart\u2019s right to be present for the colloquy was violated. Rule 4-231(c)(3) provides that the right to be present under subsection (a) is waived by a defendant who, \u201cpersonally or through counsel, agrees to or acquiesces in being absent.\u201d Here, defense counsel consented to Hart\u2019s absence from the colloquy for the limited purpose of obtaining information with regard to the extent of the jury\u2019s deadlock. The colloquy was factual in nature, and designed to explore the extent of the deadlock on Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Clearly, defense counsel understood his limitations in proceeding without his client\u2019s presence; thus, he requested that the scope of the inquiry with the foreperson be limited to exploring the nature of the impasse. <em>See Williams, </em>292 Md. at 219, 438 A.2d at 1310 (\u201cWhere the right of confrontation is not implicated, and where there is involved no other right requiring intelligent and knowing action by the defendant himself for an effective waiver, a defendant will <em>ordinarily </em>be bound by the action or inaction of his attorney.\u201d) (emphasis added). Hart was absent from the proceedings, and it is evident from the record that defense counsel did not have an opportunity to consult with Hart regarding the content of the jury note. Defense counsel stated explicitly that his ability to suggest an appropriate response to the jury note, and represent his client\u2019s interest, was hindered due to Hart\u2019s absence. He informed the trial judge: \u201cI don\u2019t have Mr. Hart by my side, which makes me apprehensive to make any moves on his behalf. But perhaps an inquiry as to how seriously they\u2019re deadlocked[.]\u201d Accordingly, defense counsel seized the opportunity to gather information about the jury note, and put himself in a position to confer with his client at a later time about the content of the note. Defense counsel did not request or consent, in his client\u2019s absence, to the trial court\u2019s answer to the jury communication, which was to deny a continuance, refuse to give an additional <em>Allen </em>charge after receiving notice of the impasse, accept a partial verdict, declare a mistrial on Count 1, and discharge the jury. Immediately following the colloquy, defense counsel made clear the scope of the waiver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think the only thing that I am in a position to request at this moment is that they be excused for the night and read the <em>Allen </em>charge first thing in the morning, start deliberations again. If they pass a similar note suggesting that they\u2019re deadlocked, we can deal with it accordingly. But they haven\u2019t been read the <em>Allen </em>charge. And most importantly I don\u2019t know what Mr. Hart\u2019s situation [is]. And without him to give me his input related to his desires, I would be I think delinquent in my duties if I requested a mistrial on his behalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Defense counsel objected to any further proceedings in Hart\u2019s involuntary absence, including the taking of a partial verdict and the declaration of a mistrial on Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In the past, \u201cwe [have] warned courts against too hastily trying an absent criminal defendant, thus affecting \u2018a waiver of rights that are to be carefully safeguarded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pinkney, </em>350 Md. at 211, 711 A.2d at 210 (quoting <em>Barnett v.

The trial court abused its discretion, because the judge proceeded <em>in absentia </em>too hastily: the facts on the record suggest that Hart was involuntarily absent, and the judge did not inquire as to the seriousness of the Hart\u2019s condition or the expected length of his absence prior to exercising her discretion to proceed without him. <em>See Pinkney, </em>350 Md. at 223, 711 A.2d at 216 (holding that the trial court erred in proceeding <em>in absentia, </em>because if it had conducted an adequate inquiry into the defendant\u2019s whereabouts, it would have determined that the defendant was involuntarily absent due to a seizure he had recently sustained); <em>Stone v.

Additionally, the judge\u2019s comment to defense counsel\u2019s objection to responding to the jury note by receiving a partial verdict suggests that Hart\u2019s involuntary absence was insignificant to the trial judge or that Hart was somehow at fault for his absence despite evidence to the contrary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Mr. Hart is not even in the building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">THE COURT: I understand that, but that\u2019s through no fault of the court.

He\u2019s either legitimately experiencing medical issues, which I think in light of him proceeding through this whole trial\u2014 and seemingly the stresses would at some point manifest and come to a head, and that would be appropriate with the timing associated with this, or he\u2019s faking it which, you know, I don\u2019t put any stock in whatsoever. But I don\u2019t think he should be punished by virtue of the fact that he\u2019s fallen ill.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">We hold that the court\u2019s violation of Hart\u2019s right to be present after the colloquy with the jury foreperson had ended was not harmless error. Hart was denied this opportunity to participate or to be informed in a timely manner about how the trial court intended to proceed following the colloquy. By going beyond the information gathering requested by defense counsel and answering the jury\u2019s communication, in the defendant\u2019s absence and without the opportunity for his input, Hart\u2019s right to be present at every stage of the trial was violated. <em>See Harris, </em>428 Md. at 712-13, 53 A.3d at 1178-79. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>As a result, the colloquy culminated in the trial court\u2019s determination to deny a continuance, decline to give an additional <em>Allen </em>charge, declare a mistrial <em>sua sponte </em>as to Count 1, and discharge the jury, during the absence of the one person \u201cmost vitally concerned with the trial\u201d and its outcome. <em>Har</em>ris, 428 Md. at 716, 53 A.3d at 1180 (citing <em>Graham v.

The manifest necessity analysis is applicable in eases involving a jury deadlock:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">Although the Supreme Court refuses to require trial courts to jump over specified hurdles in mechanical fashion prior to declaring a mistrial, its preference for the exercise of judicial discretion does not obviate the manifest necessity analysis. <em>See [Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 462, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 1069, 35 L.Ed.2d 425, 430 (1973)] (noting that mistrial by manifest necessity is appropriate where \u201cthe ends of substantial justice cannot be attained without discontinuing the trial\u201d (quoting <em>Gori v. United States, </em>367 U.S. 364, 368, 81 S.Ct. 1523, 1526, 6 L.Ed.2d 901, 904 (1961))). The trial court must determine still that no reasonable alternative to a mistrial exists. In the context of a hung jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>therefore, the trial court must determine ordinarily that genuine jury deadlock exists, such that further deliberations are unlikely to be productive. <em>See Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 509, 98 S.Ct. at 832, 54 L.Ed.2d at 730 (permitting retrial where the court discharges a \u201cgenuinely deadlocked jury\u201d). This view is entirely consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blueford. </em>The Court did not determine, in that case, that the manifest necessity standard is reached automatically whenever the judge determines that deadlock exists, without further inquiry. Rather, in <em>Blueford, </em>the Court reasoned that no further inquiry was needed to establish genuine deadlock after the jury indicated that it was deadlocked hopelessly and unlikely to reach a verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\"><em>Fennell, </em>431 Md. at 519-20, 66 A.3d at 642 (emphasis added). <em>Cornish, </em>272 Md. at 318, 322 A.2d at 884 (\u201cOrdinarily a retrial is permitted where the mistrial was caused by the jury\u2019s inability to reach a verdict[.]\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We hold that manifest necessity did not exist, and the trial judge abused her discretion in declaring a mistrial in Hart\u2019s involuntary absence. The unique facts and circumstances of this case are that the jury had only been deliberating approximately three and a half hours; the written note was given to the trial judge late in the evening, at 10:21 p.m.; Hart was involuntarily absent and whether or when he would return to the trial court was unknown; and absent was a good reason why the jurors could not have returned after a short continuance for further proceedings. Given these circumstances, the trial judge acted prematurely in determining that manifest necessity existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Prior to the declaration of a mistrial, the trial court was obliged to explore reasonable alternatives. \u201c[Rjetrial is barred by the Fifth Amendment where reasonable alternatives to a mistrial, such as a continuance, are feasible and could cure the problem[.]\u201d <em>Cornish, </em>272 Md. at 320, 322 A.2d at 886. In <em>Jourdan v. State, </em>this Court held that a trial court erred in declaring a mistrial <em>sua sponte </em>when the prosecutor became ill shortly after trial began. 275 Md. 495, 511-12, 341 A.2d 388, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>398 (1975). We held that manifest necessity did not exist where a short continuance would have allowed another prosecutor sufficient time to prepare for trial in light of the fact that the original prosecutor stated he only had ten to fifteen minutes to prepare. <em>Id. </em>We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">In the present case, no reason has been suggested why the alternate remedy of a continuance was not feasible. If it would have taken the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney until the next morning to get ready for the trial, a continuance until that time could have been granted. Or, if there were some reason (not apparent on this record) why the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney could not handle the prosecution the next day or shortly thereafter, the case could have been continued for a reasonable time until the Deputy State\u2019s Attorney was able to resume his duties. As the six month jury term of this jury was far from over, the jury could have been called back as soon as the Deputy State\u2019s Attorney was ready to resume his duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Here, the judge asked the foreperson if additional time for deliberations the next day would be beneficial. The foreperson responded no. However, given Hart\u2019s absence, the lateness of the hour, the extent of the jury\u2019s deliberations, and the rejection of the request for an additional <em>Allen </em>charge after the notice of an impasse, the trial judge\u2019s reliance on the foreperson\u2019s opinion was not a reasonable alternative to a continuance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">THE COURT: With respect to what you\u2019re referring to, the <em>Allen </em>charge, basically that\u2019s already been given in the jury instruction ... They\u2019ve already got this. The foreperson came out. He indicated that, you know, they\u2019ve taken breaks, they\u2019ve gone over it, in response to my question, because the note wasn\u2019t clear where it says no new information could help. And the response to my question was whether he was talking about information from us or information from the deliberations, and he said both. So based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>his responses to my questions I\u2019m not going to ask them to deliberate any further[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The judge, however, failed to consider the propriety of proceeding <em>in absentia, </em>and the impact Hart\u2019s absence could have on the jury. In its unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">Due to the factual nature of the inquiries surrounding the trial court\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial, we hold that Rule 4-231 required Hart to be present. As Hart was involuntarily absent due to a medical condition, none of the exceptions to the Rule apply. The declaration of a mistrial in Hart\u2019s absence, therefore, was in error under Rule 4-231.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">Although the violation of Rule 4-231(b) would be sufficient, our views are confirmed by the analogy to a defendant\u2019s right to be present when a verdict is received. A defendant\u2019s right to be present at a declaration of a mistrial is similar to the defendant\u2019s right to be present for the receipt of a verdict because, as the cases hold, the mere face-to-face contact with the defendant may cause some of the jurors to change their position:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">When a jury returns to the courtroom, faces the accused, and, typically, is subject to a poll of the verdict, the psychological influence of the eye-to-eye contact between juror and defendant may be significant enough to cause a juror to change his or her mind when outside the pressure of the jury room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\"><em>Kimes v. United States, </em>569 A.2d 104, 111 (D.C.1989). The same rationale applies to a mistrial, when the jurors, upon seeing the defendant in court, might change their prior \u201cunequivocal\u201d stances that led to the deadlock in the first place. Thus, we conclude that, in this instance, Hart\u2019s [right] to be present was violated by the trial court\u2019s order of a mistrial during his involuntary absence. Because of the importance the presence of the defendant may have in their minds of the jury, this error is not harmless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">We agree with this rationale. The decision to declare a mistrial does not fall within an exception to the right to be present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>under Rule 4-231(b). It is unclear whether any jurors would have changed their minds at the time they were summoned to the courtroom to enter a partial verdict had Hart been present.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Critically, the judge and counsel were aware of the following: Hart\u2019s absence due to a medical emergency; Hart did not have the opportunity to waive his right to be present or to consult with defense counsel; and defense counsel could not request a mistrial in his client\u2019s absence. As discussed above, the trial judge did not inquire into the voluntariness of Hart\u2019s absence or determine whether the absence would be short or prolonged. Instead, the judge outright rejected defense counsel\u2019s reasonable request for a short continuance to ascertain Hart\u2019s status.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Granting a short continuance, however, was feasible and would have cured the problem associated with proceeding in Hart\u2019s absence. A continuance would have permitted the jury to adjourn for the evening, allowed time for defense counsel to ascertain Hart\u2019s status and confer with his client, and it would have ameliorated, among other things, the court\u2019s error in receiving a partial verdict in Hart\u2019s absence. Notably, the prosecutor did not object to defense counsel\u2019s request for additional deliberations (although he implied the effort ultimately may be futile). That these proceedings also occurred late in the evening, at nearly 11 p.m., following a two-day trial is also a relevant factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">By proceeding without Hart, the court denied the defendant an opportunity to object to the declaration of the mistrial. Defense counsel objected to any court action beyond fact gathering until he could assess Hart\u2019s status and consult with his client. Under these circumstances, the declaration of a mistrial was premature: manifest necessity \u2014 a high degree of necessity \u2014 did not exist, because the defendant was involuntarily absent and he did not waive his presence, and the judge did not adopt any reasonable alternatives to the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>We recall that manifest necessity must exist in order to avoid double jeopardy. <em>See Simmons, </em>436 Md. at 214, 81 A.3d at 390 (describing the \u201cburden of justifying the mistrial\u201d as \u201ca heavy one\u201d) (quoting <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 505, 98 S.Ct. at 830, 54 L.Ed.2d at 728). The Supreme Court has characterized the burden of proving manifest necessity as a \u201chigh degree\u201d of necessity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">[I]n <em>Arizona v.

The Supreme Court recognized that although \u201cthose words do not describe a standard that can be applied mechanically or without attention to the particular problem confronting the trial judge .... we assume that there are degrees of necessity and we require a \u2018high degree\u2019 before concluding that a mistrial is appropriate.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 506, 98 S.Ct. at 830-31, 54 L.Ed.2d at 728-29. <em>See also In re Mark R., </em>294 Md. 244, 249-50, 449 A.2d 393, 397 (1982). To meet this \u201chigh degree\u201d of necessity, our cases establish that \u201cto determine whether manifest necessity to declare a mistrial over defense objection exists, the trial judge must engage in the process of exploring reasonable alternatives and determine that there is no reasonable alternative to the mistrial.\u201d <em>Hubbard v. State, </em>395 Md. 73, 92, 909 A.2d 270, 281 (2006).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-6\"><em>Simmons, </em>436 Md. at 215, 81 A.3d at 390-91 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">This is a unique case involving the interrelationship of the right to be present and manifest necessity. Manifest necessity did not exist on the basis of the record before us, because Hart was involuntarily absent, and the court failed to grant a continuance to determine the expected length of Hart\u2019s absence prior to its decision to proceed <em>in absentia. </em>We hold that the trial court erred in declaring a mistrial <em>sua sponte, </em>because of the court\u2019s failure to conduct critical inquiries, which are explained above, prior to exercising its discretion to proceed <em>in absentia. </em>Because the declaration of a mistrial oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>curred in the absence of manifest necessity, a retrial is prohibited on the grounds of double jeopardy. <em>See Jones v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 504, 516, 302 A.2d 638, 645 (1973) (\u201c[T]he question whether retrial following a <em>sua sponte </em>judicially declared mistrial without the defendant\u2019s consent is prohibited by the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment is to be resolved by a determination whether the mistrial declaration was an abuse of judicial discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. The trial court abused its discretion, and violated Hart\u2019s right to be present during critical stages of trial. The first error was in answering the jury note in the defendant\u2019s absence. The second error \u2014 the declaration of a mistrial in the absence of manifest necessity \u2014 prohibits retrial on the grounds of double jeopardy. <em>See Jones, </em>17 Md.App. at 517-18, 302 A.2d at 646.

Where a mistrial as to one count was manifestly necessary due to jury deadlock, did Hart, who was unavailable, not have a right to be present for the trial court's declaration of a mistrial as to that count, and if Hart did have a right to be present, was the error in declaring a mistrial in his absence harmless?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-13\">3. Assuming that the trial court committed reversible error in declaring a mistrial as to a deadlocked count in Hart\u2019s absence, did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that dismissal of a deadlocked count, rather than retrial, was the appropriate remedy?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\">.
