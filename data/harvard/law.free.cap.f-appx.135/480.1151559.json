Where, as here, the BIA has affirmed an IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). This court has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We assume familiarity with the facts and proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">Liu raises three kinds of claims in her petition. First, she challenges the IJ\u2019s assessment of her testimony, claiming, inter alia, that the IJ found inconsistency between her testimony and her previous written statements where no such inconsistency existed. Second, she reiterates the argument she asserted below that she fears persecution under China\u2019s family-planning policy if she has children in the future. Third, we construe Liu\u2019s petition to challenge the IJ\u2019s determination that she did not merit relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-15\">The IJ found Liu\u2019s fear of future persecution based on her tentative plans to have children too speculative to warrant relief. We see no error in this determination. We also find that, on the record as a whole, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s factual findings regarding Liu\u2019s claims of past persecution and fear of future persecution. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 306-07 (explaining applicability of substantial-evidence standard). The IJ relied not only on inconsistency between Liu\u2019s written statements and her oral testimony, but also on the substance of that testimony and the fact that Liu provided minimal corroboration of her story. Liu\u2019s central contention was that she feared persecution because family-planning authorities sought to punish her as a proxy for her sister, who allegedly gave birth to a second child in violation of China\u2019s one-child policy. The IJ found incredible Liu\u2019s assertions (1) that she was threatened by Chinese authorities because of her sister\u2019s actions and (2) that if Liu were returned to China, she would continue to be persecuted on that ground. Given the \u201cexceedingly narrow\u201d scope of our review of the IJ\u2019s factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>findings, <em>Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 313 (2d Cir.1999), and the deference we grant to an IJ\u2019s credibility determinations, <em>see Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003) (per curiam), we cannot reject the IJ\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s ruling that Liu\u2019s uncorroborated allegations (that she would be tortured if returned to China) were insufficient to merit relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 184 (2d Cir.2004) (CAT claimant must establish \u201cthat \u2018it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We have carefully considered all of Liu\u2019s arguments and find them to be meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals is hereby AFFIRMED and the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
