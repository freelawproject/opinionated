At the airport, he presented himself to immigration officers and requested asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-25\">On July 11, 2001, Isufaj was given a \u201ccredible fear\u201d interview by an asylum officer. He stated that, after living and intermittently working in Greece for four years, he had returned to Albania for about a month to participate in the June 24, 2001 parliamentary election as a local election monitor for the opposition Democratic Party. Shortly after the polls closed, unknown civilians, presumably associated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>with the ruling Socialist Party, had attempted to steal the ballot box and pointed a gun to his head when he refused to let them take it. Later that day, his cousin warned him that he should not return home, ever, because people were looking for him and would kill him. Fearing for his life, Isufaj explained, he fled the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">At the conclusion of the interview, Isufaj was given a Notice to Appear for removal proceedings, and was released from detention pending such proceedings. Those proceedings materialized on April 28, 2002, at which time Isufaj admitted the immigration charges and conceded removability. He applied for political asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">On December 31, 2002, the IJ held an evidentiary hearing. Isufaj was the sole witness. The government\u2019s cross-examination and the IJ\u2019s questions uncovered numerous inconsistencies in Isufaj\u2019s story, relating to both broad themes (such as why he came to the United States) and details (such as his United States address, when he joined the Albanian Democratic Party, and whether he had a valid Albanian passport in July 2001). Isufaj\u2019s explanation for many of these inconsistencies was that he \u201cmust\u2019ve made many mistakes on [his] statement\u201d and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The IJ concluded \u2014 based on her assessment of Isufaj\u2019s testimony viewed against the background of documentary exhibits regarding human rights and political conditions in Albania \u2014 that Isufaj was \u201cnot a credible witness,\u201d that he had \u201cspecifically lied to the Immigration Officer,\u201d and that the basic premise of his story \u2014 that he had returned to Albania to be an election monitor \u2014 was \u201cnot credible.\u201d The IJ concluded that Isufaj was \u201cso [economically] desperate ... that he has lied to me, [and] to the officer when he first came to the United States. I find that the story is just simply fabricated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">The IJ denied Isufaj\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. She further found that Isufaj had knowingly filed a frivolous application for asylum after being warned of the consequences for doing so, namely, permanent ineligibility to enter the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(6). In a brief per curiam opinion, the BIA affirmed the denial of all three forms of relief but vacated the finding that Isufaj had knowingly filed a frivolous application. On appeal, Isufaj challenges only the denial of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">An asylum applicant \u201cmay qualify as a refugee either because he or she has suffered past persecution or because he or she has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b). In either case, the applicant has the burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1208.13(a); <em>see also Khalil v. Ashcroft, </em>337 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir.2003) (enumerating requirements for proving past persecution or well-founded fear of persecution). \u201cDeterminations of eligibility for asylum or withholding deportation are conclusive \u2018if supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 372 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). \u201c[T]he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>\u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). This deferential standard means that \u201c[t]o reverse the BIA finding we must find that the evidence not only <em>supports </em>that conclusion, but <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">While Isufaj\u2019s story could, in theory, be consistent with the evidence, \u201c[mjerely identifying alternative findings that could be supported by substantial evidence is insufficient to supplant the [IJ\u2019s] findings.\u201d <em>Albathani, </em>318 F.3d at 372. The IJ concluded that the entire story on which Isufaj based his claim was \u201cjust simply fabricated.\u201d Nothing that we have found in the hearing transcript, or the documentary evidence concerning crime, politics, and human rights in Albania, undermines the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, and therefore we cannot say that the evidence compels the conclusion that Isufaj demonstrated either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The petition for review is <em>denied.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\">.
