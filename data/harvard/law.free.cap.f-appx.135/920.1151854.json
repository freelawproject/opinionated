We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>de Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 759, 761 (9th Cir.2004). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">The IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying Metzala\u2019s motion to reopen because she failed to establish \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (b)(5)(C)\u00ae; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3). Metzala\u2019s contention that she and her attorney both misread the date of the hearing is unavailing. <em>See Valencia-Fragoso v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 1204, 1205-06 (9th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (holding that confusion as to a hearing time does not amount to exceptional circumstances); <em>Garcia v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (holding that \u201ceach party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">Metzala\u2019s contention that the <em>in absentia </em>order violates due process lacks merit. <em>See Valencia-Fragoso, </em>321 F.3d at 1206 (noting that \u201c[t]he IJ did not deny Petitioners due process by proceeding with the hearing in Petitioners\u2019 absence.\u201d) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-15\">Metzala\u2019s contention that the order leads to an \u201cunconscionable result\u201d likewise lacks merit because she has not shown that she would not have been ordered removed had she attended the hearing. <em>See id. </em>at 1205-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b947-13\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
