We review the denial of a motion to suppress evidence de novo. <em>United States v. Hamlin, </em>319 F.3d 666, 671 (4th Cir.2003). We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>Id. </em>Because we conclude reasonable suspicion existed to stop Johnson\u2019s vehicle for illegal window tinting, we affirm Johnson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-19\">Johnson next argues that his sentence violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial as determined in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Johnson preserved this issue at sentencing. Although we conclude the district court did not err when it calculated Johnson\u2019s criminal history category, or when it found that one of Johnson\u2019s prior convictions was a crime of violence, we conclude the court\u2019s finding that Johnson\u2019s firearm was stolen violates the mandate that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 748, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (quoting <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We accordingly vacate Johnson\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-24\">Although the United States Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range ... and reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED FOR RE-SENTENCING</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b634-14\"> Just as we noted in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Johnson's sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
