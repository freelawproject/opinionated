Leon-Leon contends that pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), his Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the district court\u2019s factual determinations necessary to support the enhancements applied to his sentencing guideline calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-25\">When Leon-Leon entered into the plea agreement with the government, he waived his right to appeal from the court\u2019s entry of judgment and the imposition of a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>tence provided that the sentence was consistent with his plea agreement. Because Leon-Leon was sentenced to a range within the plea agreement, his appeal waiver is enforceable and deprives us of jurisdiction. <em>See United States v.
