Young argues that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Juror 9 violated his Sixth Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury. We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>Himes v. Thompson, </em>336 F.3d 848, 852 (9th Cir.2003). Because Young\u2019s habeas petition was filed after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, Pub.L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (Apr. 24, 1996) (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), AEDPA governs Young\u2019s petition. <em>Delgado v. Lewis, </em>223 F.3d 976, 979 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">Under AEDPA, \u201cstate court findings of fact are presumed correct unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence\u201d or \u201cbased on an unreasonable evidentiary foundation.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); <em>Gonzalez v. Pliler, </em>341 F.3d 897, 903 (9th Cir.2003). AEDPA requires this court to \u201cdefer to the state court\u2019s determination of the federal issues unless that determination is \u2018contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Himes, </em>336 F.3d at 852 (quoting <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003)). A state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d federal law if it \u201c(1) applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in Supreme Court cases, or (2) confronts a set of facts materially indistinguishable from a Supreme Court decision and nevertheless arrives at a different result.\u201d <em>Ramirez v. Castro, </em>365 F.3d 755, 762 (9th Cir.2004). A state court decision involves an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of federal law \u201cif it correctly identifies the governing rule but unreasonably applies it to a new set of facts or fails to extend a clearly established legal principle to a new context in a way that is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Himes, </em>336 F.3d at 852 (citations omitted). We review the California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination of the federal issues on direct appeal because it is the last reasoned deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>sion in this case. <em>See Shackleford v. Hubbard, </em>234 F.3d 1072, 1079 n. 2 (9th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Ylst v. Nunnemaker, </em>501 U.S. 797, 803, 111 S.Ct. 2590, 115 L.Ed.2d 706 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">We have held in a habeas case that a trial judge\u2019s knowing dismissal of the sole holdout for acquittal did not violate the Sixth Amendment when the record reflected the discharged juror\u2019s \u201cinability to continue performing the essential function of a juror \u2014 deliberation.\u201d <em>Perez v. Marshall, </em>119 F.3d 1422, 1427 (9th Cir.1997). Further, on habeas review, \u201ca trial court\u2019s findings regarding juror fitness are entitled to special deference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1426. The record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Juror 9 was unable to follow the court\u2019s instruction to disregard penalty in reaching a verdict. Juror 9 was evasive when asked about her ability to put the penalty out of her mind and to consider only the evidence in the case, and two other jurors stated that Juror 9 changed her verdict from guilty to not guilty after learning from the verdict form that the charged crime was a felony. Our decision in <em>Sanders v. Lamarque, 357 F.3d 943 </em>(9th Cir.2004), does not compel a contrary conclusion. In <em>Sanders, </em>unlike this case, the trial court\u2019s basis for removing a holdout juror \u2014 untruthfulness during voir dire\u2014 was an \u201cobjectively unreasonable determination of the relevant facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-15\">The state court\u2019s decision is neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent. By dismissing Juror 9 after finding that she was unable to follow instructions, the trial court did not violate Young\u2019s right to a jury composed of <em>\u201cjurors </em>who will conscientiously apply the law and find the facts.\u201d <em>Lockhart v. McCree, </em>476 U.S. 162, 178, 106 S.Ct. 1758, 90 L.Ed.2d 137 (1986). The Supreme Court has held that a trial court\u2019s inquiry into the numerical division of a deadlocked jury is inherently coercive and deprives a defendant of his right to a fair trial. <em>See Brasfield v. United States, </em>272 U.S. 448, 450, 47 S.Ct. 135, 71 L.Ed. 345 (1926); <em>see also Burton v. United States, </em>196 U.S. 283, 307-08, 25 S.Ct. 243, 49 L.Ed. 482 (1905). However, the Supreme Court has not held that a trial court\u2019s knowing discharge of a holdout juror who is unable to follow instructions violates the Sixth Amendment when the trial judge inadvertently acquires his knowledge of the jury\u2019s numerical division.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b102-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
