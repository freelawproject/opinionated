Abcouwer sued his former employer, NiSource, Inc., seeking termination benefits under his employment contract. Following a jury verdict in favor of Abcouwer, NiSource filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a new trial. The district court denied the motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">NiSource argues that no reasonable jury could find that Abcouwer was entitled to termination benefits under the contract. Shortly before Abcouwer\u2019s termination, NiSource, a utilities company, was involved in a series of complex mergers and acquisitions involving several holding companies and another utilities company. Under his contract, Abcouwer was not entitled to termination benefits if he was a \u201cparticipant in a group effecting\u201d the acquisition of NiSource. NiSource contends that Abcouwer cannot recover termination benefits because Abcouwer was a \u201cparticipant in a group effecting\u201d the acquisition as a matter of law.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of NiSource\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Abcouwer, the nonmoving party. <em>See Babcock v. BellSouth Adver. &amp; Publ\u2019g Corp., </em>348 F.3d 73, 76 (4th Cir.2003). Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate after trial only when \u201cthere is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">We conclude that there was a legally sufficient basis for the jury to find that Abcouwer was not a \u201cparticipant in a group effecting\u201d the acquisition of Ni-Source. The district court found this phrase to be unambiguous, and neither party has appealed that determination. The district court instructed the jury to give the words \u201cparticipant,\u201d \u201cgroup,\u201d and \u201ceffecting\u201d their plain and ordinary meanings. It was proper for the court to allow the jury to determine whether Abcouwer was a \u201cparticipant in a group effecting\u201d the acquisition based on the facts presented at trial. Although the evidence showed that Abcouwer performed certain tasks assigned to him by his superiors at Ni-Source, the jury could have reasonably concluded that he was not a member of the select group of top executives that actually planned and effected the acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-16\">NiSource also argues that the district abused its discretion by improperly instructing the jury. We have reviewed the jury instruction in question and find no abuse of discretion. <em>See Chaudhry v. Gallerizzo, </em>174 F.3d 394, 408 (4th Cir.1999) (\u2018We review challenges to jury instructions for abuse of discretion. The test of the adequacy of jury instructions is whether the jury charge, construed as a whole, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>adequately states the controlling legal principle without misleading or confusing the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Because we conclude that there was a legally sufficient basis for the jury\u2019s verdict and find no abuse of discretion in the jury instructions, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of NiSource\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b593-11\"> Because we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found that Abcouwer was not a \"participant in a group effecting\u201d the acquisition, we need not determine the separate issue of whether NiSource was actually acquired.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
