Petrov, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) decision affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order of removal and denial of his asylum, withholding of removal, and the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) claims. Petitioner\u2019s removal proceedings commenced after April 1, 1997, and therefore the permanent rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208,110 Stat. 3009 (1996) apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-18\">On appeal, Petrov claims that he qualified for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief. He argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was erroneous because the IJ essentially took administrative notice when he decided that without the existence of corroborating documents, Petrov could have not been attacked by the Russian nationalists for religious reasons. Petrov claims that his testimony was not only detailed, internally consistent, and corroborated with abundant evidence, but also plausible in light of the 2001 Country Report and Religious Freedom Report. Petrov also claims that he was entitled to relief under CAT because the Russian government ignores the persecution of religious groups by the neo-Nazis.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-19\">The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and this Court \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>(11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). Here, the BIA both adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning and made its own observations, so this Court should review the BIA\u2019s order and the IJ\u2019s order, to the extent the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning. <em>Id. </em>at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Credibility determinations likewise are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test. <em>D-Muhumed v. United States Attorney General, </em>388 F.3d 814, 817-18 (11th Cir.2004). The trier of fact must determine credibility, and this Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn immigration judge alone is in a position to observe an alien\u2019s tone and demean- or, to explore inconsistencies in testimony, and to apply workable and consistent standards in the evaluation of testimonial evidence.\u201d Sarv<em>ia-Quintanilla v. U.S. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1387, 1395 (9th Cir.1985) (persuasive authority); <em>accord Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 587, 597 (3d Cir.2003) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of his religion (or other statutorily listed factor), or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his religion (or other statutorily listed factor) will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. A \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution may be established by showing (1) past persecution that creates a presumption of a well-founded fear and overcomes any rebuttal by the INS, (2) a reasonable possibility of personal persecution that cannot be avoided by relocating within the subject country, or (3) a pattern or practice in the subject country of persecuting members of a statutorily defined group of which the alien is a part. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), (2). The \u2018Veil-founded fear\u201d inquiry has both a subjective and objective component \u2014 that is, the applicant must show that his fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. The subjective component is generally satisfied by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution. <em>Id. </em>This Court noted that \u201cin most cases, the objective prong can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a \u2018good reason to fear future persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">An alien\u2019s uncorroborated but credible testimony alone may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819. However, the weaker the applicant\u2019s testimony, the more compelling is the need for corroborative documentary or other testimonial evidence. <em>Matter of Y-D-, </em>21 I &amp; N Dec. 1136, 1138, 1998 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>99554 (BIA 1998). \u201c \u2018[I]f the trier of fact either does not believe the applicant or does not know what to believe, the applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate his testimony can be fatal to his asylum application.\u2019\u201d <em>Forgue v. Attorney General, </em>401 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1090 (9th Cir.2000)). An adverse credibility finding must go to the heart of the asylum claim, and not be based on minor discrepancies, inconsistencies, and omissions. <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002) (persuasive authority); <em>see also Pop v. INS, </em>270 F.3d 527, 531 (7th Cir.2001) (same); <em>Chen v. INS, </em>266 F.3d 1094, 1098 (9th Cir.2001) (same), <em>vacated on other grounds by </em>537 U.S. 1016, 123 S.Ct. 549, 154 L.Ed.2d 423 (2002). An adverse credibility finding, supported by substantial evidence, may be sufficient to a petition for review. <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819. The IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">An alien seeking withholding of removal under the INA must show that his life or freedom would \u201cmore likely than not\u201d be threatened upon return to his country because of, among other things, his religion. <em>Mendoza v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). The burden of proof under CAT is higher than the burden imposed on an asylum applicant. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">While it is true that the majority of the inconsistencies the IJ identified in Petrov\u2019s testimony and the asylum application were minor or were not actually inconsistencies, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence because two were true inconsistencies and they were related to his claims that Captain Melnichenko used neo-Nazis to persecute him based on his religion, which is the heart of his claim. First, Petrov claimed that he was attacked and beaten by five persons, allegedly hired by Federal Security Service (FSB) Captain Melnichenko, on March 3, 1994. They called him a \u201ctraitor\u201d and a \u201cdirty person of a different faith.\u201d The attack occurred a day after Petrov refused to report to Melnichenko about the foreign students at his school because, he testified, he was influenced by his mother\u2019s religion, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, not to get involved with the government. However, this attack probably was not motivated by Petrov\u2019s faith because he did not engage in any Jehovah\u2019s Witness activity until September 1994, and Melnichenko did not know this was the reason that Petrov refused to become a snitch. Second, even though in his asylum application Petrov claimed that the FSB often used the neo-Nazis to watch the \u201copposition people and simply beat them up,\u201d there was no evidence in the record supporting his assertion. Even though Petrov stated that during the threatening phone calls that started after he refused to cooperate with Melnichenko the neo-Nazis referred to a \u201crespected person,\u201d this evidence does not compel us to reject the IJ\u2019s finding that there was no connection between Melnichenko and the threatening phone calls, the vandalism of his mailbox and door, and the assault on his father by the neo-Nazis.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Additionally, even if Petrov\u2019s testimony were credible, his asylum claim fails because his fear of persecution was not objectively reasonable because the government carried its burden of proof by showing that he could escape the persecution by relocating within Russia. Finally, Petrov\u2019s withholding of removal and CAT claims also fail because he was unable to meet the burden of proof required for asylum, which is a lower burden than that required for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Upon review of the record, and having considered the brief of the parties, we discern no reversible error. For all the foregoing reasons, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision, and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
