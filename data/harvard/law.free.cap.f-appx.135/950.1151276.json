Danoff filed a complaint seeking a refund of income taxes in the amount of $22,382, which he asserted he overpaid in connection with his 1996 federal income tax return. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Cement Masons Health &amp; Welfare Trust Fund for No. Calif. v. Stone, </em>197 F.3d 1003, 1005 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-16\">The district court properly concluded that because Danoff did not file his claim for a tax refund within statutory three-year period, the refund claim was untimely under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6511(b). The district court therefore correctly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over DanofPs tax refund action. <em>See Imperial Plan, Inc. v. United States, </em>95 F.3d 25, 26 (9th Cir.1996) (affirming dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction where taxpayer failed to file a timely administrative tax refund claim under section 6511); <em>Zeier v. United States, </em>80 F.3d 1360, 1364 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that \u00a7 6511(b)(2)(A) is jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-17\">Danoff contends that the IRS should be equitably estopped from denying his refund claim because a IRS agents told him during a telephone inquiry that he had four years to file his tax return. Section 6511, however, is not subject to equitable exceptions. <em>See United States v. Brockamp, </em>519 U.S. 347, 354, 117 S.Ct. 849, 136 L.Ed.2d 818 (1997), (\u201cCongress did not intend courts to read other unmentioned, open-ended, \u2018equitable\u2019 exceptions into the statute that it wrote.\u201d); <em>see also Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[I]f a time limit is jurisdictional, it is not subject to the defenses of waiver, equitable tolling or equitable estoppel, although there may still be exceptions based on \u2018unique circumstances\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b977-14\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
