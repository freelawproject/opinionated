After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 arguments, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">1. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Kennerson, an African-American, was hired by St. Martin Parish School Board in May of 1996, upon the recommendations of the superintendent and Billy Guidry, Kennerson\u2019s soon-to-be supervisor. Kennerson\u2019s new position was as the St. Martin Parish school system Senior Computer Programmer.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">When Kennerson took the St. Martin Parish job, he knew that he was not familiar with the computer systems or programs used by the parish school system. Between 1997 and 2002, Appellees grew increasingly dissatisfied with Kennerson\u2019s performance. Despite Appellees\u2019 provision of several formal opportunities for Kennerson to remedy his deficiencies, Kennerson was terminated in July of 2002. A person outside Kennerson\u2019s protected class was hired to fill the St. Martin Parish School Board Senior Computer Programmer position.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Prior to his termination, and during the several attempts at remediation, Kennerson filed two complaints of race discrimination and retaliation with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). After Kennerson was terminated, and after he received his right to sue letter, he timely filed this suit in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">Upon motion by Appellees, the district court granted summary judgment against Kennerson on both his Title VII discrimination and retaliation claims. Kennerson timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">This court reviews a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and applies the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> District courts properly grant summary judgment if, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, the movant shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-14\">III. Analysis and Conclusions</p>\n<p id=\"b666-15\">Like the district court, we assume for the purposes of this appeal that Kennerson has established both of his prima facie claims of Title VII race discrimination and retaliation arising from his termination. Aso like the district court, we conclude that Kennerson has failed to rebut the Appellees\u2019 contention that his termination was the result of a legitimate non-discriminatory reason, viz., Appellees\u2019 dissatisfaction with Kennerson\u2019s performance. Under the McDonnell-Douglas<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> burden shifting paradigm for Title VII discrimination and retaliation claims,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> this failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>entitles Appellees to summary judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">First, there is no question that Appellees have articulated their legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the termination with sufficient clarity to afford Kennerson a realistic opportunity to show that the reason was pretextual.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Second, Kennerson does not present any summary judgment evidence to dispute the Appellees\u2019 legitimate non-discriminatory reason for his termination. His own deposition and affidavit testimony concedes that he had difficulty performing his job and that several of his co-workers were rather disappointed with his performance. More importantly, Kennerson does not point to any record evidence showing a non-African-American was treated differently by Appellees under any substantially similar circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Ultimately, Kennerson only offers a subjective belief that his termination was motivated by race discrimination and retaliation because his problems allegedly began after he \u201cclashed\u201d with a white co-worker and he was fired after he filed complaints with the EEOC. Not only is a Title VII employment discrimination or retaliation plaintiffs subjective belief an insufficient defense to a summary judgment motion,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in this case, that subjective belief is refuted by the undisputed record evidence showing that: (1) performance deficiencies were being documented by Kennerson\u2019s supervisor two years before Kennerson\u2019s clash and well before he filed his first EEOC complaint; (2) the pre-clash, and pre-EEOC complaint performance deficiencies are of the same variety as those deficiencies documented post-clash and post-EEOC complaint; and, (3) there was no marked increase in the documented deficiencies following the clash or the filing of the EEOC complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">Kennerson does not argue that Appellees\u2019 summary judgment evidence regarding their legitimate non-discriminatory reason was manufactured, post-hoc, in order to justify firing him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, though Kennerson contends that his performance had in fact improved, and that Guidry and the School Board incorrectly believed he was underperforming, \u201ceven an incorrect belief that an employee\u2019s performance is inadequate constitutes a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason [and] ... a dispute in the evidence concerning [the employee\u2019s] job performance does not provide a sufficient basis for a reasonable factfinder to infer that [the employer\u2019s] proffered justification is unworthy of credence.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">Therefore, because Kennerson offers no summary judgment evidence to substantiate his subjective belief that his termination was due to discriminatory animus or retaliation, he is unable to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Appellees\u2019 proffered legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the termination decision was pretext. Accordingly, summary judgment for the Appellees is warranted and the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b665-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
