The Court remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-26\">Both parties have submitted supplemental letter briefs addressing the implications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>of <em>Booker, </em>if any, to the facts and circumstances of this case. This Court has recently reaffirmed its \u201c \u2018well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.2001)). Although neither <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) nor <em>Booker </em>had been decided at the time of the filing of Morales\u2019s initial brief in this Court, it is undisputed that Morales had failed to challenge the constitutionality of the sentencing guidelines or his sentencing proceeding in general pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) in his initial brief in this Court. His <em>Booker </em>claim challenging his sentence is therefore deemed abandoned. <em>See Dockery, </em>401 F.3d at 1262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Accordingly, after our reconsideration of this case in light of <em>Booker, </em>we reinstate our previous opinion and affirm Morales\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">OPINION REINSTATED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
