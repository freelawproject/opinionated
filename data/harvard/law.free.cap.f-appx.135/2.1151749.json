Before trial, Rodriguez-Zuniga filed a motion to suppress the statements alleging police had not given him <em>Miranda </em>warnings before questioning him. After a hearing, the district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> denied Rodriguez-Zuniga\u2019s motion, finding \u201cno support for [his] claim that [he] was interrogated, or that he made any incriminating statements, prior to being given <em>Miranda </em>warnings by law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>enforcement.\u201d The statements were admitted at trial, and a jury convicted Rodriguez-Zuniga of conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Rodriguez-Zuniga now appeals his conviction arguing their admission violates <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Under <em>Miranda, </em>the Government may not use statements made during custodial interrogations unless the defendant has previously been advised of his Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination and right to an attorney <em>Id. </em>at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602. Rodriguez-Zuniga contends the district court should have granted his motion to suppress, either before or during the trial, or his request for a mistrial, because the officers did not advise him of his Fifth Amendment privilege before he made the incriminating statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">At the hearing on Rodriguez-Zuniga\u2019s motion to suppress, the federal agents who conducted the interview testified Rodriguez-Zuniga was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights before questioning. The agents stated that although the time of the <em>Miranda </em>waiver was noted on one form as 4:41 p.m., the agents had finished the interview by 4:34 and the notation was a mistake. One agent\u2019s notes indicated the <em>Miranda </em>warning was given at 3:25 p.m., and both agents agreed that was the correct time. The district court credited the agents\u2019 testimony, finding Rodriguez-Zuniga had been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings before making his incriminating statements and the 4:41 notation was an inadvertent error.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">We defer to the district court\u2019s finding that the agents\u2019 testimony was credible. <em>United States v. Lockett, </em>393 F.3d 834, 837-38 (8th Cir.2005). Given the agents\u2019 testimony, the district court\u2019s finding that Rodriguez-Zuniga received Miranda warnings before questioning is not clearly erroneous. See <em>United States v. Terry, </em>400 F.3d 575, 579 (8th Cir.2005) (standard of review). Thus, Rodriguez-Zuniga\u2019s incriminating statements were not obtained in violation of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">Because the district court properly denied Rodriguez-Zuniga\u2019s motion to suppress and motion for a mistrial, we affirm Rodriguez-Zuniga\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b28-16\"> The Honorable James E.
