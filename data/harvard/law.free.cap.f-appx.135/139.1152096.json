SEYMOUR, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b165-28\">Felipe Meza-Hernandez, a federal prisoner appearing <em>pro se, </em>filed a motion for a reduction of his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court refused to grant the motion or a certificate of appealability (COA). Because Mr. MezaHernandez has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, we deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-29\">Issuance of a COA is jurisdictional. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 335-36, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). To be entitled to a COA, Mr. Meza-Hernandez must make \u201ca substantial showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(2). To make the requisite showing, Mr. Meza-Hernandez must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029 (quotations omitted). In deciding whether Mr. Meza-Hernandez has carried his burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of his claims. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029. Although Mr. Meza-Hernandez need not demonstrate that his appeal will succeed to be entitled to COA, he must \u201cprove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Mr. Meza-Hernandez pled guilty to illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Pursuant to the guidelines, his base level offense was eight. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a) (2003). Mr. Meza-Hernandez\u2019s offense level was enhanced sixteen levels due to the district court\u2019s finding that he was previously deported subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). The district court also applied a three level decrease because Mr. Meza-Hernandez accepted responsibility for his actions, yielding a total base offense level of twenty-one. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. Based on that offense level and a criminal history category of IV, Mr. Meza-Hernandez\u2019s sentencing range was 57 to 71 months. The district court sentenced him at the bottom of that range to 57 months imprisonment followed by 36 months of supervised release. Mr. Meza-Hernandez timely filed for habeas relief. The district court dismissed his petition and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Mr. Meza-Hernandez first argues that his sentence was unconstitutional because it was enhanced based on a prior aggravated felony conviction that was not pled in his indictment. Mr. Meza-Hernandez\u2019s indictment charged him with one count of reentry by a previously removed felon in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. If a defendant has a previous aggravated felony conviction, \u00a7 1326(b), which carries a maximum sentence of twenty years, applies. The district court determined \u00a7 1326(b) applied and enhanced Mr. MezaHernandez\u2019s sentence sixteen levels due to its finding that he had a prior felony drug trafficking conviction. Although an indictment must set forth each element of the crime it charges, the Supreme Court has explicitly held that the constitution does not require Congress to treat recidivism as an element of the offense. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Therefore, the government\u2019s failure to plead Mr. Meza-Hernandez\u2019s drug trafficking conviction in his indictment does not constitute constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Relying primarily on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), Mr. Meza-Hernandez also argues that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines are unconstitutional insofar as they allowed the district court to enhance his sentence based on prior convictions that were neither admitted nor proven to the jury. The Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applying the rule of <em>Blakely </em>to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, bears directly on Mr. Meza-Hernandez\u2019s argument. New rules of criminal procedure, however, are applied retroactively only to cases pending on direct re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>view or cases that are not yet final. <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 328, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987). Mr. Meza-Hernandez exhausted his direct appeal and his case was \u201cfinal\u201d prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker. See id. </em>at 321 n. 6, 107 S.Ct. 708 (a case is final when \u201ca judgment of conviction has been rendered, the availability of appeal exhausted, and the time for a petition for certiorari elapsed or a petition for certiorari finally denied\u201d). Thus, <em>Blakely </em>and the Supreme Court\u2019s more recent decision in <em>Booker </em>have no applicability to Mr. Meza-Hernandez\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Price, </em>400 F.3d 844, 849 (10th Cir.2005) <em>(Blakely </em>is not retroactively applicable to a case in which conviction was final before <em>Blakely </em>was decided); <em>United States v. Mora, </em>293 F.3d 1213, 1219 (10th Cir.2002) <em>(Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable to initial habeas petitions).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Mr. Meza-Hernandez\u2019s final contention is that his attorney was constitutionally ineffective for failing to advise him of his right to attack his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In order to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim, a petitioner must demonstrate both that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient and the deficiencies prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). A showing of prejudice requires a demonstration of \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. As Mr. Meza-Hernandez has raised no meritorious \u00a7 2255 claim, his allegations are simply insufficient to meet the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland. See Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.1991) (ruling that even <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs must allege sufficient facts on which a recognized legal claim can be based, and that conclusory allegations will not suffice).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY Mr. Meza-Hernandez\u2019s application for a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
