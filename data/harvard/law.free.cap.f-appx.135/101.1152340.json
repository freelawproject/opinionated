INS, </em>79 F.3d 908, 911 (9th Cir.1996). The IJ gave three reasons for her credibility finding. First, the IJ found that although Assefa claimed persecution on account of his half-Eritrean ethnicity, he testified that people unfamiliar with him would not know that he was half-Eritrean just by looking at him. This finding does nothing to impugn Assefa\u2019s credibility, as it ignores the other means of ascertaining an individual\u2019s ethnicity available to the government, including government records, birth records, and identity cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-15\">The IJ\u2019s second reason for questioning Assefa\u2019s credibility is grounded upon the IJ\u2019s patent misunderstanding of Assefa\u2019s testimony regarding the passport he used to enter the United States. The record reflects that Assefa\u2019s actual testimony at the hearing was consistent with both his affidavit submitted in support of his asylum application and his pre-hearing statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-16\">Finally, the IJ concluded that the identity card presented by Assefa in support of his asylum application was a fraudulent document because of what she perceived to be a discrepancy between the place of birth listed on the card (Chercher) and the city identified by Assefa in his testimony, asylum application, and pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>hearing statement (Dese). Substantial evidence does not support the finding that the document is fraudulent. The . IJ cited nothing beyond the supposed discrepancy to support her finding. There is no evidence in the record that the identity card appeared to have been doctored or tampered with, nor is there forensic evidence that the card is a fake.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The IJ simply assumed that Dese and Chercher are both cities, as opposed to a city and an administrative area, respectively. The IJ\u2019s assumption finds no foundation in-the record. Indeed, the Ethiopian map accompanying the Country Conditions Report shows Dese to be a city. Chercher is not shown.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, the IJ\u2019s conjecture fails to take into account the recent changes in geo-political boundaries in Ethiopia, as reflected in the record. <em>See, e.g., </em>1999 Country Report on Human Rights Practices (discussing Ethiopia\u2019s continuing transition from a unitary to a federal system of government and the resulting creation of \u201cnew federal regions, organized along ethnic lines\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Finally, in explaining why Chercher appears on his identity card, Assefa testified that Chercher denotes his father\u2019s ethnicity. The record does not support the rejection of this plausible explanation. An adverse credibility finding cannot be sustained without first considering plausible and reasonable explanations for any perceived inconsistencies. <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 1015, 1022 (9th Cir.2003); <em>see also Chen v. INS, </em>266 F.3d 1094, 1099 (9th Cir.2001) (reversing BIA\u2019s ruling that birth certificates were counterfeit where there were other plausible reasons to account for discrepancy), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>537 U.S. 1016, 123 S.Ct. 549, 154 L.Ed.2d 423 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">None of the three grounds articulated by the IJ as the basis for her adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we reverse the credibility finding. <em>See Ding v. Ashcroft, </em>387 F.3d 1131, 1133 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that when the \u201cbases for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding are either unsupported or contradicted by the record evidence, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence\u201d). In case no. 03-71905, we grant the petition and remand to the BIA for further proceedings to determine the merits of Assefa\u2019s case. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">In case no. 03-74421, Assefa petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen for adjustment of status on account of his recent marriage to a United States citizen. The BIA ruled that Assefa failed to satisfy the procedural requirements of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1), because he did not submit a complete application for adjustment of status, and further that Assefa failed to present clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood that the marriage is bona fide. This ruling is not an abuse of the BIA\u2019s discretion, <em>see Konstantinova v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 528, 529 (9th Cir.1999), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Petition for Review of the Final Order of Removal GRANTED, REMANDED; Petition for Review of the BIA\u2019s Denial of Motion to Reopen DENIED.</p>\n<author id=\"b130-4\">WALLACE, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">I agree that Assefa\u2019s petition for review in case no. 03-74421 should be denied. However, I do not agree that the finding of the Immigration Judge (IJ) that Assefa\u2019s identity card was fraudulent was not supported by substantial evidence. I therefore respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s reversal of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding in case no. 03-71905.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">As the majority points out, Assefa\u2019s testimony, asylum application, and pre-hearing statement, all indicated that he was born in Dese, while the identity card that he presented listed Chercher as his place of birth. The majority concludes, however, that this discrepancy does not provide substantial evidence for the IJ\u2019s finding that the identity card was fraudulent for three reasons: (1) there is no evidence that the card was doctored or tampered with, or forensic evidence that the card is a fake; (2) the IJ incorrectly assumed that Dese and Chercher are both cities, as opposed to a city and an administrative area, respectively, and did not take into account \u201crecent changes in geo-political boundaries in Ethiopia\u201d; and (3) the IJ improperly rejected Assefa\u2019s supposedly \u201cplausible\u201d explanation that Chercher denotes his father\u2019s ethnicity. None of these three reasons justify reversal of the adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">As for the first reason, the majority does not cite any case holding that an IJ may not conclude that a document is fraudulent without evidence of doctoring or tampering. Nor am I aware of such a case. In my view, the discrepancy regarding Assefa\u2019s place of birth was a significant one that, in the absence of any reasonable explanation, supported a finding that the document was fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The majority\u2019s second reason is an attempt to offer a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy. <em>See Chen v. INS, </em>266 F.3d 1094, 1100 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cAll plausible and reasonable explanations for any inconsistencies must be considered.\u201d), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>537 U.S. 1016, 123 S.Ct. 549, 154 L.Ed.2d 423 (2002). The majority holds that the IJ should have realized that Dese is a city and Chercher is an administrative area. Of course, this would explain the discrepancy only if one could conclude that Dese is or was located in the administrative area of Chercher. Instead of citing evidence from the record (or from anywhere) directly supporting that conclusion, the majority asserts that the geo-political boundaries in Ethiopia are changing. Apparently, this is meant to imply that Dese <em>might </em>be or have been located in Chercher. But on what factual basis? I cannot join the majority in faulting the IJ for failing to consider such a possibility which, in my view, is wholly speculative. The petitioner did not bring it up \u2014 only the majority does. (Indeed, the majority\u2019s suggestion that Dese might be or have been in Chercher is inconsistent with Assefa\u2019s own explanation for the discrepancy, i.e., that Chercher identifies his father\u2019s ethnicity.) An IJ\u2019s duty is to consider <em>plausible </em>explanations for inconsistencies, <em>see id., </em>not implausible or purely speculative ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">Third, the majority holds that the IJ should not have rejected Assefa\u2019s explanation \u201cthat Chercher denotes his father\u2019s ethnicity.\u201d As an initial matter, this is not exactly what Assefa said; rather, he alternatively stated that Chercher was his father\u2019s ethnic group and his father\u2019s place of birth. In any event, even putting aside Assefa\u2019s vacillating testimony, the IJ properly rejected Assefa\u2019s assertion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Chercher described his father\u2019s ethnicity. Chercher is listed on the identity card directly below a line stating \u201cBirth Place Zone\u201d and right next to a line stating \u201cparticular place,\u201d indicating that the space in which \u201cChercher\u201d was entered was reserved for the ID-holder\u2019s birth place, not the ethnicity of the ID-holder\u2019s father. Further, another line on the card states \u201cEthnicity Tigraye,\u201d and it would not make much sense for the identity card to have two separate ethnicity-related entries. Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, the record amply supports the IJ\u2019s rejection of Assefa\u2019s implausible explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In conclusion, I do not feel compelled to reverse the adverse credibility finding. <em>See id. </em>at 1098 (\u201cThe factual findings underlying [an] adverse credibility determination will be upheld on review unless \u2018any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B))). I think it wrong to fault the IJ for failing to consider alternative explanations for the discrepancy between the identity card and other record evidence when the majority itself cannot come up with a plausible explanation that is consistent with Assefa\u2019s own explanation. I also conclude that the IJ properly rejected Assefa\u2019s illogical explanation for the discrepancy. The discrepancy provided a reasonable basis for the IJ\u2019s finding that the identity card was fraudulent. Therefore, substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. I respectfully dissent in case no. 03-71905.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b128-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\">.
