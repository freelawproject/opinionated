We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Moore v. Brewster, </em>96 F.3d 1240, 1243 (9th Cir.1996) (dismissal based on judicial immunity); <em>Lite-On Peripherals, Inc. v. Burlington Aire Express, Inc., </em>255 F.3d 1189, 1192 (9th Cir.2001) (summary judgment). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-15\">The district court properly dismissed Schreiner\u2019s claims against Judge Hulbert because a state judge is entitled to absolute immunity for judicial actions taken within his jurisdiction. <em>See Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Med., </em>363 F.3d 916, 922-23 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-16\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Schreiner\u2019s claims against McCanna because Schreiner failed to prove McCanna was a state actor. <em>See Simmons v. Sacramento County Superior </em>Court, 318 F.3d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that plaintiff cannot sue opposing counsel under section 1983, \u201cbecause he is a lawyer in private practice who was not acting under color of state law\u201d and \u201c[p]laintiffs conclusory allegations that the lawyer was conspiring with state officers to deprive him of due process are insufficient\u201d) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-17\">The district court properly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Schreiner\u2019s request for declaratory relief voiding the state court judgment as that would require an impermissible review of a final state court judgment. <em>See Doe &amp; </em>Assocs. <em>Law Offices v. Napolitano, </em>252 F.3d 1026, 1029 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b989-13\"><em> </em>This disposition, is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
