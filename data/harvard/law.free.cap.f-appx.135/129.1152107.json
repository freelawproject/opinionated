The sentence was imposed under the Sentencing Guidelines based on facts that were not admitted by Defendant or determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">After the district court imposed Defendant\u2019s sentence, the Supreme Court held that in order to avoid a violation of a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights by the imposition of mandatory sentence enhancements based on judge-found facts, the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory, not mandatory. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Consequently, we remand Defendant\u2019s sentence so the district court can determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed would have been materially different had the district court known that the Guidelines were advisory.\u201d <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073, 1074 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc). The district court should follow the procedures outlined in <em>Ameline.
