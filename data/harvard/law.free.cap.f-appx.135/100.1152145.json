We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-28\">Bailey contends that the district court abused its discretion in failing to decide his case within six months. We disagree. Bailey points to no case law that gives district corut\u2019s such a time constraint. Cf<em>. </em>Rule 4 of Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Bailey also contends that the district court should have given him the option to stay and hold his petition in abeyance while he exhausted his claims in state court. We disagree. A federal district court need not explain habeas procedure to a litigant. <em>See Pliler v. Ford, </em>542 U.S. 225, 124 S.Ct. 2441, 2445-46, 159 L.Ed.2d 338 (2004). Furthermore, because Bailey\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was wholly unexhausted, the district court had nothing to stay after dismissal. <em>Cf. James v. Pliler, </em>269 F.3d 1124, 1126-27 <em>(citing Calderon v. United States District Court (Taylor), </em>134 F.3d 981, 988 (9th Cir.1998)) (\u201cIn <em>Taylor, </em>we held that a district court may, in its discretion, allow a petitioner to amend a mixed petition by deleting the unexhausted claims, hold the exhausted claims in abeyance until the unexhausted claims are exhausted, and then allow the petitioner to amend the stayed petition to add the nowexhausted claims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Bailey also contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling because his \u00a7 2254 petition was pending in the district court for 8 months. Because Bailey failed to raise this argument in the district court, it is waived. <em>See Jiminez v. Rice, </em>276 F.3d 478, 481 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b126-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
