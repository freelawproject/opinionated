Restani, Chief Judge of the United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b990-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-22\">Geovani Andrade-Rivera collaterally attacks the deportation order underlying his conviction for being a deported alien found in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, and challenges his sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We affirm Andrade\u2019s conviction but remand his sentence pursuant to <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-25\">To successfully challenge the deportation order underlying his conviction for violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, Andrade must demonstrate that \u201c \u2018(1) his due process rights were violated by defects in his underlying deportation proceeding, and (2) he suffered prejudice as a result of the defects.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Muro-Inclan, </em>249 F.3d 1180, 1182 (9th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). Andrade\u2019s challenge fails because even if we were to assume that the immigration judge violated Andrade\u2019s due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>process rights, Andrade suffered no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">To establish prejudice, Andrade must show that he had \u201ca \u2018plausible\u2019 ground for relief\u2019 under section 212(h) \u201cif he had sought such relief at the time of his underlying deportation proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1185 (citation omitted). To do so, Andrade \u201cmust make a showing that his deportation would impose an \u2018extreme hardship\u2019 on the citizen,\u201d here his estranged wife or his daughter. <em>Id. </em>at 1184 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Andrade\u2019s showing is insufficient. He claims that he could have succeeded in demonstrating \u201cextreme hardship\u201d at the time he was deported because his citizen daughter \u201cwould grow up completely without a father.\u201d In an attempt to bolster his claim, he adds that the negative impact of his deportation would be exacerbated by the economic hardship his separation would cause his daughter. These claims, however, are nothing more than the \u201c \u2018common results of the deportation of a convict\u2019 \u201d and \u201cdo not constitute\u201d a \u201cplausible showing of extreme hardship.\u201d <em>United States v. Jimenez-Borja, </em>378 F.3d 853, 859 (9th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 678, 160 L.Ed.2d 511 (citation omitted). Moreover, the record demonstrates a lack of meaningful ties to his immediate family, for reasons known to the appellant but not necessary to publish in this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">Finally, we remand the sentencing challenges raised by Andrade, pursuant to <em>Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073, 1085, for proceedings consistent with Ameline\u2019s requirements. If Andrade no longer wishes to pursue resentencing, he may \u201copt out\u201d of resentencing by promptly notifying the district court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">AFFIRMED in part and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b990-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
