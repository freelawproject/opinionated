Melendez-Montoya acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but seeks to preserve the issue for review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). However, <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-22\">Melendezr-Montoya also argues that the district court erred by sentencing him under the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines scheme held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As Melendez-Montoya raises his argument for the first time on appeal, review is for plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>error only. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005). Melendez-Montoya has satisfied the first two prongs of the plain error analysis by showing that the district court committed error that was plain. <em>Id. </em>at 733. The error is not a structural one, however, <em>United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), and Melendez-Montoya has not satisfied the third prong of the plain error analysis by showing that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b787-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
