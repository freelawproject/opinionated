He was initially convicted of both burglary and grand theft, however his burglary charge has been dismissed. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, Puskac filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court. Puskac argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that his counsel was constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The district court denied relief and granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on the following ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims: (1) failure to adequately move for judgment of acquittal; (2) failure to investigate the value of the stolen items; (3) failure to object to the jury instruction concerning the burglary charge; and (4) failure to file a motion to recuse and/or petition for writ of mandamus when a continuance was denied. Puskac moved to expand the COA, and this Court granted the motion on the following issue only: \u201cWhether the district court erred in denying as a state law issue not cognizable in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition appellant\u2019s claim that \u2018[h]e received an illegal sentence when the court dismissed the burglary charge, because nothing was left to support the charge of grand theft.\u2019 \u201d We have reviewed the record and the arguments, and we conclude the district court did not err in denying Puskac\u2019s federal habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
