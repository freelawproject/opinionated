We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-21\">\u2018Where, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision while adding its own reasons, we review both decisions.\u201d <em>See Kataria v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107, 1112 (9th Cir.2000). We review for substantial evidence, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-22\">The government contends that because Aghajani\u2019s opening brief failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum based on Aghajani\u2019s failure to comply with fingerprint processing requirements, Aghajani has waived the issue. We agree. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996). The IJ\u2019s fingerprint processing determination is dispositive of Aghajani\u2019s eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-23\">The government also contends that Aghajani is not eligible for withholding of removal because Aghajani failed to establish a clear probability of persecution on account on account of a protected ground. We agree. <em>See Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646, 655 (9th Cir.2000) (citing standard); <em>see also Ochave v. INS, </em>254 F.3d 859, 865-66 (9th Cir.2001) (requiring alien to establish nexus between alleged persecution and protected ground for asylum). Even assuming Aghajani was credible, any mistreatment he experienced occurred because of a personal dispute and was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>based on an enumerated ground. <em>See Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1491 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Aghajani failed to establish eligibility for CAT relief. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b972-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
