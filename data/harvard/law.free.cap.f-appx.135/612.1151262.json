Penn appeals her conviction after a jury trial of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000). She asserts that the district court erred in denying her motions to suppress evidence and to exclude her grand jury testimony. We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix, the transcript of the district court\u2019s ruling from the bench, and the court\u2019s order denying the motions. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">With regard to the denial of the motion to suppress, we conclude that the district court did not err. Penn\u2019s airport encounter with law enforcement officials did not amount to a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996) (stating standard of review for denial of motion to suppress); <em>Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 436-37, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991) (providing standard to determine whether police-citizen encounter amounts to seizure); <em>United States v. Weaver, </em>282 F.3d 302, 309-10 (4th Cir. 2002) (same and setting forth factors to consider). We also agree with the district court that Penn voluntarily consented to a search of her purse and person. <em>See United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 558, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980) (finding that courts should consider age, maturity, and intelligence of defendant in determining whether consent to search was voluntary); <em>United States v. Lattimore, </em>87 F.3d 647, 650 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc) (same and noting that \u201cconditions under which the consent to search was given\u201d also relevant). Nor do we find any abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Penn\u2019s motion to exclude her grand jury testimony. <em>See United States v. Hodge, </em>354 F.3d 305, 312 (4th Cir.2004) (stating standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">Accordingly, we affirm Penn\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
