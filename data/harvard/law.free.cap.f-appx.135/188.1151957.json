O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-16\">Richard Patscheck, a state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>applies for a certificate of appealability (COA) to challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court determined his claims were foreclosed by our holding in <em>Rael v. Williams, </em>223 F.3d 1153 (10th Cir.2000). There being no basis for an appeal, we too deny Patscheck\u2019s application for a COA</p>\n<p id=\"b215-17\">In 1999, Patscheck was transferred from the state prison in southern New Mexico to the Lea County Correctional Facility. Patscheck now claims his incarceration at the Lea County facility violated his constitutional rights under the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because the facility was allegedly an \u201cillegal jail\u201d in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 33-3-3 (1999). (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2C.)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-18\">The issuance of a COA is jurisdictional. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). A COA will issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). \u201cThe COA determination under \u00a7 2253(c) requires an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029. \u201cThis threshold inquiry does not require full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims. In fact, the statute forbids it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Patscheck is not required to prove the merits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>of his case to obtain a COA. However, be must demonstrate \u201csomething more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith on his ... part.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029 (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">As an initial matter, Patscheck contends the plain language of \u00a7 2253 does not require a COA to appeal the denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition. He cites no authority, and apparently ignores our holding to the contrary in <em>Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862 (10th Cir.2000). There, we held \u201ca state prisoner must obtain a COA to appeal the denial of a habeas petition, whether such petition was filed pursuant to \u00a7 2254 or \u00a7 2241, whenever \u2018the detention complained of [in the petition] arises out of process issued by a State court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 867 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A)). The dismissal of Patscheck\u2019s petition is undoubtedly a final order and his detention is unquestionably the result of state action. Therefore, his argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">We turn now to Patscheck\u2019s attempt to distinguish his claim from our holding in <em>Rael v. Williams, supra. </em>In <em>Rael, </em>an inmate at the Lea County facility claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthat Lea County is not in the business of providing correctional or jail services to government entities,\u201d and thus, provision of such services violated N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 33-l-17(B) (Michie 1998 Repl. Pamp.) and infringed upon his rights under the First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. <em>Rael, </em>223 F.3d at 1154 (internal quotation omitted). Relying on <em>Montez, </em>208 F.3d at 866 n. 4, we held the absence of a federal constitutional right to incarceration in any particular prison precluded Rael\u2019s federal claims. <em>Rael, </em>223 F.3d at 1154 (\u201cclaim should be dismissed with prejudice; exhaustion of state court remedies is not required.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Patscheck argues the district court\u2019s reliance on <em>Rael </em>was misplaced because 1) he has not failed to exhaust his state remedies; and 2) his incarceration is in an \u201cillegal county jail,\u201d not a private facility. (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2B.) First, Patscheck misunderstands the relevance of the exhaustion principle here. Exhaustion is not required. Thus, even if he has exhausted his state court remedies, his claim still fails. Second, his attempt to distinguish his claim because he characterizes the Lea County facility as \u201can illegal county jail\u201d rather than a private facility is unavailing. The relationship between the State of New Mexico and the privately operated Lea County Correctional Facility does not change simply because Patscheck chooses a different characterization of that facility. The issue is well-settled. A prisoner has a legally protected interest in the conduct of his keeper, but not in the keeper\u2019s identity. <em>Pischke v. Litscher, </em>178 F.3d 497, 500 (7th Cir.1999). The district court was correct to dismiss this claim on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">We find no legal basis for Patscheck\u2019s claim and therefore DENY a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-14\">. We liberally construe Patscheck\u2019s pro se pleadings and submissions. <em>Ledbetter v. City of Topeka, Kan., </em>318 F.3d 1183, 1187 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-15\">. The district court opened this action as a 28 <em>U.S.C. \u00a7 </em>2254 petition. Upon noting that Patscheck had already filed a \u00a7 2254 petition, the district court transferred the petition to this Court for a ruling to determine whether he had permission to file a second and successive \u00a7 2254 petition. This Court, in appeal No. 03-2237, ruled that Patscheck\u2019s petition fell under \u00a7 2241 rather than \u00a7 2254, vacated the order of transfer and remanded to the district court for further proceedings. On remand, the district court dismissed his claims under \u00a7 2241 with prejudice and dismissed without prejudice his claims of unconstitutional conditions of confinement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
