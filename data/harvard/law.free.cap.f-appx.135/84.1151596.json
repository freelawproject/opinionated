As part of his plea agreement, Defendant expressly waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence, except as to the double jeopardy issue discussed below. Accordingly, Defendant\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s assessment of his criminal history for sentencing purposes must fail. <em>See United States v. Littlejohn, </em>224 F.3d 960, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (enforcing a defendant\u2019s valid waiver of the right to appeal his sentence). Furthermore, Defendant\u2019s claim that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), must also fail be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>cause a change in the law does not transform a valid waiver of the right to appeal into an involuntary or unknowing one. <em>United States v. Cardenas, </em>405 F.3d 1046, 1048 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">2. Defendant argues that the district court should have dismissed one of his sexual abuse charges as violative of the Fifth Amendment double jeopardy clause, because he was convicted in tribal court for the same conduct. This argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Male Juvenile, </em>280 F.3d 1008, 1020 (9th Cir.2002) (citing <em>United States v. Wheeler, </em>435 U.S. 313, 331-32, 98 S.Ct. 1079, 55 L.Ed.2d 303 (1978), for the proposition that an Indian prosecuted in tribal court can be prosecuted in federal court for the same conduct without violating the Fifth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">3. Defendant argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction over his case. He claims that, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a), both the perpetrator and the victim of the crime must be Indians for federal jurisdiction to attach. This claim is belied by both the plain wording of the statute and ornease law. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a) (providing federal jurisdiction where an Indian \u201ccommits against the person or property of another Indian <em>or other person </em>any of the following offenses, namely, [sexual assault]\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Henry v. United States, </em>432 F.2d 114, 117 (9th Cir.1970) (holding that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153 provides for federal jurisdiction over the crimes enumerated in the statute by Indians against non-Indians).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b110-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
