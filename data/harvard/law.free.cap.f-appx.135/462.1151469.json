We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-16\">We may reverse the BIA\u2019s determination for lack of substantial evidence only if no reasonable fact-finder would have made that finding. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 169, 177 </em>(2d Cir.2004). We grant especial deference to findings based on credibility, requiring only that specific, cogent reasons be provided for rejecting the applicant\u2019s testimony, which bear a legitimate nexus to the claim and are valid grounds for disregarding the testimony. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-18\">We have reviewed the record and find that the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. Yang\u2019s own forensic expert reported that the photograph on Yang\u2019s marriage certificate appeared to be a composite, casting doubt on Yang\u2019s testimony that he was present for the photograph. This related to the heart of Yang\u2019s claim because it related to the existence of his marriage, which is an essential element of his claim. Yang contradicted himself regarding what medical procedure was allegedly forced on his wife. This related to the heart of Yang\u2019s claim because it related to whether the Chinese family planning policy was actually applied to Yang, which was the basis of his claim. In both cases the BIA cited specific, cogent reasons which were valid grounds to question the veracity of Yang\u2019s testimony. Given the dearth of credible corroboration of the marriage or forced abortion, the BIA\u2019s finding that Yang therefore failed to establish his claim to asylum or withholding was supported by substantial evidence. We have considered Yang\u2019s remaining arguments and found that they lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-19\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Accordingly, Yang\u2019s motion for a stay of removal is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
