Dilks argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Because Dilks did not renew his motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of all of the evidence, review is limited to determining whether there was \u201ca manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>See United States v. Green, </em>293 F.3d 886, 895 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-20\">\u201cIn order to convict one for felon in possession of a firearm, the government must prove that the defendant (1) has been convicted of a felony; (2) possessed a firearm in or affecting interstate commerce; and (3) knew that he was in possession of the firearm.\u201d <em>United States v. Ybarra, </em>70 F.3d 362, 365 (5th Cir.1995). The parties stipulated that Dilks was a convicted felon. Where the place of a weapon\u2019s discovery is jointly occupied, constructive possession can be found so long as there is some evidence \u201cthat the defendant had knowledge of and access to the weapon or contraband.\u201d <em>United States v. Mergerson, </em>4 F.3d 337, 349 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-21\">A review of the evidence presented at trial indicates that the record is not \u201cdevoid of evidence\u201d of Dilks\u2019s guilt or \u201cso tenuous that a conviction is shocking.\u201d <em>See United States v. Avants, </em>367 F.3d 433, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>449 (5th Cir.2004). Therefore, Dilks has not shown that his conviction would result in \u201ca manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>See Green, </em>293 F.3d at 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Dilks argues that the evidence is insufficient to support the district court\u2019s determination that he had three prior violent felony convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). He does not contend that the government failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that he had 1990 convictions for burglary of a building and injury to a child; instead, he urges that his prior escape conviction is not a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e). We have held that escape is a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a), even if the escape did not involve the use of force. <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>180 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.1999). Several other circuits have held that escape is a violent felony within the meaning of \u00a7 924(e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">We adopt this approach and conclude that escape is a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e). Therefore, the district court did not err in determining that there was sufficient evidence to establish that Dilks had three prior violent felony convictions under \u00a7 924(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Dilks argues that his sentence should be vacated in view of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Because he did not raise this issue in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). Dilks must show (1) an error; (2) that is clear or plain; (3) that affected his substantial rights; and (4) that seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of his judicial proceedings. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">The district court enhanced Dilks\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 924(e) because he had at least three prior violent felony convictions as defined by \u00a7 924(e)(1) and (2)(B)(i) and (ii), including a 1990 conviction for burglary of a building, a 1990 conviction for injury to a child, and a conviction for escape. Under \u00a7 924(e), the mandatory minimum sentence was 15 years or 180 months of imprisonment, and the statutory maximum sentence was life imprisonment. Dilks was sentenced to 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, his offense level was increased to 33 because he had prior convictions for robbery, burglary, burglary of a building, injury to a child, and escape; he was therefore an armed career criminal. His criminal history category was IV. Based on an offense level of 33 and a criminal history category of IV, the applicable sentencing range was 188 to 235 months. Because Dilks was subject to the mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years, he has not shown that his sentence would likely have been different if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>judge had sentenced him under the <em>Booker </em>advisory regime; therefore, he has not shown plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521-22 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. March 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b680-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
