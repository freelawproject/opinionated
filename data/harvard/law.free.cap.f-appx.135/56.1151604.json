Stone appeals the district court\u2019s order sanctioning him sua sponte pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">The Local Rules for the District of Oregon provide that the first paragraph of every motion (save a motion for a temporary restraining order) must certify that \u201c[t]he parties made a good faith effort through personal or telephone conferences to resolve the dispute and have been unable to do so....\u201d LR 7.1(a)(1)(A). In connection with a motion for summary judgment filed on behalf of his client, Stone certified that \u201cthe parties have made good faith efforts through meetings and telephone conferences to resolve the issues raised by this motion but have been unable to do so.\u201d Following an order to show cause and a hearing, the district court determined that Stone\u2019s certification \u201cwas without basis in fact\u201d and cited him for violating Rule 11(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">The district court clearly erred in finding that the certification lacked any basis in fact. Stone had, in fact, conferred with opposing counsel regarding possible resolution of the dispute, both before and shortly after the action was filed. It is true that the latest of these discussions occurred more than six months before Stone filed the motion for summary judgment in question, but Stone\u2019s certification did not say that the conferences occurred shortly before the filing of the motion. LR 7.1(a) is silent on the subject of timing. Though the discussions took place long before the motion itself was prepared, it is not disputed that the discussions covered the same matters that were later raised and argued in the motion for summary judgment. The language of LR 7.1(a) requires only that counsel certify that an effort was made \u201cto resolve the dispute\u201d and although LR 7.1 is titled \u201cMotions Practice \u2014 Generally,\u201d the text of the rule does not specify that the contemplated motion must itself be discussed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">We do not dispute the district court\u2019s interpretation of LR 7.1(a). Violation of a rule does not necessarily constitute violation of Rule 11, however. Though it may have been unreasonable for Stone to have thought that conferences from the distant past satisfied LR 7.1, it simply is not true that his statement was false or, taking his statement as a factual contention, that it did not have, in the words of Rule 11(b)(3), \u201cevidentiary support.\u201d The certification accurately reflected historical events.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-14\">Moreover, the circumstances here were such that it is implausible to conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Stone intended to deceive the court or presented his certification for an improper purpose, which could have constituted a violation of Rule 11(b)(1). Stone\u2019s certification was served on counsel for the opposing party, who necessarily knew what discussions had taken place. As Stone was aware, that opposing attorney was capable of advising the court about when the discussions took place, as in fact he did. The district court might well have concluded at that point that Stone\u2019s certification did not satisfy the requirements of LR 7.1(a)(1) and denied Stone\u2019s summary judgment motion on that ground, as provided in LR 7.1(a)(2). A lawyer\u2019s unreasonable interpretation of a rule can properly result in negative consequences. That is not the issue before us, however. Rule 11 does not authorize sanctions for all conduct of which a court might disapprove.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u201c[S]ua sponte sanctions will ordinarily be imposed only in situations that are akin to a contempt of court.\u201d <em>United Nat'l Ins. Co. v. R &amp; D Latex Corp., </em>242 F.3d 1102, 1116 (9th Cir.2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Stone\u2019s conduct, though perhaps not laudable, was not so \u201cegregious\u201d as to be considered \u201cbeyond the pale.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1116-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b84-10\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-11\">. The dissenting opinion makes reference to a local rule from the Central District of California. We note, though, that the California rule, as quoted by the dissent, is considerably more specific than the rule at issue here in regard to both the timing and the substance of a pre-filing discussion. In particular, it makes explicit reference of action to be taken by counsel \"contemplating the filing of [a] motion,\u201d and requires that the attorneys \"discuss thoroughly ... the substances of the contemplated motion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b85-7\">TASHIMA, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AGV\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"Ach\">Because the majority misreads the record and usurps the district court\u2019s fact-finding function, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">In his amended motion for summary judgment, Stone certified \u201cthat the parties have made good faith efforts through meetings and telephone conferences <em>to resolve the issues raised by the motion </em>but have been unable to do so.\u201d <em>Altamont Summit Apartments LLC v. Wolff Properties LLC, </em>2002 WL 31971832, at *3 (D.Or.2002) (emphasis added). The majority finds that this certification \u201caccurately reflected historical events.\u201d Maybe so, but the context and wording were such as to be deceptive. Nonetheless, the majority holds that the district court clearly erred in finding that the certification lacked any basis in fact. But how can discussions held months before the motion was filed and even before the lawsuit was commenced be accurately characterized as \u201cmeetings and conferences\u201d held \u201cto resolve <em>the issues raised in the motion?\u201d </em>At the time the meetings and conferences were held, the substance of the motion was not even within the contemplation of the parties \u2014 no one could then know what the <em>issues </em>to be raised in a future motion would be, how they would be framed, or how they might possibly be narrowed by conferring on the motion. At the least, the district court\u2019s finding that \u201c[tjhere was no basis in fact, therefore, for the certification,\u201d <em>id. </em>at *5, in light of the accompanying record, cannot be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">The purpose of Local Rule 7.1(a)(1), obviously, is to require counsel to discuss the <em>motion, </em>not just the general subject matter of a contemplated lawsuit. This is the only reasonable reading of the rule and the reading adopted by all of the judges of the District of Oregon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In fact, the district court also found that \u201ca competent attorney practicing under the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon could not form a reasonable belief that pre-litigation discussions with opposing counsel concerning the fundamental disputes that gave rise to the action would satisfy the LR 7.1 require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>ments for good faith efforts before a motion was filed to resolve the issues raised by the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6. Stone does not dispute that he did not discuss <em>the motion </em>with opposing counsel. Given the district court\u2019s reasonable and common-sense interpretation of Local Rule 7.1,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> even if Stone\u2019s certification \u201caccurately reflected historical events,\u201d as the majority holds, it was still baseless because it bore no relationship to the requirement of the rule. Indeed, from an objective point of view, it was a deliberate attempt to circumvent the rule. Thus, the district court\u2019s finding that \u201cStone\u2019s certification \u2018was without basis in fact\u2019 \u201d easily survives clear error review. Indeed, the majority virtually admits as much in conceding that \u201c[t]he district court might well have concluded ... that Stone\u2019s certification did not satisfy the requirements of LR 7.1(a)(1).... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The majority does not reach the second prong required of a \u201cfrivolous\u201d finding\u2014 that the certification was \u201cmade without a reasonable and competent inquiry.\u201d <em>Townsend v. Holman Consulting Corp., </em>929 F.2d 1358, 1362 (9th Cir.1990) (en banc). Stone\u2019s response to the order to show cause, however, clearly demonstrates that he made <em>no inquiry at all, </em>let alone a reasonable one, concerning the rule\u2019s requirements until \u201c[fjollowing the Court\u2019s recent Orders and inquiries.... \u201d <em>Altamont Summit Apartments, </em>2002 WL 31971832, at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Because Stone\u2019s Rule 7.1 certification was \u201cboth baseless and made without reasonable and competent inquiry,\u201d <em>Townsend, </em>929 F.2d at 1362, it was frivolous, <em>id. </em>I would, thus, affirm the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\">. The requirement is not unique to the District of Oregon. <em>See, e.g., </em>Cent. Dist. of Cal. Local Rule 7-3 (\"In all cases [not otherwise exempted] counsel contemplating the filing of any motion shall first contact opposing counsel to discuss thoroughly ... the substances of the contemplated motion and any possible resolution.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-7\">. The majority does not dispute that this interpretation of Local Rule 7.1 is correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
