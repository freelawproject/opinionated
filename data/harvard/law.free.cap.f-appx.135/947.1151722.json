On appeal, Galaviz contends that her case should be remanded because she was unable to file a timely application for cancellation of removal before the Immigration Judge due to ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-23\">A petitioner asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is required \u201cto exhaust his administrative remedies by first presenting the issue to the BIA.\u201d <em>Ontiveros-Lopez v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2000). \u201cA petitioner must make a motion for the BIA to reopen before we will hold he has exhausted his claims.\u201d <em>Liu v. Waters, </em>55 F.3d 421, 424 (9th Cir.1995); <em>see also Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 896 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201c[A]s a practical matter, a motion to reopen is the only avenue ordinarily available to pursue ineffective assistance of counsel claims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-24\">The record reveals that Galaviz failed to exhaust administrative remedies with regard to her ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004) (exhaustion is jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-25\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b973-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
