On appeal, Murcia-Perlaza argues first that, because his role in the offense only was to serve as a drug courier, and he identified other, more culpable participants in the drug importation scheme, the district court should have adjusted his base offense level downward two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Murcia-Perlaza asserts that, because he had no role in planning the criminal scheme or distributing the drugs, he was less culpable than the others, who acted as \u201cpartners,\u201d while he merely served as a \u201ccog in the machine.\u201d He argues that the district court ignored the fact that he was a courier, while others were involved in recruiting, instructing, supervising, and guiding couriers. He contends that, instead of focusing on the totality of the circumstances, the district court overemphasized the amount of drugs transported.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-24\">The district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact reviewed only for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>A mitigating-role reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2 is appropriate only in circumstances where the defendant plays a part in committing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n. 3(A)). It is the defendant\u2019s burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he played only a minor role in the offense. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 934. In determining a defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the' district court first must \u201cmeasure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which she was held accountable at sentencing.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b); <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 934. Second, \u201cthe district court may also measure the defendant\u2019s conduct against that of other participants in the criminal scheme attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The district court\u2019s finding that MurciaPerlaza had a key duty in the crime, and his participation was more than minor, is supported by the record and the court did not clearly err by declining to apply a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Murcia-Perlaza next argues that, even though the federal Sentencing Guidelines were not before the Supreme Court in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the majority of the Court implicitly acknowledged that its holding would preclude federal district courts from sentencing defendants based upon uncharged relevant conduct, and from applying many sentencing adjustments.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">We recently held that <em>Blakely </em>does not impact application of the federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Reese, </em>382 F.3d 1308, 1312 (11th Cir.2004). Accordingly, no error of any kind occurred, and we affirm Murcia-Perlaza\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
