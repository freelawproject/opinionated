For the reasons stated below, we deny Anselmo\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Where, as here, the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>Khup v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 898, 902 (9th Cir.2004). The IJ found that Anselmo failed to meet her burden for establishing eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal because she was not a credible witness. Moreover, the IJ made two additional alternative findings: first, even if the petitioner were credible, the alleged incident did not rise to the level of persecution; and second, even if Anselmo were credible and the incident constituted persecution, the conditions in the Philippines have changed such that she no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>Tawadrus v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir.2004) (stating standard). The IJ based this determination on Anselmo\u2019s lack of detail, implausible explanation, and contradictions. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151-53 (9th Cir.1999). Upon review of the record, we conclude that Anselmo\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with her declaration, and lacked specificity. These inconsistencies were not minor; rather, they went to the heart of petitioner\u2019s claim for relief because they dealt with the details of her alleged persecution and her alleged membership in a statutorily protected group, <em>de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 392-94 (9th Cir.1997). Moreover, Anselmo failed to bolster her claims with easily available, material, corroborative evidence from her relatives in the United States. <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038,1044-45 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Even if the petitioner were credible, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s alternate holding that the alleged incident does not rise to the level of persecution. <em>Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir.1995); <em>see also Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995). The petitioner did not challenge the final alternate finding of changed country conditions, so we do not address it. <em>Chebchoub, </em>257 F.3d at 1045 (noting that the court considers an issue not briefed on appeal to be abandoned). Finally, Anselmo\u2019s due process claim is without merit. <em>See Alaelua v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 1379, 1382 (9th Cir.1995); <em>see also Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 851 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
