After unsuccessfully pursuing various post-conviction motions, Wallace was sentenced to 960 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release and ordered to make restitution in the amount of approximately $26,000 \u2014 the unrecovered loss to the banks. After his sentencing, Wallace moved <em>pro se </em>under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3) for relief from the judgment of conviction because of fraud on the District Court. In this post-sentencing motion, Wallace reasserted a variety of arguments already rejected by the District Court and introduced additional theories of relief. The Court properly denied this motion for lack of jurisdiction. Wallace appeals his conviction, the denial of post-conviction relief and the denial of his post-sentencing motion styled under Rule 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-23\">Wallace\u2019s appointed counsel on appeal has filed an <em>Anders </em>motion to withdraw as counsel, asserting that all potential grounds for appeal are frivolous. We consider that motion here, and for the reasons given below grant it and affirm Wallace\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-25\">Under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), if counsel \u201cfinds [a] case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of\u2019 the case, \u201cs/he must advise the Court of this finding and request permission to withdraw from the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. This request must be accompanied by \u201ca brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u201cexplain to the court why the issues are frivolous,\u201d <em>United States v. Marvin, </em>211 F.3d 778, 781 (3d Cir.2000), and in so doing demonstrate that s/he has \u201cthoroughly scoured the record in search of appealable issues,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 780. A copy of counsel\u2019s brief must be furnished to the appellant, who must be given time to raise non-frivolous arguments in a <em>pro se </em>brief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number><em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396; Third Circuit LAR 109.2(a) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">We \u201cconfine our scrutiny to those portions of the record identified by an adequate <em>Anders </em>brief ... [and] those issues raised in Appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief.\u201d <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 301 (3d Cir.2001). We grant a counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>motion to withdraw if \u201ca full examination of all of the proceedings,\u201d <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, shows \u201cthat the attorney has provided the client with a diligent and thorough search of the record for any arguable claim,\u201d <em>McCoy v. Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, </em>486 U.S. 429, 442, 108 S.Ct. 1895, 100 L.Ed.2d 440 (1988), and we conclude \u201cthat the appeal lacks any basis in law or fact,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 438 n. 10, 108 S.Ct. 1895. \u201cThe Court\u2019s inquiry ... is thus twofold: (1) whether counsel adequately fulfilled the rule\u2019s requirements; and (2) whether an independent review of the record presents any nonfrivolous issues.\u201d <em>Youla, </em>241 F.3d at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">As we write solely for the parties, we need not detail the facts of this case. Wallace\u2019s counsel has identified as potential grounds for appeal (1) the District Court\u2019s rejection of Wallace\u2019s jury tampering argument, (2) the Court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction to consider Wallace\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, (3) alleged perjury by the FBI case agent, (4) the sufficiency of the testimony by the cooperating defendants, (5) the failure of the Government to furnish <em>Brady </em>material, (6) the District Court\u2019s participation in the decision whether to call Wallace\u2019s son as a witness, and (7) the denial of Wallace\u2019s opportunity to be present at sidebar during the <em>voir dire </em>of potential jurors. Counsel has thoroughly addressed each of these arguments, demonstrating that they lack any basis in law or fact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government, in turn, has reviewed and endorsed counsel\u2019s analysis. Lastly, we note that most of these arguments were addressed on their merits at least once by the District Court and roundly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">As the Government points out, \u2018Wallace has, in numerous letters to the district court and this Court, in complaints to the bar association, and in his motions, made facially absurd allegations that government counsel, the case agent, and his trial counsel are \u2018corrupt law handlers\u2019 involved in the creation of evidence and the subornation of perjury. He claims this \u2018conspiracy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to subvert justice was aided by post-trial counsel, appellate counsel, and, apparently, even the trial judge.\u201d In fact, in a December 2, 2004 order, we described a litany of claims levied by Wallace against his appellate counsel as \u201cconclusory and unsubstantiated,\u201d indeed \u201cfantastic and patently frivolous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">In this vein, we turn to Wallace\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief in support of his appeal. As we are unable to extract any meaningful legal arguments, we can only conclude that he has failed to demonstrate the existence of non-frivolous appellate arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">We thus affirm Wallace\u2019s conviction and sentence and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-12\">. We conclude that counsel has met his obligations under <em>Anders.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
