We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, <em>de Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 759, 761 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The IJ did not abuse its discretion in denying Bulos\u2019s motion to reopen \u201cfor the purpose of finding on [a] fraud charge\u201d because Bulos did not present any new evidence and therefore did not satisfy the requirements for a motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3) (a motion to reopen must be based on new facts that were not available at prior hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">To the extent Bulos sought adjustment of status, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion to reopen because Bulos did not establish prima facie eligibility for adjustment as he did not have an immigrant visa available to him. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a); <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 105, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">Bulos is not prejudiced by the immigration court\u2019s failure to provide a transcript of the motion to reopen hearing because the record indicates that tapes of the hearing are available to Bulos. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Medina, </em>236 F.3d 1028, 1031-32 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that the failure to provide a transcript does not in itself violate due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b944-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
