Qu initially moved to reopen the exclusion proceedings \u2014 which had taken place some years earlier and which ended, on April 11, 1996, with the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) decision to deny Qu\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>applications for asylum and withholding of exclusion \u2014 in connection with two intervening changes in immigration law: (1) the new definition of \u201crefugee\u201d set forth in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009; and (2) the implementation of the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Zhao v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001). Such an abuse of discretion may exist where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the [BIA] has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">We conclude that the BIA did not here abuse its discretion in denying Qu\u2019s motion for reconsideration. When the BIA originally denied Qu\u2019s motion to reopen exclusion proceedings on February 12, 2003, the BIA noted that Qu \u201cfailed to submit any documentary or medical evidence of his [claimed] sterilization, nor has he explained his failure to do so.\u201d As a result, the BIA held that \u201cnotwithstanding recent changes in the law, the applicant has failed to establish a <em>p\u00f1ma facie </em>showing of eligibility for asylum or protection under the Convention Against Torture.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(b)(2)(ii). Because Qu\u2019s motion for reconsideration failed to specify any error of law or fact committed by the BIA when it disposed of Qu\u2019s motion to reopen exclusion proceedings, the BIA properly denied Qu\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b). We note, as well, that to the extent Qu challenges factual determinations made during the original exclusion proceedings, including the IJ\u2019s determination that Qu was not credible, such challenges are not properly before us, and we will not consider them. <em>Cf. Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, the petition is DENIED and the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
