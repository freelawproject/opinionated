Zatkoff, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">Plaintiff-Appellant, Ruben Freyre (hereinafter, \u201cTaxpayer\u201d), appeals the District Court\u2019s grant of Summary Judgment for Defendant-Appellee United States (hereinafter, \u201cthe Government\u201d). Because the district court did not err in concluding that Taxpayer was a \u201cmarried individual\u201d for the 1996 tax year, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court as to this issue. We find that the district court erred, however, in concluding that Taxpayer\u2019s $1,460.50 monthly payments should be considered as non-deductible child support. Accordingly, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ae6\">A. Factual History</p>\n<p id=\"b890-20\">Taxpayer married Esther Evans (hereinafter, \u201cSpouse\u201d) in 1990. The couple have one child. On February 9, 1996, Spouse filed suit for divorce against Taxpayer in Tennessee. Spouse also obtained a temporary restraining order against Taxpayer. Thereafter, Taxpayer resided at a separate location. On March 18,1996, Spouse filed a <em>Motion Pendente Lite </em>asking for alimony and child support <em>pendente lite.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-21\">On or about May 30, 1996, attorneys for Spouse and Taxpayer announced to the divorce referee that they had reached an agreement where Taxpayer would pay Spouse monthly payments for child support, rent, auto, and insurance payments. <em>See </em>J.A. at 135. The divorce referee set down this agreement in a handwritten consent order stating that \u201chusband to pay $1,460.50 per mo. child support, rent $850 (for wife), auto payment and ins. (for wife).\u201d <em>See </em>J.A. at 132. Thereafter, Spouse\u2019s attorney prepared a consent <em>Order on Motion Pendente Lite </em>and obtained the signatures of attorneys for both Taxpayer and Spouse. On June 5, 1996, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>divorce court judge signed and entered the Order. <em>See </em>J.A. at 61-62. In addition to the $850 monthly payment for rent and $790 monthly car payment, the Order required Taxpayer to pay Spouse $1,460.50 per month \u201cas and for support.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Pursuant to this Order, Taxpayer made these payments during the 1996 tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">When Taxpayer computed his 1996 federal income tax, he filed as a \u201csingle\u201d taxpayer and deducted $24,804 as alimony, including $11,684 representing the eight monthly payments of $1,460.50. In reviewing Taxpayer\u2019s deduction, the IRS determined that Taxpayer should have filed as a \u201cmarried individual,\u201d and that Taxpayer improperly deducted the $11,684 as alimony because this payment to Spouse should have been considered non-deductible child support. In response to the IRS\u2019s asserted tax deficiency, Taxpayer paid the deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Taxpayer brought the Present Complaint on February 19, 2003 seeking a refund regarding his 1996 federal taxes. Taxpayer brought his Complaint in the Western District of Tennessee where it was heard by Judge Samuel H. Mays, Jr. Both Taxpayer and Defendant United States brought motions for summary judgment. On January 29, 2004, the district court denied Taxpayer\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted Defendant\u2019s. <em>See </em>J.A. at 144. In granting Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court held (1) that Taxpayer was not entitled to file as a \u201csingle\u201d taxpayer and (2) that the divorce court\u2019s consent order did not modify the parties\u2019 earlier agreement which described the $1,460.50 monthly payment as child support. Taxpayer appealed the district court\u2019s order to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">II. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">The Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Watkins v. City of Battle Creek, </em>273 F.3d 682, 685 (6th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is appropriate when there are no issues of material fact in dispute, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the factual evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538, (1986). The nonmoving party must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. A genuine issue for trial exists \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202, (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">There are two issues before the Court: (1) Whether Taxpayer was a \u201csingle\u201d taxpayer or a \u201cmarried individual\u201d in 1996, and (2) Whether Taxpayer was entitled to an alimony deduction for the $1,460.50 monthly payments he paid to Spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">A. Taxpayer was a \u201cmarried individual\u201d pursuant to IRC \u00a7 7703(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">Taxpayer asserts that he was entitled to file his 1996 federal taxes as a \u201csingle\u201d taxpayer. Both the IRS and the district court disagreed with Taxpayer\u2019s assertion. This Court also disagrees with Taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-14\">Section 7703(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code states: \u201can individual legally separated from his spouse under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance shall not be considered as married.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(a)(2). In' order to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>whether Taxpayer was \u201clegally separated,\u201d the Court looks to state law. <em>See Boyer v. Commissioner, </em>732 F.2d 191, 194 (D.C.Cir. 1984) (\u201ca party must be legally separated under state law in order to be eligible to file as single for federal income tax purposes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Under Tennessee law, there are two ways by which a married couple can alter their marital status. One way is divorce; the other legal separation. <em>See </em>Tenn. Code. Ann. \u00a7 36-4-102 (\u201cA party who alleges grounds for divorce from the bonds of matrimony may, as an alternative to filing a complaint for divorce, file a complaint for legal separation.\u201d). Neither Taxpayer nor Spouse filed for legal separation, and Taxpayer\u2019s divorce was not finalized until 1998. Accordingly, Taxpayer was not entitled to file as a \u201csingle\u201d individual and the IRS properly required Taxpayer to file his 1996 tax return as a \u201cmarried individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Despite the clear meaning of IRC \u00a7 7703(a)(2) and the uniform application of the section by the courts, Taxpayer attempts to rewrite IRC \u00a7 7703(a)(2) by referring the Court to the alimony provisions of IRC \u00a7 71. IRC \u00a7 71 states that a taxpayer\u2019s gross income includes amounts received as alimony. In defining what constitutes alimony, IRC \u00a7 71(b)(1)(C) mentions the tenn \u201clegally separated.\u201d Taxpayer then directs the Court to Treasury Regulation 1.71 \u2014 l(2)(b)(3)(i) which further explains the term \u201clegally separated\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-6\">\u201cIt is not necessary for the wife to be legally separate or divorced from her husband under a court order or decree if the parties live apart, do not file joint tax returns, and the wife receives payment from her husband under a decree of alimony pendente lite requiring the husband to make payments for her support.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Taxpayer then concludes that Treasury Regulation 1.71 \u2014 1 (2)(b)(3)(i)\u2019s explanation of \u201clegally separated\u201d applies to IRC \u00a7 7703(a)(2)\u2019s use of the term. The Court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">IRC \u00a7 71\u2019s use of the term \u201clegally separated\u201d makes no reference to the requirement of IRC \u00a7 7703(a)(2) that a married individual must be \u201clegally separated\u201d to file a tax return as a single person. The Court will not rewrite IRC \u00a7 7703(a)(2)\u2019s \u201clegally separated\u201d requirement based on a treasury regulation\u2019s explanation of an unrelated section of the Code. Instead, and in accord with the plain meaning of IRC \u00a7 7703(a)(2) as well as its interpretation by the courts, the Court finds that Taxpayer was not entitled to file as a \u201csingle\u201d individual and that the IRS properly required Taxpayer to file his 1996 tax return as a \u201cmarried individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">B. Taxpayer\u2019s $1,460.50 monthly payments must be considered as alimony under the tax code.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">Under the tax code, a payor spouse\u2019s payments to the payee spouse may be considered as either non-deductible child support or deductible alimony. Alimony is deductible from the payor spouse\u2019s income, but should be included in the payee spouse\u2019s income. <em>See </em>IRC \u00a7 215(a); <em>see also </em>IRC \u00a7 71(a). Conversely, child support is non-deductible from the payor spouse and is not included in the payee spouse\u2019s income. <em>See </em>IRC \u00a7 71(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">Taxpayer argues that his monthly payments of $1,460.50 to his spouse should not be considered as child support because the payments were not specifically designated as child support. Paragraph 1 of the Divorce Court\u2019s <em>Order on Motion Pendente Lite </em>stated: \u201cRuben Hector Freyre ... is hereby ordered to pay to the Plaintiff each month the sum of One Thousand Four Hundred Sixty Dollars and Fifty Cents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>($1,460.50) as and for support ...\u201d <em>See </em>JA at 61. Because there was no mention in the Order of \u201cchild support,\u201d Taxpayer asserts that the IRS should have considered his $1,460.50 monthly payments as alimony and should have granted him a deduction under IRC \u00a7 215(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">In support of his argument, Taxpayer relies on the tax code and regulations. IRC \u00a7 71(a) states that alimony payments are includible as gross income of the payee spouse. Any payments which are \u201cfixed\u201d as child support, however, are not includible as gross income. \u00a7 71(c)(1) provides this exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-6\">[\u00a7 71(a) ] shall not apply to that part of any payment which the terms of the divorce or separation instrument fix (in terms of an amount of money or a part of the payment) as a sum which is payable for the support of children of the payor spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Treasury Regulation 1.71-l(e) explains the meaning of \u00a7 71:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-8\">Section 71(a) does not apply to that part of any periodic payment which, by the terms of the decree, instrument, or agreement under section 71(a), is <em>specifically designated </em>as a sum payable for the support of minor children of the husband.... If, however, the periodic payments are received by the wife for the support and maintenance of herself and of minor children of the husband <em>without such specific designation </em>of the portion for the support of such children, then the whole of such amounts <em>is includible </em>in the income of the wife as provided in section 71(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.71-l(e) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">In response, the Government argues that the parties clearly agreed that the $1,460.50 monthly payment was child support. As support, the Government points to the following undisputed facts. The parties\u2019 May 30, 1996 agreement with the divorce referee specified $1,460.50 per month for child support, $850 per month for rent, and an unspecified amount per month for car payments and insurance. J.A. at 132. Thereafter, when the agreement was reduced to a written order and given to the Divorce Judge to sign, the Order called for monthly payments of $850 for rent and $790 for car payments and insurance. <em>Id. </em>at 137. Instead of a $1,460.50 monthly payment for \u201cchild support,\u201d however, the Order merely designated the $1,460.50 monthly payment \u201cas and for support.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">The Court has some sympathy for the Government\u2019s position that it is unlikely that, in drafting the consent order, the parties intentionally omitted the word \u201cchild\u201d in order to substantially alter their prior agreement, thereby rendering the $1,460.50 monthly payment as alimony instead of child support. That said, there is one piece of evidence suggesting that one of the parties did think the $1,460.50 monthly payment should be treated at least in part as alimony. In her deposition, Spouse stated: \u201cMy understanding [is that] it was to be used toward the bills and to take care of our son. Just to continue the household as it was.\u201d J.A. at 119. Nevertheless, it seems inequitable to conclude that Taxpayer be given a deduction for this payment based on the omission in the consent order, and that Taxpayer\u2019s spouse be required to include the payment in her taxable gross income. Nevertheless, such a conclusion is precisely what the tax code requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">Even though it remains unclear whether the parties agreed that the payment was child support, and even if the better reading of the record suggests that the payments should be treated as child support, the tax code and regulations require that the divorce <em>instrument </em>\u201cspecifically designate\u201d a payment as child support. <em>See </em>IRC \u00a7 71(c)(1); <em>see also </em>Treasury Regulation 1.71-l(e). The prior agreement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>parties before the divorce referee does not constitute a binding divorce instrument. Therefore, regardless of any previous agreement or any mistake in the drafting of the Divorce Court\u2019s Order, Taxpayer is correct that the divorce instrument did not specifically designate the $1,460.50 monthly payment as child support as required by IRC \u00a7 71(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">In addition to the clear language of the tax code and tax regulations, Taxpayer finds further support in <em>Commissioner v. Lester, </em>366 U.S. 299, 306, 81 S.Ct. 1343, 6 L.Ed.2d 306 (1961). In <em>Lester, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe allocations to child support made [in divorce agreements] must be \u2018specifically designated\u2019 and not left to determination by inference or conjecture.\u201d <em>Commissioner v. Lester, </em>366 U.S. 299, 306, 81 S.Ct. 1343, 6 L.Ed.2d 306 (1961). Though part of <em>Lester\u2019s </em>holding was overruled by IRC \u00a7 71(c)(2), <em>Lester\u2019s </em>\u201cspecifically designated\u201d requirement is still applicable and was followed in Treasury Regulation 1.71-l(e). <em>See Preston v. Commissioner, </em>209 F.3d 1281 (11th Cir. 2000); <em>see also </em>26 C.F.R \u00a7 1.71-l(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Based on IRC \u00a7 71(c)(1), Treasury Regulation 1.71-l(e), and <em>Commissioner v. Lester, </em>the Court finds that the Divorce Court\u2019s Order did not \u201cspecifically designate\u201d or \u201cfix\u201d the $1,460.50 monthly payment as child support. Accordingly, the $1,460.50 monthly payment must be considered as alimony and thus is deductible by Taxpayer under IRC \u00a7 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court as to its conclusion that Taxpayer was a \u201cmarried individual\u201d for the 1996 tax year. We REVERSE the judgment of the district court that Taxpayer\u2019s $1,460.50 monthly payments should be considered as non-deductible child support. Accordingly, we REMAND the case to the district court with instructions to enter judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
