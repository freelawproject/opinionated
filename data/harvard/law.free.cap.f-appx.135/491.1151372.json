Crandall\u2019s claims against defendant-appellee Sergeant Juckett were dismissed without prejudice, pursuant to Rule 4(m) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for failure to serve Juckett. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of all remaining defendantsappellees, various New York State prison officials, on all claims on the grounds that Crandall had failed either to exhaust his administrative remedies, as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), or to raise a triable issue that his constitutional rights had been violated. We assume familiarity with the pleadings and the record of proceedings in the district court, particularly the report of Magistrate Judge David R. Homer on defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, which was adopted in its entirety by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-20\">Summary judgment is appropriate only when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). A fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d for these purposes if it \u201cmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). An issue of fact is \u201cgenuine\u201d if \u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>party. <em>World Trade Ctr. Props., L.L.C. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>345 F.3d 154, 165-66 (2d Cir.2003). When, as here, a litigant is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>we construe that litigant\u2019s appellate briefs and other pleadings liberally and read such submissions to raise the strongest arguments they suggest. <em>See Burgos v. Hopkins, </em>14 F.3d 787, 790 (2d Cir.1994). The rule favoring liberal construction of <em>pro se </em>submissions is especially applicable to civil rights claims. <em>See Weixel v. Bd. of Ed. of the City of NY, </em>287 F.3d 138, 146 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">In granting summary judgment, the district court held, in relevant part, that Crandall had not exhausted his allegations of medical mistreatment and other Eighth Amendment violations at the Great Meadow Correctional Facility, as required by the PLRA. With respect to claims arising at the Southport and Upstate correctional facilities, the district court held that although Crandall had exhausted these claims, he had failed to show any personal involvement in the alleged violations by several of the defendants, <em>see West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 48-49, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988), and did not submit evidence raising a triable issue of fact as to whether his medical conditions were sufficiently severe or his treatment sufficiently unreasonable to give rise to an Eighth Amendment violation for inadequate treatment, <em>see Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Finally, the district court rejected Crandall\u2019s due process claim that he was impermissibly denied the ability to present witnesses at a disciplinary hearing both because it was not exhausted and because it was precluded by the fact that Crandall\u2019s conviction at the hearing had not been overturned. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Based on our independent review of the record, which we view in the light most favorable to Crandall, we discern no errors with respect to the district court\u2019s disposition of Crandall\u2019s due process claim or his claimed medical mistreatment at the Southport and Upstate correctional facilities. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision with respect to these claims is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">As for the district court\u2019s dismissal of Crandall\u2019s Great Meadow claims for failure to exhaust, during the interim between the district court\u2019s Decision and Order granting summary judgment in this case and the present appeal, this court issued a decision in <em>Hemphill v. New York, </em>380 F.3d 680, 686 (2d Cir.2004), in which we addressed the exhaustion requirements of the PLRA \u201cwhere a prisoner plaintiff plausibly seeks to counter defendants\u2019 contention that the prisoner has failed to exhaust available administrative remedies as required by the PLRA.\u201d Specifically, we instructed district courts to conduct a three-part inquiry to ascertain (1) whether administrative remedies were in fact \u201cavailable\u201d to the prisoner; (2) whether the defendants waived or are estopped from raising an affirmative defense of non-exhaustion of administrative remedies on account of their own actions inhibiting the prisoner from filing a grievance; and (3) whether there exist any alleged \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d that would excuse the prisoner\u2019s failure to exhaust. <em>Hemphill, </em>380 F.3d at 686; <em>see, e.g., Giano v. Goord, </em>380 F.3d 670, 678 (2d Cir.2004) (holding that prisoner justifiably failed to file ordinary grievance when prisoner reasonably believed that Department of Corrections regulations foreclosed such recourse); <em>Abney v. McGinnis, </em>380 F.3d 663 (2d Cir.2004) (holding that defendants\u2019 conduct may render grievance procedures effectively unavailable).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>We find that a liberal reading of Crandall\u2019s complaint and amended complaint, together with Crandall\u2019s arguments on appeal, indicate that he may have attempted to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his Great Meadow claims. <em>See </em>7 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 701.1(a) (\u201cThe inmate grievance program (IGP) is intended to supplement, not replace, existing formal or informal channels of problem resolution.\u201d); <em>Marvin v. Goord, </em>255 F.3d 40, 43 n. 3 (2d Cir.2001) (noting that New York\u2019s administrative grievance scheme expressly contemplates the possibility that an inmate could satisfy the exhaustion requirement through informal channels).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Because the district court, understandably, did not apply the standard of <em>Hemphill </em>or review the merits of Crandall\u2019s Great Meadow claims, we are unable to review the propriety of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on these claims. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment as to them and remand to the district court to reconsider its finding that Crandall failed to exhaust his administrative remedies pursuant to the standard set forth in <em>Hemphill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED IN PART and VACATED and REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
