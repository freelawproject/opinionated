Ullrich contends that he is owed \u201cdisadvantaged minority benefits,\u201d that his disability benefits were improperly calculated, and that an overpayment for payments was not properly assessed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Kildare v. Saenz, </em>325 F.3d 1078, 1082 (9th Cir.2003), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The district court properly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Ullrich\u2019s claims that his benefits were improperly calculated and that an overpayment was not properly assessed because Ullrich failed to exhaust his administrative remedies pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and failed to allege a colorable constitutional claim. <em>See Subia v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>264 F.3d 899, 902 (9th Cir.2001). We agree with the district court that there is no statutory basis for Ullrich\u2019s claim that he is owed additional benefits as a disadvantaged minority.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b950-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
