As he concedes, this contention is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Hip\u00f3lito also contends that he is entitled to resentencing because the district court sentenced him under a mandatory application of the guidelines that has been prohibited by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756-57, 769, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Hip\u00f3lito did not raise this issue in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005). Although there was an error under <em>Booker, </em>Hip\u00f3lito fails to demonstrate that the district court would have imposed a different sentence under advisory guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 733. He therefore fails to show that the error affected his substantial rights as is necessary under the plain-error standard. <em>See id.; United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521-22 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b809-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
