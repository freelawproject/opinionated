For the reasons stated below, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">In 1996, Marylena Brown and her now-deceased husband bought a vehicle from Banner of New Orleans Inc. (\u201cBanner\u201d). To finance the purchase, the Browns entered into a retail installment contract (\u201cRIC\u201d) and purchased credit life insurance underwritten by Protective. The Browns financed their vehicle purchase using a pre-computed loan<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the amount of $23,612.58, $1,876.70 of which was paid to Protective for credit life insurance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Soon thereafter, Banner assigned the RIC to Crescent Bank <em>&amp; </em>Trust (\u201cCrescent Bank\u201d), to which the Browns agreed. R. 310. Upon the death of Brown\u2019s husband, Protective paid the outstanding loan amount to Crescent Bank. Pursuant to a related suit, Brown later received excess benefits for coverage of unearned interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The instant suit is the fourth attempt of Brown\u2019s counsel to allege claims under the Louisiana Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act (\u201cLMVSFA\u201d), La. R.S. 6:951, <em>et seq., </em>against Protective.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The gravamen of Brown\u2019s complaint is that Protective sold her (and her deceased husband) excessive credit life insurance in relation to her purchase and financing of a vehicle in 1996. She contends that the amount of coverage exceeded the finance amount and included coverage for unearned interest for the term of the RIC in violation of the LMVSFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">Granting Protective\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the district court found that the LMVSFA, which pertains to the sale and financing of motor vehicles, does not provide a cause of action against insurance companies. The district court also dismissed Brown\u2019s state law tort claims for tortious conduct and fraud under LA. REV. STAT. 22:1220, as well as her contract claims under LA. REV. STAT. 22:658. The district court did not expressly dismiss Brown\u2019s unjust enrichment claim in its written Order and Reasons, but entered judgment dismissing Brown\u2019s case in its entirety. Brown\u2019s appeal concerns only the LMVSFA claims and her unjust enrichment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss de novo, applying the same standards as that court. <em>Cornish v. Correctional Serv. Corp., </em>402 F.3d 545, 548-49 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">First we hold that, directed solely to the sale and financing of motor vehicles and defining the legal relationship of the \u201cRetail Buyer\u201d and \u201cRetail Seller,\u201d the LMVSFA does not provide a cause of action against insurance companies like Protective. Textually, Protective does not come within any of the financier/seller-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>related definitions under a plain reading of the LMVSFA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the LMVSFA, a \u201cRetail Seller or Seller\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiU\">a person who <em>sells </em>a motor vehicle to a retail buyer or a person <em>who lends money </em>to a retail buyer subject to a retail installment contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">LA R.S. 6:951(3) (emphasis added). Protective did not \u201csell\u201d a vehicle to the Browns; Banner was the dealer-seller. Nor did Protective \u201clend[ ] money\u201d to the Browns for the purchase of the vehicle. As explicitly stated in the RIC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABe\">Dealer/Creditor: <em>Banner </em>of N.O. Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVU\"><em>I have entered into a credit sale with you to finance </em>the purchase of the following motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">R. 310 (emphasis added). Under the LMVSFA, as mirrored by the terms of the contract, Brown entered into the credit sale agreement to finance the vehicle purchase with Banner, making Banner (and later Crescent Bank) Brown\u2019s exclusive lender and creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">That Protective paid the policy proceeds directly to Crescent Bank does not change the explicit creditor-debtor relationship between Brown and Banner/Crescent Bank. Defeating her own argument that this particular payment of proceeds brings Protective within the purview of the LMVSFA, Brown repeatedly recognizes that credit insurance is intended to inure <em>to the benefit of the creditor. </em>Thus, Protective, as a policy provider of credit life insurance, properly paid the policy proceeds to the creditor \u2014 Crescent Bank.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Further, Protective does not qualify as a \u201cSales Finance Company\u201d under the LMVSFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">As provided by the LMVSFA, a \u201cSales Finance Company\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai3\">a person engaged, in whole or in part, <em>in the business of purchasing retail installment contracts </em>from one or more retail sellers or <em>in the business of lending money on promissory notes </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">LA. R.S. 6:951(9) (emphasis added). Not only does Protective not qualify as a purchaser (as does Crescent Bank) or lender (as does Banner) under the LMVSFA, but Protective\u2019s insurance agreement with Brown is expressly excluded from the \u201cSales Finance Company\u201d definition which excludes \u201cthe pledge of an aggregate number of such contracts to secure a bonafide loan thereon....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">The fact that Protective\u2019s insurance agreement was part of or connected to Brown\u2019s RIC does not convert Protective into a sales finance company under the LMVSFA. The terms of the LMVSFA simply do not permit its extension to companies providing insurance premiums financed \u201cas part of the same retail installment contract which financed the vehicle.\u201d R. 87, 342. Protective\u2019s underwriting occurred apart from the transactions that established the legal relationships between Brown, Banner/Crescent Bank \u2014 the only relationships referred to in the LMVSFA. Perhaps it would be a different matter if Protective were both the insurer and the loan creditor, but where, as here, Protective\u2019s function as an insurer is distinct from Banner\u2019s and Crescent Bank\u2019s function as creditors, there is no basis for imposing creditor-liability on the party whose actions fall squarely within the \u201cbusiness of insurance.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Moreover, Protective does not qualify as a \u201cholder\u201d of a retail installment contract, which the LMVSFA defines as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\">the <em>retail seller under or subject to the contract or another assignee entitled to enforce </em>a retail installment contract against the buyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">LA. R.S. 6:951(10). Here, Protective is neither a \u201cretail seller under or subject to\u201d the RIC. Rather, as the assignee, Crescent Bank was the \u201cholder\u201d entitled to enforce the RIC. That being so, Protective was also not amenable to the LMVSFA\u2019s penalty provision, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">Any <em>seller </em>or <em>holder, </em>willfully violating R.S. 956 or R.S. 957, shall be barred from recovery of finance charges, delinquency or collection charge on the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">LA. R.S. 6:960(B) (emphasis added). Thus, no textual reading of the LMVSFA supports the conclusion that an insurance company in Protective\u2019s position constitutes a \u201cseller,\u201d \u201csales finance company,\u201d or \u201cholder\u201d thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Nor is Protective vicariously liable under the LMVSFA, LA. R.S. 6:950, <em>et seq. </em>The language of the statute does not support the conclusion that Banner was Protective\u2019s licensing agent for lending purposes. To the contrary, Banner (and later Crescent Bank) was Brown\u2019s express lender-creditor. Banner did not sell the vehicle, lend money to finance the vehicle, or assign the RIC used to finance the vehicle on behalf of Protective. Brown offers no facts that could demonstrate that Banner and Protective had an agency relationship that would render Protective liable under the LMVSFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">Because the LMVSFA makes no reference to and contains no definitional provision that covers an insurance company in Protective\u2019s position, the statute, as the district court correctly concluded, does not cover companies that provide credit life insurance in relation to a vehicle financing contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">Finally, we reject Brown\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s dismissal of her unjust enrichment claim (which she intertwined with other claims in her complaint) must be reversed. Contrary to Brown\u2019s representations, the district court took notice of the claim in its opinion, <em>see </em>R. 85, and, at the least, Protective addressed and refuted the claim at a motions hearing, <em>see </em>R. Vol. 2 at 18. That the district court\u2019s written reasons lack delineation does not mean that the claim was inadequately addressed or resolved. If any inference is made, it is that the district court\u2019s written findings, when supported by the record, are consistent with its general holding and dismissal order. <em>See First Nat. Bank of Denham Springs v. Indep. Fire. Ins. Co., </em>934 F.2d 73, 76 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Brown\u2019s case for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AMu\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b673-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
