Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">Rocha\u2019s first argument is that the district court erred in applying the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender enhancement to him based on a prior conviction for sexual assault of a minor. Rocha contends that the conviction was actually for statutory rape, which, according to Rocha, is not a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.1. Whatever the merits of his argument, Rocha waived the issue by failing to reurge it at the second sentencing hearing and by conceding that he was a career offender. <em>See United States v. Musquiz, </em>45 F.3d 927, 931 (5th Cir.1995). Unlike forfeited issues, which are reviewed for plain error, waived issues are completely unreviewable. <em>Id. </em>Even if we were to review for plain error, Rocha\u2019s claim would fail because he has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Leonard, </em>157 F.3d 343, 346 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-18\">We likewise reject Rocha\u2019s argument that, pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), which was extended to the federal guidelines by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed\u00fcd 621 (2005), the district court erred by enhancing his sentence based on the court\u2019s findings regarding drug quantity and Rocha\u2019s role as a leader. As Rocha did not raise this issue in the district court, we review his sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-21\">The record is devoid of any indication that the district court would have imposed a lower sentence under an advisory as opposed to a mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme. <em>See id. </em>at 521-22. Accordingly, Rocha cannot show that the sentence affected his substantial rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b725-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
