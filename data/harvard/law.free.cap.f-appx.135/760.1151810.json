He was sentenced to 34 months of imprisonment and one year of supervised release. Bradshaw argues for the first time on appeal and pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that his sentence is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Bradshaw has not established plain error with regard to his <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>claim because he has not established that being sentenced under a mandatory Guidelines scheme affected his substantial rights. The record does not indicate that the district court \u201cwould have reached a significantly different result\u201d under a sentencing scheme in which the Guidelines were advisory only. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-22 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b786-29\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
