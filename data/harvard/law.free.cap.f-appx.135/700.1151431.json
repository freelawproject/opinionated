He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed, but he seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Fernandez concedes, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See AlmendarezTorres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Garcia-Mejia, </em>394 F.3d 396, 398-99 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Fernandez also argues that the district court erred in enhancing his base offense level by 16 levels based on his prior Texas conviction for injury to a child because it was not a crime of violence. He argues that the offense did not require proof of the element of the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Section \u00a7 2L1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines provides that the offense level for unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States shall be increased by 16 levels if the defendant has a prior conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as any of certain listed offenses or \u201cany offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). Because injury to a child is not a listed offense, the offense must involve the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force to be a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">In determining whether the offense is a crime of violence, the court \u201clooks to the <em>elements </em>of the crime, not to the defendant\u2019s actual conduct in committing it.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon-Pena, </em>383 F.3d 254, 257 (5th Cir.2004)(en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 932, 160 L.Ed.2d 817 (2005). If an offense statute contains disjunctive elements, a sentencing court may look to the offense conduct described in the indictment or jury instructions for the limited purpose of determining which of the elements were satisfied in the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.04(a), the statute under which Fernandez was indicted and convicted, \u201ccriminalizes acts or omissions that intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently result in injury to a child.\u201d <em>United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 312 (5th Cir.2002). The commission of the offense does not require the use of physical force against a person. <em>Id.; see United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>388 F.3d 466, 469 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-13\">Although Fernandez\u2019s indictment charged that he struck a child with a cord, the statute underlying his offense does not require the use of physical force to be proved as an element of the offense. Furthermore, even if Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.04(a) were pared down to include only those elements supported by the indictment, it would not constitute a crime of violence in Fernandez\u2019s case because the statute\u2019s requirement that the defendant \u201ccause[ ]\u201d bodily injury is not equivalent to the requirement of \u201cthe use,' attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d in the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Vargas-Duran, </em>356 F.3d 598, 606 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>541 U.S. 965, 124 S.Ct. 1728, 158 L.Ed.2d 410 (2004). Thus, it was not a crime of violence warranting a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). Accordingly, the sentence is VACATED <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>and the case is REMANDED to the district court for resentencing in accordance with this opinion and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b726-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
