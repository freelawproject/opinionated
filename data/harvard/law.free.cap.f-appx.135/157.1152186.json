Leech appeals <em>pro se</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>seeking a certificate of appealability (COA) from the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus. The district court granted Leech\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>There being no basis for an appeal, we deny COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">On August 8, 2000, Leech was driving his motor home when he was stopped by Enid, Oklahoma, police officers and arrested on an outstanding felony arrest warrant. After Leech was arrested, the police used a K-9 dog to sniff the inside of the motor home. The dog alerted to drugs in the back of the vehicle. The K-9 handler went to the back of the home and discovered a metal ashtray, uncapped syringe, Leech\u2019s driver\u2019s license and a plastic baggie containing off-white powder lying on the bed. The officer also observed another bag containing more off-white powder on the headboard and found other drug-related items throughout the motor home including a smoking pipe, scales and a receipt for a substance used in the manufacture of methamphetamine. The off-white substance was tested and determined to be methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">On August 7, 2001, Leech was convicted of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine (Count 1) and possession of drug paraphernalia (Count 2) in the District Court of Garfield County, Oklahoma. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of seven years and six months, respectively, on the two counts. He appealed his conviction on the first count arguing insufficiency of the evidence to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA) which affirmed his conviction on August 23, 2002. On April 24, 2003, Leech filed a <em>pro se </em>application for post-conviction relief with the District Court of Garfield County, Oklahoma, claiming his conviction resulted from a warrantless search and seizure of his motor home in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Leech also argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the warrantless search of Leech\u2019s motor home and that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise those two claims in his direct appeal. The district court denied Leech\u2019s request and the OCCA affirmed the district court\u2019s decision. In the process, the OCCA noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq-\">Petitioner\u2019s Propositions One and Two both raise issues that could have been raised by Petitioner on direct appeal .... As his \u201csufficient reason\u201d for failing to raise these claims on appeal, Petitioner asserts that his appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by not raising them. The District Court addressed this ineffective assistance claim by finding its underlying search and seizure claim was meritless. More specifically, the District Court found, among other things:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">After all the evidence and argument were concluded, the [trial] Court specifically found that the search was lawful on two grounds. First the search conducted was a proper inventory search of the vehicle incident to a felony arrest. Second, it was proper for the officer to look through the vehicle for any additional persons and the drug items were in plain sight. The evidence clearly supported the specific finding of the [trial] Court on this issue. Appellate Counsel was well aware of the issue and by letter to Petitioner concluded she could not raises [sic] the issue on appeal. The Court finds the decision of appellate counsel was reasonable under the circumstances and was not defective legal advice or practice. As a result, there is no merit to the application [for post-conviction relief].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">(R., Doc. No. 8, Ex. E at 2-3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">Leech timely filed a <em>pro se </em>habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma asserting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>same three arguments raised in his state petition for post-conviction relief. The matter was referred to a magistrate judge who recommended the petition be denied. The District Court adopted, with some modification, the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and denied the habeas petition. The district court held that Leech\u2019s first and second claims were procedurally barred, that he failed to establish cause and prejudice to overcome the procedural bar, and that his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim was meritless because the drugs would inevitably have been discovered as a result of a proper inventory search without the dog sniff.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Unless this Court issues a COA, Leech may not appeal the dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). \u201c[Section] 2253(c) permits the issuance of a COA only where a petitioner has made a \u2018substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.E.2d 931 (2003) (quoting \u00a7 2253(c)(2)). To make the requisite showing, a petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8pC\">When the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim, a COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-11\"><em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). \u201cWhere a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of the case, a reasonable jurist could not conclude either that the district court erred in dismissing the petition or that the petitioner should be allowed to proceed further. In such a circumstance, no appeal would be warranted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">With these principles in mind, we have carefully reviewed the record, and agree with the district court\u2019s conclusions. Leech does not dispute that he failed to raise either his warrantless search and seizure claim or his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim on direct appeal to the OCCA. Under Oklahoma law, Leech is deemed to have waived these claims by failing to raise them on direct appeal. <em>See </em>22 Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 22 \u00a7 1086; <em>Steele v. Young, </em>11 F.3d 1518, 1521-22 (10th Cir. 1993) (citing <em>Maines v. State, </em>597 P.2d 774 (Okla.Cr.1979)). \u201cOn habeas review, this Court will not consider issues that have been defaulted in state court on an independent and adequate state procedural ground, unless the petitioner can demonstrate cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Hickman v. Spears, </em>160 F.3d 1269, 1271 (10th Cir. 1998). This Court has previously held that Oklahoma\u2019s procedural bar at issue here is an independent and adequate state grounds. <em>Odum v. Boone, </em>62 F.3d 327, 331 (10th Cir.1995); <em>Steele, </em>11 F.3d at 1521-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">Leech argues his third claim, the ineffective, assistance of appellate counsel, gives him cause to avoid the procedural bar.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ineffective assistance of appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>counsel can serve as cause to avoid the state procedural bar. <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 753-54, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). In order to show ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, Leech must demonstrate: \u201c(1) that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and (2) that the deficient performance was prejudicial to his [case].\u201d <em>Hickman, </em>160 F.3d at 1273; <em>see also Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201cWhen considering a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failure to raise an issue, we look to the merits of the omitted issue.\u201d <em>Hooks v. Ward, </em>184 F.3d 1206, 1221 (10th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). Because the OCCA rejected Leech\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel on its merits, its determination must be accorded a \u201clevel of deference ... provided those determinations d[o] not conflict with federal law or apply federal law in an unreasonable way.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 386, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (citation &amp; quotations omitted); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">We agree with the OCCA and the district in their determinations that the performance by appellate counsel for Leech performance did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness. Leech\u2019s warrantless search and seizure claim, which gives rise to both the ineffective assistance of trial counsel and appellate counsel claims, is without merit. When making a lawful custodial arrest, Police officers may make a search incident to the arrest of the passenger compartment of a vehicle. <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 460, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981). This exception covers the interior of a motor home. <em>California v. Carney, </em>471 U.S. 386, 393, 105 S.Ct. 2066, 85 L.Ed.2d 406 (1985). Therefore, cursory inspections of motor homes are permissible when incident to a lawful arrest. <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>855 F.2d 664, 668 (10th Cir.1988) (upholding cursory search of a houseboat incident to arrest). It is uncontested the drugs and drug paraphernalia in Leech\u2019s motor home were lying on top of the bed in plain view and would have been inevitably discovered in the inspection of the mobile home, regardless of the use of a drug-sniffing dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Appellate counsel is not required to appeal every nonfrivolous issue, <em>Jackson v. Shanks, </em>143 F.3d 1313, 1321 (10th Cir. 1998); <em>Banks v. Reynolds, </em>54 F.3d 1508, 1515 (10th Cir.1995), let alone issues which appear to be without merit. <em>Hawkins v. Hannigan, </em>185 F.3d 1146, 1152 (10th Cir. 1999). Because Leech\u2019s underlying constitutional claim is without merit, he cannot show his appellate counsel\u2019s assistance fell below an objectively reasonable standard of conduct. As such, he cannot show cause to avoid Oklahoma\u2019s procedural bar precluding his other arguments not raised on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Based on the above, we DENY Leech\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-16\">. We construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally. <em>Ledbetter v. City of Topeka, Kan., </em>318 F.3d 1183, 1187 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\">. Leech does not rely on the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception. This excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>tion is only available \u201cwhere the prisoner supplements his constitutional claim with a colorable showing of factual innocence.\u201d <em>Herrera </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>506 U.S. 390, 404, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993) (quotations and emphasis omitted).
