For the following reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-22\">On December 5, 1996, Joseph Maresca consulted Dr. Elliot L. Mancall, a licensed neurologist in Philadelphia. Dr. Mancall examined Maresca, diagnosed him with chronic headaches, and prescribed a muscle relaxant. In September 1999, nearly three years later, a rheumatologist diagnosed Maresca with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), for which he continues to receive treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-23\">Maresca filed a pro se complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County against Dr. Mancall and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital alleging medical malpractice based on the failure to diagnose AS or follow-up after the office visit in 1996. The Defendants removed the case to the District Court and, following discovery, moved for summary judgment. The District Court denied the Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, and the matter was calendared for trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-24\">In preparation for trial, the parties videotaped the testimony of Maresca\u2019s sole medical expert, Dr. Mitchell S. Felder. At the close of Maresca\u2019s case-in-chief, the Defendants renewed their previously-filed motions for judgment as a matter of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50. The Defendants argued that Dr. Felder failed to offer expert testimony from which the jury could conclude that the Defendants breached a standard of care or caused any injury to Maresca. After conducting a lengthy hearing, the District Court agreed with the Defendants and entered judgment as a matter of law in their favor. The District Court subsequently denied Maresca\u2019s timely motion for reconsideration. Mares-ca appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In Pennsylvania, a plaintiff seeking damages for medical malpractice must \u201cestablish a duty owed by the physician to the patient, a breach of that duty by the physician, that the breach was the proximate cause of the harm suffered, and the damages suffered were a direct result of the harm.\u201d <em>Toogood v. Rogal, </em>573 Pa. 245, 824 A.2d 1140, 1145 (Pa.2003). To establish a breach and causation, a plaintiff must present an \u201cexpert witness who will testify, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d of the breach and proximate cause. <em>Mitzelfelt v. Kamrin, </em>526 Pa. 54, 584 A.2d 888, 892 (Pa.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">We have reviewed the testimony of Maresca\u2019s sole medical expert in its entirety and agree with the District Court that his testimony does not satisfy these requirements. Dr. Felder did not articulate an opinion to any degree of medical certainty that either Dr. Mancall or the Hospital breached any requisite standard of care or caused harm to Maresca. In the absence of such testimony, the District Court was bound to grant judgment as a matter of law in the Defendants\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">We are aware of Maresca\u2019s continued attempts to rely on Dr. Felder\u2019s report dated November 22, 2002. We are also aware that the District Court repeatedly informed Maresca that Dr. Felder\u2019s report, while sufficient to defeat the Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, was never admitted into the trial record and thus could not be considered by the jury. At bottom, regardless of what his report states, Dr. Felder\u2019s testimony did not provide sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found in Maresca\u2019s favor on two essential elements of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">For these reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting judgment as a matter of law in favor of the Defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We deny the motion by Charles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Deng to proceed as <em>amicus curiae.

The District Court\u2019s jurisdiction was based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over 'the District Court\u2019s decision to grant judgment as a matter of law. <em>See LaVerdure v. County of Montgomery, </em>324 F.3d 123, 125 (3d Cir.2003). \u201cA court should grant such a motion only \u2018if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and giving it the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference, there is insufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could find liability.\u2019 \" <em>Northview Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., </em>227 F.3d 78, 88 (3d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 </em>F.3d 1153, 1166 (3d Cir. 1993)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-8\">.
