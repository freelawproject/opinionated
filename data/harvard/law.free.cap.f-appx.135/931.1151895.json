We have jurisdiction under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2000), and we deny in part and grant in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-20\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen because the record establishes that notice of the November 20, 2001 hearing was properly served on Cajahuaringa and his former counsel. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b (repealed 1996); <em>Garcia v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (rejecting claim of inadequate notice where the government served written notice of the hearing on applicant\u2019s counsel; noting that applicant did not raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim); <em>Arrieta v. INS, </em>117 F.3d 429, 430-31 (9th Cir.1997) (per curiam) (notice of hearing sufficient when notice sent by certified mail to alien\u2019s last known address).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-21\">The BIA failed to address Cajahuaringa\u2019s motion to remand to seek adjustment of status. The BIA abuses its discretion if it fails to \u201cindicate with speci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>ficity that it heard and considered petitioner\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>See Maravilla v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, we remand to the BIA to consider Cajahuaringa\u2019s motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b958-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
