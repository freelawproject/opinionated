NELSON, KOZINSKI, and BEA, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b79-18\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-19\">We affirm the convictions of both Herman Lemusu and Alofaga Lemusu, and remand Herman\u2019s case to the district court for the district court to evaluate Herman\u2019s sentence as discussed, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-20\">I. Herman Lemusu\u2019s Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b79-21\">Neither a variance nor a constructive amendment occurred when the district court failed to read the indictment\u2019s \u201cOvert Acts\u201d section to the jury. The overt acts were not necessary elements of the conspiracy charged in count one and the jury\u2019s copy of the indictment included an accurate list of charged crimes. <em>United States v. Shabani, </em>513 U.S. 10, 11, 115 S.Ct. 382, 130 L.Ed.2d 225 (1994). As Herman jointly proposed the relevant jury instructions, his argument is also barred by the invited error doctrine. <em>United States v. Baldwin, </em>987 F.2d 1432, 1437 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-22\">The district judge properly instructed the jury to agree on an object of the conspiracy from among the crimes that were \u201calleged in the indictment,\u201d including crimes committed by either Alofaga or Herman. The money laundering instruction was easily distinguishable from the distribution instruction, and the jury is presumed to have distinguished them. <em>See Francis v. Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307, 324 n. 9, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 85 L.Ed.2d 344 (1985). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Because the jury instructions were consistent with the indictment, no variance or constructive amendment occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">In light of the detailed information from a government informant, the police had probable cause to arrest Herman. <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>980 F.2d 546, 550 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Because Herman was seated in a comfortable conference room for only four hours, the police asked only booking questions, and Herman never felt pressured to talk, his will was not overborne when he confessed. <em>United States v. Haswood, </em>350 F.3d 1024, 1027-28 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The police conducted a legal inventory search of the minivan. Because Herman\u2019s arrest was supported by probable cause, the evidence recovered during the inventory search was not the fruit of a poisonous tree. <em>See United States v. McLaughlin, </em>170 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir.1999) (Trott Concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">II. Alofaga Lemusu\u2019s Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">There was sufficient evidence to support Alofaga\u2019s conviction for possessing a firearm in furtherance of the drug conspiracy. There was evidence that Alofaga possessed both firearms identified in the indictment in furtherance of his drug dealing activities. <em>United States v. Krouse, </em>370 F.3d 965, 968 (9th Cir.2004). Additionally, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of this case because the statute gave Alofaga adequate notice that his conduct was criminal. <em>United States v. Purdy, </em>264 F.3d 809, 811 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">There was no need for a special verdict form because the jury was specifically instructed that they must all agree on a single firearm that was possessed and used in furtherance of the conspiracy, and the use of either firearm would result in the same sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">Alofaga has offered no evidence to impugn the facially regular third superceding indictment, which is presumptively valid in light of the grand jury foreperson\u2019s signature. <em>United States v. Buffington, </em>815 F.2d 1292, 1304 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">The district court did not clearly err in finding credible the testimony of the officers who testified that there was a 25-30 second wait after the knock and announce before the forced entry into Alofaga\u2019s home. A wait of this duration was reasonable given the circumstances of the search. <em>United States v. Banks, </em>540 U.S. 31, 38, 124 S.Ct. 521, 157 L.Ed.2d 343 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">III. Herman\u2019s Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b80-14\">The district judge enhanced Herman Lemusu\u2019s sentence on the basis of judge-found facts that were not set forth in the indictment, proven to. the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, nor admitted by Herman. Because Herman did not challenge his sentence on Sixth Amendment grounds in the district court, we review his sentence for plain error. Pursuant to <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. June 1, 2005) (en banc), we remand Herman\u2019s sentence to the district court for the district court to determine whether it would have sentenced Herman differently under an advisory Guidelines system. If so, the district court shall vacate Herman\u2019s sentence and re-sentence him under the <em>post-Booker </em>advisory Guidelines. If not, Herman\u2019s sentence shall remain undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-15\">Alofaga Lemusu\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-16\">Herman Lemusu\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED; his sentence is REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b79-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
