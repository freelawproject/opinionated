Jones argues that the district court abused its discretion in allowing a police officer to describe the content of an anonymous telephone tip that led them to Jones. Jones has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in admitting this evidence as the testimony was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather to explain what the officers did in response to the call. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>967 F.2d 1032, 1035 (5th Cir.1992). Further, the anonymous tip did not directly identify Jones and, therefore, it was not prejudicial and was admissible. <em>See United States v. Carrillo, </em>20 F.3d 617, 619 (5th Cir.1994). Because admission of the testimony concerning the anonymous tip was not an abuse of discretion, Jones has not shown that the district court\u2019s admission of Officer Coleman\u2019s testimony concerning the telephone tip or the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the tip in closing argument was plain error. <em>See United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 443 (5th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Jones argues that the admission of the testimony concerning the anonymous tip violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause. Because the evidence was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, the Confrontation Clause did not bar the admission of the statement for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted. <em>See Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Jones argues that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the Government to impeach Crystal Thomas with the testimony of Officer Lejon Roberts concerning her prior inconsistent statement. Thomas testified that she had never seen Jones with a firearm. This testimony was clearly inconsistent with her prior statement to police that she had seen Jones with a firearm on July 16, 2001. After the prosecutor questioned Thomas about the prior inconsistent statement, the district court gave Thomas an opportunity to explain or deny the statement under Fed.R.Evid. 613(b). Thomas testified that she made the prior statement because the police threatened her. At that point, Officer Roberts\u2019s testimony was admissible to show that Thomas voluntarily made this statement to him and that he did not threatened or coerced her into making this statement. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>979 F.2d 1024, 1033-34 (5th Cir.1992); <em>see also United States v. Sisto, </em>534 F.2d 616, 622 (5th Cir.1976). The admission of the testimony thus was not prohibited by Fed.R.Evid. 608. <em>See Lopez, </em>979 F.2d at 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">Jones argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the testimony of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Agent Charles Smith concerning Officer White\u2019s prior statement to Smith a few hours after Jones\u2019s arrest regarding the anonymous telephone tip. Jones has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in admitting this testimony as he did not specifically argue at trial that Officer White\u2019s statement postdated the motion to fabricate. However, any error in admitting this testimony was harmless. <em>See United States v. Skipper, </em>74 F.3d 608, 612 (5th Cir.1996). Defense counsel \u2022brought out on cross-examination that Agent Smith did not personally observe Jones\u2019s arrest. Given that Officer Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>had already testified concerning the anonymous tip, Agent Smith\u2019s testimony regarding Officer Smith\u2019s statement was cumulative evidence that did not cause any further prejudice to Jones. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Jones argues that he was prejudiced by Agent Smith\u2019s testimony that firearms offenses are accepted for federal prosecution only if the defendant has a serious prior felony conviction. Jones has not shown that the admission of this testimony was plain error. <em>See Miranda, </em>248 F.3d at 443. Jones testified that he had a prior conviction for simple burglary. Therefore, the jury was aware of the nature of Jones\u2019s prior conviction. Further, the district court instructed the jury that it should not consider Jones\u2019s prior conviction as evidence that he committed the offenses for which he was currently on trial. Jurors are presumed to follow their instructions. <em>United States v. Wyly, </em>193 F.3d 289, 299 (5th Cir .1999). Therefore, Jones has not shown that admission of this testimony was clear or plain error that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Miranda, </em>248 F.3d at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Jones argues that the trial court\u2019s cumulative errors denied him a fair trial. The cumulative error rule has no application to the instant case because Jones has not identified any individual instances of error. <em>See United States v. Villarreal, </em>324 F.3d 319, 328 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Jones argues that the sentencing enhancements and departure made by the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, relying on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). In the district court, Jones argued that his sentence should not be enhanced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) based on his possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense, possession of cocaine base, because he was acquitted by the jury of possession of cocaine base. Although Jones did not expressly argue that this enhancement violated his Sixth Amendment rights or cite <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or <em>Blakely, </em>Jones\u2019s argument was sufficient to preserve this issue for review on appeal. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360 (5th Cir.2005). The Government has not met its burden of proof to show that the district court\u2019s enhancement of Jones\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) was harmless error. <em>See id. </em>Because Jones preserved his objection to the sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), we vacate Jones\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b677-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b679-10\"> Because we vacate and remand Jones\u2019s entire sentence, we need not and do not reach his other arguments of sentencing errors; rather, we leave to the district court the decision whether, in its discretion, it will impose the identical sentence with the identical departures or enhancements, or both. If the district court judge reimposes the same sentencing adjustments upon resentencing, Jones may challenge them on appeal after remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
