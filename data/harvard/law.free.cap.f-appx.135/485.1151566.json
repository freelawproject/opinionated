Conway\u2019s claims arise from a child custody dispute over which Judge Garvey presided.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of complaints pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>McEachin v. McGuinnis, </em>357 F.3d 197, 200 (2d Cir.2004). \u201cFurther, when the plaintiff proceeds <em>pro se, </em>as in this case, a court is obliged to construe his pleadings liberally, particularly when they allege civil rights violations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">An independent review of the record and the case law reveals that the district court thoroughly addressed all of Conway\u2019s claims and that the dismissal of Conway\u2019s complaint was proper. Judge Garvey is entitled to absolute judicial immunity from Conway\u2019s claims. Moreover, Conway lacks standing to assert any claim under the criminal statute 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, and he failed to allege any factual basis to support his conspiracy claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985. <em>See Boddie v. Schnieder, </em>105 F.3d 857, 862 (2d Cir.1997). In addition, as noted by the district court, to the extent Conway is seeking to relitigate the custody issues presided over by Judge Garvey, such claims are barred under the <em>Rooker/Feldman </em>doctrine, which precludes a district court from reviewing state court decisions. <em>See Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482-86, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). Finally, Conway\u2019s malpractice claim against his attorney, Rossmer, is a state law claim and, therefore, the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain it. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1332; <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), (h)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">Accordingly, for substantially the reasons given by the district court, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED and all pending motions are DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
