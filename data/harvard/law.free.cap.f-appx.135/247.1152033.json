After review, we dismiss his petition in part, and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-27\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b273-28\">Desoguste is a citizen and national of Haiti. At an unknown place and time prior to January 11, 2001, he entered the United States illegally, without being admitted or paroled. On January 11, 2001, the Immigration and Nationalization Service (INS)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued Desoguste a notice to appear, charging that he was removable as a alien who was present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-29\">On January 23, 2003, Desoguste appeared before an Immigration Judge (IJ), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>who ordered Desoguste removed to Haiti. The IJ\u2019s order indicated that Desoguste expressly waived his right to appeal this decision to the BIA, and Desoguste did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">On April 21, 2003, Desoguste filed a motion with the IJ seeking to reopen his removal proceedings (the \u201cApril 21, 2003 motion to reopen\u201d). In that motion, Desoguste claimed that he had married a United States citizen on December 20, 2002, and had a pending visa petition based upon this marriage, which was filed on April 16, 2003. The IJ denied the April 21, 2003 motion to reopen, reasoning that the pending visa petition was insufficient to warrant reopening Desoguste\u2019s removal proceeding because the decision to grant the visa was within the sole discretion of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Desoguste did not appeal this ruling to the BIA, but instead filed a motion for reconsideration with the IJ on May 21, 2003 (the \u201cMay 21, 2003 motion for reconsideration\u201d). In this motion, Desoguste argued that the BIA\u2019s decision in <em>In re Velarde-Pacheco, </em>2002 WL 393173, 23 I &amp; N Dec. 253, 256 (BIA 2002), indicated that a pending family-based visa petition justified reopening a removal proceeding. On May 28, 2003, the IJ denied the May 21, 2003 motion for reconsideration, concluding that Desoguste\u2019s case did not meet all of the <em>Velarde-Pacheco </em>criteria for reopening a case. Specifically, the IJ\u2019s decision is based solely on the ground that <em>VelardePacheco </em>required that the government not oppose any motion to reopen, and that Desoguste\u2019s case did not meet this requirement. Desoguste appealed the IJ\u2019s ruling to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">On April 28, 2004, the BIA adopted and affirmed the'IJ\u2019s May 28, 2003 ruling. In addition to adopting the IJ\u2019s decision, the BIA opinion noted that Desoguste was not entitled to relief under <em>Velarde-Pacheco </em>because he failed to submit clear and convincing evidence that his marriage was bona fide.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Desoguste did not petition this Court for a review of the BIA\u2019s April 28, 2004 ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">On July 23, 2004, Desoguste filed a separate motion to reopen with the BIA (the \u201cJuly 23, 2004 motion to reopen\u201d). Desoguste attached to his July 23, 2004 motion to reopen twenty-three exhibits evidencing that his marriage was bona fide. The exhibits included several affidavits, utility and phone bills, a copy of the marriage certificate, a 2003 tax return and other documents intended to show that the marriage is bona fide.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">On October 18, 2004, the BIA denied the July 23, 2004 motion to reopen. In its opinion, the BIA found that Desoguste could have presented this evidence before the IJ when he filed his April 21, 2003 motion to reopen. In addition, the BIA stated that the July 23, 2004 motion to reopen was \u201cdilatory in nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">On November 15, 2004, Desoguste timely filed a petition in this Court for review of the BIA\u2019s October 18, 2004 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AxS\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">In his brief on appeal, Desoguste argues at length about the various decisions made by the IJ and the BIA in this case. However, because of the strict filing deadline that governs our review of immi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>gration eases, we conclude that our jurisdiction in this case is limited to reviewing the BIA\u2019s October 18, 2004 decision denying Desoguste\u2019s July 23, 2004 motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">While this Court generally has jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed in this Court within 30 days of the order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). This statutory time limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u201c \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 [and] is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). Additionally, motions to reconsider or motions to reopen filed with the BIA do not toll or extend the filing deadline. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Desoguste\u2019s November 15, 2004 petition for review in this Court was therefore timely filed only with respect to the BIA\u2019s October 18, 2004 decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, to the extent that Desoguste argues on appeal that the IJ erred in denying his April 21, 2003 motion to reopen, or that the BIA\u2019s April 28, 2004 decision erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Desoguste\u2019s May 21, 2003 motion for reconsideration, this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider Desoguste\u2019s arguments. Thus, that portion of Desoguste\u2019s petition for review is dismissed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">We now turn to our review of the BIA\u2019s October 18, 2004 decision denying Desoguste\u2019s July 23, 2004 motion to reopen filed with the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">B. BIA\u2019s October 18, 2004 Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of Desoguste\u2019s July 23, 2004 motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1145 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">The regulation that governs motions to reopen before the BIA states that a motion to reopen may not be granted \u201cunless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing....\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">In its October 18, 2004 decision, the BIA determined that the evidence presented by Desoguste\u2019s July 23, 2004 motion to reopen, namely the twenty-three exhibits purporting to show that his marriage was bona fide, could have been presented to the IJ when Desoguste originally moved to reopen his removal proceeding on April 21, 2003. We cannot say that this is an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">The documents submitted by Desoguste in his July 24, 2004 motion to reopen consisted of items such as his marriage certificate, affidavits of his wife and friends, pictures of Desoguste and his family, a letter from his pastor, his and his wife\u2019s 2003 tax return, and various utility bills. Because Desoguste claims that he was married on December 20, 2002, there is no reason to believe that these items were \u201cnot available and could not have been discovered or presented\u201d at the time of his April 21, 2003 motion to reopen. Indeed, Desoguste does not argue on appeal that any of the new evidence submitted with his July 23, 2004 motion to reopen before the BIA was unavailable at the time of his April 21, 2003 motion to reopen before the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Under these circumstances, we can not say that the BIA abused its discretion in denying Desoguste\u2019s July 23, 2004 motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>see also INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (noting that motions to reopen are disfavored in removal proceedings because \u201cas a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">For the above reasons, we DISMISS Desoguste\u2019s petition for review insofar as it challenges any ruling other than the BIA\u2019s October 18, 2004 denial of his motion to reopen. In addition, we DENY Desoguste\u2019s petition to the extent that it challenges the BIA\u2019s October 18, 2004 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">DISMISSED in part, DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-18\">.
