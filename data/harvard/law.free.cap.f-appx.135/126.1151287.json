In light of Lewis\u2019 refusal (or inability) to hire her own attorney, to accept appointed counsel, or to represent herself, the district court\u2019s determination that she forfeited her right to counsel was \u201cfair and reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelm, </em>827 F.2d 1319, 1322 (9th Cir.1987) (holding that \u201c[i]n light of Kelm\u2019s persistent refusal to accept an appointed attorney, to hire his own attorney, or to expressly waive his right to an attorney,\u201d the district court\u2019s decision forcing Kelm to represent himself was \u201cfair and reasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">2. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Lewis\u2019 motion to withdraw her guilty plea. The court\u2019s extensive Rule 11 plea colloquy with Lewis at her change of plea hearing is \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that Lewis\u2019 guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. <em>United States v. Nostratis, </em>321 F.3d 1206, 1209 (9th Cir.2003). In addition, the court was entitled to give greater weight to Lewis\u2019 testimony given under oath and in open court during the plea colloquy than to her subsequent statements made after she knew her likely sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1210.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Nor was Lewis entitled to an evidentiary hearing. The court adequately inquired into the voluntariness of Lewis\u2019 plea during the hearing on Lewis\u2019 motion to withdraw her plea. <em>Cf. United States v. Caro, </em>997 F.2d 657, 659-60 (9th Cir.1993) (remanding for a full hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea where the court did not know that defendant was a party to a \u201cpackage deal plea\u201d and therefore did not engage in a \u201cmore careful examination\u201d of voluntariness as required in such situations).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">3. There was not \u201csubstantial evidence of incompetence\u201d in this case to require the district court, <em>sua sponte, </em>to hold a competency hearing. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, 388 F.3d </em>1199, 1251 (9th Cir.2004). There is no evidence in the record that Lewis was unable to assist in her defense or that her refusal to retain counsel was due to an abnormal mental condition. <em>Cf. United States v. Friedman, </em>366 F.3d 975, 981 (9th Cir.2004) (finding that Friedman\u2019s refusal to assist in his defense was a \u201cdirect result of his paranoid schizophrenia\u201d and therefore upholding the district court\u2019s determination of incompetence).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b153-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
