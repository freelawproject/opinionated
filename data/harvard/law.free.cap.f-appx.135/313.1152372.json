McKinney argues on appeal that (1) his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance, (2) the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea to the \u00a7 924(c) offense in Count 3, (3) the court erred in imposing a mandatory minimum ten-year consecutive sentence based on its judicial finding that McKinney possessed an Intratec 9 millimeter semi-automatic pistol, and (4) the court violated McKinney\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial in consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>ering the federal guidelines in sentencing him, in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm McKinney\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">A federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment, charging McKinney with the above-referenced offenses and listing the firearms McKinney allegedly possessed in furtherance of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine base in Count 3 of this indictment, that is, a Rossi .38 Special revolver (\u201crevolver\u201d), and an Intratec 9 millimeter semi-automatic pistol (\u201cassault weapon\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 26, 2004, McKinney pled guilty to Count 5 of his superseding indictment, without the benefit of a plea agreement. During McKinney\u2019s change-of-plea hearing, he conceded that he had both knowledge of, and access to, the revolver, the assault weapon, and the ammunition. McKinney also advised the court that, although he wished to have a trial on the remaining counts, he was waiving his right to a trial by jury because these offenses involved primarily legal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">On May 6, 2004, the day McKinney\u2019s bench trial was scheduled to commence on his remaining charges, he plead guilty to Counts 2 and 3, with the unwritten understanding that the government was agreeing to dismiss Count 1 of his superseding indictment. After confirming that McKinney was competent to plead guilty and understood the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty, the court explained the remaining charges to McKinney. As part of this discussion, McKinney\u2019s counsel informed the court that (1) whether McKinney received a mandatory minimum consecutive sentence of five or ten years\u2019 imprisonment for his \u00a7 924(c) offense in Count 3 depended on whether the firearm he possessed was the revolver or the assault weapon,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) the parties had agreed that the court would decide this issue at sentencing, and (3) McKinney wished to have his plea accepted. McKinney\u2019s counsel noted, however, that he was not certain whether \u201cpossession\u201d could be a sentencing factor. After discussing the possible implications of <em>Apprendi </em>the court and the parties concluded that McKinney\u2019s admission to possessing the revolver and his leaving for the court\u2019s determination the issue whether he also possessed the assault weapon would not result in a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">The government then proffered that, had the case proceeded to trial, it would have proven that (1) officers with the Leon County Sheriffs Office were attempting to locate Rollins, who was a fugitive; (2) as part of this investigation, a confidential information (\u201cCl\u201d) arranged a meeting with Rollins at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant, at which time the Cl was to buy cocaine base from Rollins; (3) when the officers arrived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>at the McDonald\u2019s parking lot, they observed a vehicle in which Rollins was in the passenger seat and McKinney was in the driver seat; (4) when Rollins went inside the restaurant, the officers arrested him; (5) the officers then went to the vehicle in which McKinney was sitting and arrested him; (6) during a search of this vehicle, the officers recovered both the assault weapon and the resolver from in between the front driver and passenger seats; (7) the officers also recovered rounds of .38 ammunition from McKinney\u2019s pocket, proof that the vehicle was owned by McKinney, and cocaine base from Rollins\u2019s pocket; and (8) McKinney stated that he and Rollins had (i) driven around in the vehicle that day, (ii) sold cocaine base to someone, and (iii) driven to the McDonald\u2019s restaurant to sell more cocaine base to the Cl.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">McKinney generally verified that these facts were correct, stating that, although he did not own either of the firearms, he had on his person ammunition for the pistol, he knew that Rollins had both of the firearms, and the firearms were in McKinney\u2019s vehicle while he and Rollins conducted drug transactions. The court then informed McKinney of the potential consequences of his plea, including that he would be subject to a consecutive mandatory minimum sentence of either five or ten years\u2019 imprisonment, dependent on whether the court determined that he possessed only the revolver or both the revolver and the assault weapon. McKinney also agreed that (1) no one had promised him anything in exchange for his plea, (2) no one had coerced him into pleading guilty, (3) he understood that he would not be permitted to withdraw his plea, and (3) he was satisfied with his counsel\u2019s representation. The court accepted McKinney\u2019s plea, finding that McKinney was competent to plead guilty, he understood the nature of his charges and the consequences of his plea, a sufficient factual basis supported the plea, and McKinney entered into the plea freely and voluntarily, after consulting with competent counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">McKinney\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated his base offense level for Counts 2 and 5 as 20, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The probation officer recommended a two-level upward adjustment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4), because the assault weapon previously had been reported stolen by the owner, and a two-level downward adjustment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), for acceptance of responsibility. Based on the officer\u2019s determination that McKinney was subject to an enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (armed career criminal), and that McKinney possessed a firearm in connection with a controlled-substance offense, he applied an enhanced offense level of 34, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(a) and (b)(3)(A). After the officer adjusted this enhanced offense level downwards two levels for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a), McKinney had a total offense level of 32 for Counts 2 and 5. With a criminal history category of VI, McKinney\u2019s resulting guideline range for these counts was 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>ment. McKinney, however, also was subject to a consecutive mandatory minimum statutory sentence of either five or ten years\u2019 imprisonment for his \u00a7 924(c) offense in Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">McKinney objected to the probation officer\u2019s consideration of the assault weapon in calculating his guideline range and to his mandatory minimum statutory sentence, arguing that Rollins, instead, owned and possessed this firearm. McKinney also generally raised an objection to the court\u2019s determination of this issue in light of <em>Blakely. </em>The probation officer responded that, because McKinney aided and abetted Rollins in Rollins\u2019s use of the assault weapon, he should be held accountable for this conduct. The probation officer noted, as well, that, because McKinney was a career offender, this objection had no real impact on his guideline sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">On July 26, 2004, prior to sentencing, McKinney filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea to Count 3, arguing that he plead guilty to Count 3 based on his trial counsel\u2019s misadvice that the issue whether he possessed the assault weapon was a sentencing factor, instead of an element of the offense that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. McKinney also argued in a written motion that the court should conclude that the federal guidelines were unconstitutional in light of <em>Blakely. </em>In doing so, McKinney also requested that the court determine a sentence that \u201cadequately considered] the circumstances of the offense and [his] personal circumstances,\u201d instead of \u201cmerely complying with the mechanical calculations of the [guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">On July 30, 2004, at a joint sentencing hearing for McKinney and Rollins, McKinney renewed his motion to withdraw his plea as to Count 3 of the superseding indictment. McKinney\u2019s counsel explained that, in advising McKinney that his possession of the assault weapon in Count 3 was a sentencing factor, counsel \u201chad it wrong.\u201d After the government objected to this motion, the court denied it. The court discussed that (1) the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely </em>did not effect whether a defendant could waive his right to a jury trial, (2) McKinney effectively waived this right, and (3) both his waiver of his right to a trial and his plea were knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">The court next confirmed that McKinney\u2019s only objections to the PSI were his <em>Blakely </em>objection and his argument that the court should not determine that he possessed the assault weapon. The court also clarified that the assault-weapon issue would not affect the guideline calculation; rather, it would affect the mandatory minimum sentence for Count 3. In addition to the court considering as relevant evidence McKinney\u2019s admissions during his two change-of-plea hearings, the government stipulated that Rollins brought the assault weapon to McKinney\u2019s car on the day in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">McKinney then argued that, because the record reflected that his connection with the assault weapon was \u201cremote,\u201d the government did not show that he possessed the assault weapon in furtherance of the drug offense. Citing to <em>Bazemore v. United States, </em>138 F.3d 947 (11th Cir.1998), the government responded that, by driving Rollins around to commit drug transactions and allowing the firearms to be in his vehicle, McKinney aided and abetted Rollins\u2019s acts and, thus, should be held ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>countable for both of the firearms they possessed in furtherance of these acts. McKinney replied that the facts in <em>Bazemore </em>were distinguishable because the defendant in that case had a greater involvement in the drug transactions and, thus, benefitted more from the presence of the firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The court concluded that McKinney, as an aider or abettor, possessed the assault weapon in furtherance of the drug-trafficking offense. The court also clarified that McKinney\u2019s guideline range for Counts 2 and 5 was 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that his total mandatory minimum sentence was 300 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">McKinney next argued that the court should determine that the federal guidelines were unconstitutional and only impose his total mandatory minimum statutory sentence. In the alternative, he argued that the court should impose a sentence at the bottom of his total guideline range, that is 330 months\u2019 imprisonment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because (1) he was \u201cremotely connected to [the offenses];\u201d (2) he had not committed another offense for 11 years, albeit because he had been incarcerated; and (3) he offered to cooperate with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Explaining in detail why it believed that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely </em>was applicable to the federal guidelines, the court determined, over the government\u2019s objection, that the guidelines were unconstitutional, but that courts still should consider them in an advisory fashion in sentencing defendants. The court also explained that, although it had considered McKinney\u2019s guideline range, it had concluded that McKinney\u2019s total mandatory minimum statutory sentence of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment was appropriate. In doing so, the court expressly stated that it had considered McKinney\u2019s attempts to cooperate, the fact that the instant conduct involved \u201ca fairly limited drug offense,\u201d and that Rollins\u2019s guideline range was significantly less primarily because he plead guilty several days before McKinney\u2019s plea. After concluding that the PSI was accurate, the court sentenced McKinney to a total sentence of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment (25 years\u2019 imprisonment), 5 years\u2019 supervised release, and a $300 special assessment fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Issue 1: <em>Claim of ineffective assistance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">As a preliminary issue, McKinney argues that the record shows that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient because his counsel, in arguing that the district court should allow McKinney to withdraw his guilty plea, admitted that he misadvised McKinney on the elements of his \u00a7 924(c) offense. To successfully establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a plaintiff must prove that (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, falling below an objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) this deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064-65, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">We, however, generally will not consider on direct appeal claims of ineffective assistance of counsel if the district court neither entertained this claim, nor developed a factual record. <em>United States v. Bender, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002) (citing <em>United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 948, 969 (11th Cir.1990)). We have explained that, if there is insufficient evidence in the record to consider this claim on direct appeal, it should be resolved in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, where an evidentiary hearing may be held. <em>United States v. Camacho, </em>40 F.3d 349, 355 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Here, in moving the court to withdraw McKinney\u2019s guilty plea, McKinney\u2019s counsel stated, in a conclusory fashion, that he \u201cgot it wrong\u201d in advising McKinney that McKinney\u2019s possession of the assault weapon was a sentencing factor, instead of an element of his \u00a7 924(c) offense. The record, however, is not sufficiently developed to determine either whether McKinney\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, or whether McKinney was prejudiced by this performance. Thus, we will not review on direct appeal McKinney\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Bender, </em>290 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Issue 2: <em>Denial of McKinney\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea to possession of firearms in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">McKinney also argues that the court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his plea of guilty to his \u00a7 924(c) offense in Count 3 of his superseding indictment because, as discussed above, his counsel admitted on the record that he believed that he misadvised McKinney that possession of the assault weapon was a sentencing factor, instead of an element of the crime to be determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. McKinney also contends that, because of this misadvice, he neither understood the nature of this charge, nor the potential consequences of his plea. McKinney asserts that the court did not conserve judicial resources by denying this motion because a trial would have been short, consisted primarily of stipulations, and involved only one witness. Finally, McKinney argues that the government would not have been prejudiced by the court\u2019s granting of this motion because (1) the amount of evidence was not substantial, and (2) he filed the motion shortly after pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">We review the denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for an abuse of discretion; thus, it only will reverse a court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw if it is \u201carbitrary and unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Cesal, </em>391 F.3d 1172, 1179 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). A defendant may withdraw a guilty plea before a sentence is imposed if he shows a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for the withdrawal. <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B)). \u201cTo determine whether the defendant has given a fair and just reason for withdrawal, the district court examines the totality of the circumstances, including: \u2018(1) whether close assistance of counsel was available; (2) whether the plea was knowing and voluntary; (3) whether judicial resources would be conserved; and (4) whether the government would be prejudiced if the defendant were allowed to withdraw his plea.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cesal, </em>391 F.3d at 1179 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">To the extent McKinney is arguing that the court should have permitted him to withdraw his plea to the \u00a7 924(c) offense in Count 3 because his counsel misadvised him that the type of firearm he possessed was a sentencing factor, instead of an element of the offense for the jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt, this argument is without merit. The Supreme Court clarified in <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), that \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) does not specify elements of a crime that must be charged in an indictment, submitted to the jury, or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>Id., </em>536 U.S. at 552-56, 122 S.Ct. at 2411-14. The <em>Harris </em>Court explained that an increase in the defendant\u2019s statutory mandatory minimum sentence based on a judicial finding that the defendant \u201cbrandished\u201d the firearm, pursuant to \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), \u201c[did] not evade the requirements of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Congress \u2018simply took one factor that has always been considered by sentencing courts to bear on punishment .... \u2019 and dictated the precise weight to be given that factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568, 122 S.Ct. at 2420. The <em>Harris </em>Court also discussed that, when \u00a7 924(c) was amended in 1998, numbered subsections were added, \u201cdescribing, as sentencing factors often do, \u2018special features of the manner in which\u2019 the statute\u2019s \u2018basic crime\u2019 could be carried out,\u201d and only altering the mandatory minimum sentences for the court to impose. <em>Id. </em>at 554, 122 S.Ct. at 2412-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Instead of whether the defendant \u201cbrandished\u201d the firearm under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), the subsection at issue here\u2014 \u00a7 924(c)(l)(B)(i) \u2014 involves the type of firearm possessed. <em>(See </em>R1-18). In <em>Castillo v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 120, 120 S.Ct. 2090, 147 L.Ed.2d 94 (2000), the Supreme Court, in examining a prior version of \u00a7 924(c)(1), determined that its provisions on types of firearms defined separate crimes that had to be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See id., </em>530 U.S. at 123-24, 120 S.Ct. at 2092-93. However, in reaching this determination, the <em>Castillo </em>Court relied heavily on the structure of the former \u00a7 924(c)(1), that is, that \u201cCongress placed the element of \u2018uses or carries a firearm\u2019 and the word \u2018machinegun\u2019 in a single sentence, not broken up with dashes or separated into subsections.\u201d <em>See United States v. Riley, </em>250 F.3d 1303, 1305 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Castillo, </em>530 U.S. at 124-25, 120 S.Ct. at 2093).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Because the current version of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B) \u2014 the version applicable in the instant case \u2014 dictates in separate subsections applicable mandatory statutory sentences that result dependent on the type of firearm involved in the offense, we conclude, based on the Supreme Court\u2019s similar analysis in <em>Harris, </em>that this subsection only involves a sentencing factor. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B) (2004); <em>see also Harris, </em>536 U.S. at 554, 122 S.Ct. at 2412-13.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, we have determined that the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of \u00a7 924(c)(1) applies not only to direct conduct of defendants, but also to conduct that they aid or abet. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>334 F.3d 1228, 1232-33 (11th Cir.2003). Thus, McKinney\u2019s counsel did not misadvise him that the type of weapon he possessed in Count 3 of his superseding indictment, albeit through a theory of aiding and abetting, was a sentencing factor for the court to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Examining the other factors applicable in determine whether McKinney showed a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for his motion to withdraw his plea to Count 3, the government arguably would not have been prejudiced substantially if the court had granted McKinney\u2019s motion to withdraw because only a little more than two months elapsed between his pleading guilty to Count 3 on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>May 6, 2004, and his filing his motion to withdraw this plea on July 26, 2004. On the other hand, regardless of the limited number of witnesses involved and estimated length of the trial, the court\u2019s denial of McKinney\u2019s motion to withdraw conserved judicial resources. <em>See United States v. Freixas, </em>332 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir.2003) (concluding that the court\u2019s decision denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw \u201cplainly served the goal of conserving judicial resources, as it obviated the need for a full trial on the merits in this case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Moreover, McKinney failed to show that his plea was not knowing and voluntary. \u201cWhen a distinct court accepts a guilty plea, it must ensure that the three core concerns of [Fed.R.Crim.P. 11] have been met: (1) the guilty plea must be free from coercion; (2) the defendant must understand the nature of the charges; and (3) the defendant must know and understand the consequences of his guilty plea.\u201d <em>See Freixas, </em>332 F.3d at 1318 (internal quotation and marks omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, similar to the facts in <em>Freixas, </em>the court, before accepting McKinney\u2019s plea, confirmed that McKinney was competent to plead guilty and understood the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty. The court also verified that McKinney (1) understood his remaining charges; (2) knew of the potential consequences of his plea, including that he would be subject to a consecutive mandatory minimum sentence of either five or ten years\u2019 imprisonment, dependent on whether the court determined that he possessed the assault weapon; and (3) had not been threatened or coerced into pleading guilty. In addition, the court <em>verified </em>that McKinney\u2019s plea was supported by a sufficient factual basis. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3) (before accepting a guilty plea, a district court \u201cmust determine that there is a factual basis for the plea\u201d). Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying McKinney\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea to Count 3 of his superseding indictment. <em>See Cesal, </em>391 F.3d at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Issue 3: <em>Mandatory minimum, sentence in Count S</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">McKinney next argues that the court erred in concluding that he possessed the assault weapon when the undisputed evidence showed that he only drove Rollins to the drug transaction, did not get out of the vehicle, and did not receive any benefit from the drug transaction. McKinney also contends that court\u2019s determination that he facilitated the carrying of this firearm rested on an improper finding of \u201cguilt by association.\u201d McKinney concludes, as such, that the court erred in imposing a consecutive mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">As a preliminary matter, if we construe McKinney\u2019s argument as challenging the fact that the court, instead of a jury, determined this issue, the Supreme Court held in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>2362-63. Before McKinney\u2019s sentencing hearing, the Supreme Court revisited that rule in <em>Blakely, </em>in the context of Washington state\u2019s sentencing guideline scheme, and clarified that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.... </em>In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct.at 2537 (emphasis in original). Applying these principles, the Court held that Blakely\u2019s sentence \u2014 which was enhanced under the state guidelines based on the sentencing court\u2019s additional finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Blakely committed his kidnaping offense with deliberate cruelty \u2014 violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>124 S.Ct. at 2534-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">We, however, have concluded that <em>Blakely </em>\u201cdoes not undermine the validity of minimum mandatory sentences, at least not where the enhanced minimum does not exceed the non-enhanced maximum.\u201d <em>Spero v. United States, </em>375 F.3d 1285, 1286 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1099, 160 L.Ed.2d 1084 (2005), and <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1345, 161 L.Ed.2d 143 (2005). We explained in <em>Spero </em>that <em>\u201cBlakely, </em>like <em>Apprendi, </em>explicitly distinguished minimum mandatory sentences from the circumstances involved in those cases and indicated that <em>McMillan v. Pennsylvania, </em>477 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is still good law.\u201d <em>Spero, </em>375 F.3d at 1286. In the instant case, the statutory maximum for McKinney\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) offense, without reference to his possession of the assault weapon, was life imprisonment. <em>See Harris, </em>536 U.S. at 552-56, 122 S.Ct. at 2411-14 (holding that the current version of \u00a7 924(c)(1) defines one offense, with a penalty ranging from five years\u2019 to life imprisonment). Because McKinney\u2019s total 300-month sentence did not exceed this maximum statutory sentence, no <em>Apprendi </em>error resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">Furthermore, to the extent McKinney is arguing that the court erred in accepting his plea and sentencing him in Count 3 because his codefendant owned the assault weapon and brought it into McKinney\u2019s vehicle, the Supreme Court determined in <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), that a conviction for \u201cuse\u201d under \u00a7 924(c) requires \u201cactive employment of the firearm,\u201d as opposed to mere possession. <em>Id., </em>516 U.S. at 143-45, 116 S.Ct. at 506. We, however, have concluded that, \u201c[ajlthough the <em>Bailey </em>decision narrowed the scope of conduct for \u2018use\u2019 of a firearm under \u00a7 924(c), nothing in the opinion suggests that it was intended to provide criminals with immunity from well-established doctrines of criminal law,\u201d including the theory of aiding and abetting.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Bazemore, </em>138 F.3d at 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">In <em>Bazemore, </em>we discussed that, to prove aiding and abetting, the government must show \u201cthat a substantive offense was committed, that the defendant associated himself with the venture, and that he com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>mitted some act which furthered the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u00a7 924(c) does not permit \u201cguilt by association.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>987 F.2d. 697, 702 (11th Cir.1993)). Despite this burden, however, we determined that the government in <em>Bazemore </em>produced ample evidence linking the defendant to the gun because the defendant (1) drove both the codefendants and the gun to a drug deal, and (2) knowingly accepted the gun\u2019s protection while he was inspecting the marijuana. <em>Bazemore, </em>138 F.3d at 749. In reaching this conclusion, we also explained that (1) \u201conce knowledge on the part of the aider and abettor is established, it does not take much to satisfy the facilitation element\u201d; (2) as the driver of the vehicle, the defendant was \u201cvital to the transportation of the weapon during the commission of the drug crime\u201d; and (3) the defendant could not \u201cknowingly benefit from the protection afforded by the firearm carried by his companion and then subsequently evade criminal liability for its presence.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Here, McKinney admitted during his change-of-plea hearing that (1) there were two firearms in the vehicle, (2) he knew of their presence, and (3) he drove the vehicle while they sold drugs earlier in the day. McKinney also stated that, although he did not own either firearm, he had bullets for the revolver, which was recovered from the same general location in the vehicle as the assault weapon. Moreover, McKinney conceded during his change-of-plea hearing on his \u00a7 922(g)(1) charge in Count 5 that the firearms were \u201cwhere [he] could get to them if [he] wanted to.\u201d Thus, similar to the facts in <em>Bazemore, </em>McKinney knowingly provided transportation for a drug transaction and accepted protection from the assault weapon. The court, therefore, did not err in accepting McKinney\u2019s plea to Count 3 and in sentencing him based on his possession of the assault weapon under the theory of aiding and abetting. <em>See Bazemore, </em>138 F.3d at 749; <em>see also Rutledge v. United States, </em>138 F.3d 1358, 1559 (11th Cir.1998) (concluding that the defendant admitted to all of the elements required under the theory of aiding and abetting by admitting to the government\u2019s stipulation that the weapon was in his possession and that it was used in connection with drug activities).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Issue 4: <em>Blakely/Booker Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"ATl\">In a brief he prepared prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>McKinney argues in this last issue that the district court committed a <em>Blakely </em>violation when it used the federal guidelines as an artificial guide to \u201cfashion\u201d McKinney\u2019s sentence. McKinney contends that courts may not apply the guidelines, even in an advisory fashion, because they are facially unconstitutional. Without citing to the record or caselaw, McKinney further asserts that the court \u201cwould have given [him] a much lighter sentence had it not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>used the guideline as a measuring stick,\u201d and that court should have applied his consecutive mandatory minimum statutory sentences because \u201cmandatory m\u00ednimums, etc., were intended by Congress to act in conjunction with the Guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Because McKinney timely raised a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court, we review his <em>Blakely/Booker </em>claim on appeal <em>de novo, </em>but reverse only for harmful error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948, manuscript op. at 4 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). \u201cTo find harmless error, [this Court] must determine that the error did not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948, manuscript op. at 5 (quotation omitted). We further explained in <em>Paz </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">A constitutional error, such as a <em>Booker </em>error, must be disregarded as not affecting substantial rights, if the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. This standard is only met where it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the sentence obtained. The burden is on the government to show that the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">As discussed above, before McKinney\u2019s sentencing hearing, the Supreme Court, in the context of Washington state\u2019s sentencing guideline scheme, held in <em>Blakely </em>that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. </em>... In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct.at 2537 (emphasis in original). In a footnote, however, the Supreme Court explicitly remarked that \u201c[t]he Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>124 S.Ct. at 2538 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">While the instant case was pending on appeal, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker, </em>finding \u201cno distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue\u201d in <em>Blakely. Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 749. Resolving the constitutional question left open in <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the federal guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>125 S.Ct. at 749-51. In extending its holding in <em>Blakely </em>to the Guidelines, the Court explicitly reaffirmed its rationale in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">In a second and separate majority opinion, the Court in <em>Booker </em>concluded that, to best preserve Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the appropriate remedy was to \u201cexcise\u201d two specific sections \u2014 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (requiring a sentence within the guideline range, absent a departure) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (establishing standards of review on appeal, including <em>de novo </em>review of departures from the applicable guideline range) \u2014 thereby effectively rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory only. <em>Id. </em>125 S.Ct. at 764. Thus, the guidelines range is now advisory; it no longer dictates the final sentencing result but instead is an important sentencing factor that the sentencing court is to consider, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>along with the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>and on remand, we reexamined in <em>United States v. Reese, </em>397 F.3d 1337 (11th Cir.2005), a defendant\u2019s guideline sentence that had been enhanced, over objection, because the defendant possessed a firearm in connection with another felony. <em>Id. </em>at 1337.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Concluding that the defendant\u2019s sentence was in violation of the Sixth Amendment, we vacated and remanded his case and ordered resentencing consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Booker. Id. </em>at 1338.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In <em>Paz, </em>we similarly examined a <em>Blakely /Booker </em>challenge to a six-level enhancement based on the district court\u2019s factual finding, which was not admitted by the defendant, that the amount of loss from the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction was between $30,000 and $70,000, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(D). <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 947, manuscript op. at 2. We determined that, because the defendant\u2019s sentence was enhanced, under a mandatory guidelines system, based on facts found by the judge, the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was violated. <em>Id. </em>at 948, manuscript op. at 5. Moreover, we determined that the government could not show that this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it was evident from the sentencing transcript that, had the court used the guidelines in an advisory fashion, Paz\u2019s sentence would have been shorter. <em>Id. </em>at 949, manuscript op at 6.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We concluded, as such, that the constitutional error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and it remanded for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">To the extent the court calculated McKinney\u2019s guideline range based on prior convictions or facts to which McKinney admitted during his change-of-plea hearings, no error, harmless or otherwise, occurred. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that the court did not err when it enhanced defendant\u2019s sentence based on (1) facts admitted by the defendant, or (2) his prior convictions);<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>see also United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>404 F.3d 1283, 1290-91, slip op. at 1757-58 (11th Cir.2005) (court did not violate the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights by applying an enhancement based on his prior convictions); <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962-64, slip op. at 1792-93 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(Booker </em>is not implicated when a defendant\u2019s sentence is enhanced based on a prior conviction). More importantly, unlike the facts in <em>Reese </em>and <em>Paz, </em>the court here only treated the federal guidelines as advisory. Indeed, the court sentenced McKinney to his total minimum mandatory statutory sentence of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment, instead of within his total guideline range of 330 to 382 months\u2019 imprisonment. No violation of the Sixth Amendment or <em>Booker, </em>therefore, occurred. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Furthermore, in adopting the PSI\u2019s facts and calculations, the court, at least implicitly, considered the PSI\u2019s description of the offense conduct and McKinney\u2019s history and characteristics. In imposing a sentence below McKinney\u2019s guideline range, the court explicitly stated that, although it had considered McKinney\u2019s guideline range, it had concluded that his mandatory minimum sentence was appropriate because he had attempted to cooperate, his offenses involved \u201ca fairly limited drug offense,\u201d and his codefendant\u2019s guideline range was significantly less primarily because his codefendant had plead guilty several days earlier than McKinney. Thus, the court properly considered the nature and circumstances of the offense, McKinney\u2019s character, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities between the codefendants. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(3), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not commit reversible error in denying McKinney\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea to his \u00a7 924(c) offense, imposing a mandatory minimum ten-year consecutive sentence based on his conviction for this offense, or in sentencing him in light of <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker. </em>We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-10\">.

In addition, because McKinney had to serve a mandatory minimum statutory sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment for his \u00a7 924(c) offense in Count 3 of his superseding indictment, this statutory sentence was his guideline sentence for Count 3, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(b), and Count 3 was exempted from the grouping, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Dl.l(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\">.

In addition, because the district court correctly imposed the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, any error in the guideline calculations is harmless. <em>See United States v.
