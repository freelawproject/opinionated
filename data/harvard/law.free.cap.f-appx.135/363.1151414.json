Mohammed, </em>99 Fed.Appx. 885 (11th Cir.2004). In affirming appellant\u2019s sentence, we rejected appellant\u2019s claim that the district court committed a Sixth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>error in basing the sentence on \u201cuncharged drug quantities in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">On July 19, 2004, appellant petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari; in support of his petition, he cited <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), a decision the Court handed down on June 24, 2004. In <em>Blakely, </em>the Court, applying <em>Apprendi </em>to a state guidelines-sentencing scheme similar to the federal guidelines-senteficing scheme, held that the Sixth Amendment (made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment) barred the sentencing judge from enhancing Blakely\u2019s sentence based on facts neither admitted by the defendant nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2537. In the case at hand, the Supreme Court granted Mohammed\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated our judgment, and remanded this case \u201cfor further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).\u201d <em>Mohammed v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1023, 160 L.Ed.2d 1004 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Because appellant timely presented his <em>Apprendi </em>objection to the district court and to this court in his initial brief, we treat his objection as preserving the error recognized in <em>Blakely </em>and now in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Reese, </em>382 F.3d 1308, 1309 (11th Cir.2004), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>397 F.3d 1337 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-16\">In pleading guilty, appellant admitted that he conspired to distribute \u201ca detectable amount of cocaine,\u201d not a specific quantity. The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) prepared by the district court\u2019s probation office held (on the basis of facts reported to the probation office) appellant \u201caccountable for 43 kilograms of cocaine,\u201d a quantity carrying a base offense level of 34.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The PSI then increased this level by two levels for obstruction of justice, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, and two levels for appellant\u2019s leadership role in th\u00e9 conspiracy, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), and thus arrived at an adjusted offense level of 38. Given appellant\u2019s criminal history category of I, level 38 yielded a sentence range calling for a prison sentence at a point between 235 and 293 months, inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-17\">At sentencing, the court, in addressing appellant\u2019s objections to the PSI, declined to make the \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) adjustment, and held appellant accountable for 10.3 kilograms of cocaine, instead of 43 kilograms as the PSI recommended. This lowered appellant\u2019s adjusted offense level to 32,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with a sentence range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court then sentenced appellant to a prison term of 156 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-18\">As stated above, this is a preserved-error case, not a plain-error case. Therefore, to avoid the vacation of appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>sentence and a remand for resentencing, the Government must show that the error did not affect appellant\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a); indeed, the Government must establish that, absent the error, appellant would not have received a lesser sentence. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291 (11th Cir.2005), <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>406 F.3d 1261 (2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005). As the <em>Rodriguez </em>panel expressed it, if, after reviewing the record of the sentencing proceeding in this case, \u201cwe just don\u2019t know\u201d whether the district court would have imposed the same sentence, the Government loses. <em>Id. </em>at 1301. In this case, after reviewing the record, we can\u2019t say what sentence the court would have imposed had it treated the Guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Appellant\u2019s sentence is accordingly vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing in accordance with Booker\u2019s holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-19\">. The sentence was imposed following appellant\u2019s plea of guilty pursuant to a plea agreement with the Government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b390-11\"><em>. </em>Appellant's \"contention [was] based on the notion that he only pled guilty to conspiring to distribute \u2018a detectable amount of cocaine,' not a specific quantity.\u201d <em>United States v.
