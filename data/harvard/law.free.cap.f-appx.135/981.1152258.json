We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>United States v. City of Tacoma, </em>332 F.3d 574, 578 (9th Cir.2003), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Moghaddam\u2019s due process claim arising from the six-month suspension of his telephone privileges because he failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether this sanction violated his constitutional rights. <em>See Valdez v. Rosentaum, </em>302 F.3d 1039, 1047 (9th Cir.2002) (there is no state-created liberty interest in phone privileges where the state statute specifically mandates discretionary limitations on those privileges).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-14\">The district court also properly granted summary judgment to defendants on Moghaddam\u2019s equal protection claim arising from the MDCLA\u2019s policy limiting phone use to 300 minutes per-month because he failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether officials acted with intent to discriminate against him on the basis of his membership in a protected class. <em>See Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir.1998) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-15\">We decline to consider issues on appeal that were not specifically and distinctly argued in appellant\u2019s opening brief. <em>See Jones v. Wood, </em>207 F.3d 557, 562 n. 2 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-16\">Moghaddam\u2019s motion to file a late reply brief is granted. The clerk shall file the brief received on January 10, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1008-12\"> This disposition, is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
