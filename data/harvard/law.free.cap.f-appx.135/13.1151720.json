We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">Dang has not satisfied the <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) test for ineffective assistance of counsel. Dang failed to show that Ms counsel\u2019s \u201cacts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Dang knowingly forced his counsel to trial with little more than thirty days lead time by insisting that the prosecution comply with his statutory speedy trial rights. <em>See Stuard v. Stewart, </em>401 F.3d 1064, 1068-69 (9th Cir.2005). Given the time that she had to prepare, Dang\u2019s counsel could have reasonably declined to pursue forensic testing of the gun allegedly used in the assault in favor of more viable defense strategies. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\u201c[Strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on mvestigation.\u201d). Nor \u25a0 has Dang demonstrated \u201ca reasonable probability that ... the result of the proceeding would have been different\u201d if his counsel had requested the test. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Assuming the test revealed no blood on the gun, the prosecutor could have argued that the assault had been committed with another gun (perhaps the one that Dang had recently sold) or that Dang had time to clean any blood from the gun before his arrest. Accordingly, the state court\u2019s assessment of counsel\u2019s performance was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-13\">Dang did not request an interpreter at trial. <em>See Gonzalez v. United States, </em>33 F.3d 1047, 1051 (9th Cir.1994). Dang has not shown that the trial court disregarded a clear need for an interpreter. <em>See United States v. Si, </em>343 F.3d 1116, 1122 (9th Cir.2003). Hence, we decline to expand the Certificate of Appealability to encompass the due process claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b40-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
