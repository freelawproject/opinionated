As the Superior Court judge noted, Petitioner was not inexperienced in criminal matters and could be expected to understand the. implications of the prior strike on the felony charges he was facing. E.R. at 234. In these circumstances, counsel\u2019s reference to \u201ca horrible exposure\u201d should have alerted Petitioner that he would be facing many years in prison if convicted. Counsel\u2019s assistance was not ineffective because it did not amount to a \u201cgross mischaracterization of the likely outcome presented in the case.\u201d <em>Iaea v.

I also conclude, given those facts and circumstances, that it was objectively unreasonable for the state court to determine that the defendant was not amenable to a plea. The record to the contrary is quite compelling.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1022-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
