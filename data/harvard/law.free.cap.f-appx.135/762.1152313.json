He was sentenced to 77 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Gomez-Garcia argues that his sentence is illegal pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Gomez-Garcia has not established plain error with regard to his <em>Booker </em>claim because he has not established that being sentenced under a mandatory guidelines scheme affected his substantial rights. The record does not indicate that the district court \u201cwould have reached a significantly different result\u201d under a sentencing scheme in which the guidelines were advisory only. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-22 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517); <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733-34 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">Gomez-Garcia also asserts that, under the reasoning of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional because it treats a prior conviction as an element of the offense rather than a sentence enhancement. As Gomez-Garcia concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review. This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-17\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b789-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
