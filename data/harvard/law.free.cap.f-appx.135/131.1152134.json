We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>see Harman v. Apfel, 211 </em>F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir. 2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Grolle\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the district court abused its discretion by remanding for further development of the record, rather than for an immediate award of benefits. The district court did not abuse its discretion, however, because the medical testimony regarding Grolle\u2019s interstitial cystitis left open the question of whether she met the standard for disability under step three of the analysis. <em>See Marcia v. Sullivan, </em>900 F.2d 172, 176 (9th Cir.1990) (\u201cWe remand this case to the Secretary for proper consideration of step three equivalence because he is in a better position to evaluate the medical evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Furthermore, Social Security Ruling 02-2p, which sets forth the proper manner for evaluating interstitial cystitis claims, was enacted after the ALJ\u2019s determination, and remand is appropriate to allow the ALJ to assess the clarified medical testimony in light of this new standard. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b157-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
