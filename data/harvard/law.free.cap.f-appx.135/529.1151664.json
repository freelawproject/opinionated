The District Court sentenced the defendant to 120 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-19\">The defendant filed a pro se notice of appeal, and defense counsel submitted a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and moved to withdraw. Following the decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we issued a per curiam opinion. We identified only one non-frivolous issue, namely, that the District Court had sentenced the defendant on the assumption that the Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory. We vacated the sentence imposed by the District Court and remanded for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker, </em>and we denied counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-23\">We later granted the government\u2019s petition for panel rehearing, and in light of the fact that the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by statute for the offense for which the defendant was convicted is 10 years of imprisonment, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 846, we now conclude that the appeal does not present any non-frivolous issues. We thus dismiss the appeal and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
