He appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Garcia-Aguilar argues for the first time on appeal that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional and that the validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), has been called into question in light of later cases decided by the Supreme Court. He concedes that this issue is foreclosed, and he raises it solely to preserve it for further review by the Supreme Court. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>As Garcia-Aguilar concedes, this argument is foreclosed unless and until the Supreme Court itself decides to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 935, 124 S.Ct. 358, 157 L.Ed.2d 245 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Garcia-Aguilar also argues that the district court erred in sentencing him under a mandatory application of the guidelines prohibited by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756-57, 769, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Garcia-Aguilar did not raise this issue in the district court, so we review it for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005). Although there was an error, Garcia-Aguilar\u2019s arguments and review of the record do not demonstrate \u201cthat the district judge would have imposed a different sentence\u201d under advisory guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 733. Garcia-Aguilar has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights as required under the plain error standard. <em>See Valenzuela-Quevedo </em>407 F.3d at 732-33; <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-22 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005)(No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">Garcia-Aguilar further argues that even if he has failed to show prejudice, the court should reverse because the error was structural and should be deemed presumptively prejudicial. He acknowledges that the court did not adopt this approach in <em>Mares, </em>but he believes that <em>Mares </em>was wrongly decided and he raises the issue to preserve it for further review. The issue is indeed foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b780-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
