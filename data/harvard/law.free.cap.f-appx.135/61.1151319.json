Restani, Chief Judge, United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b88-4\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Juan Gregorio Martinez-Vasquez appeals his conviction in a bench trial for knowingly transporting two illegal aliens within the United States in furtherance of their violation of immigration law, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii). Martinez-Vasquez argues that the government failed to prove the \u201cin furtherance\u201d element of the offense because his conduct did not have a direct and substantial relationship to furthering the illegal aliens\u2019 presence in the United States. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Claims of insufficient evidence are reviewed de novo when the defendant has pled not guilty in a bench trial. <em>United States v. Atkinson, </em>990 F.2d 501, 503 (9th Cir.1993) (en banc). In reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, this court determines \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii), it is illegal for any person who, \u201cknowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law, transports, or moves or attempts to transport or move such alien within the United States by means of transportation or otherwise, in furtherance of such violation of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii). To satisfy the \u201cin furtherance\u201d element of a \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii) violation, the government must prove that Martinez-Vasquez \u201cknowingly transported the aliens in order to help them to remain in the United States illegally.\u201d <em>United States v. Angwin, </em>271 F.3d 786, 805 (9th Cir.2001). However, the government need not prove by direct evidence a defendant\u2019s intent to further the presence of an illegal alien. <em>United States v. Hernandez-Guardado, </em>228 F.3d 1017, 1023 (9th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Hernandez-Franco, </em>189 F.3d 1151, 1155 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201c[Culpable intent ... can be inferred from the defendant\u2019s conduct and from the surrounding circumstances.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The government must also establish \u201ca direct or substantial relationship between that transportation and its furtherance of the alien\u2019s presence in the United States.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>561 F.2d 1321, 1323 (9th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">Sufficient evidence existed to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Martinez-Vasquez acted with the intent to help his passengers remain in the United States illegally. The parties stipulated that Martinez-Vasquez knew that his passengers were illegal aliens. A rational factfinder could have concluded that by driving away from a residence where immigration authorities were conducting a search and offering to take his passengers to a hotel for the night, Martinez-Vasquez intended to help his passengers remain in the United States, and his conduct had a direct and substantial relationship to the furtherance of the aliens\u2019 illegal presence. We therefore find sufficient evidence to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\u201cin furtherance\u201d element of a \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b88-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
