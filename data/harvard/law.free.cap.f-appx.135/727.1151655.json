He appeals his sentence. Guardado argues for the first time on appeal that his constitutional rights to grand jury indictment, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and jury trial were violated when he was sentenced on the basis of facts beyond the fact of a prior conviction. He argues that under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the district court plainly erred in increasing his criminal history score based on its finding that he was under a sentence of parole and under a sentence of probation at the time of the commission of the instant offense. He concedes that because he did not object on <em>Blakely </em>grounds in the district court, his claim must be reviewed for plain error. He contends that the error was plain and that his substantial rights were affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-15\">Guardado\u2019s claim that the district court plainly erred by increasing his sentence based on facts not determined by a jury and which he did not admit is unavailing because he failed to show that \u201cthe sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">Guardado concedes that the issue whether his sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) was rendered illegal by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and subsequent Supreme Court precedent is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and he raises it solely to preserve it for further review by the Supreme Court. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; As Guardado concedes, this argument is foreclosed unless and until the Supreme Court itself decides to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 935, 124 S.Ct. 358, 157 L.Ed.2d 245 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b754-26\">Pursuant to 5th Cir.
