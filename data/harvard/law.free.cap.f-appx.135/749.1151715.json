Cuvillos argues, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that he is entitled to resentencing because the district court erred in sentencing him under a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Because Cuvillos did not raise an argument regarding the mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines in the district court, it is reviewed only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005). \u201c[Cuvillos] has not shown, with a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome, that if the judge had sentenced him under an advisory sentencing regime rather than a mandatory one, he would have received a lesser sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Infante, </em>404 F.3d 376, 395 (5th Cir.2005). Because Cuvillos has not satisfied his burden of establishing plain error, he is not entitled to relief. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b775-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
