Toro-Toro also contends that the BIA\u2019s affirmation was an abuse of discretion and violated his due process rights. We find no abuse of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>cretion and no violation of due process and therefore will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Pedro Toro-Toro, a 40 year old native of Colombia, entered the United States in July 2000. On August 11, 2000, Toro-Toro was charged with seeking admission into the United States by fraud pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) and seeking admission without valid entry documentation pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I). Toro-Toro had a Master Calendar Hearing on December 7, 2000 and requested additional time to find legal representation. The IJ granted this request and set a new hearing date, March 1, 2001. Toro-Toro received personal notice of this hearing date and an interpreter read Toro-Toro the notice in Spanish, his native language. Mistakenly believing that his hearing was on March 2, 2001, petitioner missed his March 1, 2001 deportation hearing. In his absence the IJ issued an order removing Toro-Toro to Colombia on the charges contained in the notice to appear. On March 2, 2001, upon arrival at the courthouse for his deportation hearing, Toro-Toro learned that an order of removal had been entered <em>in absentia </em>the previous day.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Toro-Toro filed a motion to reopen on June 4, 2001 and again on October 31, 2002. The first motion was not officially accepted because it was not in proper format. The motion filed in October stated that petitioner missed his deportation hearing because he mistakenly thought his hearing was on March 2, 2001, rather than March 1, 2001. He also noted that his wife and three children were granted asylum in September 13, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">On November 25, 2002, an IJ denied 'Toro-Toro\u2019s motion to reopen on the grounds that petitioner had notice of the deportation hearing date and his failure to appear was not justified by exceptional circumstances. On November 7, 2003, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s holding and added that \u201c[t]he fact that the respondent\u2019s wife and children have now been granted asylum does not changed the result of this case or provide any basis for reopening or remanding the proceeding as the Immigration Judge has no jurisdiction over claims to derivative asylee status. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.21(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">The denial of a motion to reopen is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 324, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Under an abuse of discretion standard an agency\u2019s order is only disturbed if found to be arbitrary, irrational or contrary to law. <em>Tipu v. INS, </em>20 F.3d 580, 582 (3d Cir.1994). In addition, courts give significant deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own statute. <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Claims that Petitioner\u2019s due process rights were violated by the deportation proceeding are reviewed de novo. <em>Sharma v. INS, </em>89 F.3d 545, 547 (9th Cir.1996). This court has jurisdiction to review the denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)-(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">\n<em>1. Exceptional Circumstances Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">An IJ must order a removal <em>in absentia </em>of an alien if the alien does not attend his deportation hearing and clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that the alien received notice of the hearing and that he is removable. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A). An IJ may rescind an order of deportation entered <em>in abstentia </em>only if the alien demonstrates he or she was unable to appear at his or her removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>hearing due to exceptional circumstances. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). Exceptional circumstances are defined as \u201ccircumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative of the alien, <em>but not including less compelling </em>circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(l) (emphasis added). Toro-Toro claims that his misunderstanding of his hearing date, which caused him to miss his deportation hearing, constitutes an exceptional circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The BIA correctly found that Toro-Toro\u2019s misunderstanding of his hearing date does not constitute exceptional circumstances. The IJ and the BIA are required to consider the record as a whole when determining whether an alien meets the exceptional circumstances standard. <em>Romero-Morales v. INS, </em>25 F.3d 125, 127 (2d Cir.1994). Toro-Toro bases his exceptional circumstances argument on the fact that he misunderstood his hearing date to be March 2, 2001, rather than March 1, 2001. The record indicates that Toro-Toro was personally served with a notice of the hearing which designated March 1, 2001, as the date of the hearing. A Spanish interpreter was also present to inform Toro-Toro about the date and consequences of missing the trial. Under the circumstances surrounding Toro-Toro\u2019s notice, his misunderstanding of his hearing date, is far less compelling than serious illness or death of a relative and therefore the IJ did not abuse his discretion in holding that Toro-Toro failed to meet the exceptional circumstances standard and denying his motion to reopen pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) of the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">\n<em>2. Due Process Violation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Toro-Toro\u2019s due process rights were not violated with the denial of his motion to reopen proceedings. The constitutional sufficiency of an administrative hearing varies according to the nature of the case and the relative importance of the governmental and private interests involved. <em>Sharma, </em>89 F.3d at 548 <em>(citing Landon v. Plasencia, </em>459 U.S. 21, 34, 103 S.Ct. 321, 74 L.Ed.2d 21 (1982)). The government may set a higher standard for a motion to reopen because it has an interest in maintaining judicial efficiency. <em>Id. </em>The BIA\u2019s denial of Toro-Toro\u2019s motion to reopen did not deprive the petitioner of due process. The IJ properly applied the exceptional circumstances standard to Toro-Toro\u2019s case and the BIA properly reviewed the judge\u2019s application of it. Toro-Toro\u2019s failure to meet this standard does not equate to violation of his due process rights. <em>See Sharma, </em>89 F.3d at 548 (finding the application of the exceptional circumstances standard did not violate petitioners\u2019 due process rights when they arrived 45 minutes late for their deportation hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">For the foregoing reasons we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-25\">. The IJ cited \u00a7 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) in his Order. This section has been codified in the United States Code.
