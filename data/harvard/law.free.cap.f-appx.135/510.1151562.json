Angeloni brought a sexual harassment and retaliation claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2000e-17, against the Diocese of Scranton, Villa St. Joseph, and Reverend Aex Hazzouri (collectively \u201cappellees\u201d). The District Court granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on October 22, 2003 and dismissed the state law claims. A timely appeal followed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b537-16\">As we write only for the parties, we will confine our discussion to those facts relevant to the instant disposition. Angeloni worked as a dining room and kitchen server at Villa St. Joseph, a home for priests in Pennsylvania, from August of 1996 until January 19, 1998. She was fourteen and fifteen years old. Reverend Hazzouri allegedly began touching her inappropriately a few months after she began working at Villa St. Joseph. She estimated that the touching occurred at least ten times, and always the same way \u2014 when she was waiting on Reverand Hazzouri\u2019s table, his right hand would come into contact with her left thigh.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-17\">In May or June of 1997, Angeloni told her supervisor, Annette Balint, about the touchings, and then in July of 1997, Angeloni told her parents. Aso in July, Angeloni\u2019s mother had a meeting with Ms. Balint; by that time, Ms. Balint had spoken with Bishop John M. Dougherty, the rector at Villa St. Joseph. Both Ms. Balint and Bishop Dougherty talked to Angeloni\u2019s co-workers and to Reverend Hazzouri, and all denied that any inappropriate touching took place. Based on these discussions, they suggested that Angeloni simply stop serving Reverend Hazzouri\u2019s table so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>she could avoid any discomfort.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bishop Dougherty also met with her parents that summer, and tried to reassure them that steps were being taken to make sure that Angeloni was not in any danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">No further touching took place, but Angeloni stated that in December of 1997, Reverend Hazzouri apprbached her and told her he was worried about what she had said about him. Angeloni said she was intimidated, and told her parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">On December 17, 1997, Angeloni\u2019s mother met again with Bishop Dougherty and expressed concerns for her daughter\u2019s safety. Bishop Dougherty replied that he did not think there was cause for concern, but added that if Mrs. Angeloni was worried, Angeloni could stop working there. He also suggested that they meet with Reverend Hazzouri. Mrs. Angeloni did not want to have such a meeting, and the family instead decided that Angeloni should no longer work at Villa St. Joseph. Angeloni\u2019s resignation was effective January 19,1998. She filed suit more than four years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">We review the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>See Sempier v. Johnson &amp; Higgins, </em>45 F.3d 724, 727 (3d Cir.1995). Summary judgment is proper when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). If the evidence would be insufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find for the non-moving party, summary judgment is warranted. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In reviewing that evidence, we consider it and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Eddy v. V.I. Water &amp; Power Auth., </em>369 F.3d 227, 228 n. 1 (3d Cir.2004),</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">\n<em>1. Title VII Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">The District Court granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the grounds that; (1) there was no causal connection between Reverend Hazzouri\u2019s alleged touching and Bishop Dougherty\u2019s \u201cemployment actions\u201d against Angeloni to support a claim of <em>quid pro quo </em>sexual harassment; (2) the elements of a hostile work environment claim were not satisfied because no reasonable jury could find that <em>respondeat superior </em>liability exists; and (3) there was no retaliatory conduct because Angeloni was not constructively discharged, and therefore no adverse employment action was taken against her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-14\">\n<em>A Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment and Retaliation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-15\">Both Angeloni\u2019s <em>quid pro quo </em>sexual harassment claim and her retaliation claim depend upon her ability to prove that she was constructively discharged. <em>See Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., </em>206 F.3d 271, 281-82 (3d Cir.2000) (explaining that a plaintiff trying to prove <em>quid pro </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>quo </em>sexual harassment must show that \u201cher response to unwelcome advances was subsequently used as a basis for a decision about [employment].\u201d). This is fundamental to her claims, because \u201cconstructive discharge acts as the functional equivalent of an actual termination\u201d that can ground an employment discrimination suit. <em>See Suders v. Easton, </em>325 F.3d 432, 446 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">To find constructive discharge, a court \u201cneed merely find that the employer knowingly permitted conditions of discrimination in employment so intolerable that a reasonable person subject to them would resign.\u201d <em>Goss v. Exxon Office Sys. Co., </em>747 F.2d 885, 888 (3d Cir.1984). Put somewhat differently, the plaintiff must show that the alleged discrimination goes beyond a \u201cthreshold of \u2018intolerable conditions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Duffy v. Paper Magic Group, Inc., </em>265 F.3d 163, 169 (3d Cir.2001). \u201cIntolerability ... is assessed by the objective standard of whether a \u2018reasonable person\u2019 in the employee\u2019s position would have felt compelled to resign \u2014 that is, whether [she] would have had no choice but to resign.\u201d <em>Connors v. Chrysler Financial Corp., </em>160 F.3d 971, 976 (3d Cir.1998) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Although we have considered an employer\u2019s suggestion or encouragement that one resign as indicative of constructive discharge, <em>see Clowes v. Allegheny Valley Hosp., </em>991 F.2d 1159, 1161 (3d Cir.1993), any such suggestion or encouragement is not dispositive. <em>See Suders, 325 </em>F.3d at 446 (noting that the inquiry into constructive discharge is \u201ca heavily fact-driven determination.\u2019\u2019) (internal citations omitted). Here, it is not disputed that, in December of 1997, Bishop Dougherty suggested that if Angeloni did not feel comfortable working at Villa St. Joseph, she could resign; however, this suggestion was made during the course of a meeting with Angeloni\u2019s mother, during which she had expressed concerns for her daughter\u2019s safety. As Bishop Dougherty explained in his deposition, he suggested the possibility of resignation because he \u201cfelt as a priest that [he] wanted to reach out to [Angeloni\u2019s parents].\u201d A258-59. Significantly, during that same meeting, Bishop Dougherty offered to have a meeting with both of Angeloni\u2019s parents and Reverend Hazzouri to see if they could come to some sort of resolution. And, when Angeloni continued to work after the December 1997 meeting, Bishop Dougherty said that he was \u201cthrilled with that.\u201d A263.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Not only does Bishop Dougherty\u2019s suggestion that Angeloni consider resigning seem completely benign, but the conduct \u2022of which Angeloni complained had ended months earlier and the decision to resign was made by Angeloni and her parents at home. Given these facts, there is little or nothing in the record that supports Angeloni\u2019s argument that a reasonable person would consider her work conditions so intolerable that she would feel compelled to resign. That conclusion destroys any constructive discharge claim and, thus, there was no adverse employment action. Summary judgment was, therefore, proper on both the <em>quid pro quo </em>sexual harassment and the retaliation claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">\n<em>B. Hostile Work Environment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AGJ\">In order to succeed on her claim that the Diocese of Scranton and the Villa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>St. Joseph are liable for creating a \u201chostile work environment\u201d, Angeloni was required to satisfy a five-prong test, showing that: (1) she suffered intentional discrimination because of her sex; (2) the discrimination was \u201cpervasive and regular\u201d; (3) she was detrimentally affected; (4) the discrimination she points to would also detrimentally affect another reasonable young woman in the same position; and (5) respondeat superior liability exists. <em>See Suders, </em>325 F.3d at 441. The District Court concluded that there was \u201cno dispute\u201d that the first and third requirements were satisfied, and held that a reasonable jury could find that the second and fourth requirements were also met. While it appears that the District Court\u2019s conclusions might have been overly generous to Angeloni, we will accept them and nonetheless affirm the grant of summary judgment, as the final requirement certainly was not met. Angeloni\u2019s claim of hostile work environment, therefore, necessarily fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Applying traditional agency principles, respondeat superior liability exists when \u201cthe defendant knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action.\u201d <em>Andrews v. City of Philadelphia, </em>895 F.2d 1469, 1486 (3d Cir.1990) (internal citations omitted). Therefore, \u201cif a plaintiff proves that management-level employees had actual or constructive knowledge about the existence of a sexually hostile work environment and failed to take prompt and adequate remedial action, the employer will be liable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Angeloni admits that she did not tell Ms. Balint about the touching until May or June of 1997. By July, Ms. Balint had told Bishop Dougherty. Even assuming that Ms. Balint and Bishop Dougherty would be considered management-level \u201cemployees\u201d, both took \u201cprompt and adequate\u201d remedial action. For her part, Ms. Balint referred the matter to Bishop Dougherty, interviewed the other waitresses, and suggested that Angeloni could be relieved of her serving duties at Reverend Hazzouri\u2019s table. For his part, Bishop Dougherty said that he felt he \u201chad to get to the bottom of this,\u201d so he spoke with Reverend Hazzouri and Ms. Balint several times. He also relayed the situation to the Diocese and told Reverend Hazzouri that he was to cease any conduct that might make Angeloni uncomfortable. Finally, he approved Ms. Balint\u2019s suggestion that Angeloni stop serving Reverend Hazzouri\u2019s table, a suggestion that was immediately implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">In terms of the adequacy of these remedial steps, by all accounts any touching that had occurred ended by July 1997. Indeed, even after Angeloni chose to ignore the suggestion not to serve Reverend Hazzouri, and began doing so again, she never reported further inappropriate conduct. Summary judgment was properly granted on the hostile environment claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">\n<em>2. State Law Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">The District Court also concluded that, because summary judgment was granted on Angeloni\u2019s federal claims, it would not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims. The exercise of supplemental jurisdiction is a matter of discretion. <em>See United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966) (\u201c[PJendent jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion, not of plaintiffs right.\u201d), <em>superseded by statute in </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3) (\u201cThe district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction ... if ... the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction\u201d). And, as we have stated, when a federal claim could be, or has been, dismissed on summary judgment, \u201cthe court should ordinarily refrain from exercising [supplemental] jurisdiction in the absence of extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Tully v. Mott Supermarkets, Inc., </em>540 F.2d 187, 196 (3d Cir.1976); see <em>also Univ. of Md. v. Peat, Marwick, Main &amp; Co., </em>996 F.2d 1534, 1540 (3d Cir.1993). The District Court properly refrained from exercising supplemental jurisdiction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-8\">. Angeloni did stop serving Reverend Hazzouri, but eventually resumed service to his table and did so of her own accord.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b538-9\">. For reasons that escape us, appellees did not mention the fact that Angeloni never exhausted her administrative remedies prior to filing suit. <em>See Robinson v. Dalton, </em>107 F.3d 1018, 1021 (3d Cir.1997) (analogizing failure-to-exhaust to statutes of limitations); <em>see also Watson v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>235 F.3d 851, 854 (3d Cir.2000) (explaining that a plaintiff in Pennsylvania must first present her employment-discrimination claims to the appropriate agency before going to federal court). Indeed, the first action Angeloni took with reference to this case was to file her complaint in the District Court on February 20, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\">. It has been assumed for the purposes of argument that Bishop Dougherty could be considered an \"employer\u201d as the rector at Villa St. Joseph; however, it should be noted that Title VII defines an employer as \"a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks\u201d. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b). We do not have information in the record confirming that the Villa would satisfy those requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\">. Although individually named in the suit, Reverend Hazzouri could not be liable under Title VII because he was not Angeloni's employer; <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
