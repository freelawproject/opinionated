Finley argues that a jury instruction given by the trial court violated his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 2253, and we affirm. As an initial matter, we \u2022 conclude that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling on this issue did not rest on an independent and adequate state law ground. <em>See Bennett v. Mueller, </em>322 F.3d 573, 580 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-20\">When examining permissive inference jury instructions, the Supreme Court has held that the proper inquiry is whether there is \u201ca \u2018rational connection\u2019 between the basic facts that the prosecution proved and the ultimate fact presumed, and the latter is \u2018more likely than not to flow from\u2019 the former.\u201d <em>County Court of Ulster County v. Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 165, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979) (citations omitted). Here, the ultimate fact inferred reasonably flowed from the basic facts proven at trial; the inference of guilt provided for in the instruction was rationally connected to the facts proven by the prosecution. As such, the state court\u2019s decision denying Finley\u2019s due process claim was neither \u201ccontrary to,\u201d nor \u201can unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b151-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
