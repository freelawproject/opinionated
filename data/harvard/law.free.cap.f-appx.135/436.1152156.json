Garcia was sentenced as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, based upon his prior felony convictions in federal court for drug trafficking offenses and crimes of violence. After Garcia was sentenced, but before he filed his original appellate brief, the Supreme Court decided <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). While his appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). At our invitation, the parties filed supplemental briefs in light of <em>Booker. </em>Garcia raises two <em>Blakely/Booker </em>issues on appeal, which he concedes were not preserved below. Having failed to satisfy the plain error standard set forth in <em>United States v. Antonakopoulos, </em>399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir.2005), Garcia is not entitled to the relief he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-17\">I. <em>Blakely Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-18\">Garcia\u2019s <em>pre-Booker </em>argument was that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the federal sentencing guidelines and that his sentence enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, as a career offender, was invalid under <em>Blakely </em>because the fact of the requisite prior convictions was not submitted to a jury or proven beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Even under pre-Boo/cer law, Garcia\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>claim is without merit because \u201cthe rationale of <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to sentence-enhancement provisions based upon prior criminal convictions.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>286 F.3d 47, 51 (1st Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Stearns, </em>387 F.3d 104, 107 (1st Cir.2004) (holding that the fact of a prior conviction is beyond the ambit of <em>Blakely), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1614, 161 L.Ed.2d 289 (2005). <em>Post-Booker </em>it remains the law that \u201cprior criminal convictions are not facts that a jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>406 F.3d 11, 20 (1st Cir.2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, there was no <em>Blakely </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Moreover, this circuit has held that \u201c[t]he error under <em>Booker </em>is ... that the defendant was sentenced under a <em>mandatory </em>Guidelines system,\u201d <em>Antonakopoulos, </em>399 F.3d at 76, not \u201cthat the judge, based on facts found by him, had increased the sentence beyond that authorized solely by the facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79. \u201cIn <em>Antonakopoulos, </em>we \u2018rejected] the view that a <em>Blakely </em>[Sixth Amendment] error automatically requires a <em>Booker </em>remand\u2019 for resentencing. 399 F.3d at 79. We were very clear that the judge\u2019s finding of \u2018additional facts which raised the sentence authorized solely by the jury verdict or guilty pleas ... is insufficient to meet the third and fourth <em>Olano </em>prongs on plain-error review.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>Instead, this court must find a reasonable probability that advisory Guidelines would have produced a more favorable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Brennick, </em>405 F.3d 96, 102 n. 3 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">II. <em>Post-Booker Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALQ\">Garcia\u2019s second argument, set forth in his supplemental brief, is that his sentence violated <em>Booker </em>because it was imposed under a mandatory Guidelines regime. This claim satisfies the first two <em>Olano </em>prongs. <em>See Antonakopoulos, </em>399 F.3d at 77. However, to proceed, Garcia \u201cmust point to circumstances creating a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new \u2018advisory Guidelines\u2019 <em>Booker </em>regime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75. He has not satisfied that requirement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">Garcia faces an uphill battle because of the circumstances of his sentencing. First, the sentencing court imposed a sentence of 180 months, at the middle of the applicable guideline sentencing range (168-210 months), despite the government\u2019s recommendation that he be sentenced at the bottom of that range. Second, the sentencing judge indicated in several comments that the sentence was, if anything, too lenient. The court specifically stated to Garcia at sentencing that the long sentence was justified by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>\u201cneed to take you off the street, ... to protect the public from people like you.\u201d That disposes of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Garcia\u2019s conviction and sentence are <em>affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. R. 27(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-12\">. In his original brief, Garcia also argued that the sentencing judge\u2019s findings regarding drug quantity and possession of a firearm violated <em>Blakely. </em>Because the district court sentenced Garcia under \u00a7 4B1.1 as a career offender, however, the drug quantity and possession of a firearm were irrelevant to the calculation of his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\">. Garcia has not argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (U.S. March 7, 2005), overruled the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>exception. This court has not addressed the issue, but the circuits which have done so have held that \"the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>exception for prior convictions still stands.\u201d <em>United States v. Schlifer, </em>403 F.3d 849, 852 (7th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Mattix, </em>404 F.3d 1037 (8th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>401 F.3d 1220 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b464-13\">. Garcia argued that no prejudice showing should be required because the <em>Booker </em>error is \"structural.\u201d However, as he concedes, that argument has been expressly rejected by this court. <em>See Antonakopoulos, </em>399 F.3d at 80 n. 11. We decline Garcia\u2019s invitation to ignore <em>Antonakopoulos. </em>Absent unusual circumstances not present here, panels of this court are bound by prior circuit decisions. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>311 F.3d 435, 438-39 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
