Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 9A.52.025(1) (residential burglary) and 9A.28.020 (attempt). Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant\u2019s offense level is enhanced 16 levels if he were deported or unlawfully remained in the United States after a conviction for a felony \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d and includes \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. app. n. 1(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The district court properly concluded that Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 9A.52.025(1) did not qualify categorically as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d pursuant to the analysis set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600\u201402, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) because the statute encompasses conduct not included in the federal burglary definition. <em>United States v. Wenner, </em>351 F.3d 969, 972-73 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">In conducting a modified categorical analysis, the district court erred in determining that police reports qualified as judicially noticeable documents. <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1260-61, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). However, this error was harmless because the transcript of the plea colloquy, which may be considered in a modified categorical analysis, <em>id. </em>at 1259, provided a sufficient basis for the district court to conclude that the prior offense qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The fact that Cruz-Serrano entered a nolo contendere plea is of no consequence in assessing whether the conviction may be counted as a predicate offense. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>390 F.3d 661, 665 (9th Cir.2004), <em>as amended </em>405 F.3d 726 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b54-15\">The imposition of the enhanced sentence based on the prior conviction did not violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zapeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.2000). The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) does not alter this analysis. <em>United States v. Cortez-Arias, </em>403 F.3d 1111, 1114 n. 8 (9th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Quintana-Quintana, </em>383 F.3d 1052, 1053 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-16\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b54-17\">In supplemental submissions to the Court, Cruz-Serrano contends that re-sentencing is required pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court severed the mandatory sentencing provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, rendering its sentencing provisions, including the Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Guidelines, effectively advisory. We recently held that \u201cwhen we are faced with an unpreserved <em>Booker </em>error that may have affected a defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and the record is insufficiently clear to conduct a complete plain error analysis, a limited remand to the district court is appropriate for the purpose of ascertaining whether the sentence imposed would have been materially different had the district court known that the sentencing guidelines were advisory.\u201d <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005). Pursuant to <em>Ameline, </em>we remand the case to the district court for proceedings consistent with the procedure described in <em>Ameline.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">AFFIRMED in part; REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b54-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
