For the first time on appeal, Meza-Flores argues that his sentence violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) because it was based on an amount of \u201cice\u201d methamphetamine that was never admitted by him. He argues that under <em>Booker, </em>he could only be sentenced based on the amount of drug that was proven in this case by \u201cadmission,\u201d which was 1.8 kilograms of \u201cice\u201d methamphetamine. Because Meza-Flores did not object in the district court to his sentence on this basis, his argument is reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">Even if Meza-Flores was held accountable for only 1.8 kilograms of \u201cice\u201d methamphetamine, his base offense level would have remained the same. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1). The sentence thus did not exceed the maximum authorized by the facts admitted by Meza-Flores during the plea proceedings. To the extent that the district court\u2019s selection of a sentence within the guidelines range was based on the erroneous conclusion that Meza-Flores should be held responsible for the full 4.53 kilogram amount, Meza-Flores must show that the court\u2019s error was plain and that it affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 316-17 (5th Cir.2005). He has made no such showing. <em>Id. </em>at 317-18. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b746-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
