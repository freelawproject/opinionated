R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b120-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-23\">Chad Allen English appeals the 24-month sentence imposed after revocation of his supervised release. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-24\">English contends that the district court erred by concluding that he committed a Grade A violation of his supervised release under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1 (policy statement). Specifically, English contends that the sentencing court erred in concluding that English\u2019s violation conduct constituted a felony battery. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-25\">In <em>United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201, 1208-11 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), we held that sentencing courts should not consider recidivist enhancements in determining whether a state-law prior conviction is a felony. Therefore, to the extent that the district court in this case concluded that English had committed a felony battery because it was a third-time offense, that conclusion provided an invalid basis for determining that English\u2019s conduct constituted a Grade A violation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Appellee contends that the district court\u2019s characterization of English\u2019s prior conviction as a felony was permissible because, under Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 200.481(f), a probationer who commits battery is guilty of a felony. We are not persuaded. We held in <em>United States v. Moreno-Hernandez, </em>397 F.3d 1248, 1254 n. 7 (9th Cir. 2005), that the rule of <em>Corona-Sanchez </em>did not implicate offenses, such as being a felon in possession of a firearm, that are <em>only </em>illegal because of an offender\u2019s status. The offense in the present case does not fit the exception carved out in footnote 7 of <em>Moreno-Hemandez, </em>however, because battery is not an offense that is <em>only </em>illegal when committed by a probationer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The district court did not have the benefit of <em>Moreno-Hernandez </em>when it sentenced English on the supervised release violation because that case was not decided until after appellant\u2019s sentencing. We vacate and remand for the district court\u2019s reconsideration of English\u2019s sentence in light of <em>Moreno-Hemandez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b120-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
