He argues that the district court erred in denying his motion because his detention following the initially valid traffic stop was unconstitutionally prolonged and that his subsequent consent to the search of his vehicle was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s ultimate conclusions on Fourth Amendment issues de novo. <em>United States v. Brigham, </em>382 F.3d 500, 506 n. 2 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). Because Jordan concedes that his initial stop was valid, the pertinent inquiry in this appeal is whether his detention following the stop was reasonable to dispel Trooper Chauvin\u2019s suspicion of unlawful activity that developed during the course of the stop. <em>See id. </em>at 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">Jordan contends that it took Chauvin 12 minutes to complete the citation for which he was pulled over, when the ticket should have been issued within a matter of seconds, and that Chauvin unreasonably and unconstitutionally prolonged his detention beyond that necessary to effectuate the purpose of the initial stop, asking questions unrelated to the stop and \u201crelying on a vague hunch of wrongdoing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">Contrary to Jordan\u2019s assertion, Chauvin did not ask any impermissible questions during the course of his detention. <em>See Brigham, </em>382 F.3d at 508. Moreover, the transcript of the suppression hearing establishes that Chauvin relied on more than a \u201cvague hunch of wrongdoing;\u201d instead, Chauvin\u2019s actions were a graduated response to emerging facts, were reasonable under a totality of the circumstances, and did not unconstitutionally extend Jordan\u2019s detention. <em>See id. </em>at 506-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-16\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b810-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
