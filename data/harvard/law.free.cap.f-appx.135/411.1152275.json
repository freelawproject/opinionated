At sentencing, the district court properly calculated the guidelines sentence range as 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court then granted the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for downward de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>parture based on Martin\u2019s substantial assistance. Instead of departing to 62 months\u2019 imprisonment, as recommended by the government, the district court imposed a sentence of 60 months\u2019 probation. The government now appeals the extent of the district court\u2019s downward departure. After review and oral argument, we vacate Martin\u2019s sentence in its entirety and remand this case to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AAR\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">From 1996 through March 2003, a group of HealthSouth officers conspired to artificially inflate HealthSouth\u2019s reported earnings, earnings per share, and overall financial condition. As a result, HealthSouth\u2019s public financial records overstated its assets by hundreds of millions of dollars, and public investors purchased overvalued shares of HealthSouth\u2019s stock. According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) prepared in this case, the approximate amount of the loss to HealthSouth investors was $1.4 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Defendant Martin was employed by HealthSouth from 1989 to 2000, and served as its Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d) from 1997 to 2000. During his tenure as CFO, Martin was aware that HealthSouth\u2019s earnings would not meet expectation. According to Martin, at the direction of the Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d), Martin falsified numbers to inflate HealthSouth\u2019s stated earnings to meet expectation. During the period in which Martin served as CFO, he knowingly falsified the numbers virtually every month. Martin repeatedly discussed with the CEO the fact that the income statements provided to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the investors were inaccurate. Martin nevertheless signed HealthSouth\u2019s 10-Q and 10-K forms from 1997 to 1999, with the knowledge that the attached financial statements misrepresented the company\u2019s financial condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">On April 8, 2003, the government filed a three-count information against Martin, charging him with: (1) one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and mail fraud and falsify books and records, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (Count One); and (2) one count of falsifying books, records, and accounts, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(5), and 78ff, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.13b2-l, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Count Two). The information also included a forfeiture count (Count Three). Pursuant to a plea agreement, Martin pled guilty to all three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">The PSI indicated that Martin\u2019s offense level was 31 and his criminal history category was I, resulting in a guidelines sentence range of 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">On June 16, 2004, the government filed a motion for downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 based on Martin\u2019s substantial assistance. In that motion, the government explained that \u201c[fjrom the discovery of the defendant\u2019s participation in the conspiracy,\u201d Martin had been truthful and cooperated \u201cwithout hesitation,\u201d had been available \u201con a continuous and regular basis,\u201d and had \u201cprovided valuable assistance in helping the United States, HealthSouth, and the forensic auditor discover, in an expeditious manner, the varied ways in which the massive fraud at Health-South was conducted.\u201d Specifically, the motion explained that Martin \u201cprovided direct evidence of the former CEO\u2019s knowledge of the fraud at HealthSouth,\u201d including \u201cevidence of direct conversations about the fraud with the former CEO.\u201d The government\u2019s motion further stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s assistance has aided both the seeming of guilty pleas from other co-conspirators and the investigation of other individuals yet to be prosecuted,\u201d and that Martin\u2019s \u201cimmediate cooperation allowed the HealthSouth case to be prosecuted at a pace which, on a relative basis, constitutes swift and efficient enforcement of the United States\u2019 criminal laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">On June 19, 2004, the district court held a sentencing hearing. The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s calculations that Martin\u2019s offense level was 31, his criminal history category was I, and his guidelines sentence range was 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court then heard from the government about its \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The government described Martin\u2019s assistance as valuable, and, in response to the district court\u2019s questions, clarified that of the HealthSouth defendants from whom the district court had taken guilty pleas, Martin and one other defendant had direct connections with the former HealthSouth CEO. The government also explained that Martin had tried to talk the CEO into ending the fraudulent conduct and, when those efforts failed, resigned from HealthSouth in 2000. The government further described Martin\u2019s assistance as \u201cequal to or greater than the assistance\u201d provided by others who had come before the Court to date.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">At that time, the district court announced that it would depart downward from level 31 to level 10, which, when combined with a criminal history category I, yielded a sentence of 6 to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court then heard Martin\u2019s mitigation arguments, including testimony from counsel for the victims, who described Martin\u2019s unusual cooperation not only with the government but also with the victims of the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">In response, the government argued that, while Martin\u2019s assistance was valuable, Martin nevertheless was \u201cthe most culpable of those who have been sentenced to date,\u201d that \u201c[h]e was the most senior officer, he had the most authority, and he was involved the longest,\u201d and that \u201che obtained substantial income and status, social status, from this position at Health-South,\u201d at a huge loss to the victims. The government further stated, with regard to the need for deterrence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">Finally, Your Honor, you asked a question as to why someone like Mr. Martin would do something like this. I would suggest that part of the reason was the culture, the corporate culture, that existed at HealthSouth during that period of time. Our fear is that that corporate culture existed in many, many other corporations; and perhaps exists today in many other corporations. We suggest that a light sentence does nothing to [ajffect that corporate culture. What I\u2019m speaking of, of course, is the deterrent value of a sentence in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A99\">The government also objected to the district court\u2019s decision to depart downward to level 10. Instead, the government suggested that a level 25 and sentence of 62 months\u2019 imprisonment would be appropriate. In the event that the district court decided to depart to a level 10 over its objection, the government recommended the maximum possible sentence in that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">The district court then engaged in the following dialogue with the government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFH\">THE COURT: And were I to impose the sentence that the government recommends, the government would retain the right at the end of the [former CEO] trial to make a motion for a further reduction of Mr. Martin\u2019s sentence, which might include probation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5qh\">MR. RASMUSSEN: It could theoretically include probation, Your Honor. However, the factors that I\u2019ve listed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>today would militate against that. So I cannot \u2014 I hesitate to commit that we would\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\">THE COURT: But you would have the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">MR. RASMUSSEN: \u2014 we would have the authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">THE COURT:- \u2014 you would have the authority to do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">MR. RASMUSSEN: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. So we would like to make sure that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">THE COURT: So it may be a question of whether you\u2019re going to grant probation or I\u2019m going to do it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The district court then summarily imposed a sentence of 60 months\u2019 probation with a special condition of 6 months\u2019 home detention on each of Counts One and Two, to run concurrently. The government objected to the reasonableness of the extent of the departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">In its written judgment, the district court checked the box stating that the downward departure was \u201cbased on 5K1.1 motion of the government based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance,\u201d and offered no further reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">The government timely appealed the district court\u2019s downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">On appeal, the government argues that: (1) the extent of the downward departure and resulting sentence were unjustified and unreasonable; and (2) that the district court failed to adequately and specifically state the reasons for its departure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">Section 5K1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines specifies that the district court may depart downward based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsB\"><em>for reasons stated </em>that may include, but are not limited to, consideration of the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-21\">(1) the court\u2019s evaluation of the significance and usefulness of the defendant\u2019s assistance, taking into consideration the government\u2019s evaluation of the assistance rendered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-22\">(2) the truthfulness, completeness, and reliability of any information or testimony provided by the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-23\">(3) the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-24\">(4) any injury suffered, or any danger or risk of injury to the defendant or his family resulting from his assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-25\">(5) the timeliness of the defendant\u2019s assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-26\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Kl.l(a) (emphasis added). The commentary to \u00a7 5K1.1 recognizes that \u201cthe [njature, extent, and significance of assistance can involve a broad spectrum of conduct that must be evaluated by the court on an individual basis,\u201d and thus that latitude is afforded the sentencing judge to reduce a sentence based on \u201cvariable relevant factors.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 comment, (backg\u2019d.). \u201cThe sentencing judge <em>must, </em>however, <em>state the reasons </em>for reducing a sentence under this section.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the guidelines require that the district court\u2019s stated reasons must be individualized to the defendant based on the relevant factors and more specific than a simple statement that the reduction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance. Further, the commentary to \u00a7 5K1.1 requires the sentencing court to give \u201csubstantial weight ... to the government\u2019s evaluation of the extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, comment, n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The government did not raise any <em>Booker </em>issue in its appeal, and thus there is no .BooZcer-type issue that we must review in this appeal. Rather, this appeal concerns only the application of \u00a7 5K1.1 of the guidelines to Martin\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This Court reviews a downward departure from the guidelines range for \u201creasonableness.\u201d <em>See United States v. Blas, </em>360 F.3d 1268, 1274 (11th Cir.2004). In <em>Bias, </em>we explained that \u201ca reviewing court determines the reasonableness of the departure in light of the factors to be considered in imposing the sentence and the reasons the district court provided for departing.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1121, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). \u201cThe district court\u2019s reasons must be sufficiently specific so that an appellate court can engage in the meaningful review envisioned by the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Suarez, </em>939 F.2d 929, 933 (11th Cir.1991). Although we need not decide whether the district court must discuss each of the five factors set forth in \u00a7 5K1.1, we conclude the district court must, at a minimum, give some indication of the \u00a7 5K1.1 factors upon which it relies and the reasons for the extent of the departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Here, the district court granted Martin an extraordinary departure, departing downward by 21 levels and eliminating a 108 to 135-month term of imprisonment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Yet the district court failed to specify any reasons, either orally or in his written statement of reasons, for this extraordinary departure. It is unclear from the record (1) whether the district court relied upon permissible factors<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) if so, whether the extent of the departure was reasonable.' As a result, the record in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>case is incapable of meaningful appellate review. \u201cAlthough the district court has broad discretion in determining the extent of a downward departure, that discretion is not without limits, and appellate review is not an empty exercise.\u201d <em>United States v. Dalton, </em>404 F.3d 1029, 1034 (8th Cir.2005). Particularly in light of the extraordinary departure in this case, we will not presume that the extent of the departure was reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 1033.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Accordingly, we vacate Martin\u2019s sentence and remand this case to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion and with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-16\">. We review the extent of a departure for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Blas, </em>360 F.3d 1268, 1274 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b440-19\">. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c), if the district court imposes a sentence \u201coutside the [guidelines] range, ... the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from that described, ... must also be stated with specificity in the written order of judgment and commitment....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b441-6\">. Martin was sentenced prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Although there is no <em>Booker </em>issue that this Court must review in this appeal, <em>Booker </em>will come into play at resentencing. Accordingly, while the district court will not be bound by the guidelines on remand, it first must correctly determine Martin\u2019s guidelines sentence, including any departures permitted under the guidelines, and then impose a sentence that is reasonable in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that \"the Supreme Court concluded in <em>Booker </em>that district courts must still consider the Guidelines in determining a defendant\u2019s sentence,\u201d and that remand is required in any case in which the sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect guidelines application (citation omitted)). If the district court imposes a sentence outside the guidelines range, it must state the reasons for the imposition of that sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b441-11\">. Martin argues that this Court cannot review the reasonableness of the district court\u2019s downward departure because the government invited the error. We rejeot this argument. The government moved the district court to depart downward based on Martin\u2019s substantial assistance. The government does not challenge the district court\u2019s decision to depart. Rather, the government challenges the extent of the departure as unreasonable. The government did not invite the extent of the departure granted in this case, and in fact vigorously objected to it in the district cotut.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b441-12\">. There is some indication in the record that the district court\u2019s extraordinary departure possibly was based in part on its view that the government could, or even would, later seek a further reduction of Martin\u2019s sentence pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \u2014 an impermissible basis for a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure. However, because the district court failed to provide any reasons for the extent of its departure, we cannot determine on this record whether the district court\u2019s basis for departure was permissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b442-15\">. We reject Martin\u2019s argument that we must affirm because the government did not object in the district court to the district court's failure to specify the reasons for its departure. The government did object in the district court to the unreasonableness of the extent of the departure and has preserved that objection on appeal, and this Court cannot determine the reasonableness issue without knowing the reasons for the departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
