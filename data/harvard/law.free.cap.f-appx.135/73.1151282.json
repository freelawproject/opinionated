Restani, Chief Judge, United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b100-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-15\">Plaintiffs Richard and Stella Meyer allege that Mr. Meyer consumed nutritional supplements containing L-tryptophan, an amino acid, manufactured by defendant Showa Denko. They further allege that the Showa Denko L-tryptophan caused Mr. Meyer to develop eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), a painful and debilitating auto-immune disease. The Meyers seek to prove that Mr. Meyer had taken Ltryptophan manufactured by Showa Denko through expert testimony from Dr. Gerald Gleich. The district court excluded Dr. Gleich\u2019s testimony under <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), because it concluded that Dr. Gleich\u2019s opinion that Sliowa Denko manufactured L-tryptophan is the sole cause of EMS is not supported by the scientific literature. The district court then granted summary judgment for Showa Denko. We now reverse the district court\u2019s exclusion of Dr. Gleich\u2019s testimony and therefore also reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Showa Denko.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b100-17\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to exclude expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999). Here, the district court abused its discretion when it excluded Dr. Gleich\u2019s expert testimony. In <em>Daubert, </em>the Supreme Court set out the relevant standard by which courts should determine whether to admit expert testimony into evidence. The Court held that the guiding factors in this determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>are whether the expert testimony reflects \u201c(1) scientific knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.\u201d 509 U.S. at 592. We have since described the <em>Daubert </em>rule as requiring that we focus our inquiry on the \u201cprinciples and methodology underlying the expert\u2019s testimony, not on the conclusion.\u201d <em>Kennedy v. Collagen Corp., </em>161 F.3d 1226, 1228 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Dr. Gleich in his affidavit stated that \u201c[t]he fact that [Mr. Meyer] has EMS and that Showa Denko contaminated L-tryptophan has been shown to be the only cause of this condition establishes to a reasonable medical certainty that Mr. Meyers EMS was caused by consumption of Showa Denko L-tryptophan.\u201d He based this statement on his understanding of the scientific literature as well as on his own substantial research of EMS. The district court nonetheless excluded Dr. Gleich\u2019s affidavit because it found fault with Dr. Gleich\u2019s conclusions. But, as we stated in <em>Kennedy, </em>it is the \u201cprinciples and methodology\u201d underlying the testimony \u2014 not the conclusions \u2014 that properly inform a <em>Daubert </em>analysis. <em>Kennedy, 161 F.3d </em>at 1228. Here, the principles and methodology underlying Dr. Gleich\u2019s affidavit have sufficient scientific basis that the district court abused its discretion when it excluded his statements in support of the Meyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>See Buono v. Norton, </em>371 F.3d 543, 545 (9th Cir.2004). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law. <em>See Suzuki Motor Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., </em>330 F.3d 1110, 1131-32 (9th Cir.2003). Here, Dr. Gleich\u2019s affidavit creates a material issue of fact as to how Mr. Meyer contracted EMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Because we hold that Dr. Gleich\u2019s affidavit was improperly excluded, we also hold that the district court improvidently granted Showa Denko\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b100-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
