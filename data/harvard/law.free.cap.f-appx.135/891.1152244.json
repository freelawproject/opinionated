The Does reached a settlement agreement with all of the defendants but the Williamses, and thereafter proceeded only on their claims for punitive damages against the Williamses. Becky appeared for trial pro se, and the Does and Becky waived trial by jury, agreed to have the district court determine any award of punitive damages, and stipulated to the admission of certain evidence, including some of the documents in the criminal case against the Williamses, and psychological evaluations diagnosing Mary and Ann with post-traumatic stress disorder. Michael, incarcerated with the Missouri Department of Corrections, did not appear for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">The district court found that Mary and Ann had established their claim of battery against Michael and their claim of negligent supervision against Becky. The court imposed punitive damages of $1 million against Michael, because he had repeatedly \u2014 over an 8-year period \u2014 committed acts of molestation on Mary and Ann, and because he did so from a position of authority as their elementary school music teacher. The court imposed punitive damages of $325,000 against Becky, because she had not merely facilitated the molestation, but encouraged it.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">On appeal, the Williamses argue that the amount of punitive damages was excessive; that under federal criminal law related to restitution for victims, their economic circumstances should have been taken into account in determining the amount of punitive damages; and that Michael should have been allowed to be present at the trial and should have been provided appointed counsel. They also challenge the legitimacy of the psychological evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-15\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude that the punitive damages award was not excessive given that Michael repeatedly sexually molested Mary and Ann over .an 8-year period, and that Becky witnessed and facilitated the molestation. <em>See Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., </em>532 U.S. 424, 435, 121 S.Ct. 1678, 149 L.Ed.2d 674 (2001) (de novo standard of review); <em>BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore, </em>517 U.S. 559, 574-85, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996) (in reviewing punitive damages award for ex-cessiveness, due process and reasonableness requirements compel consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>degree of reprehensibility of defendant\u2019s conduct, difference between award and civil or criminal penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases, and disparity between harm and punitive award); <em>Weaver v. African Methodist Episcopal Church, Inc., 54 </em>S.W.3d <em>575, 589 </em>(Mo.Ct.App.2001) (noting that degree of reprehensibility of defendant\u2019s conduct is most important indicium of reasonableness of punitive damages award, and upholding punitive damages award of $4 million where defendant\u2019s grabbing of victim\u2019s breasts \u201cwas merely the culmination of a long history of far worse verbal and physical sexual harassment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Finally, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Michael\u2019s request for appointed counsel, <em>see Stevens v. Redwing, </em>146 F.3d 538, 546 (8th Cir.1998) (standard of review); <em>Davis v. Scott, </em>94 F.3d 444, 447 (8th Cir. 1996) (indigent inmates have no statutory or constitutional right to appointed counsel for civil litigation); that the district court was not obligated to secure Michael\u2019s presence at the trial, <em>Fruit v. Norris, </em>905 F.2d 1147, 1150 n. 6 (8th Cir.1990); and that the Williamses\u2019 remaining arguments lack merit and do not warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-11\">. The Honorable Henry Edward Autrey, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
