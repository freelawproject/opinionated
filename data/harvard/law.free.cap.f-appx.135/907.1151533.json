We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility finding, and will uphold the IJ\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992-93 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination rests on, among other things, inconsistencies among Singh\u2019s testimony, his application, and his documentary evidence regarding his membership in the Akali Dal Party, and the arrests and detentions he and his wife experienced. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). These discrepancies go to the heart of Singh\u2019s claims of past persecution and fear of future persecution. <em>See id. </em>Because of these material inconsistencies in Singh\u2019s testimony, the IJ properly required Singh to provide corroborating evidence, which Singh failed to do. <em>Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1090 (9th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence and Singh has failed to show eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">As Singh relies on the same evidence, and points to no additional evidence the IJ should have considered regarding the likelihood of torture if returned to India, Singh\u2019s CAT claim also must fail. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b934-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
