George, and Beverly Waddle on various drug charges. Appellant was charged in Count One with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and in Count Two with possession with intent to distribute 11.6 grams of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Appellant pled not guilty and went to trial. On May 13, 2004, the jury found her guilty as charged, and on August 12, 2004, the district court sentenced her to concurrent prison terms of 121 months. She now appeals, challenging her convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-19\">\n<em>The convictions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-20\">1) On May 26, 2004, after the jury found appellant guilty as charged, co-defendant Cooper pled guilty to Count One of the indictment (and was scheduled to be sentenced on April 5, 2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>2004, three days prior to her sentencing hearing, appellant moved the district court for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence \u2014 in the form of Cooper\u2019s testimony. The motion represented that Cooper, who would have invoked his Fifth Amendment right to stand silent had he been called to testify at appellant\u2019s trial, would testify in appellant\u2019s defense and provide exculpatory evidence were appellant granted a new trial. The district court denied the motion in a written order issued on August 25, 2004. We agree with the court\u2019s analysis of appellant\u2019s motion and find no reason for setting aside its order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">2) Appellant asks that we vacate her convictions and remand the case for a new trial on the ground that the district court abused its discretion in sustaining a hearsay objection and thus precluding Cooper\u2019s grandmother, Gladys Cooper, from telling the jury why she wired money (from Alabama) to co-conspirator Charles Dean (who entered into a plea agreement and testified as a prosecution witness at appellant\u2019s trial) in Texas. Defense counsel wanted her to say that she wired the money to Dean \u2014 after he phoned her\u2014 because he said he was stranded and needed the money. Earlier, in the prosecution\u2019s case, Dean had testified that he never called Gladys Cooper \u2014 that he called Cooper and Cooper had Gladys Cooper wire him money to purchase methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The court precluded Gladys Cooper from stating why she sent Dean money because her statement would constitute rank hearsay, offered for the truth of its contents, i.e., that Dean needed money because he was stranded. We agree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defense counsel now contends that her statement, relating what Dean said, was admissible because it would have impeached Dean\u2019s statement that he never called her. Counsel did not present this ground to the district court; we therefore do not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">\n<em>The sentences</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\"><em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) , considered together, hold that the Sixth Amendment bars the district court from enhancing a defendant\u2019s sentence under a mandatory guidelines sentencing system on the basis of facts the defendant neither admits nor the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005)(the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial is violated \u201cwhere under a mandatory guidelines system, a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d). At her sentencing hearing, appellant objected to the district court\u2019s enhancement of her offense level (1) on the basis of 11.6 grams of methamphetamine for which the court held her accountable and (2) for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1., but she did not base her objection on the Sixth Amendment. We therefore review her claims of error for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-16\">To find plain error, we must conclude that (1) the district court committed error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>that (2) was plain or obvious, (3) affected the defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights\u201d in that she suffered prejudice, and (4) \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, 507 </em>U.S. 725, 730-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-1779, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We find no Sixth Amendment violation regarding the 11.6 grams of methamphetamine because, as noted <em>supra, </em>the amount was alleged specifically in Count Two of the indictment and found by the jury in reaching its verdict of guilty on that count. Such is not the case, however, with respect to the obstruction of justice enhancement which increased appellant\u2019s offense level from 30 to 32 and thus her term-of-imprisonment sentence range (given her category I criminal history) from 97 to 121 months to 121 to 151 months. As mentioned above, the conduct was neither admitted by appellant nor found by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Accordingly, as in <em>Rodriguez, </em>we hold that the district court erred and that the error was plain \u2014 the first two prongs of the plain-error standard. Appellant has not shown that her substantial rights were affected, though, because she has not established from the record before the district court that she would have received a lesser sentence had the court considered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory rather than mandatory. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301. Because appellant fails to satisfy plain error\u2019s third element, we need not consider the fourth element; hence, her sentences, like her convictions, are due to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-11\">. According to the presentence investigation report (\"PSI\u201d) prepared by the court\u2019s probation office, appellant told the probation office that she and Cooper had shared a common-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>law relationship for the past five years, dating back to 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\">. We review the denial of a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273 (11th Cir.2003), and find no abuse here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b309-17\">. Defense counsel contended that the statement was admissible on two grounds: (1) to show Gladys Cooper\u2019s state of mind and (2) as <em>res gestae. </em>We agree with the district court that Cooper\u2019s state of mind was irrelevant and that the statement was not <em>res gestae.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b310-6\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judges,</author>\n<p id=\"AT2\">concurring specially.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">As the court properly holds, in enhancing the defendant\u2019s sentences, the district court committed <em>Booker </em>error that is plain. Ante at-. Turning to the third prong of the plain-error inquiry, the court concludes that appellant failed to establish that the court would likely have imposed lesser sentences had it treated the Guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory. Ante at</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">As I explain in my dissent to the court\u2019s refusal to rehear <em>Rodriguez </em>en banc, the enhancement of a defendant\u2019s sentence on the basis of facts the defendant neither admits nor the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt is <em>structural error; </em>hence, the third prong of the plain-error test is inapplicable. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>406 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005) (Tjoflat, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc). Accordingly, we should consider whether the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1779, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We decline to take that step, however, because the prior-panel rule requires that we adhere to <em>Rodriguez\u2019s </em>holdings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
