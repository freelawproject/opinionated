We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Murphey v. Lanier, </em>204 F.3d 911, 912 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-17\">The district court properly dismissed Sander\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims against attorneys Krupp and Sepikas because Sanders failed to name a state actor. <em>See Simmons v. Sacramento County Superior Court, </em>318 F.3d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that plaintiffs conclusory allegations that private lawyer was conspiring with state officers are insufficient to show that opposing counsel was acting under color of state law).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-18\">The district court properly dismissed Sanders\u2019 claims against Judge Morrow on the basis of absolute judicial immunity. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-19\">Dismissal was proper on Sanders\u2019 remaining claims because his complaint alleged that all parties were citizens of the same state and presented no federal question. <em>See Audette v. Int\u2019l Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union, </em>195 F.3d 1107, 1111 (9th Cir.1999). The district court also properly concluded that Sanders was collaterally estopped from invoking, as a basis for federal question jurisdiction, that CleanNet\u2019s violation of a Federal Trade Commission rule created a private cause of action because he fully litigated that issue in an earlier action. <em>See Offshore Sportswear, Inc. v. Vuarnet Intern., B.V., </em>114 F.3d 848, 850 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201cCollateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, bars the relitigation of issues actually adjudicated in previous litigation between the same parties.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-20\">The district court properly dismissed Sanders\u2019 pendent state claims without prejudice. <em>See Jones v. Cmty. Redevelopment Agency of City of Los Angeles, </em>733 F.2d 646, 651 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-21\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by entering a vexatious litigant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>order against Sanders because it was the fifth time he attempted to litigate these claims and had previously been declared a vexatious litigant by a California state court. <em>See </em>Cen. Dist. of Calif. Local Rule 83-8.4 (providing that the court may reference Cal.Code Civ. P. \u00a7 391(b)(2)-(b)(3) in determining vexatious litigant status); <em>Professional Programs Group v. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>29 F.3d 1349, 1353 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that application of local rules is reviewed for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Sanders\u2019 remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">The United States\u2019 motion to file an <em>amicus </em>brief one day late on behalf of Judge Morrow is granted. The clerk shall file the brief received March 16, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b963-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
