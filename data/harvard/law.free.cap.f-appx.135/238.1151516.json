Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Appellant\u2019s conviction and 262-month sentence for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e). <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>123 Fed.Appx. 386 (11th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-25\">In his initial brief, Appellant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction and argued that his armed-career-criminal sentence violated the Ex Post Facto Clause and constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Notably, Appellant did not assert error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or any other case extending or applying the <em>Apprendi </em>principle. In <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 962, 121 S.Ct. 2621, 150 L.Ed.2d 774 (2001), after the Supreme Court\u2019s remand with instructions to reconsider our opinion in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we observed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">Nothing in the <em>Apprendi </em>opinion requires or suggests that we are obligated to consider an issue not raised in any of the briefs that appellant has filed with us. Nor is there anything in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order, which is cast in the usual language, requiring that we treat the case as though the <em>Apprendi </em>issue had been timely raised in this Court. In the absence of any requirement to the contrary in either <em>Apprendi </em>or in the order remanding this case to us, we apply our well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 990 (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 830 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cDefendant abandoned the <em>[Apprendi </em>] indictment issue by not raising the issue in his initial brief.\u201d). We recently extended the foregoing rule to preclude untimely challenges based on <em>Booker. See United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005). In his initial brief in this case, Appellant asserted no such <em>Apprendi </em>(or its progeny) challenge to his sentence. Accordingly, we reinstate our previous opinion in this case and affirm, once again, Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">OPINION REINSTATED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
