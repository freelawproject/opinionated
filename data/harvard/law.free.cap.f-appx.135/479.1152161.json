Trager, <em>Judge) </em>denying their motion (1) to set aside a settlement agreement executed by the parties on April 9, 2003, (2) to vacate a consent judgment and permanent injunction entered by the district court on April 10, 2003, embodying the terms of the settlement agreement,\u2019 and (3) to set a date for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellants\u2019 motion. None of the conduct complained of \u2014 allegedly improper cross-examination by Playboy\u2019s counsel, Playboy\u2019s alleged breach of a March 2003 agreement settling some of the claims in this case, a \u201creprimand\u201d by the trial judge that allegedly \u201ccreated an impossible situation\u201d for Cavalluzzo, Cavalluzzo\u2019s alleged \u201cmistake\u201d about what the jury believed \u2014 constitutes fraud, mistake, or duress sufficient to vacate a settlement agreement or reheve the appellants of judgment. In short, we have carefully considered all of appellants\u2019 arguments and find them so utterly without merit as to border on the frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
