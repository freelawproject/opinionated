ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b192-16\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-17\">Edward Ronwin, appearing pro se, appeals from the district court\u2019s order granting the appellees\u2019 motions to dismiss and denying his motion for sanctions. The district court determined that Allstate Insuranee Company, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, David Lawser and Terri Rene Snyder (collectively \u201cInsurance Defendants\u201d) were entitled to immunity from Ronwin\u2019s state law claims under Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 10-4-607 and that Ronwin had faded to state a claim on his Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) claim against the Insurance Defendants and his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim against defendants Snyder, Heidi Nash and the City of Fort Collins.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-20\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Sutton v. Utah State Sch. for the Deaf &amp; Blind, </em>173 F.3d 1226, 1236 (10th Cir.1999). We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for sanctions under Fed. R.Civ.P. 11. <em>Burkhart ex rel. Meeks v. Kinsley Bank, </em>852 F.2d 512, 515 (10th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-21\">Having reviewed the briefs, the record, and the applicable law pursuant to these standards, we conclude that the district court correctly decided this case. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment for substantially the same reasons stated in the district court\u2019s order dated September 30, 2004 (adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations dated September 29, 2004). Ronwin\u2019s Motion for Permission to Include Two Items in the Addendum of Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief is DENIED. Pursuant to our authority in Fed. RApp. P. 38, we ORDER Ronwin to SHOW CAUSE in writing within twenty days of the date of this order and judgment why he should not be sanctioned for filing a frivolous appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b192-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
