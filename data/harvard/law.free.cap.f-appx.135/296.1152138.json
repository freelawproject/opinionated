Rollins argues on appeal that the court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial in considering the federal guidelines in sentencing him, in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm Rollins\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-27\">A federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment, charging Rollins with the above-referenced offenses and listing the firearms that Rollins allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>possessed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government, in turn, filed an information, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, giving Rollins notice of the two prior felony offenses on which it intended to rely in seeking an enhanced statutory sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (increasing statutory maximum to 30 years for prior felony drug offense). Rollins subsequently entered into a plea agreement, whereby he agreed to plead guilty to the above-referenced offenses in exchange for the government agreeing to dismiss the remaining count in his superseding indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">As part of this plea agreement, Rollins conceded that the government could prove the following facts beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">On June 26, 2003, Leon County Sheriff\u2019s Office (LCSO) attempted an undercover operation with the intent to capture [Rollins], a known fugitive. An undercover call was placed to Rollins and a quantity of drugs was ordered. Delivery was to take place at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant on Lake Bradford Road. Sources indicated that Rollins always carried a firearm with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">LCSO deputies who were conducting surveillance saw Rollins and another male at the McDonald\u2019s restaurant. They were seated in a 4-door Oldsmobile. Rollins exited the car and used a pay phone. Rollins then got back into the car. Rollins was in the front passenger seat. The other individual, later identified as [McKinney], was seated in the driver\u2019s seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">Rather than completing the drug transaction, LCSO deputies decided to arrest Rollins on outstanding warrants. Rollins, who had gone back to the pay phone, was arrested without incident. Crack cocaine was found in his pants pockets. The crack found totaled approximately one (1) gram. Rollins intended to sell this crack cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">LCSO deputies approached the car and ordered McKinney to get out. A ski mask, a loaded .38 caliber revolver, and a loaded Intratec 9mm semi-automatic assault weapon were found in the front seat of the car. Five (5) rounds of .38 ammunition was found in McKinney\u2019s pocket, and another 5 rounds were found in the glove box of the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-12\">Prior to being arrested, Rollins and McKinney had been selling crack cocaine in the vicinity of the Florida A &amp; M University campus in Tallahassee, Florida. The crack cocaine found in Rollins\u2019[s] pocket belonged to him. The Intratec 9mm semi-automatic assault weapon, loaded with approximately [22] rounds of ammunition, also belonged to Rollins. This 9mm ammunition was manufactured outside the [S]tate of Florida. Thus, it had previously traveled in interstate commerce. Rollins possessed the Intratec 9mm semi-automatic assault weapon in order to further his drug[-]trafficking activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">In addition to this factual proffer, Rollins conceded in the plea agreement that the government could prove that, prior to this incident, he had been convicted of seven enumerated felony offenses, including escape, attempted possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, two counts of aggravated battery, and battery on a law enforcement officer. The parties also agreed that they were reserving the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>to appeal any sentence that the court imposed. After conducting a change-of-plea hearing, the court accepted this plea agreement and adjudicated Rollins guilty of the above-referenced offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Rollins\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated his base offense level for Counts 1 and 4 as 24, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The probation officer recommended a two-level upward adjustment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4), because the semi-automatic handgun previously had been reported stolen by the owner, and a three-level downward adjustment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, for acceptance of responsibility. Based on the officer\u2019s determination that Rollins was a career offender, however, he applied an enhanced offense level of 34, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">After the probation officer adjusted this enhanced offense level downwards three levels for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, Rollins had a total offense level of 31 for Counts 1 and 4. With a criminal history category of VI, Rollins\u2019s resulting guideline range for Counts 1 and 4 was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. As discussed above, however, Rollins also was subject to a consecufive mandatory minimum statutory sentence of ten year\u2019 imprisonment for his \u00a7 924(c)(l)(B)(ii) offense in Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Rollins only objected pretrial to the probation officer\u2019s statement in the PSI that Rollins \u201cproffered\u201d certain facts that were outlined in the offense conduct. The officer responded that (1) Rollins made both post-arrest and proffer statements, and (2) this information did not impact the guideline calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">At a joint sentencing hearing for Rollins and codefendant McKinney, Rollins conceded that his objection as to whether the offense conduct came from his own proffer was not relevant in calculating his guideline range because he admitted the same facts during his change-of-plea hearing. Rollins also generally raised a <em>Blakely </em>objection. After explaining in detail why it believed that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely </em>was applicable to the federal guidelines, the district court determined that the guidelines were unconstitutional, but that courts still should consider them in an advisory fashion in sentencing defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">The court specifically noted that its decision on <em>Blakely </em>could affect, at most, 8 potential months\u2019 imprisonment, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>(1) the low end of Rollins\u2019s combined guideline range was 308 months\u2019 imprisonment, (2) Rollins\u2019s combined statutory-mandatory minimum sentence was 300 months\u2019 imprisonment, and (3) <em>Blakely </em>did not affect mandatory minimum statutory sentences. The court explained that \u201cthis is [a] case where the policies adopted by the Congress, the career criminal provisions, the minimum mandatory provisions, this very circumstance one properly considers under [\u00a7 ] 3553, are not all inconsistent with the guidelines determination in the case.\u201d The court also discussed that, although it was sympathetic with Rollins\u2019s background, it believed that the substantial sentence that corresponded with Rollins\u2019s guideline calculations was appropriate because Rollins had returned to his prior criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Thus, after giving Rollins the opportunity to allocute, and after concluding that the PSI was accurate, the court sentenced Rollins to the low end of his guideline range, that is, 188 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts 1 and 4, a consecutive term of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 3, a total of 6 years\u2019 supervised release, and a $100 assessment fee. After pronouncing this sentence, the court also clarified, on the government\u2019s questioning, that the court had considered the federal guidelines in an advisory capacity in sentencing Rollins'.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In a brief he prepared prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>Rollins argues that the district court committed a <em>Blakely </em>violation when it relied on facts that were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt in determining Rollins\u2019s guideline range for Counts 1 and 4. Rollins contends that, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Blakely, </em>the district court should not have determined, under the career offender provisions, that he had been convicted previously of three \u201cviolent felonies\u201d or \u201cserious drug offenses,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Because Rollins timely raised a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court, we review his <em>Blakely /Booker </em>claim on appeal <em>de novo, </em>but reverse only for harmful error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948, manuscript op. at 4 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). \u201cTo find harmless error, we must determine that the error did not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948, manuscript op. at 5 (quotation omitted). We further explained in <em>Paz </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">A constitutional error, such as a <em>Booker </em>error, must be disregarded as not affecting substantial rights, if the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. This standard is only met where it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the sentence obtained. The burden is on the government to show that the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-9\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. Before Rollins\u2019s sentencing hearing, the Supreme Court revisited that rule in <em>Blakely, </em>in the context of Washington state\u2019s sentencing guideline scheme, and clarified that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.... </em>In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>facts, but the m\u00e1ximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct.at 2537 (emphasis in original). Applying these principles, the Court held that Blakely\u2019s sentence \u2014 which was enhanced under the state guidelines based on the sentencing court\u2019s additional finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Blakely committed his kidnaping offense with deliberate cruelty \u2014 violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>124 S.Ct. at 2534-38. In a footnote, however, the Court explicitly remarked that \u201c[t]he Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>124 S.Ct. at 2538 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">While the instant case was pending on appeal, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker, </em>finding \u201cno distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue\u201d in <em>Blakely. Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 749. Resolving the constitutional question left open in <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the federal guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>25 S.Ct. at 749-51. In extending its holding in <em>Blakely </em>to the Guidelines, the Court explicitly reaffirmed its rationale in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">In a second and separate majority opinion, the Court in <em>Booker </em>concluded that, to best preserve Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the appropriate remedy was to \u201cexcise\u201d two specific sections \u2014 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (requiring a sentence within the guideline range, absent a departure) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (establishing standards of review on appeal, including <em>de novo </em>review of departures from the applicable guideline range) \u2014 thereby effectively rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory only. <em>Id. </em>125 S.Ct. at 764. Thus, the guidelines range is now advisory; it no longer dictates the final sentencing result but instead is an important sentencing factor that the sentencing court is to consider, along with the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>we re-examined on remand in <em>United States v. Reese, </em>397 F.3d 1337 (11th Cir.2005),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a defendant\u2019s guideline sentence that had been enhanced, over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>objection, because the defendant possessed a firearm in connection with another felony. <em>Id. </em>at 1337. Concluding that the defendant\u2019s sentence was in violation of the Sixth Amendment, we vacated and remanded his case and ordered resentencing consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Booker. Id. </em>at 1338.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In <em>Paz, </em>we similarly examined a <em>Blakely/Booker </em>challenge to a six-level enhancement based on the district court\u2019s factual finding, which was not admitted by the defendant, that the amount of loss from the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction was between $30,000 and $70,000, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(D). <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 947, manuscript op. at 2. We determined that, because the defendant\u2019s sentence was enhanced, under a mandatory guidelines system based on facts found by the judge, the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was violated. <em>Id. </em>at 948, manuscript op. at 5. Moreover, we determined that the government could not show that this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it was evident from the sentencing transcript that, had the court used the guidelines in an advisory fashion, Paz\u2019s sentence would have been shorter. <em>Id. </em>at 949, manuscipt op. at 6.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We concluded, as such, that the constitutional error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and we remanded for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325 (11th Cir.2005), we vacated and remanded a defendant\u2019s 190-month sentence, based on the defendant\u2019s argument that the district court plainly erred in sentencing him under the federal guidelines, in light of <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker. Id. </em>at 1326. We determined that no Sixth Amendment violation occurred because the judicially determined facts on which the court relied in calculating the defendant\u2019s guideline range were, among other things, prior convictions that need not be admitted by the defendant during his change-of-plea colloquy or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30. Nevertheless, we determined that, because the district court considered and applied the federal guidelines as mandatory, plain error occurred under <em>Booker. See id. </em>at 1330-34.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">In the instant case, in adopting the PSI, the court determined that Rollins was a career offender because (1) he was at least 18 years old at the time the instant offense was committed; (2) the offense in Count 1 was a controlled-substance offense; and (3) Rollins had at least two prior felony convictions that were either a crime of violence or a controlled-substance offense. This determination resulted in Rollins\u2019s offense level being enhanced from level 23 to level 34, pursuant to the career-offender provisions in \u00a7 4B1.1(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">To the extent Rollins is challenging the court\u2019s factual findings as to prior convictions, no Sixth Amendment violation occurred. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329-30; <em>see also United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>404 F.3d 1283, 1290-91, slip op. at 1757-58 (11th Cir.2005) (court did not violate the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>rights by applying an enhancement based on his prior convictions); <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962-64, slip op. at 1792-93 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(Booker </em>is not implicated when a defendant\u2019s sentence is enhanced based on a prior conviction). Nevertheless, even if we were to conclude that whether a prior criminal conviction is a crime of violence or a controlled-substance is a fact that must be decided beyond a reasonable doubt, instead of being a fact of a prior conviction, the district court here, unlike the courts in <em>Reese, Paz, </em>and <em>Shelton, </em>only treated the federal guidelines as advisory. <em>(See </em>R4 at 34-37, 46). No violation of the Sixth Amendment or <em>Booker, </em>therefore, occurred. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Moreover, in adopting the PSI\u2019s facts, the court, at least implicitly, considered the PSI\u2019s description of the offense conduct and Rollins\u2019s history and characteristics. In imposing a sentence at the low end of Rollins\u2019s guideline range, the court explained that \u201cthis is [a] case where the policies adopted by the Congress, the career criminal provisions, the minimum mandatory provisions, this very circumstance one properly considers under [\u00a7 ] 3553, are not all inconsistent with the guidelines determination in the case.\u201d The court also discussed that, although it was sympathetic with Rollins\u2019s childhood, it believed that the substantial sentence that resulted from Rollins\u2019s guideline calculations was appropriate because Rollins had returned to his prior criminal activity. Thus, the court properly considered the nature and circumstances of the offense, Rollins\u2019s character, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities between the codefendants. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(3), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not violate Rollins\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial in sentencing him. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-9\">. Rollins\u2019s codefendant, Maurice Pernell McKinney, was charged in this same superseding indictment with Counts 1 and 3, as well as possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) (\"Count 2\u201d), and possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e) (\"Count 5\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b324-6\">. The PSI reflects that Count 1 (U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D 1.2(c)) and Count 4 (U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1) were grouped together, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2. Because the use of \u00a7 2K2.1 resulted in the highest offense level, it was used as the offense level for the grouped offenses, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D 1.3(a). In addition, because Rollins had to serve a mandatory minimum statutory sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment for his \u00a7 924(c) offense in Count 3 of his superseding indictment, this statutory sentence was his guideline sentence for Count 3, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(b), and Count 3 was exempted from the grouping, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Dl.l(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b324-7\">. The probation officer explained in the PSI that she had determined that Rollins was a career offender because (1) he was at least 18 years old at the time the instant offense was committed; (2) the offense in Count 1 was a controlled-substance offense; and (3) he had at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or controlled-substance offense, including convictions for (i) escape on December 10, 1990, (ii) possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute on May 18, 1993; and (iii) aggravated battery, aggravated battery with a firearm, and assault of a law enforcement officer on April 7, 1992. The officer also explained that the enhanced offense level was 34, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.1(B), because the statutory maximum penalty for Count 1 was 30 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b326-5\">.
