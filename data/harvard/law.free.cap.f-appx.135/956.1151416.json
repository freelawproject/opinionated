We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>see Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">The record supports the IJ\u2019s determination that the events Karapetian experienced were not \u201con account of\u2019 an enumerated ground. <em>See Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1488-91 (9th Cir.1997). While the trial of the minister of education might have been politically motivated, Karapetian testified that government agents detained her in order to elicit false testimony, not because of her political opinion, real or imputed. <em>See Kozulin v. INS, </em>218 F.3d 1112, 1116 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that the \u201cpresence of some political element does not require the conclusion that ... maltreatment was on account of political opinion\u201d). Karapetian\u2019s reliance on our decisions in <em>Grava v. INS, </em>205 F.3d 1177, 1181 (9th Cir.2000) and <em>Hasan v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 1114, 1121 (9th Cir.2004) is misplaced. In both of those cases, government officials retaliated against the petitioners for exposing political corruption. <em>See Grava, </em>205 F.3d at 1180; <em>Hasan, </em>380 F.3d at 1117-18. Accordingly, Karapetian failed to establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Belayneh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 488, 491 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW\u2019 DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b982-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
