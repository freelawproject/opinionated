We have jurisdiction pursuant to former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>see Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2000), we grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-24\">The BIA abused its discretion in concluding that the late filing of Zaidi\u2019s appeal was not excused by ineffective assistance of prior counsel Alan Harris, and instead constituted a lack of due diligence by Zai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>di. The BIA should have treated Zaidi\u2019s \u201cmotion to accept late filing of appeal\u201d as a motion to reopen. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 891 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cWhere the facts surrounding allegedly ineffective representation by counsel were unavailable to the petitioner at an earlier stage of the administrative process, motions before the BIA based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are properly deemed motions to reopen.\u201d). A motion to reopen is due \u201cno later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Because Zaidi promptly retained new counsel after obtaining his case file from Harris, and filed the motion within 90 days of discovering the file\u2019s contents, equitable tolling rendered the motion timely. <em>See Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">On the merits of the motion to reopen, Harris\u2019s ineffective assistance is plain from the record, as he erroneously sent the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision to Zaidi\u2019s former address. <em>See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, </em>282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir.2002). Zaidi has, moreover, complied with the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). <em>Id. </em>As Zaidi was denied his appeal to the BIA due to counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, a presumption of prejudice arises which is not rebuttable where a petitioner demonstrates plausible grounds for relief. <em>See Siong v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 1030, 1037-38 (9th Cir.2004). Zaidi has shown plausible grounds for relief in his contentions concerning the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1182, 1189-90 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Without expressing an opinion as to the merits of Zaidi\u2019s appeal to the BIA, we remand with directions that Zaidi\u2019s proceedings be reopened. <em>Id. </em>at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b133-25\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
