Hudson claims he was suffering from clinical depression due to race based disparate treatment in subsequent positions, and that the government failed to make reasonable accommodations even though he was a qualified individual with a disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">(III) The government violated the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a) by refusing to transfer Hudson to another available position for which he was qualified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">(IV) The government violated Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a) by not selecting Hudson for a position as Supervisory Import Specialist because of racial discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">(V) The government violated Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a) by transferring Hudson from ACSI and taking subsequent adverse employment actions against him due to his race.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">(VI) The government violated Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) by denying him the transfer to Supervisory Import Specialist in retaliation for his filing of Equal ' Employment Opportunity (\u201cEEO\u201d) Complaints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">(VII) The government violated Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) by forcing Hudson to resign as an EEO counselor and removing him from his assignment at the Blue Lightning Operations Center (\u201cBLOC\u201d) in retaliation for filing his own EEO complaints and assisting others with their EEO complaints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">(VIII) The government violated Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a) by forcibly removing Hudson from the BLOC facility on racial grounds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">The district court granted summary judgment to the government on counts I, II, V, VII, and VHI. The district court denied summary judgment on counts III, IV, and VI, and those claims were tried before a jury. Following a five-day trial, the jury found in favor of the government on all remaining counts, and the district court subsequently denied Hudson\u2019s motion for a new trial on count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">After reviewing the parties briefs, the record and oral argument, we find no discernible error in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion regarding both the motion for summary judgment and motion for a new trial. Accordingly, we AFFIRM without opinion in accordance with 11th Circuit Rule 36-1.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-16\">. During the course of litigation, the United States Custom Service became part of the Department of Homeland Security under the direction of Thomas Ridge. Though parties note this in the style of their briefs, we will generally refer to the defendant as \"the government\u201d for clarity purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
