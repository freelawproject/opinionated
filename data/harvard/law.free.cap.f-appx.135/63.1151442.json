We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation of provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d). <em>Corder v. Howard Johnson &amp; Co., </em>53 F.3d 225, 229 (9th Cir.1994). In the instant case, the district court determined that it lacked authority to grant the appellants\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1) because it dismissed the Board of Trustees\u2019 ERISA action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Appellants argue that the district court should have awarded attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1), because the Board of Trustees \u201ccolorably maintained\u201d that it had a viable action under ERISA by aggressively pursuing unfounded ERISA claims throughout the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1), \u201c[i]n any action under this subehapter ... by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of action to either party.\u201d By its express terms, the statute authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201conly when the action is brought by one of the parties enumerated in \u00a7 1132(g)(1).\u201d <em>Corder, </em>53 F.3d at 229. The appellants assert that the district court has authority to award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1132(g)(1) in reliance on an exception established in <em>Credit Managers Ass\u2019n v. Kennesaw Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>25 F.3d 743 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">In <em>Credit Managers, </em>this Court awarded attorney\u2019s fees where the plaintiff \u201ccolor-ably maintained that it was a fiduciary of an ERISA plan throughout the proceedings below, in a manner sufficient to withstand summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 747. In <em>Corder, </em>this Court clarified that the exception in <em>Credit Managers </em>only applies \u201cwhen a party survives summary judgment and actually tries its case on the colorable theory that it is one of the enumerated parties specified in \u00a7 1132(g)(1).\u201d <em>Corder, </em>53 F.3d at 230-31. Here, the Board of Trustees\u2019 action did not survive the appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the issue of its fiduciary status.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Accordingly, the district court lacked authority to award attorney\u2019s fees under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1) because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the underlying ERISA claim, and the Board of Trustees\u2019 action failed to survive summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b89-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
