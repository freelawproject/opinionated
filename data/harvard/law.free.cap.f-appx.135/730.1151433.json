California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). McGill has received a copy of counsel\u2019s motion and has filed a pro se response. In his response, McGill contends that his trial counsel was ineffective. We conclude that the record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration on direct appeal of McGill\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. Brewster, </em>137 F.3d 853, 859 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Our independent review of counsel\u2019s brief and the record disclose no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the appeal is DISMISSED without prejudice to McGill\u2019s right to raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claims in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b756-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
