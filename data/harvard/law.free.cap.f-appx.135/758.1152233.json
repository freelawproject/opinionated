Rocha-Hernandez was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 57 months to be followed by three years of non-reporting supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-17\">Rocha-Hernandez argues for the first time on appeal that in light of <em>United States v. Booker</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court plainly erred in sentencing him under a mandatory guideline system based on facts that were not admitted by Rocha or found by a jury. He contends that the district court\u2019s comments at sentencing indicate that it would have imposed a different sentence if it had sentenced him under an advisory guideline scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-24\">Rocha\u2019s claim that the district court plainly erred by enhancing his sentence based on facts not determined by a jury and which he did not admit is unavailing because he failed to show that \u201cthe sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather then a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-522 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). His argument that the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines as mandatory was error also fails because he did not show that the district court would have imposed a different sentence had the guidelines been advisory only. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-34 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-25\">Rocha concedes that the issue whether his sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(b)(2) was rendered unconstitutional by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and subsequent Supreme Court precedent is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and he raises it solely to preserve it for further review by the Supreme Court. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). We therefore must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>rule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Ane\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b784-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
