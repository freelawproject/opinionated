At his sentencing hearing, which occurred five days after the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), Jeremiah challenged the constitutionality of the sentencing guidelines. The district court rejected the <em>Blakely </em>argument, but sentenced him to 27 months\u2019 imprisonment, the minimum for his offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-12\">Given this court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Haidley, </em>400 F.3d 642 (8th Cir.2005), and <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>406 F.3d 527 (8th Cir.2005), we reverse and remand this case for resentencing. Like the defendants in those two cases, Jeremiah was sentenced at the low end of his guidelines range, and he has properly preserved his argument that the sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional. Under these circumstances, the government bears the burden of showing the sentencing error-using an unconstitutional mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme-was harmless. <em>Haidley, </em>400 F.3d at 644. The government made no such argument in its brief, and it waived oral argument. Thus, it has not satisfied its burden of showing that the sentencing error was harmless. <em>Garcia, </em>406 F.3d 527, 529 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-13\">We reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
