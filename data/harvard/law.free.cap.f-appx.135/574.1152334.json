See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-17\">Mashuda Corporation, a highway construction company, filed this petition for review of an order of the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d or the \u201cBoard\u201d) adopting an administrative law judge\u2019s findings that Mashuda Corporation violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d), when it declined to hire Gary Singer as a mechanic for its road-widening project in Follansbee, West Virginia. The NLRB filed a cross-application for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-18\">Ralph Mashuda, Mashuda Corporation\u2019s owner and president, had explained to Singer that one of the company\u2019s reasons for not hiring him was that \u201cmaybe you [were] too union for us.\u201d On the basis of this comment and the surrounding circumstances, Singer filed a complaint with the NLRB. Following a hearing, the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) concluded that Mashuda Corporation had coerced employees in the exercise of their self-organization rights in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the NLRA and that anti-union animus had contributed to Mashuda Corporation\u2019s decision not to hire Singer in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(3) and 8(a)(1) of the Act. Among, other remedies, the ALJ recommended that Mashuda Corporation be ordered to hire Singer and to remit backpay to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-19\">We conclude that we have no jurisdiction to consider the independent \u00a7 8(a)(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>coercion violation and that substantial evidence supports the \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(3) and 8(a)(1) failure-to-hire violation. Accordingly, we deny Mashuda Corporation\u2019s petition for review and grant the NLRB\u2019s cross-application for enforcement of its order finding violations of the Act. Because Singer\u2019s entitlement to backpay, however, should have been \u201ctolled\u201d by his refusal to consider an alternative mechanic position with Mashuda Corporation, we grant the company\u2019s petition for review and deny the Board\u2019s cross-application for enforcement as to that portion of the remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Complainant Gary Singer is a mechanic and a member of the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 132, AFL-CIO. Local 132 covers West Virginia and operates a \u201chiring hall\u201d to which contractors such as Mashuda Corporation can turn for qualified workers. When a contractor needs to staff a job located within Local 132\u2019s jurisdiction, it calls Local 132 and states the skills required for the job. Local 132 then sends to the job the first person on its list who meets the skill requirements. Over the years, Mashuda Corporation, which is headquartered in western Pennsylvania, has been involved in a number of highway construction projects in West Virginia. And on three such projects, it employed Singer pursuant to referrals by Local 132. In 1982, Singer served on a Mashuda Corporation job as a drill operator, and in 1985 and 1990, as a master mechanic.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">During Singer\u2019s 1990 engagement with Mashuda Corporation, two conflicts developed between him and his Mashuda supervisors. First, toward the end of the project, Mashuda Corporation equipment foreman Ronald Huffman attempted to lay off Singer while retaining Dennis Drummond, a \u201ccompany\u201d mechanic who traveled with Mashuda Corporation from project to project. Singer, however, claimed a right to his continued employment on the basis of Mashuda Corporation\u2019s contract with the union, which required that since the project was taking place in Local 132\u2019s jurisdiction, Singer had priority over Drummond, who was a member of Local 66 in Pennsylvania. The union intervened on Singer\u2019s behalf; Drummond was transferred to another job site; and Singer was retained until termination of the project. The second conflict involved the operation of a steam \u201cjenny,\u201d which had been brought to the job site in order to steam clean construction equipment and which foreman Huffman had directed a laborer to operate. Singer advised Huffman that, under Mashuda Corporation\u2019s contract with Local 132, operators (such as mechanics) \u2014 and not laborers \u2014 were to run steam jennies. In response to Singer\u2019s protest, Huffman had Singer replace the laborer as the steam jenny operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">In connection with the staffing of a project involving the widening of West Virginia Route 2 in Follansbee in February 2003, Mashuda Corporation representatives met with Local 132 union members, including business agent Mike O\u2019Hara, to express the need for mechanics for the project. After O\u2019Hara stated that Singer was first on their referral list, Mashuda Corporation sent O\u2019Hara a letter advising O\u2019Hara that it did not want Singer on the project. The company\u2019s general manager, Robert Mellon, wrote, \u201cDue to past performance and personality conflicts with other mechanics and employees!,] we are requesting at this time not to have Mr. Singer sent to our project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Shortly thereafter, Singer contacted O\u2019Hara to inquire about working on the Mashuda project, and O\u2019Hara told him of the Mashuda Corporation letter. Singer then telephoned Ralph Mashuda to discuss the situation, and the two met alone in a parking lot at the project site. According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>to Singer, whose testimony the ALJ credited in making his findings of fact in this case, the following exchange took place.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeh\">Singer asked Mashuda why he did not want Singer for the job. Mashuda said his people said Singer was a pain in the neck. Singer said he did not understand and asked who made this accusation. Mashuda said, \u201cmaybe you just PO\u2019d somebody real good.\u201d Singer asked how, and Mashuda replied you bad mouthed [Mashuda Corporation].... Mashuda said it was not a problem with Singer\u2019s ability to do the job and there was no problem with his truck, it was just a personality conflict. Singer told Mashuda he did not understand the personality conflict assertion because he was not aware that he had any problems with anyone. Singer asked who the problem was with, but all Mashuda would say was it was his people. Mashuda then said, \u201cmaybe you 'was too union for us.\u201d Mashuda went on to state you are a union man. Singer replied he was and was proud of it. Mashuda told Singer that Mashuda wanted mechanic Andy Potter on the job because Potter was well versed in repairing [Mashuda Corporation\u2019s] 90\u2019s scrapers, which are dirt moving machines. Mashuda said he would talk to some more people and get back to Singer. Mashuda said in a couple of weeks he would be starting a night shift. Singer cut him off, and said \u201cif Gary Singer is not good enough to work for you on day shift, he sure is not good enough to work night shift for you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">(Footnotes omitted). Ralph Mashuda later telephoned Singer and indicated that although he had not had a chance to discuss Singer\u2019s performance further with any other individuals, he would be sticking with his decision not to hire Singer for the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Singer filed a complaint against Mashuda Corporation with the NLRB, and on July 21, 2003, the NLRB issued a formal complaint against Mashuda Corporation, alleging that the company \u201chas been interfering with, restraining, and coercing employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed by Section 7 of the [National Labor Relations] Act in violation of Section 8(a)(1) of the Act,\u201d and \u201chas been discriminating in regard to the hire or tenure or terms or conditions of employment of its employees, thereby discouraging membership in a labor organization in violation of Section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the [National Labor Relations] Act.\u201d The complaint was heard before an ALJ on October 1, 2003, and Singer testified to the events as related above by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">In response, Ralph Mashuda testified that the Mashuda Corporation letter to O\u2019Hara was based on his discussions with his equipment foreman, Ronald Huffman, regarding Huffman\u2019s prior experience with Singer. According to Mashuda, Huffman found Singer to be lazy and a difficult individual with whom to work. Mashuda recounted an episode involving some work on a 50-ton truck, during which Singer sat in a pickup truck and watched because it was raining, and a somewhat different version of the steam jenny incident. Ralph Mashuda testified that Huffman attempted to have an operator run the steam jenny, but that the operators declined because it was dirty work. Later, only after an operator was going to be laid off did Singer allegedly protest, resulting in the laying off of the laborer and the placement of an operator on the steam jenny. Ralph Mashuda also testified that Paul Owens, Mashuda Corporation\u2019s master mechanic on the Follansbee project, told Mashuda that he would not work with Singer because, on a prior job, Owens had ended up having to do the work that should have been performed by Singer. Finally, Ralph Mashuda testified that Charlie HinHe, a supervisor for a Mashuda Corporation competitor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>had told him that the company was unlikely to get much work out of Singer.</p>\n<p id=\"At0\">Huffman and Owens testified on their own about these events, but their testimony was significantly less detailed. Owens testified that he told Ralph Mashuda that he would not work with Singer because Singer was lazy, although he admitted on cross examination that he had never actually worked directly with Singer. Huffman testified simply that Singer did not work hard and did not like to work in the rain.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The ALJ credited Singer\u2019s testimony, finding Huffman entirely unbelievable and Owens\u2019 testimony contradictory. The ALJ determined that Ralph Mashuda\u2019s remark to Singer in partial explanation of why Singer was not being hired \u2014 that maybe he was \u201ctoo union for us\u201d \u2014 was coercive and violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the NLRA. In addition, the ALJ found that Singer was qualified for the mechanic position and that anti-union animus stemming from Singer\u2019s actions to enforce the union contract during the 1990 job contributed to Ralph Mashuda\u2019s decision not to hire him. The ALJ also found that the performance-related reasons given by Mashuda Corporation for not hiring Singer were pretextual. Finally, the ALJ concluded that Ralph Mashuda\u2019s discussion with Singer about the night shift position was not \u201ca bona fide job offer to Singer\u201d and that \u201cMashuda never made a firm offer ... for such a position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">With these findings, the ALJ held that Mashuda Corporation engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the Act and recommended that Mashuda Corporation be ordered to offer Singer the day-shift mechanic position for which he had applied and to make him whole for any losses he had suffered. Mashuda Corporation filed exceptions, and on April 30, 2004, the Board issued a decision and order affirming the ALJ\u2019s \u201crulings, findings, and conclusions.\u201d The Board also adopted the ALJ\u2019s recommended order with a slight modification. Mashuda Corporation filed this petition for review, and the Board filed a cross-application for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">In its petition, Mashuda Corporation contends that the Board erred in finding anti-union animus by failing to consider the context surrounding Ralph Mashuda\u2019s \u201ctoo union\u201d comment, the company\u2019s longstanding relationship with the unions, and the company\u2019s non-union-related objections to employing Singer. In addition, the company contends that even if a prima facie case had been made against Mashuda Corporation, the company \u201csustained its burden to prove that the same action would have been taken even absent the allegedly discriminatory motive.\u201d Finally, Mashuda Corporation argues that backpay should not have been awarded to Singer in light of its offer of night-shift employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">In its cross-application for enforcement, the Board contends that its decision and order is supported by substantial evidence and that Mashuda Corporation waived any objection to the independent \u00a7 8(a)(1) violation because it failed to present the issue to the Board. The Board also maintains that its backpay order was justified because Mashuda\u2019s night-shift offer was insufficiently clear to toll backpay under the Board\u2019s established mitigation doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">We address first the Board\u2019s contention that we lack jurisdiction to review the independent \u00a7 8(a)(1) violation stemming from Ralph Mashuda\u2019s \u201ctoo union\u201d comment because Mashuda Corporation did not preserve the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">Section 8(a)(1) makes it unlawful for an employer \u201cto interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of\u2019 their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>self-organization rights. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1). The Board may find an independent \u00a7 8(a)(1) violation, and any \u00a7 8(a)(8) violation that it finds arising from a failure to hire also necessarily includes a derivative violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1). <em>See Metro. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>460 U.S. 693, 698 n. 4, 103 S.Ct. 1467, 75 L.Ed.2d 387 (1983) (explaining the relationship between \u00a7 8(a)(1) and \u00a7 8(a)(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In its exceptions taken from the ALJ\u2019s findings and recommendations, Mashuda Corporation addressed only the failure-to-hire violation, and it preserved no challenge to the ALJ\u2019s independent finding that the \u201ctoo-union\u201d remark itself violated \u00a7 8(a)(1). Because Mashuda Corporation did not preserve this issue before the Board, it cannot present it to us now. We agree with the Board that on that basis we have no jurisdiction to review the violation. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (noting that the court has no jurisdiction to consider objections not urged before the NLRB, absent \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d); <em>see also Woelke &amp; Romero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>456 U.S. 645, 665-66, 102 S.Ct. 2071, 72 L.Ed.2d 398 (1982). Mashuda Corporation\u2019s conclusory assertions that it \u201cfiled exceptions to the [ALJ\u2019s] entire decision\u201d and that it \u201cis not relinquishing its appeal from the 8(a)(1) portion of the Order\u201d are unsupported by the record and unavailing, given the requirements of the Act. Indeed, it is telling that Mashuda Corporation\u2019s argument challenging this violation is confined to a solitary footnote in its opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Mashuda Corporation\u2019s petition for review of this portion of the Board\u2019s order is accordingly dismissed, and the Board\u2019s cross-application for enforcement is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">We now turn to Mashuda Corporation\u2019s principal argument that the Board erred in concluding that anti-union animus contributed to its decision not to hire Singer, and that Mashuda Corporation thus violated NLRA \u00a7 8(a)(3) and derivatively \u00a7 8(a)(1). Section 8(a)(3) makes it unlawful for an employer \u201cby discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3). We enforce the Board\u2019s order with respect to violations such as these if, looking at the entirety of the record, the Board\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e); <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">The analysis for determining a \u00a7 8(a)(3) violation was initially set out in <em>NLRB v. Wright Line, Inc., </em>662 F.2d 899 (1st Cir.1981), and has since been adopted and restated by us. <em>See, e.g., USF Red Star, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>230 F.3d 102, 106 (4th Cir.2000); <em>FPC Holdings v. NLRB, 64 </em>F.3d 935, 942 (4th Cir.1995). It is a two-step, burden-shifting analysis under which we determine first whether the General Counsel proved a prima facie case that the employer\u2019s decision not to hire an employee was motivated by anti-union animus. <em>See FPC Holdings, </em>64 F.3d at 942. To prove a prima facie case, \u201cthe General Counsel must show (1) that the employee was engaged in protected activity, (2) that the employer was aware of the activity, and (3) that the activity was a substantial or motivating reason for the employer\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the General Counsel has carried his burden, we move to the second step, under which we determine whether the employer has carried its burden of proving that the same action would have been taken even in the absence of the employee\u2019s union activity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Mashuda Corporation contends first that there was insufficient evidence that Singer\u2019s 1990 pro-union activity was a motivating reason behind Mashuda\u2019s decision not to hire him. \u201cMotive may be demonstrated by circumstantial as well as direct evidence and is a factual issue \u2018which the expertise of the Board is peculiarly suited to determine.\u2019 \u201d <em>FPC Holdings, </em>64 F.3d at 942 (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Perel v. NLRB, </em>373 F.2d 736, 737 (4th Cir.1967)). When these \u201cfactual findings rest upon credibility determinations, they should be accepted by the reviewing court absent \u2018exceptional circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fieldcrest Cannon, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>97 F.3d 65, 69 (4th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>NLRB v. Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Inc., </em>717 F.2d 141, 145 (4th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">In this case, the issue does come down to a question of witness credibility, and accordingly our review is highly deferential. Applying the standard of review, we can find no \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that compel us to reject the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations. Singer testified to two union-related conflicts that he had in 1990 and to Ralph Mashuda\u2019s observation in 2003 that Singer might be \u201ctoo union\u201d for Mashuda Corporation. Of course, Mashuda Corporation disputes this testimony, contending instead that Ralph Mashuda\u2019s decision not to hire Singer was motivated by negative reports on Singer\u2019s work ethic. Ralph Mashuda testified to conversations he had about Singer with Ronald Huffman, Greg Demistratus, Mike O\u2019Hara, Charlie Hinkle, and Paul Owens. Of this group, however, only Huffman and Owens testified before the ALJ, and neither testified as fully about the conversations as did Ralph Mashuda. For example, Owens testified that Singer was lazy and that he told Mashuda he would not work with him. But Owens admitted that he had never worked with Singer directly and that his opinion was based on what he himself had only heard from others. When Owens was asked directly about his experience with Singer, he only replied that he would \u201chear a lot of stuff,\u201d that Singer would be \u201c[slitting in his truck, wouldn\u2019t report to the master mechanic for other stuff to do.\u201d This testimony compares with Ralph Mashuda\u2019s testimony recounting a conversation in which Owens stated that he had had to do Singer\u2019s work. Similarly, Ralph Mashuda testified that Huffman told him about the steam jenny incident and about Singer\u2019s sitting in a truck watching others repair a 50-ton truck in the rain. Huffman, however, testified in only very general terms about Singer\u2019s work ethic and mentioned something about Singer\u2019s not liking the rain. Huffman never mentioned the steam jenny incident, and the record reveals that his testimony in general was somewhat agitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Singer\u2019s testimony, if credited, provides support for the motivation prong under the <em>Wright Line </em>test, especially because anti-union animus need only be a contributing factor and is sufficient for a prima facie case even if \u201ccombined with other legitimate nondiscriminatory motives.\u201d <em>Ultrasystems Western Constructors, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>18 F.3d 251, 257 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Second, Mashuda Corporation contends that even if a prima facie case was proved, it sustained its burden of proving that it would not have hired Singer anyway because of his work ethic. But the evidence that would substantiate Ralph Mashuda\u2019s claim that he heard Singer was lazy is the same discredited evidence that was used in an attempt to rebut a prima facie case of anti-union animus. Moreover, under this second prong of the <em>Wright Line </em>test, Mashuda has the shifted burden of proof. <em>See FPC Holdings, </em>64 F.3d at 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Given the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations and the unexceptional circumstances of this case, we conclude that the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>dence. Accordingly, we deny Mashuda Corporation\u2019s petition to review the \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(3) and 8(a)(1) violations and grant the Board\u2019s cross-application for enforcement with respect to these violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Finally, Mashuda Corporation challenges the Board\u2019s order awarding Singer backpay on the basis of the conversation between Ralph Mashuda and Singer in which Singer essentially rejected the possibility of accepting an offer for night employment. As found by the ALJ, the exchange took place as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">Mashuda said in a couple of weeks he would be starting a night shift. Singer cut him off, and said \u201cif Gary Singer is not good enough to work for you on day shift, he sure is not good enough to work night shift for you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The Board concluded that because Mashuda Corporation did not make a valid offer of employment for the night shift, it could not toll Singer\u2019s entitlement to backpay.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The general rule is that an individual\u2019s entitlement to backpay is tolled if he fails to mitigate damages. <em>See NLRB v. Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. of Fayetteville, </em>258 F.3d 305, 310 (4th Cir.2001). Accordingly, \u201c[a]n employer\u2019s offer of reinstatement,\u201d or, in this case, of employment, \u201ctolls the accrual of backpay,\u201d <em>Halle Enterprises v. NLRB, </em>247 F.3d 268, 271 (D.C.Cir.2001), because it creates an opportunity for the employee to mitigate damages. Such an offer of employment is only effective, however, if it is \u201cfirm, clear, and unconditional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Consol. Freightways v. NLRB, </em>892 F.2d 1052, 1056 (D.C.Cir.1989)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">In this case the Board correctly noted that Mashuda Corporation did not demonstrate that it had firmly, clearly, and unconditionally offered Singer a job on the night shift. But the Board ignored the fact that the reason for this failure was Singer\u2019s preemption of such an offer. By telling Ralph Mashuda that he would not consider a night shift job when Mashuda raised the subject, Singer must now be estopped from asserting the insufficiency of Mashuda\u2019s offer as a basis to excuse his failure to mitigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">This is not the case where an employer has extended a conditional or hypothetical offer and attempted to use an employee\u2019s rejection of that offer as evidence of a failure to mitigate. A number of circuits have held that such a situation does not result in the tolling of an entitlement to backpay. <em>See, e.g., Consol. Freightways, </em>892 F.2d at 1056 (noting that it is \u201cincumbent on the [employer] to extend to the injured employee a facially valid offer of reinstatement before the burden shifts to the injured employee to accept or reject the offer\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>NLRB v. Seligman &amp; Assoc., </em>808 F.2d 1155, 1163 (6th Cir.1986) (noting that \u201can employee is under no obligation to decide whether to accept reinstatement until an unconditional offer of reinstatement is made\u201d). Instead, in this case Singer cut Ralph Mashuda off and precluded his extending any offer of employment \u2014 conditional, hypothetical, or bona fide \u2014 and the only evidence received was that Ralph Mashuda was prepared to extend a valid offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">Although it was unnecessary to his conclusion, the ALJ also concluded that the day shift mechanic position was a \u201chigher profile job\u201d than the night shift position and that it was not \u201cincumbent on Singer, after being told that he was 'too union\u2019 for [Mashuda], to be required to accept a less favorable shift and a position of less stature as a result of his union activities.\u201d Such a conclusion, however, is not supported by the record, and Singer testified before the ALJ that the night shift posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>tion paid the same as the day shift. Moreover, the Board explicitly declined to address this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that Singer\u2019s preemptive statement renouncing any interest in a night shift position with Mashuda Corporation tolled his entitlement to backpay. While Mashuda Corporation did not make a bona fide offer of employment, it need not have done so in the face of Singer\u2019s unambiguous anticipatory rejection of any such offer. Therefore, with respect to this portion of the Board\u2019s order, we grant Mashuda Corporation\u2019s petition for review and deny the Board\u2019s cross-application for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">In sum, we dismiss Mashuda Corporation\u2019s petition for review of the independent \u00a7 8(a)(1) violation based on the \u201ctoo-union\u201d comment; we deny its petition for review of the Board\u2019s findings that it violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(3) and 8(a)(1) in declining to hire Singer; we grant Mashuda Corporation\u2019s petition for review with respect to the Board\u2019s award of backpay to Singer; and we grant the Board\u2019s cross-application for enforcement of its order in its entirety, with the exception of its order awarding Singer backpay.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
