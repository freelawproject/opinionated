Gomez does not appeal the BIA\u2019s ruling that she abandoned her permanent resident status. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-21\">The BIA\u2019s interpretation of purely legal questions is reviewed <em>de novo. Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1193 (9th Cir.2003). The BIA\u2019s interpretation and application of immigration law is \u201csubject to established principles of deference\u201d unless the intent of Congress is clear. <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The authority providing eligibility for Cancellation of Removal states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-22\">The Attorney General may cancel removal in the ease of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United States if the alien\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-23\">(1) has been an alien <em>lawfully admitted for permanent residence </em>for not less than 5 years,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-24\">(2) has resided in the United States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any status, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-25\">(3) has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-26\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a) (emphasis added). The term \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence\u201d is further defined as \u201cthe status of having been lawfully accorded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws, <em>such status not having changed. \u201d Id. </em>at \u00a7 1101(a)(20) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The BIA determined that Gomez\u2019s recent change in permanent resident status rendered her ineligible for Cancellation of Removal. We agree. The loss of permanent resident status is just that \u2014 a change in status. <em>See Singh v. Reno, </em>113 F.3d 1512, 1514 (9th Cir.1997) (requiring the-INS to establish by clear, unequivocal evidence that Singh\u2019s status as a permanent resident had changed to find him ineligible for readmission); <em>Matter of Huang, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 749, 757, 1988 WL 235431 (BIA 1988) (concluding that \u201cthe status of the applicants as lawful permanent residents changed, that their absences were not temporary in nature, and that they are therefore not entitled to admission to the United States as returning permanent residents\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Abandoning her permanent resident status changed Gomez\u2019s status as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(20). This change meant that Gomez could not meet an eligibility requirement for Cancellation of Removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(l). Accordingly, Gomez cannot demonstrate prima facie eligibility for the relief she seeks in her motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"b106-28\"> ThiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
