Pritchett, </em>125 Fed. Appx. 976 (11th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The case is back before us on remand from the Supreme Court for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-18\">As we noted in our prior opinion in this case, Pritchett did raise his <em>Apprendi/Blakely </em>contention in his opening brief to this Court, but he failed to preserve it in the district court. Accordingly, our review is only for plain error. With commendable candor, Pritchett concedes in his post-remand supplemental letter brief that no one knows if his sentence would have been different if the sentencing guidelines had been applied in an advisory instead of mandatory fashion: \u201cIf the district court judge in this case had the liberty of increasing or decreasing Pritchett\u2019s sentence above or below the guidelines range, he might have given Pritchett a longer sentence, or he might have given him a shorter sentence, or he might have given him the same sentence. The record provides no reason to believe any result is more likely than the other.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Supp. Br. at 13. That being so, this case is squarely controlled by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299-1305 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-19\">Pritchett\u2019s contention essentially is that we got it wrong in <em>Rodriguez </em>and should instead have adopted in that case the position that <em>Booker </em>error is structural so that reversal is required in every case of unpreserved error regardless of whether the defendant can show a reasonable probability of a different result if the guidelines had been applied in an advisory way. He acknowledges that his argument \u201cis taken substantially from Judge Tjoflat\u2019s dissent [from the denial of rehearing en banc] in <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>406 F.3d 1261, 2005 WL 895174 (11th Cir. [Apr. 19,] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>2005).\u201d Appellant\u2019s Supp. Br. at 5 n. 1. That dissent was a dissent, and the law of the circuit is established by the <em>Rodriguez </em>panel opinion, which under the prior precedent rule we are required to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Accordingly, we reinstate our previous opinion in this case affirming the Pritchett\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">OPINION REINSTATED; AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
