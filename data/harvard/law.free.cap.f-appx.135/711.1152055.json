A certificate of appealability was previously granted. Gray argues that his petition, which he filed to challenge the loss of good-time credits due to a prison disciplinary proceeding, was timely filed. The respondent argues that Gray\u2019s appeal is moot due to his release on parole on October 14, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-25\">The respondent\u2019s arguments are meritorious. Gray has not shown an injury-in-fact, and his habeas claims are moot due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>his release on parole. <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>see Ex parte Hallmark, </em>883 S.W.2d 672, 674 (Tex.Crim.App.1994) (good-time credits apply only to an inmate\u2019s eligibility for parole or mandatory supervision and do not affect the length of the inmate\u2019s sentence). Further, the revocation of Gray\u2019s parole would not result in the restoration of his good-time credits. <em>See Hallmark v. Johnson, </em>118 F.3d 1073, 1075-76 (5th Cir.1997); Tex.Code Ann. \u00a7 498.004(b) (2005). Accordingly, Gray\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b737-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
