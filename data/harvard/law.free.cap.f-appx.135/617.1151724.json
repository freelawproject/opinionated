Able claims that the administrator of BellSouth\u2019s ERISA plan miscalculated the amount due to her as disability pension benefits under the plan. We have reviewed the record and find Abie\u2019s arguments to be meritless. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. (Supp. J.A. at 288-97.) We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
