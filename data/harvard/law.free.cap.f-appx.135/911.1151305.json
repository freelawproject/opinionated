We dismiss in part and deny in part Panosyan\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-21\">Panosyan, through counsel, failed to exhaust the issue of the IJ\u2019s dispositive adverse credibility finding before the BIA. For this reason, we lack jurisdiction to consider Panosyan\u2019s contentions regarding his eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-22\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 over Panosyan\u2019s CAT claim. We review for substantial evidence. <em>Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1193 (9th Cir.2003). We deny Panosyan\u2019s CAT claim because he has not shown that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to Armenia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b937-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
