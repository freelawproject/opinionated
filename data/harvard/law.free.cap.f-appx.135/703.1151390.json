Cuvillier executed a plea agreement waiving certain of his appellate rights; however, he reserved the right to appeal \u201cany punishment imposed in excess of the statutory maximum.\u201d Cuvillier\u2019s sentence is based solely on facts to which he stipulated in connection with his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-18\">Nevertheless, Cuvillier argues that his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his rights under the Sixth Amendment when he stipulated to the facts supporting his guilty plea. Thus, he contends that the waiver provision in his plea agreement does not bar his appeal. He further argues that he must be resentenced because the district court\u2019s belief that the sentencing guidelines were mandatory prevented the court from considering potential mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-25\">Our review of the record shows that Cuvillier\u2019s waiver of his appellate rights was knowing and voluntary. This appeal is barred by the \u201cplain language\u201d of the waiver because Cuvillier\u2019s 180-month term of imprisonment, which is based solely on his own admissions, does not exceed the statutory maximum term of life imprisonment that could have been imposed for the offense. <em>United States v.
