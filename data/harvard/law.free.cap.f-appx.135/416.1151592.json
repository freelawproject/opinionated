Botts, a former HealthSouth Corporation (\u201cHealth-South\u201d) executive, pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and mail fraud and falsify books and records, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. At sentencing, the district court properly calculated the guidelines sentence as 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court then granted the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for downward departure based on Botts\u2019s substantial assistance. Instead of departing to 40 months\u2019 imprisonment, as recommended by the government, the district court imposed a sentence of probation. The government now appeals the extent of the district court\u2019s downward departure. After review and oral argument, we vacate Botts\u2019s sentence in its entirety and remand this case to the district court for resentencing. .</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ae7\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">From 1988 to 2003, Defendant Botts was employed in HealthSouth\u2019s tax department. In 1998, Botts was promoted to the position of Senior Vice President for Tax. In that position, Botts was responsible for HealthSouth\u2019s tax returns and for providing information to taxing authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">From 1996 through March 2003, a group of HealthSouth officers conspired to artificially inflate HealthSouth\u2019s reported earnings, earnings per share, and overall financial condition. As a result, HealthSouth\u2019s public financial records overstated its assets by hundreds of millions of dollars, and public investors purchased overvalued shares of HealthSouth\u2019s stock. According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) prepared in this case, the approximate amount of the loss to HealthSouth investors was $1.4 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-14\">Botts became aware of the conspiracy in 2000, when he was informed that fictitious assets appeared on HealthSouth\u2019s books. Thereafter, Botts provided auditors with asset schedules that he knew included phony assets. In addition, in 2001 and 2002, Botts prepared and submitted Health-South tax returns that he knew included material, false information about Health-South\u2019s taxable income, depreciation deductions, and assets. Botts, or someone acting at Botts\u2019s direction, placed the fraudulent tax returns in the United States mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b443-16\">On July 31, 2003, the government filed a three-count information against Botts. The information charged Botts with: (1) conspiracy to commit securities fraud (a violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78m(b)(2)(A) &amp; (B), and 17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.13a-l, 13a-13 &amp; 13b2-2), falsify books and records (a violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78m(b)(2)(A) &amp; (B), 78m(b)(5) and 78ff), and commit mail fraud (a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341), all in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (Count One); and (2) mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 1342 (Count Two). The information also included a forfeiture count (Count Three). On August 27, 2003, Botts pled guilty to all three counts of the information pursuant to a plea agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-17\">The PSI indicated that Botts\u2019s total offense level was 34 and his criminal history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>category was I, which ordinarily would yield a guidelines range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, the statutory maximum sentence for Botts\u2019s offense was 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. As a result, the PSI assessed a guidelines sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">On June 1, 2004, the government filed a motion for downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 based on Botts\u2019s substantial assistance. In that motion, the government explained that \u201c[f]rom the discovery of the defendant\u2019s participation in the conspiracy,\u201d Botts had been truthful and cooperated \u201cwithout hesitation,\u201d had been available \u201con a continuous and regular basis,\u201d and had \u201cprovided invaluable assistance in helping the United States, Health-South, and the forensic auditor discover, in an expeditious manner, the varied ways in which the fraud was conducted.\u201d The government\u2019s motion further stated that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s assistance has facilitated both the securing of guilty pleas from other co-conspirators and the prosecution of other individuals yet to be convicted,\u201d and that Botts\u2019s \u201cimmediate cooperation has allowed the HealthSouth case to be prosecuted at a pace which, on a relative basis, constitutes swift and efficient enforcement of the United States\u2019 criminal laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">At the June 2, 2004, sentencing hearing, the district court found, in accordance with the PSI, that the offense level was 34 and Botts\u2019s criminal history category was I, yielding a guidelines range of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. The government then presented its motion for downward departure, and requested that the district court sentence Botts to 40 months\u2019 imprisonment. While the government sought a reduction in Botts\u2019s 60-month sentence as a result of his cooperation, it argued that his conduct merited a substantial prison term of 40 months, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">All said, Your Honor, the government is compelled in this case to recommend a substantial term of imprisonment and we would ask the Court to depart downward from the maximum sentence of 60 months to a sentence of 40 months imprisonment. That is the term of imprisonment which the government believes is reasonable to indicate the seriousness of this offense, to reflect punishment to this defendant for his conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-11\">I might add, Your Honor, this'was not one of the individuals who walked in and voluntarily cooperated with the government, before we knew about the fraud. Yes, after other individuals came in and disclosed to the government that there was a massive accounting fraud underway at HealthSouth, Mr. Botts did come in and admit his participation in that conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-12\">But, he made a choice, Your Honor, and that was when he was confronted with the horrifying facts of this accounting fraud, instead of reporting it, he chose to become a member for the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">The district court then engaged in the following dialogue with the government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-14\">THE COURT: Well, you\u2019re hot suggesting that anything less than 40 months would be unreasonable, are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-15\">MR. WIEDIS: Your honor, that is the government\u2019s position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-16\">THE COURT: So what you\u2019re saying is that even if he testifies, as I expect he will, in the other cases and cooperates fully, the government would not plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>on filing a motion for a downward departure after he\u2019s testified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">MR. WIEDIS: I know that the government might avail itself of the Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and make a motion for a further downward departure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">THE COURT: So the government would have that option to in fact, after he testifies, ask that he be placed on probation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">MR. WIEDIS: The law provides an opportunity for the government to make a motion for a further reduction in sentence after somebody testifies. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">The district court then heard from Botts\u2019s counsel, who outlined Botts\u2019s role in the conspiracy, the extent of his cooperation, and his character and background, and requested probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">After hearing from Botts\u2019s counsel, the district court departed downward to a level 8, which yielded a guidelines imprisonment range of 0 to 6 months. The government requested the maximum term of 6 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court then imposed a sentence of 60 months\u2019 probation, with a special condition of 6 months\u2019 home detention. The government objected to the reasonableness of the \u00a7 5K1.1 departure in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">In its written judgment, the district court checked the box stating that the downward departure was \u201cbased on 5K1.1 motion of the government based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance,\u201d and offered no further reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">The government timely appealed the district court\u2019s downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b445-16\">On appeal, the government argues that: (1) the extent of the downward departure and resulting sentence were unjustified and unreasonable; and (2) that the district court failed to adequately and specifically state the reasons for its departure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-18\">Section 5K1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines specifies that the district court may depart downward based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-19\"><em>for reasons stated </em>that may include, but are not limited to, consideration of the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-22\">(1) the court\u2019s evaluation of the significance and usefulness of the defendant\u2019s assistance, taking into consideration the government\u2019s evaluation of the assistance rendered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-23\">(2) the truthfulness, completeness, and reliability of any information or testimony provided by the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-24\">(3) the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-25\">(4) any injury suffered, or any danger or risk of injury to the defendant or his family resulting from his assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-26\">(5) the timeliness of the defendant\u2019s assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-27\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Kl.l(a) (emphasis added). The commentary to \u00a7 5K1.1 recognizes that \u201c[t]he nature, extent, and significance of assistance can involve a broad spectrum of conduct that must be evaluated by the court on an individual basis,\u201d and thus that latitude is afforded the sentencing judge to reduce a sentence based on \u201cvariable relevant factors.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 comment, (backg\u2019d.). \u201cThe sentencing judge <em>must, </em>however, <em>state the reasons </em>for reducing a sentence under this section.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the guidelines require that the district court\u2019s stated reasons must be individualized to the defendant based on the relevant factors and more specific than a simple statement that the reduction is based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance. Further, the commentary to \u00a7 5K1.1 requires the sentencing court to give \u201csubstantial weight ... to the government\u2019s evaluation of the extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, comment, n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The government did not raise any <em>Booker </em>issue in its appeal, and thus there is no Boo/cer-type issue that we must review in this appeal. Rather, this appeal concerns only the application of \u00a7 5K1.1 of the guidelines to Botts\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This Court reviews a downward departure from the guidelines range for \u201creasonableness.\u201d <em>See United States v. Blas, </em>360 F.3d 1268, 1274 (11th Cir.2004). In <em>Bias, </em>we explained that \u201ca reviewing court determines the reasonableness of the departure in light of the factors to be considered in imposing the sentence and the reasons the district court provided for departing.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1121, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). \u201cThe district court\u2019s reasons must be sufficiently specific so that an appellate court can engage in the meaningful review envisioned by the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Suarez, </em>939 F.2d 929, 933 (11th Cir.1991). Although we need not decide whether the district court must discuss each of the five factors set forth in \u00a7 5K1.1, we conclude the district court must, at a minimum, give some indication of the \u00a7 5K1.1 factors upon which it relies and the reasons for the extent of the departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Here, the district court granted Botts an extraordinary departure, departing downward by 26 levels and eliminating a 60-month term of imprisonment. Yet the district court failed to specify any reasons, either orally or in his written statement of reasons, for this extraordinary departure. It is unclear from the record (1) whether the district court relied upon permissible factors<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (2) if so, whether the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>of the departure was reasonable. As a result, the record in this case is incapable of meaningful appellate review. \u201cAlthough the district court has broad discretion in determining the extent of a downward departure, that discretion is not without limits, and appellate review is not an empty exercise.\u201d <em>United States v. Dalton, </em>404 F.3d 1029, 1034 (8th Cir.2005). Particularly in light of the extraordinary departure in this case, we will not presume that the extent of the departure was reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 1033.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Accordingly, we vacate Botts\u2019s sentence and remand this case to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion and with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-18\">. Count Two of the information subsequently was dismissed and Botts\u2019s guilty plea on Count Two was withdrawn.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-6\">. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a) states: \"Where the statutorily authorized maximum sentence is less than the minimum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily authorized maximum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b445-13\">. We review the extent of a departure for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Blas, </em>360 F.3d 1268, 1274 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b446-5\">. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c), if the district court imposes a sentence \u201coutside the [guidelines] range, ... the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from that described, ... must also be stated with specificity in the written order of judgment and commitment....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b446-6\">. Botts was sentenced prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Although there is no <em>Booker </em>issue that this Court must review in this appeal, <em>Booker </em>will come into play at resentencing. Accordingly, while the district court will not be bound by the guidelines on remand, it first must correctly determine Botts\u2019s guidelines sentence, including any departures permitted under the guidelines, and then impose a sentence that is reasonable in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that \"the Supreme Court concluded in <em>Booker </em>that district courts must still consider the Guidelines in determining a defendant\u2019s sentence,\u201d and that remand is required in any case in which the sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect guidelines application (citation omitted)). If the district court imposes a sentence outside the guidelines range, it must state the reasons for the imposition of that sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b446-12\">. There is some indication in the record that the district court\u2019s extraordinary departure possibly was based in part on its view that the government could, or even would, later seek a further reduction of Botts's sentence pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \u2014 an impermissible basis for a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure. However, because the district court failed to provide any reasons for the extent of its departure, we cannot determine on this record whether the district court's basis for departure was permissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b447-5\">. We reject Botts's argument that we must affirm because the government did not object in the district court to the district court\u2019s failure to specify the reasons for its departure. The government did object in the district court to the unreasonableness of the extent of the departure and has preserved that objection on appeal, and this Court cannot determine the reasonableness issue without knowing the reasons for the departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
