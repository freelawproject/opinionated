(\u201cSealy\u201d) under Title VII of the CM Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d) and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (\u201cPHRA\u201d). He appeals the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Sealy.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">Corbett worked at Sealy for sixteen years, first as a laborer, then in management, where he attained the position of production supervisor of the sewing room. In his capacity as supervisor, Corbett oversaw Kathy Kriebel (\u201cKriebel\u201d), described by Corbett as a \u201cverbally crude\u201d employee who \u201cfrequently used foul, vulgar, and explicit language.\u201d Corbett had previously complained to Sealy management that Kriebel had pinched the rear of a coworker, but Sealy took no action.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-18\">On October 18, 2000, Corbett and several co-workers were discussing camouflaged hunting pants Corbett had received from a co-worker. Kriebel told the group she could tell they were from a local high school, to which Corbett responded, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ve got your little boy\u2019s pants right here.\u201d (Corbett deposition, A-45) Joking, Corbett then gestured as if he were going to unzip his pants, but did not actually do so. Kriebel responded, \u201cLet me see, let me see.\u201d Corbett laughed and said, \u201cNo.\u201d Kriebel replied \u201cI knew you didn\u2019t have a hair on your ass to do that.\u201d Another male employee, Garret Goheen (\u201cGoheen\u201d), pulled his pants down an inch or two.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-19\">The following day, Corbett assigned Kriebel to finish pillow tops, a job not normally hers. Kriebel said she would not \u201ceffing do that job,\u201d and suggested someone less senior should do it. After further discussion, Kriebel agreed to do the job, but threatened to complain to her union. She did so, and also complained about the events of October 18 (\u201cthe October 18 Incident\u201d). The union then contacted Sealy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Vice President of Human Resources, Tom Brown (\u201cBrown\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">On October 20, 2000, Corbett met with Brown and plant manager Jim Staab at the request of Brown to discuss the October 18 Incident. Corbett told them what happened and who was there. Later that day, Brown told Corbett he had talked to the witnesses, and they corroborated Corbett\u2019s version of the incident. Several days later, Brown suspended Corbett with pay while the incident was investigated further. Brown said other witnesses saw Corbett pull his zipper down, but Corbett denied it. Brown also accused Corbett of retaliating against Kriebel by looking at her in the wrong manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Two days later, Brown completed his investigation, and concluded Corbett had made an inappropriate gesture. Corbett was permanently discharged for violation of the Sealy non-harassment policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A letter emphasizing the non-harassment policy was placed in Kriebel\u2019s employee file. Goheen, who had pulled his pants down an inch or two, received a warning letter. Corbett requested and received an exit interview with the president of human resources and vice president of operations at Sealy\u2019s corporate offices. Corbett said the October 18 Incident was simply a joke over hunting pants, and denied any intent to sexually harass Kriebel. Sealy upheld his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Corbett filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), and the EEOC, finding no discrimination, issued a right-to-sue letter. Corbett filed this action against Sealy for violations of Title VII and the PHRA. The District Court granted summary judgment for Sealy on both counts. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is plenary. <em>Hampe v. Butler, </em>364 F.3d 90, 93 (3d Cir.2004). We apply the same test as the District Court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c). <em>See Kelley v. TYK Refractories Co., </em>860 F.2d 1188, 1192 (3d Cir.1988). Summary judgment may be granted only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and Sealy is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In evaluating the evidence, we interpret facts in the light most favorable to Corbett, and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor. <em>Doe v. County of Centre, PA, </em>242 F.3d 437, 446 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">A. Sex Discrimination Under Title VII</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">Corbett alleges Sealy disciplined him more harshly than Kriebel because he is male, a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Sex discrimination against males has been dubbed \u201creverse discrimination.\u201d <em>See Iadimarco v. Runyon, </em>190 F.3d 151, 155 (3d Cir.1999). In <em>Iadimarco, </em>this Court defined a modified burden-shifting analysis that differs slightly from the usual test under <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Corbett must establish a <em>prima facie </em>case by presenting sufficient evidence to allow a factfinder to conclude Sealy treated some people less favorably than others based on sex. <em>Iadimarco, </em>190 F.3d at 161. The burden then shifts to Sealy to articulate a legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason for firing Corbett. <em>Id. </em>at 157. If Sealy succeeds, the burden shifts back to Corbett to show Sealy\u2019s reason for firing him was pretextual. <em>Id. </em>at 166. Corbett must point to evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could either: 1) disbelieve Sealy\u2019s alleged nondiseriminatory reason; or 2) believe an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of his firing. <em>Id. </em>If Corbett offers evidence \u201cthat would allow reasonable minds to conclude that the evidence of pretext is more credible than the employer\u2019s justifications, the employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment must fail.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The District Court applied the modified burden-shifting analysis under <em>Iadimarco </em>to Corbett\u2019s reverse discrimination claim. To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, Corbett claimed disparate treatment of him relative to Kriebel. Corbett had reported Kriebel for pinching a male worker\u2019s rear and she had frequently used vulgar language, but Sealy had taken no disciplinary action. After the October 18 Incident, Sealy fired Corbett, but merely placed a letter in Kriebel\u2019s file. The District Court, rejecting this argument, found that: 1) Brown, who investigated the October 18 Incident, was never made aware of Kriebel\u2019s past conduct; 2) Sealy treated Corbett more harshly than Kriebel because he was a supervisor; and 3) Goheen, who was treated less harshly than Corbett, was male. Considering the totality of this evidence, the District Court held no reasonable factfinder could find Sealy treated Corbett more harshly because he was male, so that Corbett failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, and even if he had, Corbett could not show Sealy\u2019s legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for firing him was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Considering the facts alleged and the inferences therefrom in favor of Corbett, a reasonable factfinder could conclude Sealy treated him more harshly than Kriebel because he was male. A reasonable fact-finder could also conclude that Brown was never made aware of Kriebel\u2019s vulgar behavior because Sealy\u2019s failure to investigate was discriminatory. Corbett did establish <em>a prima facie </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">However, Sealy articulated a legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason for firing Corbett while retaining Kriebel: Corbett, who violated Sealy\u2019s non-harassment policy by gesturing towards Kriebel on October 18, and later eying her in a retaliatory manner, was a supervisor, while Kriebel was not. Sealy could reasonably hold management to a higher standard than laborers. This nondiseriminatory reason is supported by Sealy\u2019s treatment of Goheen, a laborer who was reprimanded in the same lenient fashion as Kriebel even though he was male.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The burden then shifted to Corbett to show Sealy\u2019s reason was pretextual. Corbett argued the non-harassment policy prohibits ^solicited behavior, and that Kriebel solicited his gesture by responding, \u201cLet me see, let me see.\u201d But the non-harassment policy is not limited to unsolicited behavior. Sealy could reasonably have found Corbett\u2019s behavior was harassment since the policy\u2019s defined harassment as \u201cverbal or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual ...\u201d Corbett admitted he made the unzipping gesture before Kriebel responded, \u201cLet me see, let me see.\u201d His gesture could not have been solicited by conduct that had not yet occurred. He offered no evidence that Sealy\u2019s explanation was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">B. Sex Discrimination Under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Claims under the PHRA are interpreted coextensively with Title VII claims. <em>Kelly v. Drexel University, </em>94 F.3d 102, 105 (3d Cir.1996). Since Corbett failed to establish a claim of sex discrimination under Title VII, summary judgment for Sealy on the PHRA claim was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Corbett established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, but Sealy presented a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for firing him. Corbett did not present evidence that Sealy\u2019s reason was pretextual. While Sealy\u2019s treatment of Corbett may have been harsh, it was not illegal sex discrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-6\">. The non-harassment policy states: \u201cHarassment is considered an act of misconduct which will result in disciplinary action including discharge if the situation warrants.\u201d The policy defines harassment as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">... unwelcome or unsolicited sexual, physical, verbal or written conduct which creates or contributes to a hostile or offensive work environment. Harassment is also verbal or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his/her race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age or disability, and that (i) has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; (ii) has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance, or (iii) otherwise adversely affects an individual\u2019s employment opportunities.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-15\">.
