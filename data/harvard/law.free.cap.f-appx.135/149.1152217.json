R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1.(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-28\">Jaime Lopez-Marques pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute in excess of fifty grams of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B). On appeal, Lopez-Marques\u2019 counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, <em>18 </em>L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and moved for leave to withdraw. For the reasons set out below, we conclude the case is wholly frivolous, grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>Anders </em>holds that if counsel finds a case to be wholly frivolous after conscientious examination, he may so advise the court and request permission to withdraw. <em>Id. </em>at 744. Counsel must submit to both the court and his client a brief referring to anything in the record arguably supportive of the appeal. <em>Id. </em>The client may then raise any point he chooses, and the court thereafter must undertake a complete examination of all proceedings to determine whether the appeal is in fact frivolous. If it so finds, it may grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. <em>Id. </em>Counsel has provided Lopez-Marques with a copy of his appellate brief and Lopez-Marques has filed his own brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">In his <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel identified no nonfrivolous appealable issues for our consideration. Lopez-Marques filed his own <em>pro </em>se<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> supplemental brief raising two issues on appeal: 1) methamphetamine was unconstitutionally moved in 1971 from a schedule III to a schedule II drug; and 2) L isomer methamphetamine is not a controlled substance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>this Court held the procedure reclassifying amphetamine and methamphetamine was adequate and that amphetamine was properly classified as a Schedule II controlled substance. 967 F.2d 370, 373 (10th Cir.1992). Lopez-Marquez provides no new basis for challenging that procedure and consequently, his claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">As to Lopez-Marques\u2019 second argument, methamphetamine is clearly classified as a controlled substance. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308.12(d); <em>United States v. Youngblood, </em>949 F.2d 1065, 1066 (10th Cir.1991). Lopez-Marques tries to distinguish between D and L isomer methamphetamine, arguing only D isomer methamphetamine is a controlled substance and that the government failed to prove that the methamphetamine in his possession was D isomer. The distinction between methamphetamine isomers is irrelevant because 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308.12(d) not only lists methamphetamine as a controlled substance but also \u201cits salts, isomers, and salts of its isomers.\u201d Courts in a variety of contexts have routinely rejected the necessity of proving particular isomer form. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>725 F.2d 43, 44-45 (4th Cir.1984) (discussing \u201cisomer strategy\u201d in the context of cocaine). We also decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">In sum, after a careful review of the record, we conclude the case is wholly frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">Appeal DISMISSED. Counsel is permitted to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b175-20\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-6\">. We construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally. <em>Ledbetter v.
