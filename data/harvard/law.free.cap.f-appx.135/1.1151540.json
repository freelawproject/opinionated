Mr. Manfre received a sentence calculated under the federal Sentencing Guidelines. He argues that sentence enhancements he received for obstruction of justice and for his role in the offense violate his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-25\">During the pendency of this appeal, the Supreme Court held in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, ---, 125 S.Ct. 738, 755-56, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that the reasoning in <em>Blakely </em>applies to the federal Sentencing Guidelines, and therefore that \u201cany fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty ... must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice \u2014 which was not based on facts established by a jury or admitted to by Mr. Manfre \u2014 violated Mr. Manfre\u2019s constitutional rights as interpreted by <em>Booker; </em>and Mr. Manfre preserved the Sixth Amendment argument below. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number><em>See Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 765; <em>United States v. Adams, </em>401 F.3d 886, 899 (8th Cir.2005) (defendant preserved Sixth Amendment argument by-raising objection to his sentence below based on <em>Apprendi v.
