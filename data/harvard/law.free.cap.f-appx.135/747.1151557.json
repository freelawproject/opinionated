The district court sentenced him to 27 months of imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-29\">Delgado-Ramirez argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>cause it does not require the fact of a prior aggravated-felony conviction to be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. As Delgado-Ramirez concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was not overruled by <em>Apprendi. See United States v. Sarmiento-Funes, </em>374 F.3d 336, 346 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">For the first time on appeal, Delgado-Ramirez argues that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court must vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing because the mandatory guideline regime was in place at the time of his sentencing. An unpreserved challenge to the computation of a defendant\u2019s sentence under the formerly mandatory sentencing guidelines is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The district court\u2019s application of the guidelines in their mandatory form constituted error that is \u201cplain\u201d for purposes of satisfying the first two prongs of the plain error analysis. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005). Delgado-Ramirez must nevertheless show that the court\u2019s error affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>To make such a showing, Delgado-Ramirez bears the burden of demonstrating \u201cthat the sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one\u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521. Delgado-Ramirez has failed to make such a showing. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b773-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
