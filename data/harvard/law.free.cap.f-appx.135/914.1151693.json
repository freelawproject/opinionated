The booking photos, court records, booking sheet, and fingerprint card were all public records that bore the indicia of reliability \u2014 which was uncontested. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>117 F.3d 417, 420 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-18\">In supervised release revocation proceedings, defendants \u201care entitled to certain minimal due process requirements,\u201d such as \u201cthe right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). However, \u201cthe Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in supervised release revocation proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). In weighing the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation against the government\u2019s need to put on evidence, the district court may consider the \u201cimportance of the evidence to the court\u2019s finding, the [defendant\u2019s] opportunity to refute the evidence, and the consequences of the court\u2019s finding,\u201d as well as \u201cthe difficulty and expense of procuring witnesses\u201d and the \u201ctraditional indicia of reliability borne by the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations, internal quotation marks, and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-19\">The FBI Rap Sheet was admitted to show that the probation office had been notified of Cervantes-Aguinaga\u2019s law enforcement contacts and that the probation office had acted on such notice to begin searching for documentation to substantiate the notice. The rap sheet was not admitted to prove Cervantes\u2019 criminal history, and it was not hearsay. FED. R. EVID. 801(c) (\u201cHearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d).
