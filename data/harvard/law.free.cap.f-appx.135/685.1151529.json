She argues that the district court erred in determining that there was a sufficient factual basis to support application of a two-level adjustment for possession of a dangerous weapon under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). She also contends that the district court erred pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by applying this adjustment, and a six-level adjustment for creating a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor. She contends that the sentencing guidelines are unconstitutional and that enhancing her sentence based on facts to which she did not admit and that were not found by the trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt violates her Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-15\">After Beshirs filed her notice of appeal, the district court granted the Government\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) and entered an amended judgment sentencing Beshirs to 81 months of imprisonment. The Government originally filed a motion to dismiss this appeal as moot but has since moved to strike this motion. The motion to strike is construed as a motion to withdraw the motion to dismiss and is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-16\">As both parties concede, the district court lacked jurisdiction to grant the Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) motion once Beshirs\u2019s notice of appeal was filed. <em>See United States v. Hayes, </em>589 F.2d 811, 827 n. 8 (5th Cir.1979). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s amended judgment is void, and the original judgment remains in effect. The proper method for preserving a direct appeal and a post-judgment motion that is not in aid of the appeal is to request a stay from the appellate court when the district court indicates that it is inclined to grant the post-judgment motion. <em>See Winchester v. U.S. Attorney for the S. Dist. of Texas, </em>68 F.3d 947, 949 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-17\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the guidelines de novo, and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202-203 (5th Cir.2005). An adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) is appropriate if a weapon is present \u201cunless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment (n.3). Weapon possession is established if the Government proves by a preponderance of the evidence \u201cthat a temporal and spatial relation existed between the weapon, the drug trafficking activity, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Hooten, </em>942 F.2d 878, 882 (5th Cir.1991). Regardless whether the semi-automatic rifle could have been used for hunting, a supposition which Beshirs offers no evidence to support, the firearm was found in the open, and it is not clearly improbable that it was connected to Beshirs\u2019s offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3); <em>United States v. Hewin, </em>877 F.2d 3, 5 (5th Cir.1989). Accordingly, the district court did not err in imposing the two-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon in connection with a drug-trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. <em>Booker </em>also struck down 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) and rendered the guidelines advisory, rather than mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 764-65. Pursuant to <em>Booker, </em>the increases in Beshirs\u2019s offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 exceed the maximum sentence authorized by her guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Where, as here, a defendant has preserved a <em>Booker </em>challenge in the district court, \u201cwe will ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless we can say the error is harmless under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 04-9517 (U.S. Mar. 31, 2005). As the Government concedes, it has not met its burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that this error did not contribute to the sentence that Beshirs received. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 376 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we vacate Beshirs\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">MOTION TO WITHDRAW THE MOTION TO DISMISS GRANTED; AMENDED JUDGMENT VOIDED; SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b712-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
