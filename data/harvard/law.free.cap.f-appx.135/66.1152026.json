The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) concluded that Kazi was hot credible and further found that if Kazi had suffered past persecution, the presumption of future persecution would be rebutted by changed country conditions. The BIA affirmed, noting additional grounds for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and we grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-16\">\u201cWe review adverse credibility determinations under the substantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>Hoque v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1190, 1194 (9th Cir.2004). Determinations of an alien\u2019s eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal are also reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>Where, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision and also adds its own findings, we review both decisions. <em>Chand v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1066, 1072 n. 7 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-17\">We conclude that the \u201c \u2018[mjinor inconsistencies [cited by the BIA] that reveal nothing about [Kazi\u2019s] fear for [his] safety are not an adequate basis for an adverse credibility finding.\u2019\u201d <em>Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 884 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Osorio v. INS, </em>99 F.3d 928, 931 (9th Cir.1996)). Thus, that Kazi first testified that the BNP members came to his home \u201cseveral times\u201d while he was in hiding and later testified that they came \u201cmany times\u201d cannot support the adverse credibility finding. <em>See Vilorio-Lopez v. INS, </em>852 F.2d 1137, 1142 (9th Cir.1988) (reversing an IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding that was made on the basis of inconsistencies regarding the date of a threatening incident and the length of time the petitioner remained in hiding from his alleged persecutors).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-18\">Further, the record does not support the IJ\u2019s finding that Kazi first testified that the BNP members came to his father-in-law\u2019s house and that Kazi then contradict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>ed this statement; Kazi did not testify that the men came to his father-in-law\u2019s house. Similarly, Kazi\u2019s testimony regarding the BNP members\u2019 numerous threats against Kazi\u2019s brothers did not conflict with his brother Mamun\u2019s letter, which was written to inform Kazi of a recent threatening incident. That Kazi\u2019s brother\u2019s letter did not mention earlier incidents, which Kazi described, did not undermine Kazi\u2019s credibility. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 1015, 1022 (9th Cir.2003) (reversing an adverse credibility determination that was made on the basis of petitioner\u2019s husband\u2019s inability to remember the dates on which a Chinese official forcibly subjected the petitioner to various birth control measures).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In addition, the record does not support the IJ\u2019s finding that Kazi testified inconsistently concerning his friend Habib\u2019s stab wound and death. Throughout the course of the hearing, Kazi testified that Habib had been stabbed during the attacks at the political meeting and that he died after the stabbing. Indeed, all parties understood that Habib had died.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record indicates that Kazi\u2019s one statement that Habib \u201cwas fine\u201d after the stabbing was the result of language problems or miscommunication. <em>See Akinmade v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 951, 956 (9th Cir.1999). (holding that the discrepancies in the petitioner\u2019s testimony were not a sufficient basis for an adverse credibility finding because they were \u201cpossibly the result of mistranslation or miseommunication\u201d). Therefore, Kazi\u2019s statement was not a sufficient basis for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">The BIA also found that Kazi was not credible because he testified that he did not report that he witnessed Habib\u2019s murder when he was interviewed by the asylum officer. The BIA also surmised, without any evidentiary support, that Kazi did not mention the kidnaping in his asylum interview. We have recognized that \u201c[cjertain features of an asylum interview make it a potentially unreliable point of comparison to a petitioner\u2019s testimony for purposes of a credibility determination.\u201d <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 1081, 1087 (9th Cir.2005). Without a transcript of the asylum interview, a record of the questions and answers at the interview, or testimony from the asylum officer, Kazi\u2019s asylum interview is not a reliable evidentiary source. In these circumstances, the alleged discrepancies between the asylum interview and direct testimony cannot support the adverse credibility finding. <em>See id. </em>at 1089-90; <em>see also In re S-S-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 121, 123-24, 1995 WL 688875 (BIA 1995) (holding that \u201cthe record must contain a meaningful, clear, and reliable summary of the statements made by the applicant at the interview\u201d for statements or omissions at an asylum interview to support an adverse credibility determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">The BIA also adopted the IJ\u2019s alternative holding that, even if Kazi suffered past persecution, the presumption of future persecution would be rebutted by changed country conditions pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). The basis for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>IJ\u2019s determination was the 1997 State Department Country Report for Bangladesh, which reflects that Kazi\u2019s political party joined a coalition with the BNP. However, \u201c[o]ur cases hold that \u2018individualized analysis\u2019 of how changed conditions will affect the specific petitioner\u2019s situation is required.\u201d <em>Garrovillas v. INS, </em>156 F.3d 1010, 1017 (9th Cir.1998). The BIA\u2019s reliance on \u201cinformation about general changes in the country is not sufficient.\u201d <em>Id; see also Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 799, 805 (9th Cir.2004). We therefore remand for an individualized analysis of changed country conditions, which \u201c \u2018could lead to the presentation of further evidence of current circumstances in [Bangladesh] \u2014 evidence that may well prove enlightening.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 806 (quoting <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">PETITION GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b93-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-5\">. Even after Kazi testified that his friend \"was fine\u201d the IJ assumed that his friend was killed.
