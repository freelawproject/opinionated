Terrell Hodges, United States District Judge for the Middle District of Florida, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b373-19\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b373-20\">The district court granted Harold Clark\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, concluding the state court\u2019s adjudication of Clark\u2019s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim was an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The State filed this appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-21\">Clark was charged in state court with breaking into the dwelling of his former girlfriend, and attempting to kill her by cutting her throat while she slept. During closing arguments at trial, the State told the jury that in order to prove Clark guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>of attempted first-degree murder, the State could show either premeditation or that the act of cutting the victim\u2019s throat was done in the course of another felony. The jury found Clark guilty of attempted first-degree murder and burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">After Clark\u2019s conviction, the Florida Supreme Court decided <em>State v. Gray, </em>654 So.2d 552 (Fla.1995), receding from a prior decision and holding attempted felony murder was not a crime in Florida. <em>Id. </em>at 554. In <em>Gray, </em>the Court stated its decision should be applied to all cases pending on direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>At the time the <em>Gray </em>decision was rendered, Clark\u2019s direct appeal was pending, but briefing had been completed. Clark\u2019s attorney did not raise an argument based on <em>Gray. </em>On May 23, 1995, the state appellate court affirmed Clark\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In September 1995, Clark filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in state court, arguing, inter alia, that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise an argument based on the <em>Gray </em>holding that attempted felony murder is not a crime in Florida. The state court summarily denied Clark\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Clark then filed a motion for post-conviction relief, pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850. After an evidentiary hearing, the state court denied Clark\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion. The court noted that Clark\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim was cognizable only in the habeas corpus proceeding before the court that decided Clark\u2019s direct appeal. The denial of Rule 3.850 relief was affirmed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Clark, initially proceeding pro se, filed this \u00a7 2254 petition arguing, inter alia, that: (1) his conviction was obtained by use of a non-existent crime under Florida law (attempted first-degree felony murder); and (2) he was denied effective assistance of appellate counsel based on his appellate attorney\u2019s failure to argue he was convicted of a non-existent crime. The district court denied Clark\u2019s petition. On the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim, the district court concluded Clark\u2019s appellate counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient. The district court did not address the <em>Strickland </em>prejudice prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">On appeal, we appointed counsel. We vacated the district court\u2019s judgment on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>See Clark v. Crosby, </em>335 F.3d 1303, 1313 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1155, 124 S.Ct. 1159, 157 L.Ed.2d 1052 (2004). We remanded the case, stating: \u201cWithout an evidentiary hearing, the record in this case does not support a finding regarding th[e] constitutional adequacy of Clark\u2019s appellate counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">On remand, the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing and entered a very thorough opinion granting Clark\u2019s petition with respect to his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim. The State appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">We heard oral argument on the State\u2019s appeal. After hearing oral argument and reviewing the briefs and the record in this case, we hold there was no reversible error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
