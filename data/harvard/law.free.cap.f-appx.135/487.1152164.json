Humphrey\u2019s complaint alleges various constitutional violations arising primarily out of the dismissal of prior complaints Humphrey had filed in state and federal courts. We assume familiarity with the facts and proceedings in this case, as well as with the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-20\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 <em>de novo. See McEachin v. McGuinnis, </em>357 F.3d 197, 198 (2d Cir.2003). Based on our independent review of the record and Humphrey\u2019s pleadings, we find no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of Humphrey\u2019s complaint, which lacks any arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Cf. Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989) (holding that an appeal may be dismissed as frivolous if it \u201clacks an arguable basis in law or fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-21\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
