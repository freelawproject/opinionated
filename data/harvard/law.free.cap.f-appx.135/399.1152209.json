As one condition of his release, he could not use controlled substances. Johnson was released from incarceration in 2004, and a few months later, the probation officer filed a petition for warrant of arrest based on numerous violations of the conditions of Johnson\u2019s release, including, inter alia, a positive urinalysis test submitted three days after Johnson\u2019s release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-13\">At the revocation hearing, Johnson pleaded guilty to violating the conditions of his release based on the positive urinalysis test. The court determined that the conduct involved a Grade C violation, and that, with Johnson\u2019s criminal history category VI, the guidelines range was eight to fourteen months imprisonment. Johnson made no objections to these findings. The court then considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the policy statements of Chapter 7 of the sentencing guidelines and sentenced Johnson to eleven months imprisonment, explaining that continuing supervised release was \u201cnot an option.\u201d In reaching this sentence, the court noted Johnson\u2019s extensive criminal record, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-14\">reviewing your record, it\u2019s pretty tough, I think you will admit that. It\u2019s a tough record, and it seems as though that when you get out you do something to get you back in again. You\u2019ve spent a lot of those 44 years that you have in\u2014 you\u2019ve spent a lot of those years in prison.... Every time that you get sentenced to go back into prison, it makes it tougher on whoever hears your case to expect that you\u2019re going to do anything better than what you have done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">Johnson did not object to the sentence. Johnson now appeals, challenging the imposition of a term of imprisonment rather than a continuation of his supervised release based on his single positive urinalysis test.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-16\">When a defendant fails to object to an error before the district court, we review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the argument for plain error. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>314 F.3d 565, 566 (11th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). \u201cPlain error occurs where (1) there is an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) affecting the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>314 F.3d at 566; <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583, the court is required to revoke supervised release if the defendant (1) possessed a controlled substance, or (2) tested positive three times over the course of one year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(1), (4); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, comment, (n.5). In cases involving other violations, the court may revoke release upon a finding that the defendant violated the terms of his release and after considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Under Chapter 7 of the sentencing guidelines, the guidelines range is calculated based on the grade of the probation violation and the defendant\u2019s criminal history category at the time of the original sentencing hearing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. A Grade C violation permits the court to revoke supervised release or extend the term of release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(a)(2). A court need only consider the sentencing guidelines policy statements in Chapter 7 in determining a defendant\u2019s sentence following violations of supervised release, as these guidelines are not binding on the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 7, pt. A(1), (3)(a); <em>Cook, </em>291 F.3d at 1301; <em>United States v. Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d 357, 361 (11th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Milano, </em>32 F.3d 1499, 1503 (11th Cir.1994), <em>superceded on other grounds by, Cook, </em>291 F.3d at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Johnson contends that the court erred because it believed that it was required to impose imprisonment because another term of supervised release was not an \u201coption.\u201d Although we do not know what the court meant by the statement that supervised release was not an option, the district court indicated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as Johnson\u2019s criminal history to conclude that a term of imprisonment was necessary in Johnson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>case. The court noted Johnson\u2019s lengthy prison record and the fact that he repeatedly committed other offenses after release. The court sentenced Johnson at the middle of the guideline range based on its consideration of his criminal history and the need for deterrence, and there is no evidence that the court would have imposed a different sentence had it known that imprisonment was not required. Johnson\u2019s mere speculation is insufficient to establish plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299-1300 (11th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(No. 04-1148) (Feb. 23, 2005). Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-7\">. The government points out that Johnson may have been subject to the mandatory term of imprisonment because mandatory imprisonment is statutorily required if a defendant violates the terms of supervised release by possessing a controlled substance and the use of a controlled substance may be considered as evidence of possession. <em>See United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316 (11th Cir.1993) (explaining that, although there was no indication that the district court believed it was required to equate use with possession, the district court reviewed the evidence and exercised its factfinding power to determine that Almand possessed a controlled substance on each of the four occasions on which he tested positive). Here, however, the court made no such factual findings, and, therefore, we do not consider whether Johnson was subject to a mandatory term of imprisonment. Because we do not address mandatory imprisonment following revocation, we need not consider whether Johnson was entitled to relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3, comment, (n.6) (instructing that when the case involves a defendant who failed a drug test, the court \"shall consider whether the availability of appropriate substance abuse programs, or a defendant\u2019s current or past participation in such programs, warrants an exception from the requirement of mandatory revocation and imprisonment.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b427-12\">. In revoking a term of probation, the court should consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), including: the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the seriousness of the offense, deterrence, and the need to provide the defendant with treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), 3583(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
