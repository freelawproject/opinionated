We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. \u2018Where the BIA adopts the findings and reasoning of the IJ, this court reviews the decision of the IJ as if it were that of the BIA.\u201d <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-21\">The IJ based his adverse credibility finding on, among other things, inconsistencies between petitioner\u2019s application and his testimony on matters concerning: the issuance of a police summons, bail, the manner of his termination of employment, the number of times and manner in which he was interrogated in police custody, and police surveillance of his residence. <em>See Chebchoub, </em>257 F.3d at 1043-44. The IJ provided specific and cogent reasons for finding petitioner not credible, and the denial of asylum is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 1044. Because petitioner failed to demonstrate that he was eligible for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah, </em>348 F.3d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>Petitioner has waived his claim for protection under CAT by failing to raise any arguments in his opening brief challenging the BIA\u2019s denial of this claim. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v.
