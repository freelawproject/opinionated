Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 489-90, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), for failure to state a claim. Wheeler also moves for appointment of counsel. Wheeler alleges that his disciplinary conviction has been invalidated and that the application of <em>Heck </em>to prison disciplinary proceedings is unconstitutional. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal de novo. <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-25\">Wheeler has not provided evidence in support of his allegation that his disciplinary conviction has been overturned or declared invalid, and we have held <em>Heck </em>applicable to prison disciplinary proceedings. <em>See Clarke v. Stalder, </em>154 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc). Wheeler consequently has not shown erroneous the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-26\">Wheeler\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Both the district court\u2019s dismissal and this court\u2019s dismissal of the instant appeal count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Wheeler is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-27\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b728-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
