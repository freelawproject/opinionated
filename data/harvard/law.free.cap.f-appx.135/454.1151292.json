We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-18\">We may reverse the BIA\u2019s determination for lack of substantial evidence \u201conly if no reasonable fact-finder\u201d would have reached the same conclusion. <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 177 (2d Cir.2004). We defer to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretations of the immigration laws. <em>Michel v. INS, </em>206 F.3d 253, 262 (2d Cir.2000). To establish eligibility for asylum, Lin was required to demonstrate either a well-founded fear of future persecution in China or past persecution giving rise to a rebuttable presumption of such a well-founded fear. <em>See Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 148 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-19\">The BIA\u2019s finding that Lin\u2019s allegation that he was discharged from his position as village doctor after he had already left China did not allege treatment rising to the level of past persecution was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. While imposition of a \u201csubstantial economic disadvantage\u201d may sometimes amount to persecution, <em>Liao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 67 (2d Cir.2002), Lin did not offer evidence that he was deprived of a career in China, but only that he was discharged from a position with one hospital. None of Lin\u2019s other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>allegations establish past persecution. While Lin alleges that police sought to arrest him and that his wife was threatened with sterilization, he concedes that he was not arrested and his wife was not sterilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The BIA\u2019s finding that Lin did not allege facts supporting a well-founded fear of future persecution was also reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. The BIA was entitled to consider the lapse of time since Lin\u2019s activities in contravention of Chinese family planning policy, the relatively small scale of Lin\u2019s resistance to that policy, the lack of evidence of any continuing interest in Lin by authorities in China, and that Lin\u2019s family members have been subject to no harassment or other ill treatment during the previous nine years in China. Thus Lin has failed to establish that Chinese authorities currently are inclined to persecute him, which is required in order to establish that a fear of future persecution is well-founded. <em>See Carcamo-Flores v. INS, </em>805 F.2d 60 (2d Cir.1986). Furthermore, there is no evidence to support a likelihood of future sterilization of Lin or his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Accordingly, Lin\u2019s motion for a stay of removal is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
