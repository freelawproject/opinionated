Perez challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress statements based on his unlawful handcuffing at the Otay Mesa port of entry. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-16\">As the government concedes, Perez\u2019s handcuffing was unlawful because it was not supported by reasonable suspicion. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>295 F.3d 1002, 1011 (9th Cir.2002). Nonetheless, we conclude that Perez\u2019s statements were not a product of the illegal handcuffing: (1) the officer handcuffed Perez for only two minutes during the walk from Perez\u2019s vehicle to the holding area; (2) fifteen minutes later, officers discovered marijuana in Perez\u2019s vehicle during a lawful border search and subsequently arrested Perez; (3) Perez was then <em>Mirandized; </em>(4) Perez invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights and was not questioned by officers; and (5) five to seven hours later, Perez made the statements he sought to suppress. By the time Perez made the statements, the taint of the illegal handcuffing had dissipated. <em>See Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 603-04, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975). Because the statements did not flow from the unlawful detention, the district court did not err when it denied Perez\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b35-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
