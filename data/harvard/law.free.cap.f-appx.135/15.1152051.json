Applying <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Falness, </em>39 F.3d 966 (9th Cir.1994), we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-24\">In <em>Falness, </em>we determined that a \u201cso-called named insured exclusion\u201d was beyond the range of the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations: \u2018Whether the passenger spouse is considered as a named insured or as a member of the household, the insured driver would reasonably expect coverage for the spouse\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 966-68. We discern no meaningful distinction between the exclusion at issue in <em>Falness </em>and the exclusion at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-26\">Because the present exclusion is thus \u201cunexpected,\u201d it may not be enforced if \u201cthe insured did not receive full and adequate notice.\u201d <em>Gordinier v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>154 Ariz. 266, 742 P.2d 277, 283-84 (1987). The record before us supports the appellants\u2019 claim that insured James C. Wernicke did not receive such notice. To be sure, Wernicke testified at his deposition that he received and read the policies \u2014 after he purchased them \u2014 but he also testified that at the time, he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>notice or understand the relevant exclusions. <em>See Averett v. Farmers Ins. Co. of Ariz., </em>177 Ariz. 531, 869 P.2d 505, 508 (1994) (\u201cWhen the exclusion was finally called to his attention, he said that he read but was unable to understand it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Under these circumstances, we believe the appellants\u2019 reasonable expectations claim should be considered by the finder of fact. <em>See id. </em>at 509. Accordingly, we reverse the summary judgment entered in favor of American Family and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b41-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
