Sanchez argues that his case should be remanded under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court committed reversible plain error when it sentenced him under the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines. Although Sanchez alleges a <em>Booker </em>error, this court must first address the antecedent error that the district court committed when it applied \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) to enhance Sanchez\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 364 n. 8 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">After Sanchez was sentenced, this court held that the Texas offense of retaliation is not a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). <em>United States v. Martinez-Mata, </em>393 F.3d 625, 629 (5th Cir.2004). De novo review of Sanchez\u2019s sentence indicates that the district court\u2019s enhancement of Sanchez\u2019s sentence for his prior conviction for retaliation was therefore error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 360-361. The error was also plain. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997). Further, Sanchez has met his burden of showing that the error affected the outcome of the sentencing proceedings because he received a sentence that was several years longer and in another Guidelines range of imprisonment than he would have absent the error. <em>Villegas, </em>404 F.3d at 364-365. Finally, because the sentencing error resulted in an increased sentence, this court will exercise its discretion to correct it. <em>See United States v. Williamson, </em>183 F.3d 458, 463 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, Sanchez\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and his case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Sanchez\u2019s argument that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). His conviction is, therefore, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b741-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
