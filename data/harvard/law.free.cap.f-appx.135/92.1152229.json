Faught appeals pro se the. district court\u2019s order dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition as untimely. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. Reviewing de novo, <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">Faught\u2019s conviction became final prior to April 24, 1996, the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Therefore, absent tolling, Faught had until April 23, 1997 to file a federal habeas petition. <em>See id. </em>at 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">Because the California Supreme Court denied Faught\u2019s state post-conviction petition on timeliness grounds, Faught was not entitled to statutory tolling during the gap between the enactment of AEDPA and the fifing of his section 2254 habeas petition in district court on October 24, 2001. <em>See Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 1814, 161 L.Ed.2d 669, - (2005) (holding that \u201ctime limits, no matter their form, are \u2018fifing\u2019 conditions. Because the state court rejected petitioner\u2019s [state] petition as untimely, it was not \u2018properly filed,\u2019 and he is not entitled to statutory tolling under \u00a7 2244(d)(2).\u201d); <em>see also Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 225-26, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002) (noting that if the California Supreme Court expressly holds delay was unreasonable, petition is no longer \u201cpending\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-17\">Next, though Faught claims he is actually innocent, he provides no evidence to support the claim. Citing <em>Majoy v. Roe, </em>296 F.3d 770, 775-76 (9th Cir.2002), the district court correctly found that Faught \u201chas not shown that, in fight of all the evidence, no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-18\">Finally, Faught claims he is entitled to equitable tolling due to a delay in his prison library\u2019s acquisition of the AED-PA statutes until \u201cmid-1998.\u201d Even if Faught\u2019s AEDPA statute of limitations was tolled until \u201cmid-1998,\u201d he filed his habeas petition in district court on October 24, 2001, over two years beyond the AED-PA deadline. His claims for equitable tolling based on ignorance of the law, and difficulties in obtaining assistance in preparing his petition, are equally unpersuasive. <em>See Calderon v. United States Dist. Court (Beeler), </em>128 F.3d 1283, 1288-89 (9th Cir.1997), <em>overruled on other grounds by Calderon v. United States Dist. Court (Kelly), </em>163 F.3d 530 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-19\">An Amicus Curiae brief has been filed in this appeal. The arguments in that brief do not persuade us that the district court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b119-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
