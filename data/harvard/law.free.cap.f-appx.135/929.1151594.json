Buckley, an attorney formerly employed by the Social Security Administration (the \u201cagency\u201d), appeals pro se the district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissing his action under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 <em>et seq. </em>We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. In a FOIA case decided on summary judgment, \u201cwe first determine whether the district judge had an adequate factual basis for decision, and if not, remand. If there was an adequate factual basis, we will overturn the district court\u2019s fact findings underlying its decision only for clear error. We review de novo whether a FOIA exemption applies to particular material.\u201d <em>Fiduccia v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>185 F.3d 1035, 1040 (9th Cir.1999). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-22\">The district court did not err in concluding that the agency had demonstrated that the records Buckley sought were exempt from disclosure. <em>See Hunt v. FBI, </em>972 F.2d 286, 288-90 (9th Cir.1992) (describing application of \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d exemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(b)(6) and (7)(C)). The affidavit the agency provided established the privacy interest at stake, and Buckley failed to demonstrate a countervailing public interest. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-23\">Because we conclude the agency established a basis for nondisclosure, we also conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion by not ruling on the discovery motions Buckley filed during the pendency of the summary judgment motion. <em>See Citizens Comm\u2019n on Human Rights v. Food and Drug Admin., </em>45 F.3d 1325, 1329 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-24\">Buckley\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b955-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
