This court will not review Akbar\u2019s claims that his due process rights were violated at the revocation hearing, that his arrest for murder was the result of racial profiling, or that his guilty plea was invalid because he did not present these claims to the district court. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-22\">Because Akbar did not properly brief his claim that he is being denied a speedy trial, this court will not review that issue. <em>Id. </em>Even if this court construes Akbar\u2019s brief as raising a speedy trial claim, he is not entitled to mandamus relief on that claim because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 offers him \u2019 another means of relief once he exhausts his state court remedies. <em>See Dickerson v. Louisiana, </em>816 F.2d 220, 228 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-23\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b738-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
