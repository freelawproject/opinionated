We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility determination, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. The IJ offered specific, cogent reasons for the decision based on inconsistencies between petitioner\u2019s testimony and documentary evidence and inconsistencies within petitioner\u2019s testimony, including regarding whether police were looking for him and whether his friend was arrested. <em>See id. </em>at 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Because petitioner failed to demonstrate that he was eligible for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Because petitioner does not challenge the denial of CAT relief in his opening brief, the claim is waived. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b141-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
