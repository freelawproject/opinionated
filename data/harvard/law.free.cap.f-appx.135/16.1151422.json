Wyatt and Rebecca Kay Smith (collectively \u201cdefendants\u201d) appeal their convictions for (1) using, or aiding and abetting the use of, a hazardous or injurious device on federal land with the intent to obstruct a timber harvest; and (2) maintaining an unauthorized structure on National Forest land. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-20\">The parties are familiar with the facts and we do not recount them here except as necessary. Defendants raise multiple issues, which we consider below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>1. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"Ar\">Because defendants moved for acquittal on Count 1, we review their sufficiency of the evidence claim <em>de novo. See United States v. Naghani, </em>361 F.3d 1255, 1261 (9th Cir.2004). Considered in the light most favorable to the prosecution, sufficient evidence exists to establish all five of the elements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1864(a)(2). First, although the record does not show any direct evidence defendants strung the yellow ropes themselves, the aiding and abetting element is established because defendants knew the purpose of the yellow ropes was to interfere with helicopter operations at the site, knew that their presence in the trees by itself would hinder helicopter landings in the protest area, and were in a position on the platforms to assert control over the yellow ropes. There was also evidence the yellow ropes were tied to the trees occupied by defendants, within reach of defendants (themselves four to nine stories above the ground), and that the yellow ropes were adjusted during the time defendants were stationed in their respective trees. Considering that evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>see Naghani, </em>361 F.3d at 1261, a rational jury could conclude that defendants at least aided in the use of the yellow ropes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a) (\u201cWhoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.\u201d); <em>United States v. Castro, </em>887 F.2d 988, 995 (9th Cir.1989) (to convict for aiding and abetting under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, \u201ca jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant willingly associated himself with a criminal venture and participated therein as something he wished to bring about.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Second, the statutory definition of the term \u201chazardous or injurious device\u201d specifically includes \u201clines or wires,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1864(d)(3), which encompasses defendants\u2019 yellow ropes. Here, there was sufficient evidence the use of the yellow ropes posed a danger to helicopters because they could interfere either with the logging helicopters or with emergency medical helicopters, and such interference could have resulted in a helicopter crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Third, there is no dispute in the record that the protest site was on National Forest Service land, and fourth, was without the consent of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Fifth, as to intent to obstruct or harass the harvesting of timber, both defendants testified they knew they were occupying a proposed helicopter landing site, and their occupancy would prevent helicopters from using the site. That interference obstructed logging helicopters from harvesting timber, and obstructed emergency medical helicopters from being available to serve the loggers. Accordingly, there is sufficient evidence to support defendants\u2019 convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1864(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">2. Bret Daugherty\u2019s Claimed \u201cHearsay\u201d Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">Even though Daugherty referred during cross examination to a writing that reflected the designation of the protest site as an emergency medical helicopter landing site, Daugherty\u2019s testimony was not based upon that document, nor did he refer to it during direct examination. Writing down the designation of the site on a form did not transform into a hearsay statement Daugherty\u2019s act of designating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the site. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). The magistrate judge did not err in admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">3. Affirmative Defense of Entrapment by Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Defendants contend the magistrate judge erred in refusing an entrapment by estoppel jury instruction, which defendants offered as a defense to both Counts 1 and 2. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s refusal to provide a requested jury instruction on an entrapment by estoppel defense. <em>United States v. Batterjee, </em>361 F.3d 1210, 1216 (9th Cir.2004). A defendant is entitled to an instruction concerning his theory of defense only \u201cif it is supported by law and has <em>some foundation in the evidence. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Zuniga, </em>6 F.3d 569, 570 (9th Cir.1993) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The record contains no evidence government officials affirmatively told either defendants or the ground protesters (who were relaying information to defendants by walMe-talkie) that the use of the ropes over the helicopter landing site, or the maintenance of the unauthorized structures in the trees, was permissible. Defendants point to statements made by Ellen Davis, a public affairs specialist with the U.S. Forest Service. Even if Davis could be considered an \u201cauthorized government official, empowered to render the claimed erroneous advice,\u201d <em>see Batterjee, </em>361 F.3d at 1216, and Davis\u2019s statements were an affirmative misrepresentation that defendants\u2019 conduct was permissible, <em>see id., </em>there was no evidence Davis was \u201caware of all the relevant historical facts\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>of the presence of the lines or wires or of the designation of the medical emergency landing site by Daughtery) when she made her statements. <em>See id. </em>The magistrate judge did not err in refusing the jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">4. Restitution Order</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the magistrate judge\u2019s order for defendants to pay restitution pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563(b)(2). <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>367 F.3d 846, 854 (9th Cir.2004). We have \u201cadopted a broad view of the restitution authorization. We ask whether the costs were incurred as a \u2018direct and foreseeable result\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Here, the magistrate judge did not err in ordering Wyatt and Smith to pay restitution costs for their respective medical expenses, and for Smith to pay for the cost of the cherry picker crane used to remove her from the tree. Those costs were a \u201cdirect and foreseeable result\u201d of defendants refusing to descend from the trees.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">5. Probation Condition</p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">We review for plain error the magistrate judge\u2019s imposition of the probation condition prohibiting defendants from entering any National Forest land except when accessing wilderness areas because defendants did not object to the condition before that same magistrate judge. <em>See United States v. Rearden, </em>349 F.3d 608, 618 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">The forest restriction here is reasonably related to protecting the public by limiting defendants from areas where they might criminally interfere with logging operations. <em>See United States v. Juvenile Male </em># <em>1, </em>38 F.3d 470, 473 (9th Cir.1994). Their conduct at the protest site was located on National Forest land, and logging activity continues there. Preventing defendants from again interfering with logging operations will serve the interest of protecting the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). Thus, the magistrate judge did not commit plain error in imposing the forest restriction on defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Defendants\u2019 citation to <em>United States v. Wise, </em>391 F.3d 1027 (9th Cir.2004) is inapposite. We have rejected a notice requirement for an imposed condition of supervised release where the condition is listed as a discretionary condition of supervised release within the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, <em>see United States v. Lopez, </em>258 F.3d 1053, 1056 (9th Cir.2001), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563(b)(6) allows as a discretionary condition of probation for a court to require \u201cthat the defendant ... refrain from frequenting specified kinds of places____\u201d The magistrate judge did not plainly err in imposing the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b43-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b43-23\">. By published opinion filed concurrently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>herewith, we decide whether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1864(a), which prohibits the use of hazardous or injurious devices on federal land, is unconstitutionally vague as applied here. We decide defendants\u2019 remaining contentions in this memorandum disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
