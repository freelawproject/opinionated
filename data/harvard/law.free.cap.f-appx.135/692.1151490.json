Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As Sanchez-Lopez did not raise a claim under <em>Booker </em>below, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that, \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. We \u201cread <em>Booker </em>to apply only to sentencing adjustments based on judge-found facts which increase a defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>sentence, not to mitigating adjustments.\u201d <em>United States v. De Jesus-Batres, </em>410 F.3d 154, 166 n. 2 (5th Cir.2005). Thus, <em>Booker </em>does not apply to Sanchez-Lopez\u2019s assertion of error and the district court did not commit error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">To the extent that Sanchez-Lopez\u2019s argument may be perceived as a preserved objection to the district court\u2019s denial of a minor-role downward adjustment, this court\u2019s review is for clear error. <em>De Jesus-Batres, </em>410 F.3d at 162-163. Sanchez-Lopez was convicted and sentenced based solely on the activity in which she was involved and she has not shown that she was substantially less culpable than the average participant. Thus, the district court did not clearly err by denying Sanchez-Lopez a minor-role downward adjustment. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Atando, </em>60 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b719-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
