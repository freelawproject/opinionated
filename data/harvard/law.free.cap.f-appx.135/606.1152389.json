Dumas was sentenced based on a base offense level of twenty-four, pursuant to the <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2D3.1(2) (2003), enhanced two levels under USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(l) because property of a financial institution was taken, and enhanced five levels under USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) because a firearm was brandished or possessed during the offense. Citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), Dumas objected on the basis that he should only have been subject to a three-level guideline enhancement for use of a deadly weapon, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E), not a five-level enhancement for use of a firearm, because the facts underlying the five-level enhancement were not found by a jury and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>because Dumas pled guilty only to an unspecified \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">We agree with Dumas that the district court erred in imposing a sentence based on facts not found by a jury or admitted by Dumas, in violation of the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, we reject Dumas\u2019 contention that <em>Blakely </em>deprived the district court of the authority to impose a term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">In view of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Booker, </em>and because Dumas does not challenge the validity of his conviction, we therefore affirm the conviction, vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-11\">. Just as we noted in <em>United States v. Huqhes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), \"we of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\" of Dumas\u2019 sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b633-12\">. Although the sentencing guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \"consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546 (applying <em>Booker </em>on plain error review). The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \"within the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
