We deny the petition because the evidence does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>Jie Cui v. Holder, </em>712 F.3d 1332, 1336 (9th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-22\">Because Sui\u2019s entire claim for persecution is based on a single arrest and detention, the details of that event are critical. <em>See Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir.2005). Sui\u2019s application described in detail a significant beating following the first interrogation, an event which he completely failed to mention in his direct testimony, despite being directly asked by counsel following a discussion of the first interrogation: \u201cHow did the police respond?\u201d and \u201cWhat did they do?\u201d Moreover, the addition of new facts that enhance a persecution claim \u2014 such as being beaten with a belt and slashed on the wrist with a glass shard \u2014 is also generally suspect, particularly when, as here, the information is not provided until near the end of the applicant\u2019s testimony. <em>Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1254 (9th Cir.2003); <em>see also Kin v. Holder, </em>595 F.3d 1050, 1057 (9th Cir.2010). All of the reasons cited by the IJ and BIA go to the heart of Sui\u2019s asylum claim and properly support an adverse credibility finding. <em>Ce</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number><em>ballos-Castillo v. INS, </em>904 F.2d 519, 520 (9th Cir.1990).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Sui also claims for the first time on appeal that he was denied due process because he was not afforded an opportunity for redirect at his hearing before the IJ. However, due process claims must be exhausted, <em>Huang v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 1006, 1008 (9th Cir.2008), including claims of \u201cprocedural error that an administrative tribunal could remedy.\u201d <em>See De Mercado v. Mukasey, </em>566 F.3d 810, 815 n. 4 (9th Cir.2009). We thus lack jurisdiction over this claim and it must be dismissed. <em>Id.; see also Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">DENIED in part, DISMISSED in part.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b763-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-15\">. Sui filed an application for asylum before the May 11, 2005, enactment of the REAL ID Act, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, and thus its amendments pertaining to credibility determinations do not apply to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b764-16\">.
