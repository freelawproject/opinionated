He challenges only the 16-level enhancement that he received pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because he had been previously deported following his prior conviction for sexual assault of a child under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.011(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The district court\u2019s characterization of a prior offense as a crime of violence is a question of law that this court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>469 F.3d 376, 378 (5th Cir.2006). This court has squarely rejected Marquez\u2019s arguments that a conviction under \u00a7 22.011(a)(2) is not a crime of violence because that statute criminalizes behavior that is broader than the generic, contemporary definitions of sexual abuse of a minor and statutory rape. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 562-63 &amp; n. 28 (5`th Cir.2013) (en banc), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(June 6, 2013) (No. 12-10695). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
