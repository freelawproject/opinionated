A writ of mandamus is a drastic remedy and should be granted only in those extraordinary situations when no other remedy is available. <em>United States v. Moussaoui, </em>333 F.3d 509, 516-17 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-20\">A review of the district court\u2019s docket reveals that the district court recently directed the Government to file by July 30, 2013 a response to Walsh\u2019s petition, motion to subpoena telephone records, and motion to amend the restitution order, pleadings to which the Government had not filed a response. Because there has been recent significant action in the district court, we conclude that Walsh is not entitled to mandamus relief. Accordingly, we deny the mandamus petition.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-21\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-17\"> We anticipate that the district court will address promptly Walsh\u2019s pending petition and motions following receipt of the Government's response. However, in view of the length of time Walsh\u2019s petition and motions have been pending in the district court, our denial of Walsh\u2019s mandamus petition is without prejudice to the filing of another if further significant delay occurs in the district court after the expiration of the July 30 response deadline.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
