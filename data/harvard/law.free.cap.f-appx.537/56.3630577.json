After the District Court denied his petition, Aziz timely appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-22\">Shortly after the Government filed its brief on appeal, Aziz was removed to Guyana; ergo, he is no longer in immigration detention. The issue now before us, pursuant to the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, is whether Aziz\u2019s removal moots his habeas corpus petition and deprives us of jurisdiction over this appeal. <em>See, e.g., Burkey v. Marberry, </em>556 F.3d 142, 147 (3d Cir.2009); <em>see also In re Semcrude, L.P., </em>No. 12-2736, 728 F.3d 314, 317, 2013 WL 4517238, at *1, 2013 U.S.App. LEXIS 17903, at *1-2 (3d Cir. Aug. 27, 2013) (\u201cMootness is a threshold issue that prevents a federal court from hearing a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>where there is no live case or controversy as required by Article III of our Constitution.\u201d). To resolve the question, we must consider whether this case can be distinguished from <em>Diop v. ICE/Homeland Sec., </em>656 F.3d 221 (3d Cir.2011). In <em>Diop, </em>we held (in part) that release from immigration detention need not always render moot a habeas corpus petition challenging that detention. <em>See id. </em>at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We conclude that <em>Diop </em>is distinguishable. The petitioner in <em>Diop </em>was detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c), which governs pre-removal-decision detention. We believed his situation to be vulnerable to repetition because \u201cthe prospect of his once again being detained by the Government is not wholly speculative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228. Present were numerous factors, including the possible reinstatement of Diop\u2019s conviction and the Government\u2019s continued contention that he could be plausibly detained based on another conviction, that suggested reincarceration to be a very real possibility. <em>Id. </em>Here, by contrast, Aziz was held pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a), which covers post-removal-decision detention. As Aziz has been removed, the only plausible way he would be detained in the same situation is if he reentered the country and was again subject to a lengthy removal process (which is unlikely as the prior order can simply be reinstated). Whether he will do so or intends to do so is wholly speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\"><em>Diop </em>also suggested that mootness could be avoided if the petitioner \u201cmay again be subject to the challenged conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229. As discussed above, any argument to this end would be very speculative. Thus, unlike the petitioner in <em>Diop, </em>Aziz does not \u201cretain[ ] an interest in this appeal despite his release.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we grant the Government\u2019s motion and will dismiss this appeal as moot. Aziz\u2019s motion for summary action is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-14\">. He also filed a motion for summary action, in which he also requests that we vacate an order granting the Government an extension of time to file its brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
