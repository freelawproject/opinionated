R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b726-17\"> The Honorable Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, Senior District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b726-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-23\">Jason Jian Liang appeals his conviction and sentence following his unconditional guilty plea for violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (\u2018TEE-PA\u201d), 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1705, and the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d), 15 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 736.2, 764.2. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-24\">Liang\u2019s unconditional guilty plea waived his right to seek review of any alleged defects in his indictment or in the constitutionality of the underlying statutes. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Armenta, </em>400 F.3d 1173, 1175 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[I]t is well-settled that an unconditional guilty plea constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal all nonjurisdictional antecedent rulings and cures all antecedent constitutional defects.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-25\">Even absent waiver, Liang\u2019s arguments lack merit. The indictment was not defective because the foreign availability of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>item on the Commodity Control List is not an element of an IEEPA violation. <em>See United States v. Mandel, </em>914 F.2d 1215, 1223 (9th Cir.1990). The indictment alleged that Liang knew that a license was required for export of the thermal imaging cameras, that he lacked the license, and that he chose to export the cameras. This is sufficient to make out a violation of the IEEPA. <em>See United States v. Zhi Yong Guo, </em>634 F.3d 1119, 1123 (9th Cir.2011). Moreover, we have held that the IEEPA is not unconstitutionally vague, and Liang has provided no basis to conclude otherwise. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The district court did not err when it calculated Liang\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Garro, </em>517 F.3d 1163, 1167 (9th Cir.2008). In 2011, the Sentencing Commission amended the Guidelines Manual to include U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.1 as a cross-reference for IEEPA violations. U.S.S.G. App. C at 401. Because Liang was convicted in 2012, the district court properly consulted \u00a7 2M5.1 in calculating his Guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.11 (\u201cThe court shall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced.\u201d). The district court correctly concluded that a base offense level of 26 was appropriate given that Liang\u2019s offense conduct involved the evasion of \u201cnational security controls.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">We decline to reach Liang\u2019s claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel due to his counsel\u2019s alleged ignorance of 50 U.S.C.App. 2403(c). \u201c[I]neffective counsel claims cannot generally be evaluated on direct appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Wagner, </em>834 F.2d 1474, 1483 (9th Cir. 1987). The record is insufficiently developed at this stage to evaluate Liang\u2019s claims. <em>See United States v. Hanoum, </em>33 F.3d 1128, 1131-32 (9th Cir.1994). Liang remains free to raise his claims in a collateral attack on his conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See id. </em>at 1131 (\u201cThe customary procedure in this Circuit for challenging the effectiveness of defense counsel in a federal criminal trial is by collateral attack on the conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b726-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
