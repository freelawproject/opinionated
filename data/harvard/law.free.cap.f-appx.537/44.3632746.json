There being no substantial question presented, we grant the Bank\u2019s motion to summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-21\">Cunningham\u2019s complaint arises from a foreclosure action initiated by the Bank in the Delaware Superior Court. At issue in that case is a mortgage executed by Joseph Cunningham, Sr., Cunningham\u2019s deceased father. Over five months after the Bank initiated the foreclosure case, Cunningham filed a rambling complaint in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>District Court. This complaint was a combination of discovery requests and an allegation that the Bank has committed fraud by concealing the satisfaction of the mortgage from the heirs of Cunningham\u2019s father\u2019s estate. The District Court dismissed his complaint without prejudice and provided him time within which to file an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Cunningham filed his amended complaint, again asserting various discovery requests and his fraud allegation. His amended complaint appears to allege that the Bank\u2019s fraudulent actions interfered with his ability to defend against the foreclosure, and he asked the District Court to enjoin the foreclosure action and award him $1 million in damages. The District Court dismissed his complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and pursuant to the abstention doctrine set forth in <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We agree with the District Court that <em>Younger </em>abstention was appropriate in Cunningham\u2019s case. Such abstention is appropriate \u201conly when: (1) there are ongoing state proceedings that are judicial in nature; (2) the state proceedings implicate important state interests; and (3) the state proceedings afford an adequate opportunity to raise federal claims.\u201d <em>Kendall v. Russell, </em>572 F.3d 126, 131 (3d Cir.2009). Here, the foreclosure action against Cunningham is ongoing in the Delaware Superior Court, and this proceeding implicates important state interests. Finally, Cunningham has adequate opportunities to raise his fraud claim in state court. Furthermore, Cunningham has not demonstrated \u201cbad faith, harassment or some other extraordinary circumstance, which might make abstention inappropriate.\u201d <em>Anthony v. Council, </em>316 F.3d 412, 418 (3d Cir.2003). Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion by deciding to abstain. Therefore, we grant the Bank\u2019s motion for summary action and will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-7\">. The <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrine \"reflects a strong federal policy against federal-court interference with pending state judicial proceedings absent extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Gwynedd Props., Inc. v. Lower Gwynedd Twp., </em>970 F.2d 1195, 1200 (3d Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this doctrine, \"federal courts must abstain in certain circumstances from exercising jurisdiction over a claim where resolution of that claim would interfere with an ongoing state proceeding.\" <em>Miller v. Mitchell, </em>598 F.3d 139, 145 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b69-19\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \"We exercise plenary review over the legal determinations of whether the requirements for <em>Younger </em>abstention have been met and, if so, we review the district court\u2019s decision to abstain for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>FOCUS v. Allegheny Cnty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>75 F.3d 834, 843 (3d Cir. 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
