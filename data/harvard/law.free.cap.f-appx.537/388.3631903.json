He was sentenced to 46 months in prison, at the bottom of the correctly calculated guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Lopez contends that his sentence was unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We review the sentences for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Because there is no dispute that the guidelines range was properly calculated, Lopez\u2019s sentence at the bottom of the range is presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Lopez argues that his sentence is not worthy of a presumption of reasonableness because the illegal-reentry Guidelines are not empirically based. But he acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366 (5th Cir.2009) (refusing to second-guess a district court\u2019s decision \u201csimply because the particular Guideline is not empirically-based\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">By contending that the district court gave inadequate consideration to his personal circumstances and his motive for reentering, and too much weight to his criminal history, Lopez is asking this court to substitute his assessment of the sentencing factors for the district court\u2019s reasoned assessment. We decline, because to do so would be contrary to the deferential review dictated by <em>Gall. See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Lopez\u2019s mere disagreement with the sentence does not rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
