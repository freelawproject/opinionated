After granting the Government\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on Robinson\u2019s substantial assistance and Robinson\u2019s motion for a downward variance, the court sentenced Robinson to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2010). Robinson subsequently filed a 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2013) motion, arguing that he should receive the benefit of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372. The Government agreed, and the court ordered that Robinson be resentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">Prior to Robinson\u2019s resentencing, the Government filed a motion to reduce sentence under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) for substantial assistance that Robinson provided after his original sentencing. At resentencing, the court granted the Government\u2019s motion for a downward departure and considered the assistance Robinson had provided the Government both before and after his original sentencing. The court also granted Robinson\u2019s motion for a downward departure or variance. The court ultimately sentenced Robinson to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but questioning whether Robinson\u2019s sentence is reasonable. Robinson has filed a pro se supplemental brief, raising additional challenges to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-16\">We review Robinson\u2019s sentence for reasonableness under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court properly calculates the defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, gives the parties an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>opportunity to argue for an appropriate sentence, considers the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, does not rely on clearly erroneous facts, and explains sufficiently the selected sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Our review of the record reveals that Robinson\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Finding no procedural error, we next consider the substantive reasonableness of Robinson\u2019s sentence, \u201ctak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d Id. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Because Robinson\u2019s sentence is below the properly calculated Guidelines range, we apply a presumption on appeal that the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Susi, </em>674 F.3d 278, 289 (4th Cir.2012). This presumption may only be rebutted if Robinson shows \u201cthat the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Comparing his original sentence with his new sentence, Robinson argues that he is entitled to a greater sentence reduction. We conclude, however, that the district court was not required to grant the same downward variance at resentencing as it did at Robinson\u2019s original sentencing. <em>See United States v. Muhammad, </em>478 F.3d 247, 250 (4th Cir.2007) (holding that, when original sentence is vacated in its entirety, \u201cprior sentencing proceedings [are] nullified,\u201d and district court conducts resentencing de novo). Moreover, we conclude that Robinson\u2019s sentence was reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as it is clear that the court considered the special circumstances of Robinson\u2019s case and carefully balanced Robinson\u2019s substantial assistance with the seriousness of his crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Robinson also suggests that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to advocate for a greater sentence reduction in light of the additional substantial assistance outlined in the Government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel \u201care generally not cognizable on direct appeal ... unless it conclusively appears from the record that defense counsel did not provide effective representation.\u201d <em>United States v. Benton, </em>523 F.3d 424, 435 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The record here does not clearly demonstrate that counsel failed to effectively advocate for a sentence reduction based on the substantial assistance Robinson provided to the Government both before and after his original sentencing. Because the face of the record does not unambiguously demonstrate that counsel was ineffective, this claim is not cognizable on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Finally, Robinson suggests that the district court created an unwarranted sentencing disparity between his codefendant and him by failing to reduce Robinson\u2019s sentence both under the FSA and pursuant to the Rule 35(b) motion. Robinson\u2019s argument is without merit: the district court did in fact reduce Robinson\u2019s sentence both under the FSA and pursuant to the substantial assistance outlined in the Rule 35(b) motion. Moreover, as we have repeatedly stated, the sentencing factor addressing sentencing disparities, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6), is aimed primarily at eliminating national sentencing inequity, not differences between the sentences of co-defendants. <em>United States v. Withers, </em>100 F.3d 1142, 1149 (4th Cir.1996); <em>see also United States v. Simmons, </em>501 F.3d 620, 623-24 (6th Cir.2007) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Robinson, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Robinson requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
