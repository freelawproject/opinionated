We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-18\">First, Cruz-Castillo appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. He claims that his motion should have been granted, asserting that he did not understand the plea agreement, which he alleges was not properly translated into Spanish, and because he could not easily communicate with his attorney, who he alleges was not fluent in Spanish. But Cruz-Castillo\u2019s allegations in the motion to withdraw and on appeal \u201cmerely contradict the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Torres, </em>129 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>970 F.2d 1095, 1100 (2d Cir.1992)). At his plea allocution, Cruz-Castillo confirmed while under oath that he had reviewed his plea agreement with his attorney and that he was satisfied with his attorney\u2019s advice and representation. \u201cA defendant\u2019s bald statements that simply contradict what he said at his plea allocution are not sufficient grounds to withdraw [a] guilty plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Cruz-Castillo\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-19\">Next, Cruz-Castillo appeals from the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence of 99 months of imprisonment, arguing that the sentence was unreasonable. However, in his plea agreement Cruz-Castillo agreed not to appeal from \u201cany sentence within or below the Stipulated Guidelines Range of 87 to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment.\u201d J.A. at 23. This waiver covers the sentence that was imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Cruz^Castillo contends that he is not bound by the appeal waiver because the government breached the plea agreement when it advocated against the application of an acceptanee-of-responsibility adjustment. We disagree. The agreement states that \u201c[njothing in this Agreement limits the right of the Government to seek denial of the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility ... if the defendant fails clearly to demonstrate acceptance of responsibility, to the satisfaction of the Government, through his allocution and subsequent conduct prior to the imposition of sentence.\u201d J.A. at 23. The government reasonably determined that Cruz-Castillo had failed to demonstrate acceptance of responsibility to the government\u2019s satisfaction because Cruz-Castillo had filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea in which, at the least, he \u201cmaintain[edj his innocence to some degree.\u201d J.\u00c1. at 44. The government was therefore entitled to advocate against a finding that Cruz-Castillo had accepted responsibility, and in doing so it did not breach the plea agreement. Consequently, the appeal waiver within that agreement bars Cruz-Castillo\u2019s sentencing appeal. We will enforce that waiver here and decline to consider his sentencing challenges. <em>See United States v. Djelevic, </em>161 F.3d 104, 106 (2d Cir.1998) (per curiam) (\u201cIt is by now well-settled that a defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal a sentence within an agreed upon guideline range is enforceable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">We have considered Cruz-Castillo\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
