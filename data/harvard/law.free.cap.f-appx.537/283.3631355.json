During his detention, Sawyer sustained a broken nose after Wood County Deputy Sheriff Jim Asbury used physical force upon him. The interaction was recorded on closed-circuit video, without sound, and that video is central to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-16\">As a result of the incident, Sawyer sued Asbury in federal court, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming (among other things) that Asbury\u2019s use of excessive force violated Sawyer\u2019s rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The jury returned a verdict in Asbury\u2019s favor. Concluding that the video clearly established Asbury\u2019s use of excessive force, the district court granted Sawyer\u2019s motion for judgment. <em>See Sawyer v. Asbury, </em>861 F.Supp.2d 737 (S.D.W.Va.2012). In addition, the district court found that Asbury was not entitled to qualified immunity. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-18\">In October 2010, Sawyer filed suit against Deputy Asbury, in both his individual and official capacities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sawyer\u2019s Amended Complaint (JA 15) contained two claims against Asbury under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In particular, Sawyer asserted a claim of excessive force, in violation of the Fourth Amendment, arising out of Deputy Asbury\u2019s arrest of Sawyer at his home in October 2009, and another claim of excessive force, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, based on Deputy Asbury\u2019s conduct at the detention center.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-19\">Following discovery, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Deputy Asbury in his official capacity as to all counts, and in favor of Deputy Asbury in his individual capacity as to the excessive force claim arising from Sawyer\u2019s arrest. However, the court denied summary judgment with respect to the individual-capacity Fourteenth Amendment claim relating to the occurrence at the detention center.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">At the trial in April 2012, the jury heard the testimony of Sawyer and Asbury, as well as Sergeant Larry D. Kearns and Lieutenant David Massey, who were at the detention center at the relevant time. In addition, the video recording was played for the jury \u201cseveral times at different speeds with freeze frames on occasion.\u201d 861 F.Supp.2d at 743.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the time of the incident, Asbury was not aware of the video camera in the room. JA 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The evidence showed that Deputy As-bury proceeded to Sawyer\u2019s home on October 29, 2009, in response to a domestic disturbance call from Sawyer\u2019s girlfriend. Sawyer admitted that before his arrest he had consumed \u201ca couple Klonopin\u201d and \u201ca couple beers.\u201d JA 115-16. While Deputy Asbury was placing Sawyer under arrest, Sawyer attempted to kick Asbury. But, Asbury \u201csaw the kick coming\u201d and avoided it. As a result, Sawyer struck the door of the residence. JA 208.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-15\">After Asbury arrested Sawyer, Asbury put Sawyer into his police vehicle and drove him to the detention center. Both Sawyer and Asbury testified that, during the drive to the detention center, Sawyer was \u201crunning [his] mouth\u201d to Asbury. JA 118 (Sawyer); JA 171 (Asbury). For example, Sawyer told Asbury that Asbury \u201cwas a tough guy because he put his hands on someone while they\u2019re cuffed\u201d; claimed that Sawyer \u201cknew where [Asbury] lived\u201d; stated that Sawyer was \u201cgoing to kick [Asbur/s] ass\u201d; and asked Asbury if \u201che ever wonder[s] what his wife\u2019s doing while he\u2019s out working these late hours.\u201d JA 118-19 (Sawyer); JA 171 (Asbury).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parties agree that Sawyer\u2019s stream of invective continued as Sawyer proceeded into the detention center. They also agree, however, that Sawyer did not engage in any physical misconduct, such as kicking, spitting, rocking the police vehicle, or physically resisting the deputies\u2019 directives.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-16\">As reflected on the video and as described in the trial testimony, the deputies escorted Sawyer, in handcuffs, into the processing room at the detention center. Once inside, Sawyer complied with Sgt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Kearns\u2019 directive to sit on a cement bench attached to the wall. Sawyer was then instructed to stand so that Deputy Asbury could remove his handcuffs. Again, Sawyer complied. Thereafter, Asbury directed Sawyer to face the wall and place his hands on it, so that Asbury could perform a pat-down. Sawyer complied, and Deputy Asbury conducted the pat-down. During these events, Sawyer continued his invective against Asbury, although Asbury conceded that Sawyer\u2019s demeanor was \u201cdiminished\u201d from the hostility he displayed in the police vehicle. JA 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The video shows that, during the pat-down, Sawyer turned his head to look back at Asbury and to speak to him, but kept his hands on the wall. All three deputies characterized Sawyer\u2019s action in turning his head as a \u201ctarget glance,\u201d which the deputies described from their training and experience as a \u201cdanger cue,\u201d indicating (in Sgt. Kearns\u2019 description) that the suspect is \u201clooking back to see the position of the officer, or what the officer might have, or what the officer\u2019s doing in preparation for some kind of an act against the officer.\u201d JA 206; <em>see also </em>JA 229; JA 255. Nevertheless, Sawyer did not take any physically aggressive action toward the deputies. And, despite the \u201ctarget glance,\u201d the deputies did not place Sawyer back in handcuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">After Asbury completed the frisk, Sawyer again sat on the cement bench. JA 176. However, Sawyer crossed his legs and arms, a posture that Asbury and Sgt. Kearns both regarded as \u201cdefiant.\u201d JA 176; JA 229. It is undisputed, and readily apparent from the video, that while Sawyer was seated on the bench and Asbury stood directly in front of him, the two engaged in a heated verbal argument for about thirty seconds. The other deputies observed the events from a distance of a few feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Sawyer and Asbury were gesticulating with their hands, and both admitted that they were using \u201cabrasive\u201d and inappropriate language. JA 179. Asbury claimed that during this exchange he told Sawyer, three times, to stand so that he could be fingerprinted and photographed, but Sawyer did not do so, instead sitting back with his arms and legs crossed. Asbury is seen on the video pointing repeatedly with his right hand at his own left chest, in the area of his badge. The parties agree that around this time, Sawyer stated that he would \u201ctake [Asbury\u2019s] badge off [his] chest and shove it up [his] ass.\u201d JA 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">At this point, the video shows that Deputy Asbury lunged at Sawyer, who was still seated. With his left hand, Asbury grabbed Sawyer\u2019s right arm, which was in mid-gesture. With his right hand, Asbury seized Sawyer by the throat, and forced him back against the wall, pushing back and upward on Sawyer\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Although the video indisputably shows that Asbury seized Sawyer by the neck, Asbury denied placing his hands on Sawyer\u2019s neck. JA 183. Instead, he claimed that he \u201cplaced [his] hand upon [Sawyer\u2019s] chest in the upper chest area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On cross-examination, Asbury acknowledged that he had testified at his deposition that he placed his hand on Sawyer\u2019s \u201cupper chest and throat area.\u201d JA 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Sgt. Kearns and Lt. Massey both testified that Asbury seized Sawyer by the neck. But, they claimed that Asbury was attempting to use \u201cpressure point control tactics\u201d on Sawyer\u2019s neck, and denied that Asbury was \u201cchoking\u201d Sawyer. JA 232 (Kearns); <em>see also </em>JA 259 (Massey). Notably, Asbury did not testify that he attempted to use a pressure point control tactic on Sawyer at any time during the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Sgt. Kearns believed the \u201cpressure point\u201d had \u201cto do with a thumb up along the jawbone by the ear, something in that area.\u201d JA 232. He described the pressure point control tactic as \u201ca pain compliance technique\u201d and stated: \u201c[Wjhen someone has that on you it\u2019s causing pain and you try to get away from it.\u201d JA 232. But, Kearns denied that the purpose of such a technique is to cause pain or injury, explaining: \u201c[Ijt\u2019s in an effort to get them to do what you want them to do. You\u2014 you apply the pressure to cause pain and you must tell them what to do; and when they comply, then you stop.\u201d JA 233. However, he could not recall whether As-bury told Sawyer what to do while applying the pressure point tactic. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The video indicates that, after Asbury lunged at Sawyer and seized him by the throat, Sgt. Kearns and Lt. Massey walked to either side of Asbury and Sawyer. As-bury drew his hand back as if to strike Sawyer, but what he did with his hand is not captured on the video, because the video skips at that point. A moment later, however, the video clearly shows that As-bury drew his fist back a second time and struck Sawyer in the face. Nevertheless, Asbury testified that he \u201cdid not punch Mr. Sawyer,\u201d JA 105, and \u201cdid not strike him.\u201d JA 106. The other two deputies also denied that Asbury hit Sawyer. <em>See </em>JA 245-46 (Kearns); JA 266 (Massey). Lt. Massey testified that he believed that what appears to be a punch on the video was another instance of Asbury attempting to touch a \u201cpressure point\u201d behind Sawyer\u2019s ear. JA 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">According to the video, Asbury then grabbed Sawyer by the neck, and the other two deputies laid hands upon Sawyer\u2019s extremities. Sawyer\u2019s head and body rose higher.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After another moment, Sawyer\u2019s head and body rose above the deputies\u2019 heads. During this entire time, Asbury was holding Sawyer by the throat. Thereafter, the deputies pulled Sawyer to the ground. It is clear from the video, as well as from the testimony of Sawyer and As-bury, that Sawyer\u2019s face did not strike the ground when the deputies pulled him down. <em>See </em>JA 132 (Sawyer); JA 190 (As-bury). Sawyer was face-down and the upper half of his body was behind a corner and hidden from the view of the camera. Deputy Asbury also was not visible to the video camera, although the other deputies, who were grabbing and striking Sawyer in the arms and legs, were visible. The deputies proceeded to restrain Sawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">At trial, Sawyer claimed that Asbury punched him repeatedly in the head while he was on the ground; Asbury denied it. The video cannot resolve the dispute as to that portion of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">The video and the trial testimony showed that, after restraining Sawyer on the ground for several seconds, and placing him in handcuffs, the deputies left Sawyer handcuffed and face down on the ground. As the deputies proceeded to other business, Sawyer remained unattended on the ground for several minutes. Eventually, Sawyer pulled himself to a seated position, reclining against the wall. <em>See </em>JA 136-38; JA 193-94; JA 249-251; JA 273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-15\">Sawyer was bleeding from the nose, <em>see </em>JA 192; JA 273, and at some point he asked to be taken to the hospital. JA 138. Asbury transported Sawyer to the emergency room, where Sawyer was diagnosed with a broken nose, along with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>bruising to his face and extremities. Plaintiffs hospital records and the medical bill were entered into evidence, along with photographs of Sawyer that depicted his injuries. JA 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">At the close of the evidence, Sawyer moved for judgment as a matter of law as to liability, and Asbury moved for a \u201cdirected verdict\u201d on the basis of qualified immunity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b), the district judge reserved ruling on Sawyer\u2019s motion until after the jury returned its verdict. JA 277-78. In denying Asbur/s motion, the district judge said: \u201cI think it is a clearly established constitutional right that a pretrial detainee is not to be subjected to willful, wanton and outrageous punishment in the terms of a punch to the nose. Here the nose is broken.\u201d JA 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of Deputy Asbury. Thereafter, Sawyer renewed his motion for judgment as to liability, which the district court granted. <em>See Sawyer v. Asbury, </em>861 F.Supp.2d 737 (S.D.W.Va.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In his opinion, the trial judge included a link to a portion of the video posted on the district court\u2019s website, <em>see </em>http://www. wvsd.uscourts.gov/videos/, which the judge incorporated by reference in his ruling. The district judge also included in his opinion several still images taken from the video. And, he provided a detailed description of the events depicted on the video, <em>id. </em>at 731M3 (internal citations, images, and footnote omitted), stating, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The officers brought Mr. Sawyer into the processing room.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">Sergeant Kearns asked Mr. Sawyer to sit on a cement bench attached to the wall. Mr. Sawyer sat until Deputy As-bury had him stand while he removed the handcuffs and searched him.... After the pat-down, Mr. Sawyer sat back down.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">While Mr. Sawyer was seated on the bench, the video shows Mr. Sawyer and Deputy Asbury exchanging words and Deputy Asbury motioning upward, as if he was asking Mr. Sawyer to stand back up. Mr. Asbury also patted his chest while facing Mr. Sawyer. During the exchange, Mr. Sawyer remained seated on the bench and his lower back remained against the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">Shortly after patting his chest, Deputy Asbury attacked Mr. Sawyer, violently grabbing him around the throat with his right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">As Deputy Asbury was choking Mr. Sawyer with his right hand, the other officers in the room began to move towards Deputy Asbury. Then Deputy Asbury pulled his arm back. The tape skips and does not show the completed arm movements ]</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">Once the other officers reached Deputy Asbury\u2019s side and began holding Mr. Sawyer, Deputy Asbury pulled his right fist back again. The video clearly shows Deputy Asbury punching Mr. Sawyer in the face, with the force of his blow knocking Mr. Sawyer\u2019s face to the side.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">The officers then took Mr. Sawyer to the floor.... Mr. Sawyer was left on the ground for a period of time until he managed to sit up.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>In granting Sawyer\u2019s renewed motion for judgment as to liability and a new trial as to damages, the district court stated, in relevant part, <em>id. </em>at 738, 745-46 (internal citations and emphasis omitted):</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">[T]he jury did what they thought was right but simply got it wrong ... but that is what judges are for.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The video indisputably captures Deputy Asbury\u2019s excessive use of force on Mr. Sawyer at the Wood County holding center. I have incorporated a part of the videotape that was introduced at trial in this order so that all may see that the jury did not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for Deputy Asbury on the issue of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">While courts are not to simply rubber stamp a jury\u2019s verdict, judges believe that judgment as a matter of law is a power to be applied sparingly and only in the most extraordinary circumstances. No weighing of the evidence or credibility determinations are permitted. I made none.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">What the video shows cannot be reconciled with the jury\u2019s verdict. The video shows Deputy Asbury grabbing the plaintiff by the throat. The video shows Deputy Asbury punching the plaintiff in the face with his fist. The video shows the officers leaving an injured Mr. Sawyer lying on the holding center floor. Mr. Sawyer walked into the holding center uninjured, and he left with a fractured nose and battered face. While Mr. Sawyer\u2019s verbal threats against Deputy Asbury were disgusting, they were still only words, and a pretrial detainee\u2019s words do not justify an officer\u2019s use of such force.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">I find that no reasonable jury was at liberty to disregard the video evidence showing Deputy Asbury choking and punching Mr. Sawyer for no purpose other than inflicting unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering. I find that Deputy Asbury thereby violated Mr. Sawyer\u2019s right under the Due Process Clause to be free from excessive force while in pretrial detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">On August 22, 2012, the district court entered a \u201cJudgment Order\u201d in accordance with the parties\u2019 request.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of Sawyer\u2019s Rule 50 motion, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Deputy Asbury as the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. <em>Buckley v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 306, 321 (4th Cir.2008). The reviewing court \u201cmay not make credibility determinations or substitute [its] judgment for that of the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Kivanc, </em>714 F.3d 782, 795 (4th Cir.2013). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>\u201cWe must affirm if a reasonable jury could only rule in favor of [Sawyer]; if reasonable minds could differ, we must reverse.\u201d <em>A Helping Hand, LLC v. Balt. Cnty., Md., </em>515 F.3d 356, 365 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Sawyer brought his excessive force claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. It establishes a cause of action against any person who, acting under color of state law, \u201csubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Section 1983 \u201c \u2018is not itself a source of substantive rights,\u2019 but merely provides \u2018a method for vindicating federal rights elsewhere conferred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Albright v. Oliver, </em>510 U.S. 266, 271, 114 S.Ct. 807, 127 L.Ed.2d 114 (1994) (quoting <em>Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 144 n. 3, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979)). Thus, \u201canalysis of an excessive force claim brought under \u00a7 1983 begins with \u2018identifying the specific constitutional right allegedly infringed by the challenged application of force.\u2019 \u201d <em>Orem v. Rephann, </em>523 F.3d 442, 445 (4th Cir. 2008) (quoting <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 394, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In <em>Graham, </em>the touchstone case with respect to excessive force claims under \u00a7 1983, the Supreme Court rejected the notion \u201cthat all excessive force claims brought under \u00a7 1983 are governed by a single generic standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, 109 S.Ct. 1865. The Court held that claims for the use of excessive force in effectuating an arrest or other seizure are governed by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against \u201cunreasonable\u201d seizures; claims of excessive force against a convicted prisoner are governed by the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d; and claims of post-arrest excessive force against an arrestee or pretrial detainee, as here, are governed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits before conviction \u201cthe use of excessive force that amounts to punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395 &amp; n. 10, 109 S.Ct. 1865. <em>Accord Orem, </em>523 F.3d at 446; <em>Taylor v. McDuffie, </em>155 F.3d 479, 483 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Under the Fourteenth Amendment standard, a plaintiff must show that the defendant \u201c\u2018inflicted unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering\u2019 upon the detainee.\u201d <em>Carr v. Deeds, </em>453 F.3d 593, 605 (4th Cir.2006) (citations and some internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c \u2018The proper inquiry is whether the force applied was in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Taylor, </em>155 F.3d at 483) (internal quotation marks omitted in <em>Carr).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Moreover, no particular extent of physical injury is required to establish an excessive force claim under the Eighth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment. In <em>Wilkins v. Gaddy, </em>559 U.S. 34, 130 S.Ct. 1175, 175 L.Ed.2d 995 (2010), involving an excessive force claim brought by a convicted prisoner under the Eighth Amendment, the Supreme Court abrogated a requirement to prove more than a de minimis injury, which the Fourth Circuit previously had applied in excessive force cases. <em>Id. </em>at 39, 130 S.Ct. 1175. <em>See, e.g., Taylor, </em>155 F.3d at 483; <em>see also Orem, </em>523 F.3d at 447-48; <em>Carr, </em>453 F.3d at 605-06; <em>Riley v. Dorton, </em>115 F.3d 1159, 1166 (4th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1030, 118 S.Ct. 631, 139 L.Ed.2d 611 (1997).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>In applying these principles to the facts, we must determine whether, in the light most favorable to Asbury, the district judge correctly concluded that Asbury used excessive force. The lens of the video camera played a key role in the district court\u2019s decision, as it does here. The video clearly shows that, at least once, Asbury struck Sawyer in the face while two deputies began to hold him. Under binding Supreme Court precedent, the video recording of the incident operated as a legal constraint on the fact finding of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007), the Supreme Court held that, when \u201copposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted\u201d by video evidence contained in the record, \u201cso that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380, 127 S.Ct. 1769. Rather than relying on \u201cvisible fiction\u201d propounded by the party whose account is contradicted by the video evidence, a court should \u201cview[ ] the facts in the light depicted by the videotape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 127 S.Ct. 1769.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">As we explained in <em>Witt v. West Virginia State Police, Troop 2, </em>633 F.3d 272 (4th Cir.2011), the principle articulated in <em>Scott </em>does not license a court to reject one side\u2019s account as a matter of law if the \u201cdocumentary evidence, such as a video,\u201d merely \u201coffers <em>some </em>support for [the other side\u2019s] version of events.\u201d <em>Witt, </em>633 F.3d at 276 (emphasis in original). Rather, the video controls only where it \u201c \u2018blatantly contradicts]\u2019 \u201d one side\u2019s testimonial account. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Scott, </em>550 U.S. at 380, 127 S.Ct. 1769). Nevertheless, \u201c[i]ncontrovertible evidence relied on by the moving party, such as a relevant videotape whose accuracy is unchallenged, should be credited by the court\u201d when resolving a motion for judgment as a matter of law, \u201cif it so utterly discredits the opposing party\u2019s version that no reasonable juror could fail to believe the version advanced by the moving party.\u201d <em>Zellner v.

Rephann, supra, </em>523 F.3d 442, while police officers were transporting a handcuffed arrestee to jail, the arrestee \u201cyelled, cursed and banged her head against the police car window.... Her jumping and banging around in the back of the vehicle was so intense that the vehicle rocked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An officer opened the door of the vehicle and repeatedly instructed the arrestee to \u201c \u2018calm down\u2019 \u201d and to \u201c \u2018[sjtop it,\u2019 \u201d and admonished the arrestee \u201cto respect\u201d the officers. <em>Id. </em>The arrestee directed profanity at the officer, who stated, \u201c \u2018I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019d better stop it,\u2019 \u201d and then \u201cshocked [the arrestee] twice with a taser gun \u2014 underneath her left breast and on her inner thigh.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445. At the time, the arrestee was in handcuffs and foot restraints. <em>Id. </em>at 443. The district court denied summary judgment to the officer on the arrestee\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment excessive force claim, and we affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">This Court rejected the officer\u2019s claim that \u201chis use of the taser gun was not excessive because [the arrestee] was unruly and uncooperative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446. Although we acknowledged that \u201csome action was necessary to calm [the arrestee] and safely transport her,\u201d we concluded that, in the light most favorable to the arrestee, the officer\u2019s \u201cactions were not a \u2018good faith effort to restore order\u2019 but, rather, wanton and unnecessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This conclusion was based on several factors, including that the arrestee \u201cwas handcuffed, weighed about 100 pounds, ... and was locked in the back seat cage of [a police] car,\u201d; that the officer tasered the arrestee immediately after she used profanity toward him; that the officer applied the taser to sensitive body areas; and, \u201cafter shocking\u201d the arrestee, the officer \u201ccommanded that she respect the officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\"><em>United States v. Cobb, </em>905 F.2d 784 (4th Cir.1990), is also instructive. There, four law enforcement officers were criminally prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242 (\u201cthe criminal analog of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 788 n. 6), for their use of excessive force against a detainee who was being held in a booking room after his arrest for public intoxication. <em>Id. </em>at 785. The detainee \u201cand the officers exchanged insults and a heated argument ensued.\u201d The officers \u201cproceeded to beat [the detainee] for almost two hours, insulting and ridiculing him the entire time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The arrestee \u201cremained handcuffed throughout the attack. At no point did he attempt to strike any of the officers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">We upheld the convictions of three officers for use of excessive force, in violation of the detainee\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment rights. In doing so, we approved as \u201cfairly staffing] the controlling law,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 789-90, the trial court\u2019s jury instructions, which stated, in pertinent part, <em>id. </em>at 787:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">A law enforcement officer is justified in the use of any force which he reasonably believes to be necessary to effect arrest or hold someone in custody and of any force which he reasonably believes to be necessary to defend himself or another from bodily harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">Provocation by mere insulting or threatening words will not excuse a physical assault by a law enforcement officer. Mere words, without more, do not constitute provocation or aggression on the part of the person saying those words. No law enforcement officer is entitled to use force against someone based on that person\u2019s verbal statements alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Of import here, we said: \u201cThe trial court was entirely correct that words alone do not justify the excessive use of force against a pretrial detainee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 789. Accordingly, we rejected the officers\u2019 contention that \u201cmere words by a pretrial detainee can justify the use of physical force by a police officer.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Perhaps the most factually apposite of our prior cases is <em>Jones v. Buchanan, </em>325 F.3d 520 (4th Cir.2003). In that case, a handcuffed detainee in a processing room at a jail exchanged \u201c\u2018pretty foul language\u2019 \u201d with a deputy, who then knocked the detainee to the floor, jumped on him, and crushed his nose. <em>Id. </em>at 524.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We reversed the district court\u2019s grant of qualified immunity to the deputy, stating, <em>id. </em>at 530 (citation omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">To be sure, when Deputy Keller knocked Jones to the floor and injured him, Jones concedes that he was drunk, angry, and using foul language. However, mere use of foul language, even a drunk\u2019s loud use of such language in a police station, does not justify an objectively reasonable police officer knocking the drunk down, jumping on him, and breaking his nose.... [A] drunken plaintiffs \u2018screaming\u2019 and use of \u2018foul language\u2019 in a confined area ... constitutes a mere \u2018nuisance\u2019 and not an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">We also noted that testimony that the officer had \u201chit Jones \u2018with his fist\u2019 \u201d provided further \u201cevidentiary support for Jones\u2019s contention that the level of force was excessive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530 n. 6. And, we stated: \u201cDeputy Keller also cannot justify his actions based on Jones\u2019s slight physical movement \u2014 simply beginning to stand up,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 530 (emphasis omitted), where the detainee \u201cnever pushed, kicked, or threatened anyone.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\"><em>Orem, Cobb, </em>and <em>Jones </em>stand in marked contrast to <em>Grayson v. Peed, </em>195 F.3d 692 (4th Cir.1999), in which we rejected a claim of use of excessive force against a pretrial detainee. In <em>Gmyson, </em>officers arrested a man for possession of marijuana and PCP after he was discovered with those substances while on the floor of a mall restroom stating, \u201cI love everyone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694. The man resisted arrest. <em>Id. </em>He was transported to a detention center where, after being strip searched, he attempted to escape his cell, causing a \u201cstruggle\u201d to ensue with officers, who subdued the detainee with pepper spray. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">The next morning, the detainee \u201cwas again acting belligerently,\u201d sticking his arm through the food slot of his cell. <em>Id. </em>When one of the officers opened the door of the detainee\u2019s cell in an attempt to get the detainee to put his arm back, the detainee jammed his own foot in the doorway of the cell. A \u201cfive-man cell extraction team ... pinned [the detainee] face down. During the course of the struggle [the detainee] was punched seven to nine times.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The detainee \u201ccontinued to act violently\u201d until the officers \u201cplaced him in four-point restraints.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A few minutes later, the detainee lost consciousness. <em>Id. </em>Although medics checked the detainee\u2019s pulse on two occasions and observed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>\u201che was okay,\u201d the detainee suddenly ceased breathing. <em>Id. </em>Attempts at CPR were unsuccessful and the detainee died. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In the \u00a7 1988 suit that followed, brought on behalf of the detainee\u2019s estate, we affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the officers. In light of the detainee\u2019s physical resistance and attempts to escape his cell, we ruled that the officers\u2019 \u201crestraining measures were necessary to subdue\u201d the detainee. <em>Id. </em>at 696. Therefore, we determined that the \u201cforce applied by [the] officers was \u2018in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline,\u2019 and did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Unlike <em>Grayson, </em>in this case the video clearly reveals that Sawyer did not attempt any violent, unruly, or evasive act before Deputy Asbury hit him in the face. As in <em>Orem, Ccvrr, </em>and <em>Jones, </em>the officer\u2019s assault here was provoked by the detainee\u2019s verbal tirade and/or his intransigence and failure to heed instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">To be sure, the detainees in <em>Orem, </em>Can* and <em>Jones </em>were all in handcuffs when they were assaulted by officers, whereas in this case, Sawyer was not handcuffed when Asbury struck him. This distinction is not determinative, however. We did not state in <em>Orem, </em>Can\", or <em>Jones </em>that the officer\u2019s use of force was excessive because the detainee was in handcuffs. Nor did we suggest that, but for the handcuffs, the force would not have been excessive. Rather, as we reasoned in <em>Jones, </em>the handcuffs were significant because, \u201cif [the detainee] was handcuffed behind his back,\u201d it was \u201chard to see how he would pose an immediate threat to anyone.\u201d 325 F.3d at 529. In this case, the video dispels any need to speculate as to whether Sawyer posed an immediate threat to the officers: it shows that Deputy Asbury, rather than Sawyer, was the aggressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">We recognize that \u201cthe agents of the state are permitted to exercise a certain degree of force in order to protect the interests of society.\u201d <em>Justice v. Dennis, </em>834 F.2d 380, 382 (4th Cir.1987) (en banc), <em>vac\u2019d on other grounds, </em>490 U.S. 1087, 109 S.Ct. 2461, 104 L.Ed.2d 982 (1989). In the Fourteenth Amendment context, an officer may use the force needed in a \u201c \u2018good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline,\u201d\u2019 but the officer may not use force \u201c \u2018maliciously or sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carr, </em>453 F.3d at 605 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">In the light most favorable to Asbury, he was faced with a detainee who was verbally defiant and uncooperative in response to Asbury\u2019s lawful order to stand, and Asbury resorted to \u201cpressure point control tactics\u201d to obtain compliance. Even if the jury credited the testimony of Kearns and Massey, to the effect that As-bury was using \u201cpressure point control tactics\u201d when he seized Sawyer by the neck, and even if the use of such \u201cpressure point control tactics\u201d was not excessive under the circumstances, that did not end the parties\u2019 contact. Asbury then proceeded to strike Sawyer in the face, just as the other deputies had begun to restrain Sawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Sawyer\u2019s failure to comply with Asbury\u2019s order to stand did not justify Asbury in striking Sawyer in the face. A detainee\u2019s refusal to comply with an officer\u2019s lawful order, without more, is not a license to \u201ctake the gloves off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">Moreover, Asbury knew that Sawyer was unarmed, as he had just frisked Sawyer. Nor did the deputies\u2019 testimony that Sawyer engaged in \u201ctarget glances\u201d during the pat down support Asbury\u2019s decision to strike Sawyer. It is plain that, if the \u201ctarget glances\u201d had actually caused any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>the deputies to be concerned that Sawyer was about to become violent, they would not have removed Sawyer\u2019s handcuffs or would have put him back in handcuffs at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">In sum, under the facts of this case, Asbur/s deployment of a blow to the head of Sawyer, a detainee, in response to mere insulting words and noncomplianee with the deputy\u2019s orders, was excessive. Such conduct did not constitute a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline. The district court understood the import of the video evidence, which indisputably shows that Deputy Asbury used force that was excessive under the circumstances. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting Sawyer\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The district court also determined that Deputy Asbury was not entitled to qualified immunity, and Asbury challenges that ruling on appeal. We review de novo the court\u2019s denial of motion for judgment. <em>Randall v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>302 F.3d 188, 201 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">\u201cThe doctrine of qualified immunity protects police officers and public officials from claims of constitutional violations \u2018for reasonable mistakes as to the legality of their actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Merchant v.

And, the \u201c \u2018nonexistence of a case holding the defendant\u2019s identical conduct to be unlawful does not prevent denial of qualified immunity,\u2019 \u201d because \u201c \u2018qualified immunity was never intended to relieve government officials from the responsibility of applying familiar legal principles to new situations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson v.

Therefore, at the time of the underlying events, the de minimis injury standard was part of the clearly established law of this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Nevertheless, that standard was readily satisfied here. Under clearly established law in October 2009, a broken nose was well within the range of injuries considered more than de minimis. <em>Compare Orem, </em>523 F.3d at 447-48 (holding \u201celectric shock, pain,\u201d and \u201csunburn-like scar\u201d from taser application more than de minimis); <em>Young v.

Nevertheless, qualified immunity does not protect an officer \u201c \u2018who knowingly violate[s] the law,\u2019 \u201d <em>Hunter v.

In evaluating whether the unlawfulness of an officer\u2019s use of a taser was clearly established from the perspective of a hypothetical \u201creasonable officer,\u201d the <em>Orem </em>Court said: \u201c[W]e need not use hindsight or conjure up a pseudo-'reasonable officer\u2019 because, two other presumably \u2018reasonable officers\u2019 were at the scene.\u201d <em>Orem, </em>523 F.3d at 448. We noted that the other officers on the scene never attempted to use a taser or physical force to subdue the arrestee.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">In this case, the video shows that, when Asbury lunged at Sawyer and seized him by the neck, two other officers were standing several feet away, and neither reacted in such a way as to suggest that Sawyer had suddenly exhibited threatening or volatile behavior. Indeed, the other deputies stood still for two seconds as Asbury seized Sawyer by the neck, and then they walked without urgency to Sawyer and grabbed him, just as Asbury struck Sawyer in the face. The conduct of the two deputies is a powerful indicator that a need to deploy violent force was not apparent to a reasonable officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Our substantive analysis of Deputy As-bury\u2019s conduct in striking Sawyer in the face is drawn entirely from pre-2009 case law and does not involve any novel extension of precedent. It was clearly established in October 2009 that \u201cwords alone do not justify the excessive use of force against a pretrial detainee.\u201d <em>Cobb, supra, </em>905 F.2d at 789. Our precedent made it clear to any reasonable officer that \u201cmere use of foul language ... does not justify an objectively reasonable police officer knocking [an arrestee] down, jumping on him, and breaking his nose.\u201d <em>Jones, supra, </em>325 F.3d at 530. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s rejection of Deputy Asbury\u2019s qualified immunity defense was legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-12\">. The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 &amp; 1367(a). Our jurisdiction is founded on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-20\">. Sawyer also sued Asbury's employer, the Wood County Commission, but the district court granted summary judgment in its favor. That ruling is not contested on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\">. On appeal, Deputy Asbury challenges the summary judgment ruling as to the Fourteenth Amendment claim to the extent that the district court denied him qualified immunity. However, a party may not \"appeal an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on the merits!.]\u201d <em>Ortiz v. Jordan, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 884, 889, 178 L.Ed.2d 703 (2011). Accordingly, our review concerning qualified immunity is limited to the district court\u2019s rulings during trial. In undertaking this review, we look to \" 'the trial record, not the pleadings nor the summary judgment record.' \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b309-11\">. At the outset of trial, the district court gave the jury the following stipulated instruction regarding the video, JAI 11:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-17\">[T]he video recording you are about to see is from a security camera that is motion-activated. As a result, the video will skip slightly and the playback will pause or be slower than real-time in parts. The security camera does not record audio, so that is not available to us.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b309-18\">. Based on Sawyer\u2019s conduct during the arrest, he was prosecuted in West Virginia state court on charges of assaulting a police officer and pleaded guilty to that offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b309-19\">. Sawyer did not know Asbury\u2019s marital status. JA119. In fact, Asbury was unmarried. JA209.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b311-8\">. Sawyer testified that, at this point, he was \"trying to keep [his] tippytoes down to take the pressure off\u201d of his neck. JA 128. It is not possible to discern from the video how much of Sawyer's upward movement was due to the deputies pushing Sawyer upward, as opposed to Sawyer\u2019s attempt to find a foothold on the floor to alleviate the pressure on his throat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\">. Deputy Asbury also moved for a \"directed verdict\u201d on the same grounds at the close of plaintiff's case. JA 220-22. Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 was revised in 1991 to change the nomenclature of \"directed verdict\u201d to \"judgment as a matter of law.\u201d However, the amendment did not \"alter the substantive content of the standard.\u201d Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, 9B Federal Practice <em>&amp; </em>Procedure \u00a7 2521, at 223 (3d ed. 2008, 2013 Supp.) (indicating that a motion for directed verdict is synonymous with a motion for judgment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b313-10\">. Initially, Deputy Asbury filed a motion asking the district court to enter partial final judgment, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), so that he could take an immediate appeal from the district court's liability ruling. Although the district court denied that motion, Asbury noted an appeal, docketed in this Court as <em>Sawyer v. Asbury, </em>No. 12-1775. Thereafter, Asbury dismissed that appeal, and instead filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition, asking this Court to direct the district court to reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict and cancel the new trial as to damages. <em>See In re: Asbury, </em>No. 12-1878. We denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-17\">The parties jointly moved for entry of a final judgment in favor of Sawyer in the stipulated amount of one dollar, and advised the district court that they \"had reached a side agreement concerning damages that is a high low agreement.\u201d JA 325. Accordingly, the district court awarded Sawyer nominal damages, noting that a \"live controversy still exists between the parties regarding the defendant\u2019s liability.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\">. Prior to <em>Wilkins, </em>we had required plaintiffs in excessive force cases under either the Eighth or Fourteenth amendments to establish that the defendant inflicted upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>plaintiff \" \u2018more than <em>de minimis </em>\u2019 \u201d injury, or alternatively, inflicted either force of \" 'a sort repugnant to the conscience of mankind\u2019 \" or pain of a nature such that the \" \u2018pain itself ... can properly be said to constitute more than <em>de minimis </em>injury.' \u201d <em>Taylor, </em>155 F.3d at 483 (quoting <em>Norman v.

Although <em>Wilkins </em>was an Eighth Amendment case, the Supreme Court also disapproved the de minimis injury standard under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Wilkins, </em>559 U.S. at 38-39, 130 S.Ct. 1175 (overruling <em>Riley </em>(Fourteenth Amendment), <em>Taylor </em>(Fourteenth Amendment), and <em>Norman </em>(Eighth Amendment)). In the wake of <em>Wilkins, </em>the trial judge correctly recognized that the de minimis injuiy standard is no longer applicable in either Eighth Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment cases. <em>See </em>JA 222 (\"The Supreme Court has overruled the Fourth Circuit on that issue. There is no doubt anymore about that.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b315-11\">. Although <em>Scott </em>and <em>Witt </em>concerned motions for summary judgment, \"the standard for granting summary judgment 'mirrors' the standard for judgment as a matter of law, such that 'the inquiry under each is the same.' \u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing, </em>530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (quoting <em>Anderson v.

In light of this conclusion, we do not resolve whether Asbury was justified in his alleged use of a \"pressure point control tactic\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>(i.e., seizing Sawyer by the neck) to secure Sawyer\u2019s compliance with his directives.
