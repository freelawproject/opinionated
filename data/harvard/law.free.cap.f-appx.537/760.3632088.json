Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-22\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that He did not establish his conduct constituted \u201cother resistance\u201d to China\u2019s population control program. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); <em>cf. Jiang v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 1086, 1094-95 (9th Cir.2010). Further, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that He did not demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003) (possibility of future persecution too speculative). Accordingly, He\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-23\">Because He failed to meet the lower standard of proof for asylum, his claim for withholding of removal necessarily fails. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-24\">We lack jurisdiction to review He\u2019s contentions regarding a pattern or practice of persecution against people who resist China\u2019s family planning policies, whether such people are a disfavored group, the universal household registration system, and relief under the Convention Against Torture, because he failed to raise them to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b776-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
