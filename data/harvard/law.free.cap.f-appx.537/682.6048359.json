The immigration judge and the Board provided \u201cspecific cogent reason[s]\u201d for the adverse credibility finding, and Chen has failed to demonstrate that \u201cany reasonable factfinder would necessarily conclude that [she] is eligible for relief from deportation.\u201d <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042-43 (9th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">Chen claims that counsel at her removal hearing provided ineffective assistance. Chen has not raised the issue before the Board, <em>see Martinez-Zelaya v. INS, </em>841 F.2d 294, 296 (9th Cir.1988), nor has she complied with the procedural requirements established by the Board in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance is not \u201cobvious and undisputed on the face of the record,\u201d therefore compliance with <em>Matter of Lozada\u2019s </em>procedural requirements is not excused. <em>See Reyes v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 592, 596-97 (9th Cir.2004). Even if we reach the merits of the argument, Chen does not explain what additional information her attorney could have elicited that could be expected to have made a difference, so she has failed to demonstrate that her representation at the hearing was \u201cso inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Ray v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 582, 587 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">Petition DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b699-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
