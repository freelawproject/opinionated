On appeal, Bell argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court based the upward variance on conduct comprising the essential elements of misprision of a felony. He contends that the court wrongly understood the misprision of a felony statute to require only that a person fail to report a felony to authorities, instead of the correct reading of the statute: the correct reading also requires that the defendant conceal or participate in the underlying felony. Thus, Bell argues, his conduct participating in the underlying felonies merely constituted essential elements of the offense and could not be used to vary upward.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">We review all sentences for reasonableness under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the sentence carries the burden to demonstrate that it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). When a sentencing argument is raised for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d 1233, 1238 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-14\">\u201cWhoever, having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony cognizable by a court of the United States, conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the same to [authorities], shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4. \u201cMisprision of a felony \u2018requires both knowledge of a crime and some affirmative act of concealment or participation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Itani v. Ashcroft, 298 </em>F.3d 1213, 1216 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>I. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">In determining reasonableness, we must determine whether the district court committed a \u201csignificant procedural error\u201d by \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">As an initial matter, because Bell did not object before the district court that the court erred in treating conduct that comprised the elements of the offense as aggravating factors, we review his argument for plain error. <em>See Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d at 1238. Although Bell is correct that misprision of a felony requires an affirmative act of concealment or participation in the underlying felony, no evidence suggests that the district court misunderstood the required elements of the offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4; <em>Itani, </em>298 F.3d at 1216. Never did the court say or distinctly indicate (as Bell suggests it did) that the simple failure to report a felony was the <em>only </em>element of the offense. Thus, Bell has not carried his burden of showing that the district court did not understand the elements of the offense and committed procedural error, based on a misinterpretation of the criminal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">II. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">The district court is required to impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from future criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(C). A district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, and the applicable guideline range. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(3)-(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">We will not remand for resentencing unless \u201cthe district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). Imposition of a sentence well below the statutory maximum is an indication of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (considering that defendant\u2019s sentence was well below the statutory maximum in finding the sentence reasonable). A sentence may be substantively unreasonable if it is based on an impermissible factor. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191-92. But \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">Extraordinary justification or rigid mathematical formulas are not required for a sentence outside the guidelines range, but the district court should explain why the variance is appropriate in a particular case and the justification for the variance must be \u201csufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47, 50, 128 S.Ct. at 595, 597. We must give deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the extent of the variance. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>In imposing an upward variance, the district court may consider information about a defendant\u2019s \u201cbackground, character, and conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1379 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661 (\u201cNo limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Because Bell argued before the district court that his sentence unreasonably exceeded the guideline range, his substantive reasonableness argument has been preserved. Nevertheless, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the above-guideline, 18-month sentence. <em>See Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 41, 128 S.Ct. at 591. The record shows that the district court considered Bell\u2019s advisory guideline range, but determined that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors required a greater sentence. The court properly considered that Bell arranged and was present during the sale of stolen items, and that he accompanied co-conspirator Robert Kier to a home that Kier had burglarized: this information was relevant to Bell\u2019s background, character, and conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661; <em>Tome, </em>611 F.3d at 1379. Thus, because the court was permitted to consider Bell\u2019s conduct in imposing the sentence, it did not base its sentence on an impermissible factor. <em>See Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191-92. Furthermore, the court adequately explained its reasons \u2014 chiefly, more than minimally significant criminal participation \u2014 for the variance, and the justification for the variance was sufficiently compelling to support it. <em>See Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597. To the extent that Bell urges us to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to place greater emphasis on his mitigating factors, we will not do so. <em>See Langston, </em>590 F.3d at 1237. Finally, Bell\u2019s 18-month sentence fell well below his 3-year statutory maximum sentence, another indicator of reasonableness. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">In sum, Bell has not shown that his sentence was procedurally or substantively unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
