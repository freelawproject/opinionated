Per 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a), the SSA was required \u201cwithin 20 days after\u201d receiving the request to (1) determine \u201cwhether to comply with [the] request\u201d and (2) \u201cimmediately notify [Havemann] of [its] determination and the reasons therefor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i). The SSA sent Havemann six letters, dated March 16 and 17, 2010, acknowledging receipt of his requests and inviting him to inquire regarding their status if he did not hear from them in thirty days. On June 8, 2010, Havemann filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, (1) alleging that the SSA had failed to comply with the deadlines imposed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A) and (2) seeking \u201cinjunctive relief compelling the release and disclosure of the requested agency records.\u201d The SSA then provided the following notifications to Havemann regarding its disclosure determinations: On August 13, 2010, it sent Havemann a letter denying Requests I, II, and IV, and partially denying Request III; on September 10, 2010, it sent a letter asking for clarification regarding Request V; and on September 13, 2010, it sent a letter communicating that it would partially grant Request VI. Later it reversed some of these determinations, but ultimately, as detailed below, it complied only partially with Havemann\u2019s requests. As to the information that it withheld, it moved for summary judgment, maintaining that \u201cfurther disclosure would constitute a \u2018clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u2019 under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6).\u201d <em>Havemann v. Astrue, </em>No. 10-1498, 2012 WL 4378143, at *1 (D.Md. Sept. 24, 2012).

According to Cooley, Havemann\u2019s story (or stories) \u201cwill take an in-depth look at the workings inside the SSA and, to a lesser degree, the [Veteran\u2019s Administration (VA) ], as to their administration of certain of their benefit programs, and the relevant inter-agency interactions.\u201d This appeal involves three of Havemann\u2019s six requests \u2014 Requests I, II, and V.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-15\">In Request I, Havemann sought information regarding married couples \u201cwhere <em>both </em>members ... were applying for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>and/or receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits as an \u2018aged, blind or disabled individual with an eligible spouse\u2019 and where such benefits were denied or subsequently stopped because the couple also received a pension from the Department of Veterans Affairs.\u201d Said differently, Havemann sought records with the following three characteristics:</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u2022 The latest \u201ctype of master record\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is \u201caged, blind or disabled individual with eligible spouse\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u2022 The record shows a denial of SSI for excess income in 1990 or later, or shows that the individual and spouse had been receiving SSI that was stopped in 1990 or later, due to excess income;</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">FOIA Request I (Veteran Couple Request)</p>\n<p id=\"A_v\">Data Requested Data Released</p>\n<p id=\"AQh\">Social Security Number (SSN) or alternative identifier Alternative Identifier</p>\n<p id=\"AFW\">Current or last shown \u201cMaster Record\u201d Yes</p>\n<p id=\"A2Z\">Full Name No</p>\n<p id=\"At5\">Address with 9-digit zip code No (only initial 5 digits of zip code released)</p>\n<p id=\"A_D\">SSI application date No</p>\n<p id=\"Ajq\">Code for most recent state and county of residence No (only state code released)</p>\n<p id=\"AAi\">Current SSI status Yes</p>\n<p id=\"Af7\">Reason for SSI denial Yes</p>\n<p id=\"A3I\">Denial Date Yes</p>\n<p id=\"Ahp\">Date of status change due to excess income Yes</p>\n<p id=\"AK7\">Disability Payment Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Yes</p>\n<p id=\"AL1\">Ledger Account File (LAF) Code<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Yes</p>\n<p id=\"ANY\">Date of Birth No (only year released)</p>\n<p id=\"A-x\">Earned Income Yes</p>\n<p id=\"Aly\">Unearned Income Yes</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u2022 The record shows that one or both members of the couple received, or began receiving, a VA benefit (pension or compensation) based on need.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Havemann\u2019s purpose for this request is to \u201cshed light on the SSA\u2019s handling of a regulatory policy concerning war veterans and their spouses who receive a VA pension ... and also file for SSI benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The SSA released some of the information requested. Below, we delineate the requested versus released information in the same manner as the district court.

Trs. of the Univ. of N.C.-Wilmington, </em>640 F.3d 550, 556 (4th Cir.2011), where FOIA is involved, our review is limited to determining \u201c(1) [whether] the district court had an adequate factual basis for the decision rendered and (2) whether upon this basis the decision reached is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Spannaus v. Dept. of Justice, </em>813 F.2d 1285, 1288 (4th Cir.1987) (quoting <em>Willard v. Internal Revenue Serv., </em>776 F.2d 100, 104 (4th Cir.1985)) (collecting cases) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-14\">FOIA was enacted in 1967 as a means of \u201cfacilitating public access to [g]overnment documents.\u201d Its predecessor, Section 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002 (1964), ostensibly existed for the same purpose but, as time passed, was viewed \u201cmore as a withholding statute than a disclosure statute.\u201d <em>Dept. of Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 360, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976) (quoting <em>EPA v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 79, 93 S.Ct. 827, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cCongress therefore structured a revision whose basic purpose reflected \u2018a general philosophy of full agency disclosure unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360-61, 96 S.Ct. 1592 (quoting S.Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong. 1st Sess., 3 (1965)). But Congress\u2019s desire \u201cto pierce the veil of administrative secrecy and to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 361, 96 S.Ct. 1592 (quoting <em>Rose v. Dept. of Air Force, </em>495 F.2d 261, 263 (2d Cir.1974)) (internal quotation marks omitted), did not produce a statute that provides unfettered access to agency records. Rather, in its current form, FOIA reflects Congress\u2019s intent that the public\u2019s right to information be balanced against other competing interests. At issue here is the competing interest of privacy: Per 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) (Exemption 6), an agency can refuse to disclose \u201cpersonnel and medical flies and similar flies the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-15\">The parties do not dispute that Exemption 6 applies to the data at issue here. <em>See U.S. Dept. of State v. Wash. Post Co., </em>456 U.S. 595, 602, 102 S.Ct. 1957, 72 L.Ed.2d 358 (1982) (\u201c[W]e do not think that Congress meant to limit Exemption 6 to a narrow class of files containing only a discrete kind of personal information. Rather \u2018[t]he exemption [was] intended to cover detailed [g]overnment records on an individual which can be identified as applying to that individual.\u2019 \u201d) (second and third alterations in original) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 1497 (1966), <em>reprinted in </em>1966 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2428). Accordingly, we determine whether disclosing this data would \u201cconstitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6); <em>see also Core v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>730 F.2d 946, 947 (4th Cir.1984) (\u201cIf the files fall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u25a0within th[e] definition [of similar files,] the remaining issue is whether disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d). Making \u201c[t]his determination requires \u2018a balancing of interest between the protection of an individual\u2019s private affairs from unnecessary public scrutiny, and the preservation of the public\u2019s right to government information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 948 (quoting S.Rep. No. 813).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">We think it obvious that the beneficiaries implicated by Havemann\u2019s requests have a privacy interest in the information that the SSA has collected about them. Individuals have a right to control dissemination of information about their person, even if that \u201cinformation may [already] be available to the public in some form.\u201d <em>U.S. Dept. of Defense v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., </em>510 U.S. 487, 500, 114 S.Ct. 1006, 127 L.Ed.2d 325 (1994); <em>see also U.S. Dept. of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press, </em>489 U.S. 749, 763-64, 109 S.Ct. 1468, 103 L.Ed.2d 774 (1989) (recognizing that the concept of privacy \u201cencompass[es] the individual\u2019s control of information concerning his or her person\u201d and that \u201cscattered disclosure of ... bits of information\u201d is different than wholesale dissemination of individuals\u2019 profiles that are compiled by the government and not otherwise \u201cfreely available\u201d to the public). The more pressing question is whether release of the withheld data would enable identification of specific individuals and thus compromise beneficiaries\u2019 privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Specific individuals obviously are identifiable through data that is exclusive to their person, such as a name, address, or social security number. Such data is termed a \u201cunique identifier.\u201d At issue here are elements of data that are not unique identifiers, but that, according to the SSA, function as unique identifiers because they can be combined with other available information to identify specific individuals. The district court agreed with the SSA\u2019s categorization of this data and its decision to deny disclosure because of the possibility that the data could be used to single out certain beneficiaries. We find the district court\u2019s decision sound. The record provided to this Court demonstrates that the SSA thoroughly analyzed and demonstrated the methods through which the withheld data could lead to the identification of specific individuals. The district court relied on the SSA\u2019s analysis, and we can ascertain no reason why it should not have done so. Moreover, Havemann\u2019s arguments to the contrary fall short because they focus on whether singular pieces of withheld data <em>(e.g., </em>month and day of birth, SSI application date, etc.) could lead to the identification of individuals rather than on whether those pieces of data working in combination with other information could assist in such identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Havemann faults the SSA\u2019s rationale for withholding this data, charging that it is speculative: \u201c[T]he Agency withheld the date of birth from disclosure based on the premise that personal information <em>could lead </em>to identification of a living individual. However[,] the cases dealing with this issue hold that possibility of identification is not a sound bas[is] for nondisclosure.\u201d But Havemann\u2019s argument lacks merit. It is true that an agency cannot withhold information based on a \u201cmere possibility]\u201d that an individual\u2019s privacy will be invaded. <em>See Department of Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 378, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976) (\u201cThe legislative history is clear that Exemption 6 was directed at threats to privacy interest more palpable than mere possibilities.\u201d). But it can withhold data if it demonstrates a likelihood that releasing the information would connect private rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ords to specific individuals. <em>See Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Retired Fed. Emp. v. Horner, </em>879 F.2d 873, 878 (D.C.Cir.1989) (\u201cWhere there is a substantial probability that disclosure will cause an interference with personal privacy, it matters not that there may be two or three links in the causal chain. The concern ... is not ... with the number of steps that must be taken to get to the threatened effect; rather, [it is on] the likelihood that the effect will ever come to pass\u201d). As noted above, the SSA conducted a thorough and careful demonstration of the effect that releasing the disputed data could have. As such, the district court did not err in concluding that disclosure of the data would implicate the beneficiaries\u2019 privacy interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Having concluded that beneficiaries\u2019 privacy interests are at stake, we evaluate whether those interests are outweighed by the public\u2019s interest in disclosure. Per the Supreme Court, \u201cthe only relevant public interest in the FOIA balancing analysis [is] the extent to which disclosure of the information sought would \u2018she[d] light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties\u2019 or otherwise let citizens know \u2018what their government is up to.\u2019 \u201d <em>U.S. Dept. of Defense v. Fed. Labor Rel. Auth., </em>510 U.S. 487, 497, 114 S.Ct. 1006, 127 L.Ed.2d 325 (1994) (quoting <em>Reporters Comm., </em>489 U.S. at 773, 109 S.Ct. 1468).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Havemann\u2019s stated intent to evaluate the SSA\u2019s administration of various benefit programs fits within FOIA\u2019s goal of \u201cshed[ding] light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties.\u201d But he fails to satisfactorily articulate how the withheld data aids his pursuits. In his brief to this Court, he avers that \u201cto properly inform the public about SSA\u2019s operations and associated failures, [he] needs records and combinations of records that <em>pertain </em>to individuals.\u201d But the information that the SSA has already disclosed does relate to individuals, and Havemann does not indicate why it is insufficient. Havemann further maintains that \u201cdates of birth are essential to identification of eligibility for certain categories of benefits.\u201d As noted by the district court, however, the SSA has explained that Havemann can achieve nearly 100% accuracy on eligibility determinations with access simply to the year of birth. Thus, it is unclear how access to the month and day of beneficiaries\u2019 birth will assist Havemann in any significant way.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Having reviewed the district court\u2019s decision and Havemann\u2019s arguments, we are convinced that any interest the public may have in the withheld data is sufficiently outweighed by the privacy interests that would be compromised by such disclosure. The public\u2019s interest in disclosure of the withheld data is negligible at best. The SSA has provided significant details for more than 140 million individuals, and such details appear sufficient to allow Havemann to conduct his analysis. To the extent that they are lacking, we do not believe that the marginal gains ostensibly possible through further disclosure are worth the burdens that will likely result to beneficiaries\u2019 privacy interests. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court \u201chad an adequate factual basis for the decision [it] rendered\u201d and that its decision was not clearly erroneous. <em>Spannaus, </em>813 F.2d at 1288. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the SSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Havemann contends that he is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs and that the district court erred in denying his motion to this effect. Per 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E), \u201c[t]he court may assess against the United States reasonable attorney fees and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under this section in which the complainant has substantially prevailed.\u201d A complainant \u201csubstantially prevails]\u201d in a case when he proves that \u201c(1) his filing of the FOIA action was necessary to obtain the information sought and (2) the action had a \u2018substantial causative effect\u2019 on the ultimate receipt of that information.\u201d <em>Long v. U.S. I.R.S., </em>932 F.2d 1309, 1313 (9th Cir.1991). Here, Havemann did not \u201csubstantially prevail[]\u201d in his opposition to the SSA\u2019s summary judgment motion. Thus, he is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees connected with that endeavor. He appears to argue, however, that he is entitled to the fees associated with filing his complaint on June 8, 2010, because, as noted above, although the SSA acknowledged his requests for information within the time-frame outlined in section 552(a)(6)(A), it failed to communicate its determinations regarding disclosure within that time-frame. The filing of the complaint thus arguably \u201cwas necessary to obtain the information [Havemann] sought\u201d and \u201chad a \u2018substantial causative effect\u2019 on the ultimate receipt of [the] information\u201d that the SSA did disclose. <em>Id. </em>We decline to explore this argument further, however, because, as the SSA points out, Havemann failed to comply with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54 regarding claims for attorney\u2019s fees. Rule 54 requires that \u201c[a] claim for attorney\u2019s fees ... be made by motion\u201d; \u201cbe filed no later than 14 days after the entry of judgment\u201d; \u201cspecify the judgment and the statute, rule, or other grounds entitling the movant to the award\u201d; \u201cstate the amount sought or provide a fair estimate of it\u201d; and \u201cdisclose, if the court so orders, the terms of any agreement about fees for the services for which the claim is made.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(2)(A)-(B). Havemann made no such motion. We recognize that in his \u201cMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d Havemann argued that he was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because the SSA did not provide a substantive response to his request until after he filed his complaint in this action. But even if we reckon this argument sufficient to comply with Rule 54\u2019s requirement that \u201c[a] claim for attorney\u2019s fees ... be made by motion,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(2)(A), we cannot ignore Havemann\u2019s failure to \u201cstate the amount sought or provide a fair estimate of it,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(2)(B)(iii). Because Havemann failed to make a proper plea for attorney\u2019s fees before the district court, the district court did not err in denying his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-44\">.
