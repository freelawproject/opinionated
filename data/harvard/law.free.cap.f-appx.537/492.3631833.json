There is no error in the court\u2019s determining Stapleman\u2019s claim accrued under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), on that date, and that the instant complaint, filed in district court on 4 April 2012, was untimely. <em>See Owens v. Okure, </em>488 U.S. 235, 249-50, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989) (\u201c[W]here state law provides multiple statutes of limitations for personal injury actions, courts considering \u00a7 1983 claims should borrow the general or residual statute for personal injury actions.\u201d); <em>Elzy v. Roberson, </em>868 F.2d 793, 794-95 (5th Cir.1989) (applying Louisiana\u2019s one-year prescriptive period for personal-injury actions to plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claim). Stapleman has not established equitable tolling of the limitations period is warranted. <em>E.g., Cruz v. Louisiana, </em>528 F.3d 375, 378 &amp; n. 7 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Barber v. Emp\u2019rs Ins. Co., </em>97 So.3d 454, 464 (La.Ct. App.2012) (if complaint is facially untimely, Louisiana law places burden on plaintiff to establish prescription has been interrupted or suspended).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
