Oser, a federal inmate currently incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania (\u201cUSP Lewisburg\u201d), appeals pro se from an order of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus without prejudice to his right to file a civil rights action under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown, Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Because the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-24\">According to Oser\u2019s habeas petition, in March 2012, while he was incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary at Pollock, in Louisiana, he was found guilty of a rule infraction and ordered to serve 15 days of disciplinary segregation. For reasons unknown, Oser was held in disciplinary segregation for 234 days, and was then transferred to the Special Management Unit (\u201cSMU\u201d) at Lewisburg, where he remains. In December 2012, Oser filed a petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, claiming that his confinement at the SMU is in violation of the First, Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The Magistrate Judge screened Oser\u2019s petition subject to Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Habeas Cases and determined that, because Oser was challenging the conditions of his confinement rather than the validity, duration, or execution of his conviction and sentence, Oser\u2019s claims were not within the scope of habeas corpus. Overruling Oser\u2019s objections, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissed Oser\u2019s petition without prejudice to his filing a <em>Bivens </em>claim. Oser timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact. <em>Vega v. United States, </em>493 F.3d 310, 314 (3d Cir.2007). We may summarily affirm a judgment of the District Court if the appeal does not raise a substantial question. <em>See </em>I.O.P. 10.6; <em>see also Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 247 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">The District Court correctly determined that Oser\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition does not challenge the basic fact or duration of his imprisonment, which is the \u201cessence of habeas.\u201d <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 484, 498-99, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). We have held that \u00a7 2241 \u201cconfers habeas jurisdiction to hear the petition of a federal prisoner who is challenging not the validity but the execution of his sentence.\u201d <em>Woodall v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>432 F.3d 235, 241 (3d Cir.2005) (citing <em>Coady v. Vaughn, </em>251 F.3d 480, 485 (3d Cir.2001)). While the \u201cprecise meaning of \u2018execution of the sentence\u2019 is hazy,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 242, we have defined execution to mean \u201cput into effect\u201d or \u201ccarry out,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 243 (citation omitted). \u201c[T]o challenge the execution of his sentence under \u00a7 2241, [an inmate] would need to allege that [the Bureau of Prison\u2019s] conduct was somehow inconsistent with a command or recommendation in the sentencing judgment.\u201d <em>Cardona v. Bledsoe, </em>681 F.3d 533, 537 (3d Cir.2012). Oser has failed to do so here, as he has not alleged that his placement in the SMU was inconsistent with any express command or recommendation in his sentencing judgment. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we agree with the District Court that Oser\u2019s confinement in the SMU does not give rise to a habeas claim and that his claims if any should instead be brought in an action pursuant to <em>Bivens.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-15\">Accordingly, the District Court did not err in dismissing Oser\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. For substantially the same reasons set forth by the District Court, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Oser\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-10\">. A certificate of appealability is not required to appeal the denial of a section 2241 petition. <em>Burkey v. Marberry, </em>556 F.3d 142, 146 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b63-17\">. We express no opinion as to the merits, if any, of any civil rights claim Oser may choose to file based upon the facts asserted in his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
