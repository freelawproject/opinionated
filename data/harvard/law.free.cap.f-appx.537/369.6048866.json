We AFFIRM in part, REVERSE in part, VACATE, and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">Santos was arrested at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (\u201cDFW\u201d) after United States Customs and Border Protection agents discovered drugs hidden in the lining of her purse. Santos subsequently pleaded guilty, without a plea agreement, to possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(l)(B)(viii). Santos signed a factual resum\u00e9 admitting the elements of her crime and participated in a proffer interview with the Government. The parties agreed that any self-incriminating information that Santos disclosed during the proffer interview would not be used in determining any applicable Sentencing Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-17\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) stated that the Drug Enforcement Administration laboratory results showed that the methamphetamine found in Santos\u2019s purse had a 98.6 percent purity rate. The PSR assigned a two-level increase in Santos\u2019s offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(5)(A) because Santos \u201cagreed to act as a \u2018drug mule\u2019 for unknown individuals in Mexico. The defendant was in possession of methamphetamine that had been imported from Mexico\u201d (the \u201cimportation enhancement\u201d). The PSR characterized Santos as an \u201caverage participant,\u201d so it did not make an adjustment for minor role pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>The PSR also assigned a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), stating that Santos \u201chas clearly demonstrated acceptance of responsibility for the offense.\u201d It assigned a further one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) because Santos \u201chas assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of the defendant\u2019s own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of the intention to enter a plea of guilty.\u201d Thus, the PSR subtracted a total of three levels from Santos\u2019s base offense level due to her acceptance of responsibility. Based on all of the adjustments, the PSR attributed a total offense level of 31 to Santos.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Santos objected to the two-level enhancement for the importation of methamphetamine from Mexico. She did not contest the facts set forth in the PSR, but argued that the evidence used to support the enhancement was improperly derived from her proffer interview and that the undisputed facts in the PSR were legally insufficient to support the finding that the methamphetamine she possessed had been imported from Mexico. Specifically, Santos noted that the PSR determined that the drugs were imported from Mexico because Santos had agreed to act as a drug mule for individuals in Mexico. She argued that this evidence was obtained solely from the proffer interview in which she participated, the information from which could not be used against her for sentencing purposes. She further argued that there was no evidence in the record that she had obtained the drugs in Mexico. Even were the proffer interview to be considered, the only evidence was that she had obtained the drugs in Nogales, Arizona, from where she flew to DFW and was apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In a written response, the Government agreed that the PSR improperly relied on Santos\u2019s proffer interview to support its conclusion that the drugs were imported from Mexico. It also agreed that there was insufficient evidence independent of Santos\u2019s proffered statement to support the importation enhancement. Therefore, the Government stated that Santos\u2019s adjusted offense level, including a reduction for acceptance of responsibility and without considering the improper importation enhancement, should be 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The probation officer filed an addendum to the PSR, which disputed that the importation enhancement relied on information obtained in the proffer interview. Instead, it stated that when Santos was questioned by federal agents at DFW, \u201cshe told agents that she had been living in Tijuana, Mexico, since May 2001 [and t]hus by a preponderance of the evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the methamphetamine was imported from Mexico, which is where she was living at the time of her arrest.\u201d The addendum also noted that Santos\u2019s travel had been booked by the same travel agency that had been used by other international drug traffickers and that she had been previously arrested for importing marijuana from Mexico to California. Finally, the addendum declared that \u201cit is common knowledge among federal law enforcement that the methamphetamine being supplied in the United States is imported from Mexico. The defendant only confirmed, in her proffer interview, what government agents already knew.\u201d The addendum concluded that Santos \u201cappears to be denying or frivolously contesting her relevant conduct which is inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Santos also objected to the lack of a minor role reduction, arguing that the evidence showed that she was a mere drug courier, and therefore should receive a two-level reduction as a minor participant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The probation officer responded that Santos was an average participant who was held accountable only for the conduct in which she was directly involved, not for the illegal activity of a drug organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Prior to Santos\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court tentatively concluded that the \u201cinformation available to the court appears to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the methamphetamine involved in defendant\u2019s offense conduct was imported from Mexico.\u201d In addition, the district court tentatively concluded that Santos \u201chas frivolously contested relevant conduct [by objecting to the importation enhancement], as the probation officer noted in the addendum, and that in doing so she has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility, with the consequence that she should not receive a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">At the sentencing hearing, both Santos and the Government reiterated their concerns about the importation enhancement. The Government was particularly vociferous in support of Santos\u2019s objection, and the following exchanges, among others, occurred between the district court and the Government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">THE COURT: What is the Government\u2019s position as to where the drugs originated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">[THE GOVERNMENT]: Your Honor, we don\u2019t know. The facts of this case do not establish where those drugs came from. The only fact we have now is something we did gain in the proffer interview of Ms. Santos, which was she was handed that purse [containing the drugs] in Nogales, Arizona. She does not claim to know where those drugs came from. It\u2019s possible they came from Mexico, but we simply don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">THE COURT: Okay. Of course, I\u2019ll have to make the decision as to what the preponderance of the evidence establishes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">[THE GOVERNMENT]: Absolutely, Your Honor. May I be heard further?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">THE COURT: Well, if you would like to be heard further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">[THE GOVERNMENT]: The original PSR certainly appeared to use proffered information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-13\">THE COURT: I agree that the probation officer did, in explaining why there should be a two-level increase based on importation from Mexico, use proffer information, and she should not have done that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-14\">[THE GOVERNMENT]: Thank you, Your Honor. I agree. And because of that, I\u2019m not sure this issue [of importation of the drugs from Mexico] would have arisen in probation\u2019s mind or in the Court\u2019s mind. It didn\u2019t arise in my mind until I saw, frankly, [Santos\u2019s] objection [to the enhancement].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-15\">[THE COURT]: So my tentative conclusion is that the preponderance of the evidence establishes that she brought these drugs from Mexico, or if she didn\u2019t, somebody else did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-16\">[THE GOVERNMENT]: Your Honor has to come to a conclusion, and you certainly have the right and the ability to come to that conclusion, however, I would like to clarify that there is nothing that I have seen in this record\u2014 and I don\u2019t believe it exists \u2014 that suggests she had that purse with methamphetamine in it when she crossed the border.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>THE COURT: [Government counsel], do you understand the concept of circumstantial evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">[THE GOVERNMENT]: One more thing, Your Honor. Obviously, the Government has a huge problem with \u2014 or had a huge problem with the way this was coming down and made the appropriate objections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">THE COURT: What do you have a problem \u2014 why does the Government have a problem with the way this is coming down? If a defendant frivolously contests relevant conduct, then the guidelines [sic] contemplate she won\u2019t get acceptance of responsibility. Does the Government have a problem with that concept?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">[THE GOVERNMENT]: Not with the concept, Your Honor, but with its application here. I don\u2019t believe the defendant or defense counsel is frivolously contesting relevant conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayz\">As you said, Your Honor, you have to link up circumstantial evidence to make this conclusion that those drugs were imported from Mexico, and it\u2019s within defendant\u2019s rights, Your Honor, to challenge whether those links are sufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">THE COURT: What has been your experience as to where methamphetamine with almost 100 percent purity comes from when it\u2019s found in Texas?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">[THE GOVERNMENT]: I have no personal experience with that, Your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">The district' court then continued the hearing, ordering the Government to bring its case agent to the next hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">Just prior to the second sentencing hearing, the Government informed Santos\u2019s counsel of additional information supplied by the Government\u2019s case agent. The case agent reported that most drugs in Arizona come from Mexico and that the travel agency that had booked Santos\u2019s travel had also booked travel for a previous defendant who had carried drugs from Mexico and was associated with Nogales, Arizona. Based on this additional information, Santos withdrew her objection to the importation increase, as did the Government. At the subsequent hearing, the Government proffered the case agent\u2019s testimony. The district court then adopted the two-level importation increase, finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the drugs Santos had been carrying had been imported from Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">The district court also denied Santos the three-level acceptance-of-responsibility reduction because \u201cthe very fact that she would contest that issue and put everybody to the trouble that everybody has been put to, to deal with that contest, causes me to conclude that she has not accepted responsibility.\u201d In other words, because Santos contested the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the importation enhancement, the district court refused to grant her a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Consequently, Santos\u2019s total offense level increased from 31, as calculated in the original PSR, to 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-16\">The district court also found that Santos was not entitled to a minor role reduction. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-17\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AQA\">A. Acceptance of Responsibility<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-18\">Santos argues that the district court erred when it denied her an offense-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. To be clear, Santos does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that she was subject to a two-level increase because the drugs she was carrying were imported from Mexico. Instead, she challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to grant her a three-level decrease in her offense level for acceptance of responsibility. The initial PSR stated that Santos had fully accepted responsibility such that she should receive the decrease. It was only after Santos objected to the lack of evidence supporting the importation enhancement that the probation officer suggested she was not accepting responsibility. The district court\u2019s comments demonstrate that Santos\u2019s objection to the importation enhancement was the sole reason for its refusal to grant Santos a decrease for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>681 F.3d 678, 712 (5th Cir.2012) (citation omitted). \u201cWhile the district court\u2019s findings under the [Sentencing [Guidelines are generally reviewed for clear error, a determination whether a defendant is entitled to an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is reviewed with even greater deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>485 F.3d 274, 287 (5th Cir.2007). Santos bears the burden of demonstrating that she is entitled to this reduction. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>915 F.2d 947, 950 (5th Cir.1990). We \u201caffirm a sentencing court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, a defendant may receive a two- or three-level reduction in offense level if he \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d \u201cIf a defendant enters a guilty plea prior to trial, truthfully admits the conduct comprising the offense, and admits, or at least does not falsely deny, any additional relevant conduct for which he is accountable, the court may find significant evidence of the defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Medina-Anicacio, </em>325 F.3d 638, 648 (5th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). A defendant is \u201cnot required to volunteer or affirmatively admit relevant conduct beyond the conviction offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Patino-Cardenas, </em>85 F.3d 1133, 1135 (5th Cir. 1996). However, a defendant may not \u201cfalsely deny or frivolously contest relevant conduct that the court determined to be true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">There is no dispute that Santos entered her guilty plea prior to trial and truthfully admitted the conduct comprising the offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We also observe that importing drugs from Mexico was not an element of the crime with which Santos was charged. Therefore, the alleged international provenance of the drugs constituted additional conduct relevant to the offense rather than conduct comprising the offense charged. <em>See id. </em>at 1136. Accordingly, Santos did not have to admit that the drugs came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>from Mexico, but neither could she falsely deny it. Santos did not deny the drugs came from Mexico. Rather, she made two legal objections to the importation enhancement: (1) that the PSR improperly relied on information obtained during the proffer session and (2) that the evidence in the record was insufficient to support the enhancement. Therefore, our inquiry is whether the district court committed reversible error by characterizing these objections as \u201cfrivolous\u201d and inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 does not define a \u201cfrivolous! ] contest! ],\u201d so we use the plain meaning of the words. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines frivolous as \u201c[ljacking a legal basis or legal merit; not serious; not reasonably purposeful.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 739 (9th ed.2009); <em>accord Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989) (holding that a complaint is legally frivolous if it is based on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d); <em>Biliski v. Harborth, </em>55 F.3d 160, 162 (5th Cir.1995) (citations omitted) (\u201cA complaint is frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis in law or in fact.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">With respect to Santos\u2019s first objection, we observe that the district court agreed with Santos that the PSR improperly relied on the information obtained in the proffer session to support the importation enhancement. It is axiomatic that an objection cannot be frivolous if the district court agrees with the grounds for the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">As to Santos\u2019s challenge as to the sufficiency of the evidence, we also hold that it was not frivolous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There was insufficient original, non-proffer evidence in the record that the drugs at issue here had been imported from Mexico. To the contrary, the only original, non-proffer evidence in the record as to the origin of the drugs was that Santos had received them in Arizona. In the first sentencing hearing, the Government admitted that no such original, non-proffer evidence existed and disagreed with the district court that the circumstantial evidence indicated that the drugs had been imported from Mexico. When <em>additional evidence </em>linking the drugs to Mexico was presented <em>after </em>the first hearing, Santos withdrew her objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">We have previously stated that \u201cmerely pointing out that the evidence does not support a particular upward adjustment or other sentencing calculation, does not strike us as a legitimate ground for ruling that the defendant has not accepted responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>190 F.3d 656, 659 (5th Cir.1999) (citation omitted), <em>recognized as abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Dunigan, </em>555 F.3d 501 (5th Cir.2009). There may be some cases in which a defendant\u2019s challenge of the sufficiency of the evidence is a frivolous contest or a false denial of the facts of the relevant conduct, but this is not one of those cases. Based on the facts in the record, it was not frivolous for Santos to raise an objection designed to ensure that the Government properly met its burden of proof concerning a factual determination with which she had not been indicted. The record shows that the district court denied Santos acceptance of responsibility merely because she objected to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the importation enhancement. We hold this denial to be without foundation. <em>See Solis, </em>299 F.3d at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Our holding is consistent with our precedent. We previously have determined that a district court erred in failing to grant a defendant an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. In <em>Patino-Cardenas, </em>the defendant\u2019s admission was silent as to additional conduct alleged by the Government that was not charged in the indictment. 85 F.3d at 1136. This court reversed the district court\u2019s determination that the defendant had failed to accept responsibility, and we vacated the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1137. We concluded that the defendant had not denied any of the facts stated in the PSR but had objected to the \u201clegal characterization (leadership role) given his actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1136. As the defendant had \u201cadequately admitted the conduct comprising the offense and either admitted or did not falsely deny the additional relevant conduct identified by the government,\u201d we held that the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a reduction for acceptance of responsibility was without foundation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">In <em>United States v. Fells, </em>we vacated the defendant\u2019s sentence where the district court had refused to grant the defendant a reduction for acceptance of responsibility because the defendant went to trial. 78 F.3d 168, 172 (5th Cir.1996). The defendant was stopped at an airport and, upon questioning, admitted that he had placed a pistol in his checked luggage. <em>Id. </em>at 170. He was arrested and charged with being a felon in possession of a handgun. <em>Id. </em>Although the defendant admitted the facts underlying the indictment, he went to trial where he argued that the airline \u201cpossessed\u201d the gun when it was stored in his checked luggage and that venue was improper. <em>Id. </em>The defendant was convicted, and during sentencing, the district court denied him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility because he had put the prosecution to its burden of proof at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">In vacating the sentence, this court noted that the defendant had \u201cfreely admitted all the facts but challenged them legal interpretation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172. Therefore, we held that, under the circumstances presented, the district court\u2019s refusal to consider a reduction for acceptance of responsibility merely because the defendant had sought to hold the prosecutor to its burden of proof at trial \u201cimpermissibly penalized the defendant] for asserting his constitutional right to trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Thus, in both <em>Patino-Cardenas </em>and <em>Fells, </em>we refused to permit a district court to deny a defendant a reduction for acceptance of responsibility where the defendant made only a legal objection and otherwise fulfilled U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l\u2019s requirements. Similarly, in the instant case, Santos promptly pleaded guilty to the crime with which she was charged, adequately admitted the conduct comprising the offense, participated in a proffer session with the Government, at no point denied the additional relevant conduct, and, indeed, admitted the conduct once the Government presented the additional evidence. She made only a legal objection to a base level offense enhancement. Based on the record, we hold this objection was not frivolous. The PSR assigned Santos a reduction for acceptance of responsibility before her objection, and the district court gave no other reason for denying Santos this reduction. Consequently, there was no foundation for the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, and Santos must be resentenced.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Patino-Cardenas, </em>85 F.3d at 1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>B. Minor Role</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Santos argues that the district court based its denial of a two-level minor role reduction in Santos\u2019s base level offense on improper grounds. Specifically, Santos argues that the district court viewed her as per se ineligible for the reduction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The district court adopted the PSR and its addendum, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">The defendant is an average participant. ... The defendant was not held accountable for any illegal activities of a \u201cdrug organization,\u201d but rather her conduct for which she is directly involved, namely, possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. This is, at least, the second time she has acted as a drug courier. Thus, her role was not minor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">At Santos\u2019s second sentencing hearing, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">Well, I\u2019m satisfied that her role was such that \u2014 she hadn\u2019t satisfied me that her role was such that she should receive any reduced offense level because of her role. And I\u2019m satisfied, on the other hand, that ... her conduct was such that she should receive the role assigned to her in the presentence report. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, a defendant who was a \u201cminor participant in any criminal activity\u201d may have his offense level decreased by two levels. Additionally, \u201c[a] defendant who is accountable ... only for the conduct in which the defendant personally was involved and who performs a limited function in concerted criminal activity is not precluded from consideration for an adjustment under this guideline.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 n. 3(A). Additionally, the Sentencing Guidelines note that \u201ca defendant who is convicted of a drug trafficking offense, whose role in that offense was limited to transporting or storing drugs ... is not precluded from consideration for an adjustment\u201d under this Guideline. <em>Id. </em>However, neither is a drug courier per se entitled to this reduction. \u201c[A] defendant may be a [drug] courier without being either a minimal participant or a minor participant.\u201d <em>United States v. Gallegos, </em>868 F.2d 711, 713 (5th Cir.1989) (citation omitted). Because the determination depends on the defendant\u2019s culpability, not the defendant\u2019s status, \u201ca defendant may be a courier without being substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Not every courier is not entitled to receive a downward adjustment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">Here, the district court made a factual finding that Santos was not a minor participant. The district court noted that, <em>inter alia, </em>Santos had been apprehended with a significant amount of methamphetamine and that she previously had been apprehended while smuggling a significant quantity of marijuana from Mexico to the United States, accompanied by her two young children. The district court considered the defendant\u2019s crime a serious one. Its findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s determination that Santos\u2019s role in the offense did not justify a minor role reduction is AFFIRMED. The district court\u2019s determination that Santos failed to accept responsibility, which justified its refusal to adjust downward three levels is REVERSED. Accordingly, Santos\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-12\">.

Before the district court and on appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Santos argues that the sentence violates her Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury and her Fifth Amendment rights to proof beyond a reasonable doubt and to indictment.

The indictment charged Santos with possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, to which she pleaded guilty and the elements of which she admitted in a factual resum\u00e9. No one disputes that Santos adequately admitted the conduct comprising her offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\">. On appeal, Santos also urges that her challenge to the lack of a minor role reduction provided an independent ground for her challenge as to the propriety of the importation increase. As we hold that Santos's challenge as to the sufficiency of the evidence was not frivolous, we need not consider this alternative ground for reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b400-5\">. Santos requests that her case be remanded to a different judge for resentencing. We do not find such a reassignment necessary under the factors identified in <em>Simon v. City of Clute, </em>825 F.2d 940, 943-44 (5th Cir.1987), and so we deny this request.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
