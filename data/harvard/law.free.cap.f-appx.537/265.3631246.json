We have reviewed the record and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-16\">In 2008, the Government initiated civil commitment proceedings against Timms by certifying him as a \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4248(a) (2006). After a hearing in 2011, the district court dismissed the case, finding that \u00a7 4248 was unconstitutional as applied to Timms. We reversed and remanded with instructions that the district court \u201cdetermine on the merits whether Timms meets the \u00a7 4248 criteria for being declared a \u2018sexually dangerous person.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Timms, </em>664 F.3d 436, 456 (4th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-17\">On remand, the district court entered an order civilly committing Timms as a \u201csexually dangerous person.\u201d Specifically, the district court determined that the Government established by clear and convincing evidence that Timms engaged in sexually violent conduct in the past and that he suffers from pedophilia, a serious mental disorder. Further, the district court determined that Timms would have serious difficulty in refraining from re-offending if released. This finding was based on expert witness testimony, as well as \u201cTimms\u2019 continued violations while incarcerated, his refusal to accept responsibility for his past conduct, and his lack of sex offender treatment.\u201d (J.A. 307-08).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Timms filed a motion for a new hearing pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a)(2), arguing that a new hearing was \u201cnecessary to prevent manifest injustice.\u201d (J.A. 309). On December 12, 2012, the district court denied Timms\u2019 motion, finding that Timms \u201cidentified no sufficient basis upon which the [cjourt might find that the evidentiary hearing in this matter was unfair or that a manifest injustice has resulted from it.\u201d (J.A. 317). Timms appeals, asserting that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion because the absence of his own testimony and the disproportionate allotment of expert witnesses at his trial resulted in manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for a new hearing. <em>United States v. Ibisevic, </em>675 F.3d 342, 349 (4th Cir.2012). Rule 59(a)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P., states that \u201c[ajfter a nonjury trial, the court may, on motion for a new trial, open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new ones, and direct the entry of a new judgment.\u201d At the conclusion of a bench trial, \u201ca motion for rehearing \u2018should be based upon manifest error of law or mistake of fact, and a judgment should not be set aside except for substantial reasons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Hous. Auth. of Raleigh, </em>595 F.Supp.2d 627, 630 (E.D.N.C. 2008) (quoting Wright &amp; Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2804 (2d ed.2005)); <em>see also Ball v. Interoceanica Corp., </em>71 F.3d 73, 76 (2d Cir.1995) (stating same standard). Further, \u201ca new trial will not be granted on grounds not called to the court\u2019s attention during the trial unless the error was so fundamental that gross injustice would result.\u201d <em>United States v. Carolina E. Chem. Co., Inc., </em>639 F.Supp. 1420, 1423 (D.S.C.1986) (citing Wright &amp; Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2805).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Timms has failed to identify any cognizable error with regard to the absence of his testimony at the hearing. Notably, Timms does not argue, nor is there any evidence to suggest, that the district court prohibited him from testifying. Rather, Timms asserts that \u201c[it] is manifestly unjust for the [c]ourt not to evaluate [his] in-person testimony in reaching its decision of sexual dangerousness.\u201d We disagree. An individual in a civil commitment hearing is not required to testify, but must \u201cbe afforded an opportunity to testify.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(d) (2006). Timms was afforded an opportunity to testify, but chose not to. We therefore find no error in the district court reaching its conclusion without hearing in-person testimony by Timms.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Timms has also failed to identify any error resulting from the disproportionate number of expert witnesses at the hearing. Timms did not request an additional expert witness prior to his hearing, as he was permitted to do pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(b) (2006). Rather, Timms presented the expert testimony of Dr. John Warren, and waited until after the hearing to request the appointment of a second expert. Moreover, Timms did not raise any objections during the hearing concerning the disproportionate number of expert witnesses. We thus find no error with regard to the number of expert witnesses who testified at Timms\u2019 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Finally, we find unpersuasive Timms\u2019 argument that it was manifestly unjust that Dr. Warren, his expert witness, did not conduct an in-person examination of him. Dr. Warren was able to review Timms\u2019 medical records, along with records of the Department of Social Services and other data pertaining to Timms\u2019 history and psychological condition. Moreover, Timms did not object, before or during the hearing, to Dr. Warren\u2019s failure to person<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ally examine him. Thus, this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Timms\u2019 motion for a new hearing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-10\"> \"J.A.\u201d refers to the joint appendix filed by the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
