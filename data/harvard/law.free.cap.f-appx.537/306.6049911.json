In his petition for review, Mata contends his prior conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony subjecting him to deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Although 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) strips our court of jurisdiction to review orders of removability based on an alien\u2019s commission of an aggravated felony, we may consider related questions of law, including whether a given offense is a qualifying felony. <em>E.g., Martinez v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 532, 538 (5th Cir.2008) (whether bank-fraud conviction was an aggravated felony constitutes reviewable question of law). Because the BIA\u2019s decision did not adopt the Immigration Judge\u2019s, we review only the former. <em>E.g., Bouchikhi v. Holder, </em>676 F.3d 173, 176 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">To determine whether a state statute states a qualifying theft offense under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G), we compare the state statute at issue to our \u201cgeneric definition of a theft offense, which is a taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits of ownership, even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent\u201d. <em>Nolos v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 279, 285 (5th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The state statute provides in relevant part: \u201cA person commits an offense if he unlawfully [without the owner\u2019s effective consent] appropriates property with intent to deprive the owner of property.... [A]n offense under this section is a state jail felony if the value of the property stolen is $1,500 or more but less than $20,000\u201d. Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 31.03(a), (b)(1), &amp; (e)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Pursuant to this analysis, the BIA did not err in concluding the statute states a crime qualifying as a theft under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G), as the state statute comports with our generic theft definition. <em>E.g., id.; see also United States v. Benitez-Villafuerte, </em>186 F.3d 651, 659 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
