An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) issued a report and recommended ruling in favor of Dr. T.J. McNichol (\u201cDr. McNichol\u201d). The DEA Administrator rejected that ruling and revoked Dr. McNichol\u2019s DEA registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-21\">An agency\u2019s factual findings are conclusive \u201cif supported by substantial evidence.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 877. Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). It is \u201cmore than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Hale v. Bowen, </em>831 F.2d 1007, 1011 (11th Cir.1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). An administrative agency\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence even if \u201ctwo inconsistent conclusions [could be drawn] from the evidence.\u201d <em>Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 1026, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 (1966); <em>see also Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 465, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951) (agency decision must be upheld even if court would have reached different conclusion under <em>de novo </em>review). The \u201climited\u201d substantial evidence review \u201cprecludes deciding the facts anew, making credibility determinations, or re-weighing the evidence.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number><em>see also Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">A court may set aside the DEA\u2019s final decision only if is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). \u201cThis standard is exceedingly deferential.\u201d <em>Sierra Club v. Van Antwerp, </em>526 F.3d 1353, 1360 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Rice, </em>85 F.3d 535, 541 (11th Cir.1996)). This court will not overturn an agency decision so long as the agency \u201cexamine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d <em>Motor Veh. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2866, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">To determine whether an agency decision was arbitrary and capricious, the reviewing court considers whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 43, 103 S.Ct. at 2866-67. A court will not overturn an agency decision unless the agency has \u201crelied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\u201d <em>Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. United States, </em>566 F.3d 1257, 1264 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Alabamar-Tombigbee Rivers Coal. v. Kempthome, </em>477 F.3d 1250, 1254 (11th Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">After reviewing the record in this case, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s decision to revoke Dr. McNiehol\u2019s DEA registration. The record clearly demonstrates that Dr. McNichol repeatedly prescribed controlled substances without a legitimate medical purpose and outside the usual course of his professional practice. Moreover, the government established by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case that revocation was in the public interest, and Dr. McNichol did not present sufficient mitigation to rebut that case. Specifically, the administrator properly relied on uncontested evidence that Dr. McNichol illegally prescribed controlled substances to four undercover law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">Because the record supports that the administrator considered all aspects of the evidence in light of the applicable statutory factors and committed no clear error of judgment in its decision, its decision was not arbitrary and capricious. Finally, we also agree with the administrator\u2019s conclusion that Dr. McNichol\u2019s continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
