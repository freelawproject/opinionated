Hale, Jr., appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C: \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">Our review is governed by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). <em>Brown v. Ornoski, </em>503 F.3d 1006, 1010 (9th Cir.2007). AEDPA restricts federal courts from granting a habeas writ to a petitioner in custody after a state court judgment on the merits unless the petitioner can show that the state court\u2019s last reasoned adjudication of the petitioner\u2019s federal claim resulted in a decision that (1) \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or (2) \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-14\">Hale and two codefendants were tried in state court before separate juries in connection with a drive-by shooting. Hale was convicted under an aiding and abetting theory of liability of attempted murder in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 187(a) &amp; 664.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury also found that the attempted murder was deliberate, willful, and premeditated. The conviction was upheld on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-15\">Hale challenges the California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to support his conviction. Pursuant to <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>in determining a due process claim based on the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cthe critical inquiry ... is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 443 U.S. 307, 318, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). \u201cWhen we undertake collateral review of a state court decision rejecting a claim of insufficiency of the evidence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), however, our inquiry is even more limited; that is, we ask only whether the state court\u2019s decision was contrary to or reflected an unreasonable application of <em>Jackson </em>to the facts of a particular case.\u201d <em>Emery v. Clark, </em>643 F.3d 1210, 1213-14 (9th Cir.2011) (citing <em>Juan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number><em>H. v. Allen, </em>408 F.3d 1262, 1274-75 (9th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The relevant inquiry must be made in light of the applicable state law. <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 324 n. 16, 99 S.Ct. 2781; <em>see also Emery, </em>643 F.3d at 1214 (\u201c[ijnsufficient evidence claims are reviewed by looking at the elements of the offense under state law\u201d). Under California law, \u201can aider and abettor is a person who, acting with (1) knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator; and (2) the intent or purpose of committing, encouraging, or facilitating the commission of the offense, (3) by act or advice aids, promotes, encourages or instigates, the commission of the crime.\u201d <em>People v. Prettyman, </em>14 Cal.4th 248, 58 Cal.Rptr.2d 827, 926 P.2d 1013, 1018-19 (1996) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The California Court of Appeal concluded that although \u201ca close case,\u201d \u201cthe jury could reasonably deduce from these facts that Hale had knowledge of, and shared, Ricketts\u2019 intent to kill.\u201d That court rejected the notion that Hale knew of Ricketts\u2019 intent before getting in the car, but then determined that \u201cthe situation changed\u201d when Ricketts told the others he would make them \u201criders.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The state court also found that Hale was not a \u201cmere passenger\u201d in the car, but \u201cby staying in the car after it became clear that Ricketts was about to engage in some of the \u2018violent stuff,\u2019 his presence facilitated and encouraged the crime by contributing to the show of force by 1200 Blocc members in their rival\u2019s territory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Upon review of the trial court record, we conclude that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination as to the sufficiency of the evidence in this case was not contrary to nor did it reflect an unreasonable application of <em>Jackson. See Emery, </em>643 F.3d at 1213-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b748-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-12\">. Hale was also convicted of two other crimes that are not at issue here: discharge of a firearm from a motor vehicle and assault with a semiautomatic firearm. The jury also found true allegations that race was a substantial motivating factor in committing the crimes; that the crimes were committed with the intent to promote, further, or assist a criminal gang; and that a principal personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injuiy. On direct appeal, the California Court of Appeal struck the true finding on the assault count that race was a substantial motivating factor and vacated the corresponding portion of the sentence, but otherwise affirmed the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\">.
