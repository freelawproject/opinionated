California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). In response to the motion, Garcia requests that we strike counsel\u2019s brief, extend the briefing period, and appoint new appellate counsel. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the record. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue; however, we do not address counsel\u2019s discussion of the adequacy of trial counsel\u2019s performance as the issue was not raised in the district court and the record has not been developed for appellate review. <em>See United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir. 2006). Accordingly, Garcia\u2019s motions to strike the brief, extend the briefing period, and appoint substitute counsel are DENIED; counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED; counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein; and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b560-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
