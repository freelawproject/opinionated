In a 34-page opinion in which he recounted the facts of this case with which he was personally and thoroughly familiar, Judge O\u2019Kelley denied the motion as untimely. In his opinion, Judge O\u2019Kelley considered and rejected every possible legal theory under which Clark might be entitled to recover such fees. We can find nothing to add to this careful examination of Clark\u2019s motion. Accordingly, the decision of the district court denying Clark\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b904-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
