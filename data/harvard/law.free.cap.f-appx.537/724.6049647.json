We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s judgment upholding the denial of social security benefits, <em>Berry v. Astrue, </em>622 F.3d 1228, 1231 (9th Cir.2010), and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">Mengistu asserts that additional evidence he submitted to the Appeals Council would have changed the outcome of the disability determination. Although we do not have jurisdiction to review the Appeals Council\u2019s denial of further review, we may consider additional evidence presented for the first time to the Appeals Council when reviewing the agency\u2019s disability determination. <em>Taylor v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>659 F.3d 1228, 1231-32 (9th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">The district court erred in concluding that a remand was not warranted because the new evidence, Dr. Gurevitch\u2019s September 1, 2009, report, relates to the relevant time period and there is a reasonable possibility the report would have changed the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) decision. <em>See Mayes v. Massanari, </em>276 F.3d 453, 462 (9th Cir.2001) (to warrant a remand, appellant must show \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that new evidence would have changed outcome of administrative hearing). Therefore, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision and remand with instructions to remand to the ALJ for consideration of Dr. Gurevitch\u2019s report and for reconsideration of Mengistu\u2019s application for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-15\">In light of this disposition, we do not reach Mengistu\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-16\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b741-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
