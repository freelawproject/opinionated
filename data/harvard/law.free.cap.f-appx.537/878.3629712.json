He claims that the district court clearly erred by applying a three-level role enhancement under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3B1.1(b) for being a manager or supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Cunningham\u2019s sentence stems from his role in a bank fraud scheme. The scam was relatively simple. Gafor Balogun would gain access to individuals\u2019 credit reports through a credit-reporting website, look for businesses\u2019 names on images of deposited checks, and then use state websites to obtain the businesses\u2019 tax identification numbers and the names of their owners. He gave that information to \u201csuppliers\u201d who would recruit \u201crunners\u201d to go to various banks and withdraw funds from the businesses\u2019 accounts through cash withdrawals, negotiated unauthorized cashier checks, and wire transfers. The runners used fake identification obtained by Balogun. After each withdrawal, the funds were divvied up. Runners got $500 per withdrawal. Balogun and the supplier split the remainder, with the supplier typically taking at least fifty percent and Balogun taking about thirty-five percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">Balogun had at least two suppliers who ran their own separate groups under his general supervision. Cunningham worked as a runner in Christian Okafor\u2019s group. But Cunningham did more than a typical runner: He recruited others to join Okafor\u2019s group as runners.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">Following his indictment by a federal grand jury, Cunningham pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028A(a)(1) and 1344. The presentence investigation report calculated a base offense level of 7 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(l). It added 12 levels under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(G) because the loss was greater than $200,000 but less than $400,000, and added 3 levels under \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) because Cunningham was a \u201cmanager or supervisor\u201d of the bank fraud scheme and it involved more than five participants. The PSR subtracted 3 levels under \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 19. That offense level combined with his criminal history category of VI to give Cunningham a guidelines range of 87 to 102 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">Cunningham objected to the three-level role enhancement, arguing that he had only recruited runners into the scheme and more is required to warrant the enhancement. The district court overruled Cunningham\u2019s objection, finding that his recruitment of others into the scheme was sufficient. The court then sentenced him to 87 months imprisonment. This is his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">Cunningham\u2019s sole contention is that he should not have received a three-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) because his only managerial act was recruiting other runners to join the bank fraud scheme. We review only for clear error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>the sentencing court\u2019s decision to impose that aggravating role enhancement. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>287 F.3d 1053, 1055 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The guidelines require a three-level enhancement to a defendant\u2019s base level offense if \u201cthe defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). The guidelines commentary explains that district courts may consider a number of factors in assessing the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-5\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-6\"><em>Id., </em>comment, (n.3). The commentary factors \u201care merely considerations for the sentencing judge,\u201d so there is no requirement that a certain number of factors be present for the enhancement to apply. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1026 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). There must, however, ultimately be an \u201cexertion of some degree of control, influence, or leadership.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Cunningham argues that he did not exercise the necessary degree of control, influence, or leadership because he did not have any authority over others\u2019 actions after he recruited them into the bank fraud scheme. But the \u201cinfluence\u201d he exerted over individuals by recruiting them into the scheme was enough for \u00a7 3B1.1(b) to apply. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1355 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006) (finding no clear error where the defendant received a role enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) based solely on the fact that he recruited others into the conspiracy). The district court therefore did not clearly err in applying a three-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
