He argues that his sentence, which exceeds the range set forth in the nonbinding policy statements in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines but is within the statutory maximum, is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to articulate adequate reasons for the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-21\">Although we generally review revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)\u2019s \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard, <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011), Lopez did not raise the specific issue he raises here in the district court and we thus review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Hernandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d 270, 272-73 (5th Cir.2007). Under the plain error standard, Lopez must show a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). We have discretion to correct such an error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-22\">Lopez asserts generally that a district court frustrates the purpose of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, deprives a defendant of his due process rights, and violates the principle of separation of powers when it sentences a defendant outside of the policy statement range without an adequate explanation. When a district court deviates from the policy statement range, Lopez asserts, it must provide an explicit rationale demonstrating that the United States Sentencing Commission unsoundly applied \u201cits fact-findings to its statutory purpose\u201d in crafting the relevant guideline provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-23\">In choosing a sentence, a district court must consider most of the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the policy statements found in Chapter Seven of the Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. B, intro, comment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Contrary to Lopez\u2019s contention that, under <em>FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., </em>556 U.S. 502, 129 S.Ct. 1800, 173 L.Ed.2d 738 (2009), an explicit rationale <em>should </em>be required for a district court setting a non-guidelines sentence on revocation, we have required, based on \u00a7 3553(c) and <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356-57, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), that the district court provide \u201csome explanation\u201d if it imposes a revocation sentence that falls outside a defendant\u2019s advisory sentencing guidelines range. <em>Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 261-62. \u201c[A] district court need not engage in a checklist recitation of the section 3553(a) factors,\u201d <em>United States v. Kippers, </em>685 F.3d 491, 498 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), but should articulate reasons that are sufficient to \u201csatisfy the appellate court that [the district court] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In setting the sentence in the instant matter, the district court permitted Lopez\u2019s counsel and Lopez himself to address the court regarding the appropriate sentence. The district court then noted that Lopez began his supervised release in October 2010, but by 2011 was already involved in a drug transaction, had failed to submit two urine samples to his probation officer, and had failed to notify his probation officer of a change in his employment. In light of these facts, the district court determined that the policy statement range was inadequate to address Lopez\u2019s conduct, although the statutory maximum was too high. The district court concluded that a sentence of 36 months of imprisonment was \u201cnecessary to adequately and appropriately address the [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors the Court should consider in a revocation sentencing context.\u201d The district court\u2019s explanation of Lopez\u2019s sentence indicates that the district court considered the policy statement range, the specific facts of Lopez\u2019s situation, and Lopez\u2019s argument in favor of a lower sentence. As such, the explanation was adequate under <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
