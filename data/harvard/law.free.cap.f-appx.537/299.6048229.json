Burnett pleaded true to three \u201ctechnical\u201d violations of his supervised release conditions but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>contested the allegation that he violated the conditions by committing other crimes, specifically, assaulting a neighbor and spanking a child with a belt without parental permission. The district court found that, in addition to the admitted violations, Burnett had violated the condition that prohibited him from committing another crime by assaulting his neighbor but not by disciplining the child. Burnett appeals the sentence imposed following the revocation of his supervised release, arguing for the first time on appeal that the district court erred in relying in part on hearsay statements regarding the assault allegation in violation of his due process right to confrontation. Because we cannot conclude on the record that the error affected Burnett\u2019s substantial rights, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In 2008, Bryan Burnett pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute fifty kilograms or more of marijuana and was sentenced to thirty-six months in prison and two years of supervised release. Burnett began his term of supervised release on May 11, 2011. In September of 2012, his probation officer alleged that Burnett had violated the conditions of his supervised release, and initiated proceedings to revoke his status as a releasee.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The probation officer alleged that Burnett violated the terms of his supervised release by: (1) committing other crimes, <em>viz., </em>allegedly punching a neighbor on March 30, 2012, and spanking a child with a belt without the parent\u2019s permission on September 18, 2012; and (2) committing a number of \u201ctechnical\u201d violations of the terms of his supervised release, <em>viz., </em>submitting untruthful reports to his probation officer for eight months; failing to notify his probation officer of changes in his residence and employment; associating with a convicted felon; failing to answer truthfully inquiries of his probation officer regarding his residence and his association with a convicted felon; and failing to report his contact with law enforcement officers. Burnett\u2019s alleged contact with law enforcement officers included several speeding tickets and one incident during a traffic stop in which Burnett allegedly brandished an Exacto knife, causing the officer to draw his weapon and order Burnett to drop the knife; Burnett complied and stated, \u201cshoot me, go ahead and shoot me,\u201d and was ultimately released without a charge. Burnett pleaded \u201cnot true\u201d to violating the conditions by committing the two alleged assaults but pleaded \u201ctrue\u201d to the remaining, \u201ctechnical\u201d violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Burnett\u2019s probation officer testified about the alleged March 30 assault but acknowledged that she lacked personal knowledge of the incident, and instead based her testimony on information from Dallas police officers, a police report, photographs of the victim obtained from the officers and from the victim, and Burnett\u2019s, his girlfriend\u2019s, and the victim\u2019s descriptions of the incident. Among other things, the probation officer testified that Burnett \u201ctold [her] that he had put his hands on [the victim] and that he went to jail, that he had messed up[.]\u201d Natalia Latin, who lived with Burnett for a period of time, testified during the revocation hearing about Burnett\u2019s alleged assault on their neighbor. She testified that, based on what her son had told her, she believed that Burnett assaulted the neighbor because the neighbor, had \u201cmade some type of gesture or statement that made [her] son feel threatened and [Burnett] did what he felt like he needed to do to protect him[.]\u201d Both Ms. Latin and the probation officer also testified about the alleged spanking incident. Ms. Latin testified that Burnett had disciplined her son by spanking him because her son lied to Burnett <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>about a disciplinary issue at school. Burnett argued that there were no appropriate documents to show that the spanking was a violation that would result in increasing his advisory guidelines range above one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The Government also argued that Burnett had disregarded the conditions of his supervision, as shown by his technical violations, and in light of that, Burnett\u2019s long history of violence, and the two alleged assaults, it requested a sentence of eighteen months. Burnett acknowledged that he had a history of serious violence as a juvenile but pointed to the fact that now, at forty years old, he had a long history of employment, and the crime for which he was on supervision was not a violent offense. He asked the court to continue his supervision within a halfway house or in community service or, alternatively, to give him a short sentence at the bottom of the advisory range (between three and ten months).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The district court revoked Burnett\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to a year and a day in prison. The district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">Having heard the motion to revoke supervised release and the defendant\u2019s admission of true to some of the allegations in the motion, it is the opinion of the court the motion should be granted. And regardless of whether it\u2019s a grade B or grade A violation the result is the same. I\u2019m finding him \u2014 that he violated all the ones that he admitted he violated and so this is \u2014 I\u2019m basing it on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">And I do find that he did violate condition number 1, with regard to the incident at the Bayou Bend Apartments [on March 30] and that he did hit that young man with regard to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">With regard to the spanking incident, I\u2019m not basing it on that. I\u2019m just not. So based upon that I\u2019m going to sentence the defendant to the custody of the United States Bureau of Prisons for a term of 12 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">And I\u2019m not ordering any further supervised release. I don\u2019t think this has \u2014 it just hasn\u2019t suited Mr. Burnett. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re doing him any good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">Burnett filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">Burnett contends that the district court erred by admitting out-of-court statements regarding the alleged assault on his neighbor in violation of his due process right to confront adverse witnesses against him. As Burnett concedes, because he did not raise this claim of error in the district court, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). To prevail, Burnett must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Even if he makes such a showing, we will not exercise our discretion to correct the error unless the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-16\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-17\">Due process requires that a person in supervised release revocation proceedings have \u201cthe right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses!,] \u2022 \u2022 \u25a0 unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation^]\u201d <em>United States v.

[b]eeause a person\u2019s liberty is at stake, ... due process requires that a defendant be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>given a fair and meaningful opportunity to refute and challenge adverse evidence to assure that the court\u2019s relevant findings are based on verified facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Grandlund, </em>71 F.3d 507, 509-10 (5th Cir.1995), <em>opinion clarified, </em>77 F.3d 811 (5th Cir.1996) (citing, <em>inter alia, Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 786, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973); <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972)). \u201cThe defendant\u2019s rights in a revocation hearing include a qualified right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510; <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(2)(C) (providing that, in a supervised release revocation hearing, the releasee \u201cis entitled to ... an opportunity to ... question any adverse witness unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear\u201d). \u201cThe confrontation of a particular witness may be disallowed upon a finding of good cause. In its determination whether good cause exists, courts must employ a balancing test which weighs the defendant\u2019s interest in the confrontation of a particular witness against the government\u2019s interest in the matter. A critical consideration is the indicia of reliability of the challenged evidence.\u201d <em>Grandlund, </em>71 F.3d at 510 (citations omitted). To that end, \u201cthere must be an explicit, specific finding of good cause, and the reasons should be made a part of the record of the revocation hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Thus, our precedents have long established that district courts must apply this balancing test when presented with hearsay testimony arguably in violation of the releasee\u2019s due process right to confrontation. <em>See, e.g., Grandlund, </em>71 F.3d at 510 &amp; n. 6 (\u201cIn its determination whether good cause exists, courts <em>must </em>employ a balancing test which weighs the defendant\u2019s interest in the confrontation of a particular witness against the government\u2019s interest in the matter.... [Tjhere must be an explicit, specific finding of good cause, and the reasons should be made a part of the record of the revocation hearing.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>United States v. Alaniz-Alaniz, </em>38 F.3d 788, 791 (5th Cir.1994) (assuming the district court\u2019s failure to balance the releasee\u2019s due process confrontation right with good cause was plain error, and affirming on the ground that the error did not affect the releasee\u2019s substantial rights); Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(2)(C) (providing that, in a supervised release revocation hearing, the releasee \u201cis entitled to ... an opportunity to ... question any adverse witness unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear\u201d (emphasis added)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The constitutional error Burnett alleges was clear or obvious under the foregoing authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The government argues that the denial of Burnett\u2019s due process right to confrontation was not plain error because Burnett did not object to the admission of the hearsay evidence during his revocation hearing. Specifically, the government argues that the right to confrontation in a final revocation hearing is conditioned upon the defendant\u2019s affirmative request to confront a hearsay witness, citing as support <em>McBride v. Johnson, </em>118 F.3d 432, 437 (5th Cir.1997) (noting that, during a preliminary hearing on parole revocation proceedings, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses \u201cis a \u2018conditional one\u2019 \u2014 the condition being the parolee\u2019s affirmative request to confront an adverse witness\u201d). The government\u2019s reliance on <em>McBride </em>is misplaced. There, we specifi-</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>cally distinguished between a parolee\u2019s limited right to confront witnesses at a <em>preliminary </em>hearing on parole revocation proceedings and a parole \u201cfinal revocation hearing whose purpose goes beyond a determination of probable cause \u2018to a final evaluation of any contested relevant facts and consideration of whether the facts as determined warrant revocation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. at 488, 92 S.Ct. 2593). In final parole revocation hearings, courts must adhere to all of the \u201cessential protections required by the Due Process Clause,\u201d including \u201c \u2018the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation)[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. 2593). The reason, we explained, for this rule is that hearsay evidence \u201c \u2018presents a twofold problem: it prevents the parolee from confronting and cross-examining the declarant, and unreliable hearsay undermines the accuracy of the fact-finding process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438 (quoting <em>Farrish v. Miss. State Parole Bd., </em>836 F.2d 969, 978 (5th Cir.1988)). Parolees and releasees may face steep penalties if they are found in violation of their terms of release. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>Accordingly, we have held that, for final, as opposed to preliminary, revocation proceedings where the releasee\u2019s \u201cliberty is at stake, ... due process requires that [he] be given a fair and meaningful opportunity to refute and challenge adverse evidence\u201d; to that end, \u201ccourts must employ a balancing test which weighs the defendant\u2019s interest in the confrontation of a particular witness against the government\u2019s interest in the matter.\u201d <em>Grandlund, </em>71 F.3d at 509-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">It is undisputed that much of the testimony that the government presented constituted hearsay, including the parole officer\u2019s testimony regarding the assault allegations based not upon her own firsthand knowledge but upon police reports and out-of-court statements by the victim, and Ms. Latin\u2019s testimony summarizing what her son had told her about the incident. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 802.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Burnett is correct that the hearsay statements were inadmissible against him at the revocation hearing without an opportunity to confront the witnesses against him unless there was good cause to deny the opportunity to confront them. <em>See Grandlund, </em>71 F.3d at 510; <em>McBride v. Johnson, </em>118 F.3d at 437-38; Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(2)(C). However, because Burnett did not object during the hearing, we will not reverse and remand for the district court to make a good-cause determination in the first instance unless Burnett has met his burden under the plain error rule to show that the error affected his substantial rights. We therefore turn to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">On the next prong of plain error review, whether the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, Burnett must show that, but for the asserted error, the district court would not have revoked his term of supervised release or that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the asserted error, he would have received a lower sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 647 (5th Cir.2010); <em>see also Alaniz-Alaniz, </em>38 F.3d at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">Even if Burnett had not committed a Grade A or B violation within the meaning of the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court was authorized to revoke Burnett\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>supervised release if it found by a preponderance of the evidence that he had violated a condition of his release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(a)(2). Even without the now-challenged evidence regarding the March assault, the evidence of Burnett\u2019s admitted technical violations, and his plea of \u201ctrue\u201d to those technical violations, supported the district court\u2019s revocation decision. Among those technical violations was his failure to report the traffic stop incident during which Burnett brandished an Exacto knife. Moreover, Burnett does not challenge the admissibility of his probation officer\u2019s testimony that Burnett admitted to \u201cputting his hands on\u201d his neighbor during the March 30 incident or the photographs of the victim\u2019s bruises.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The district court, after a review of all of these factors, concluded that twelve months and one day of imprisonment, without the imposition of any further terms of supervised release, was the appropriate sentence for Burnett. On the record before us, we conclude that Burnett has not met his burden of showing that, but for the asserted error regarding the March assault, the district court would not have revoked his supervised release or would have given him a lower sentence upon revocation. Because Burnett fails to demonstrate that the error affected his substantial rights, reversal upon plain error review is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-5\">. <em>Cf.
