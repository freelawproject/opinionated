He contends, in part, that the district court erred in calculating his applicable guideline range because it increased his offense level by 24 levels based on two specific offense characteristics \u2014 amount of loss and number of victims, <em>see </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(J) and (b)(2)(C) \u2014 in the absence of supporting evidence or individualized findings regarding the scope of his criminal activity. Because, as the government concedes, the court\u2019s findings regarding these enhancements lacked evidentiary support, we vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-21\">\u201c[0]nee a defendant objects to a fact contained in the [Presentence Investigation Report (PSI) ], the government bears the burden of proving that disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2009). \u201c[Ajbsent a stipulation or agreement between the parties, an attorney\u2019s factual assertions at a sentencing hearing do not constitute evidence that a district court can rely on.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>714 F.3d 1358, 1361 (11th Cir.2013). Ultimately, \u201c[i]t is the district court\u2019s duty to ensure that the Government carries this burden by presenting reliable and specific evidence.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>584 F.3d at 1027 (quotation marks omitted). And if a-court breaches this duty by imposing a sentencing enhancement without demanding that the government present sufficient evidence to support a disputed, underlying fact, we generally will vacate and remand. <em>See id. </em>at 1029; <em>see also Washington, </em>714 F.3d at 1362-63 (vacating the defendant\u2019s sentence because the district court imposed a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>tencing enhancement based on the government\u2019s unsupported representations).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">As the government concedes, the district court in this case erred in its fact finding regarding the loss amount attributable to Ferrao and the number of victims insofar as the findings lacked evidentiary support. Ferrao objected to the PSI\u2019s determination of the loss amount and number of victims \u2014 both before and during sentencing \u2014 for lack of evidence. While at sentencing the government said it would be \u201chappy to provide the Court with all of the receipts\u201d documenting the \u201ctotal extent of the fraud,\u201d the district court never asked for such evidence and the government never provided it. This, despite Ferrao\u2019s objections. The court ultimately relied on the government\u2019s unsubstantiated representations, however, and because we have expressly deemed that such representations are not evidence, the court clearly erred in doing so. <em>See Washington, </em>714 F.3d at 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">We agree with the government\u2019s concession that this error was not hai\u2019mless. Without the erroneous enhancements, Ferrao\u2019s guideline range would have been zero to six months in prison. With the enhancements, his applicable guideline range was 135 to 168 months in prison, resulting in a 60 month guideline sentence because Ferrao\u2019s statutorily authorized maximum sentence was 60 months. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 5G1.1(a); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1029(b)(2), (c)(1)(A)(i). We conclude that this discrepancy yields grave doubt that Ferrao\u2019s sentence would have remained the same without the error, warranting vacatur and remand. <em>See United States v. Pacchioli, </em>718 F.3d 1294, 1305 (11th Cir.2013) (explaining that we will reverse \u201cif [the errors] have a \u2018substantial influence\u2019 on the outcome of a case or leave \u2018grave doubt\u2019 as to whether they affected the outcome of a case\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">Finally, the 24-level enhancement for amount of loss and number of victims under USSG \u00a7\u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(J) and (b)(2)(c) is set aside and the case is remanded for resentencing without that enhancement. <em>See Washington, </em>714 F.3d at 1362 (\u201cNothing prevented the government \u2014 which was aware of [the defendant\u2019s] objection \u2014 from putting on evidence concerning the number of victims at the sentencing hearing, and a party who bears the burden on a contested sentencing issue will generally not get to try again on remand if its evidence is found to be insufficient on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
