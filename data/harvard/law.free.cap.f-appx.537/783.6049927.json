BACHARACH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b799-31\">Mr. Ernest Jan Fowlke appeals the Tax Court\u2019s assessment of additional taxes and imposition of sanctions. Mr. Fowlke admits that he earned money, but denies a duty to pay income tax. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Mr. Fowlke did not file federal income tax returns from 2004 to 2008. Based on substitute- returns, the Internal Revenue Service assessed tax deficiencies under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6651(a)(1) (failure to file timely tax returns), \u00a7 6651(a)(2) (failure to timely pay taxes), and \u00a7 6654 (failure to make estimated tax payments). Mr. Fowlke challenged these assessments by petitioning the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue moved for judgment on the pleadings, and Mr. Fowlke moved to dismiss. With these filings, the Tax Court held a hearing and found that the claims involved a meritless protest against the federal income tax system. Thus, the court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion, denied Mr. Fowlke\u2019s motion to dismiss on grounds of mootness, and sanctioned Mr. Fowlke for making frivolous arguments. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">\n<em>Tax Court\u2019s Alleged Delay in Filing Documents</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">According to Mr. Fowlke, the Tax Court delayed filing his motion to dismiss and response to the Commissioner\u2019s motion. With this contention, Mr. Fowlke asserts that the Tax Court ruled without the benefit of his response brief. These representations are incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Mr. Fowlke states that the Tax Court \u201centered\u201d the motion to dismiss and response brief on March 6, 2012, conducted a hearing six days later, and issued a decision over a month later. Appellant\u2019s Informal Br. at 4-5. Thus, even under Mr. Fowlke\u2019s chronology, the Tax Court would have had the benefit of the motion to dismiss and response brief at the time of the hearing. This sequence is confirmed in the record, for the judge in Tax Court referred to Mr. Fowlke\u2019s motion to dismiss and response brief. Tr. at 3. Because the judge had the motion to dismiss and response brief when she conducted the hearing, any delay in filing the documents would not have affected the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">\n<em>The Commissioner\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">We conduct de novo review over the Tax Court\u2019s grant of judgment on the pleadings. <em>See Nelson v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>419 F.3d 1117, 1119 (10th Cir.2005) (a motion for judgment on the pleadings is reviewed de novo).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">In challenging the Tax Court\u2019s judgment, Mr. Fowlke argues that he is not subject to taxation, that the income tax falls on earnings from \u201cprivileges\u201d but not \u201crights,\u201d that the tax falls only on \u201cUnited States persons\u201d and he is not one, that the Tax Examiner lacked authority to issue a notice of deficiency, and that the Tax Court lacked jurisdiction. These arguments are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">First, Mr. Fowlke argues that the tax is imposed on income, but is not directed to any person or entity. We rejected this argument in <em>Charczuk v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>771 F.2d 471, 473 (10th Cir.1985), and must follow that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-14\">The second argument is that the Constitution confines the taxation power to privileges, rather than rights (such as the right to earn a living). We rejected this argument, as well, in <em>Charczuk, </em>771 F.2d at 472-73, and characterized the argument as frivolous in <em>Lonsdale v. United States, </em>919 F.2d 1440, 1447-48 (10th Cir.1990). Again, we must follow these precedents and reject Mr. Fowlke\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-15\">Third, Mr. Fowlke denies that he is a \u201cUnited States person\u201d because that phrase is used elsewhere to refer to foreign corporations. This contention is frivolous. The tax code defines the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>\u201cUnited States person\u201d to include citizens or residents of the United States. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a)(30) (2006). Because Mr. Fowlke does not deny that he is a citizen or resident of the United States, he is considered a \u201cUnited States person\u201d under the tax law.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Fourth, Mr. Fowlke contends that the notice of deficiency was issued by a Tax Examiner, who exceeded his authority under the Internal Revenue Manual. But, the Manual does not give rights to the taxpayer. <em>See Armstrong v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>15 F.3d 970, 975 (10th Cir.1994) (holding that the Internal Revenue Manual is directory rather than mandatory and lacks the force and effect of law). Thus, we reject Mr. Fowlke\u2019s argument based on the Internal Revenue Manual.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Mr. Fowlke\u2019s fifth argument is that the Tax Court lacked jurisdiction because he is not a \u201ctaxpayer.\u201d This argument is circular because it turns on his contention, rejected elsewhere, that he is not subject to the income tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The Tax Court has jurisdiction over cases begun by \u201ctaxpayers.\u201d Tax Court Rule 13(a)(1). Under federal law, the term \u201ctaxpayer\u201d includes \u201cany person subject to any internal revenue tax.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a)(14) (2006). As discussed elsewhere, Mr. Fowlke is subject to the income tax; as a result, the Tax Court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">\n<em>Sanctions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">In addition to challenging the Tax Court\u2019s finding of a deficiency, Mr. Fowlke challenges its imposition of sanctions. We reject this challenge. The Tax Court is authorized to impose sanctions up to $25,000 when a taxpayer suit is frivolous or intended to create delay. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673(a)(l)(A)-(B) (2006). The court applied this authority here, sanctioning Mr. Fowlke $5,000 because it viewed Mr. Fowlke\u2019s claims as groundless. Tr. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">We review these sanctions for an abuse of discretion;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in doing so, we conclude that the Tax Court acted within its discretion. Like the district court, we believe that Mr. Fowlke\u2019s underlying arguments are groundless because they are plainly foreclosed by governing case law or statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">As a result, we affirm the Tax Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b799-19\"> This order and judgment does not constitute precedent. See Tenth Cir. R. 32.1(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-10\">. <em>See Lewis v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service, </em>523 F.3d 1272, 1274 (10th Cir. 2008) (\u201cTax Court sanctions are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
