We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we vacate and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Delgadillo contends that the government breached the plea agreement by indicating in a footnote in its sentencing summary chart that the presentence report \u201ccorrectly\u201d calculated a sentence enhancement and that the government had failed to account for the prior conviction in its calculation due to an \u201coversight,\u201d but that it would nevertheless \u201cstand[] by\u201d the lesser enhancement it had agreed to in the plea agreement. Even if Delgadillo did not waive this argument, the government did not breach the plea agreement by noting that the sentence enhancement was correctly calculated under plain error review. <em>See United States v. Cannel, </em>517 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th Cir.2008) (holding on plain error review that the government did not breach its plea agreement where it \u201cagreed that the PSR accurately assessed\u201d predicate conduct that supported a five-level sentence enhancement but stated that it \u201cstands by its original plea agreement recommendation\u201d of a two-level enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">However, the district court erred by applying an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) on the basis of a prior conviction for delivery of a controlled substance without first identifying the statute of conviction and analyzing it under <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), to determine whether it satisfied the Guidelines definition of a felony drug trafficking offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) (providing a sentence enhancement for certain \u201cfelony drug trafficking offense[s]\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. 1(B)(iv) &amp; 2 (defining \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1) and \u201cfelony\u201d for purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B)); <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>278 F.3d 880, 885 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc) (\u201cThe district court did not.... analyze the statutes of conviction to determine whether the <em>Taylor </em>standard was in fact met, as <em>Taylor </em>directs courts to do.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Pimentel-Flores, </em>339 F.3d 959, 968-69 (9th Cir.2003) (vacating a sentence and remanding where the district court ruled that a prior offense was a qualifying offense \u201cbased only on the facts recited in the PSR\u201d where the presentence report did not list the statute of conviction). The district court also erred to the extent it based its application of the enhancement on the probation officer\u2019s characterization of Delgadillo\u2019s prior offense as a felony drug trafficking offense. <em>See United States v. Castillo-Marin, </em>684 F.3d 914, 920 (9th Cir.2012) (\u201c[W]e have recognized that a district court may not base a sentence enhancement on the PSR\u2019s characterization of a prior offense as a qualifying offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">Because there are no documents in the record that establish Delgadillo\u2019s statute of conviction or whether the conviction constitutes a \u201cfelony drug trafficking offense,\u201d we vacate Delgadillo\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing, on an open record. <em>See Matthews, </em>278 F.3d at 885.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b706-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
