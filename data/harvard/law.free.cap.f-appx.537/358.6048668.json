For the reasons that follow, we DENY the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (\u201cCSB\u201d) is an independent governmental board composed of experts in industrial safety and environmental health. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(r)(6)(A)-(B). It is charged with investigating any actual or potential \u201caccidental release\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201can unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the ambient air from a stationary source,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 7412(r)(2)(A) \u2014 and with recommending measures to prevent future accidental releases. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7412(r)(6)(C), (F).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">On April 20, 2010, a blowout and subsequent explosion occurred at the Macondo lease site on the United States Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. According to Transocean, oil traveled up the riser to the deck of the mobile offshore drilling unit (\u201cMODU\u201d), where it combusted in a fire until the MODU collapsed and sank two days later. <em>See In Re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig \u201cDeepwater </em>Horizon\u201d <em>in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010 (In Re: \u201cDeepwater Horizon </em>\u201d), 844 F.Supp.2d 746, 748 &amp; n. 4 (E.D.La.2012) (order on cross-motions for partial summary judgment). As separate Transocean and government investigative teams later stated, the blowout emitted large amounts of hazardous gases, which \u201cmade an explosion inevitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Invoking its jurisdiction to investigate accidental releases of regulated or extremely hazardous substances into the ambient air, the CSB asked Transocean (the MODU\u2019s owner) to preserve all evidence relevant to the CSB\u2019s investigation of the incident. The CSB later served Trans-ocean with administrative subpoenas, demanding documents that had been collected by a Transocean internal investigative team, as well as documents that had been provided to other government agencies. As later alleged, Transocean only partially complied with the subpoenas. On October 12, 2011, after almost one year of seeking Transocearis compliance through non-judicial means, the government filed in the district court a petition to enforce the CSB\u2019s subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Transocean moved to dismiss the petition and quash the subpoenas, arguing that the CSB lacked statutory authority to investigate the Macondo well incident. After considering the parties\u2019 written submissions and oral arguments, the district court, in a comprehensive opinion, denied Transocearis motion and granted the government\u2019s petition to enforce the subpoenas. Final judgment was entered on April 22, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Transocean asked the district court to stay execution of its judgment pending appeal. The district court temporarily stayed its judgment to permit further briefing. After considering the parties\u2019 arguments, the district court denied the motion. Transocean now asks this court for a stay pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">II. LEGAL STANDARDS</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u201cA stay is not a matter of right.... It is instead an exercise of judicial discretion, and the propriety of its issue is dependent upon the circumstances of the particular case.\u201d <em>Nken v. Holder, </em>556 U.S. 418, 433, 129 S.Ct. 1749, 173 L.Ed.2d 550 (2009) (alteration omitted) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a stay pending appeal for abuse of discretion. <em>Beverly v. United States, </em>468 F.2d 732, 740 n. 13 (5th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that a four-factor test governs a court\u2019s consideration of a motion for stay pending appeal: \u201c(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\u201d <em>Nken, </em>556 U.S. at 434, 129 S.Ct. 1749 (citation omitted); <em>see, e.g., Chafin v. Chafin, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1017, 1027, 185 L.Ed.2d 1 (2013); <em>Hilton v. Braunskill, </em>481 U.S. 770, 776, 107 S.Ct. 2113, 95 L.Ed.2d 724 (1987). Under this \u201ctraditional standard,\u201d the first two factors \u201care the most critical.\u201d <em>Nken, </em>556 U.S. at 434, 129 S.Ct. 1749. The final two factors \u201cmerge when the Government is the opposing party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435, 129 S.Ct. 1749. The applicant bears the burden of showing that a stay is justified. <em>Id. </em>at 433-34, 129 S.Ct. 1749.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">Instead of seeking to satisfy the traditional standard, in which courts begin by evaluating whether an applicant has made a \u201cstrong showing\u201d that success on the merits is likely, Transocean turns to our decision in <em>Ruiz v. Estelle (Ruiz I), </em>650 F.2d 555 (5th Cir. Unit A June 1981) (per curiam). We held in <em>Ruiz I </em>that on a motion for stay pending appeal \u201cthe movant need not always show a \u2018probability\u2019 of success on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565. \u201c[I]n-stead, the movant need only present a substantial case on the merits when a serious legal question is involved and show that the balance of the equities weighs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>heavily in favor of granting the stay.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>While citing <em>Ruiz I, </em>however, Transocean asks us to apply a variant of <em>Ruiz I </em>that uses a sliding scale approach \u201cin which the probability of success that must be demonstrated is inversely proportionate to the amount of irreparable injury that would be suffered absent a stay.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Transocean Mot. at 4. While the sliding scale approach has been adopted by some other circuits, <em>see, e.g., Davis v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., </em>571 F.3d 1288, 1291-92 (D.C.Cir. 2009); <em>Thapa v. Gonzales, </em>460 F.3d 323, 334 (2d Cir.2006), we have continued to use the <em>Ruiz I </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In repeatedly reaffirming <em>Ruiz I, </em>we have reiterated that \u201c[ljikelihood of success remains a prerequisite in the usual case\u201d and \u201c[ojnly \u2018if the balance of equities <em>(i.e. </em>consideration of the other three factors) is ... <em>heavily tilted </em>in the movant\u2019s favor\u2019 will we issue a stay in its absence, and, even then, the issue must be one with patent substantial merit.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. Estelle (Ruiz II), </em>666 F.2d 854, 856-57 (5th Cir. 1982) (quoting <em>Ruiz I, </em>650 F.2d at 565-66); <em>see also Weingarten Realty Investors v. Miller, </em>661 F.3d 904, 910 (5th Cir.2011); <em>Arnold v. Garlock, Inc., </em>278 F.3d 426, 438-39 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Wildmon v. Berwick Universal Pictures, </em>983 F.2d 21, 23-24 (5th Cir.1992); <em>O\u2019Bryan v. McKaskle, </em>729 F.2d 991, 993 (5th Cir.1984) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Because Transocean relies on <em>Ruiz </em>and the government argues in a similar vein, we will consider this matter under the <em>Ruiz </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">Transocean has failed to satisfy its burden under <em>Ruiz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">A. Success on the Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">Transocean has not even attempted to make a \u201cstrong showing that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits.\u201d <em>Nken, </em>556 U.S. at 434, 129 S.Ct. 1749. Instead, invoking <em>Ruiz, </em>it relies on the \u201csubstantial case on the merits\u201d standard. Seeking to satisfy <em>Ruiz\u2019s </em>prerequisites, Transocean argues that \u201cserious legal questions\u201d are implicated in this matter. The district court agreed, stating \u201c[t]he questions include whether, under the Clean Air Act and related regulations, the <em>Deepwater Horizon </em>qualifies as a \u2018stationary source\u2019 and whether the release of gasses from the seabed went into the \u2018ambient air.\u2019 \u201d We assume, without deciding, that Transocean has raised serious questions respecting statutory interpretation and the CSB\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See Wildmon, </em>983 F.2d at 24 (a legal question may be \u201cserious\u201d when it implicates \u201cfar-reaching effects or public concerns\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">While ruling firmly against Transocean on the merits, the district court also concluded that Transocean had made out a \u201csubstantial case.\u201d Again, we assume, without deciding, that the district court is correct on this point. So, for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>our <em>Ruiz </em>inquiry, we accept that Trans-ocean has raised serious legal questions and has made a substantial case on the merits. Regardless, the three <em>Ruiz </em>equities do not \u201cweigh heavily\u201d in favor of granting a stay. <em>See Ruiz, </em>650 F.2d at 565. Accordingly, Transocean fails the <em>Ruiz </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">B. Irreparable Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The second factor in the traditional test (and the first of the three equities under Ruiz) is \u201cwhether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay.\u201d <em>Nken, </em>556 U.S. at 434, 129 S.Ct. 1749. Under the traditional test, this factor and the \u201clikelihood of success\u201d factor are \u201cthe most critical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This factor weighs against Transocean because it has offered no valid reason why immediately turning over the subpoenaed documents will cause irreparable injury. <em>See Weingarten, </em>661 F.3d at 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Transocean\u2019s principal argument is that denial of a stay \u2014 i.e., being forced immediately to comply with the subpoenas \u2014 will cause irreparable injury by mooting its appeal. This is so, Transocean argues, because compliance with the subpoenas will remove it from \u201can adversarial posture with CSB.\u201d <em>See Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 721, 726, 184 L.Ed.2d 553 (2013) (\u201cA case becomes moot ... when the issues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">In <em>Church of Scientology of California v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 9, 10-11, 113 S.Ct. 447, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992), the Supreme Court discussed whether a matter was rendered moot by compliance with a district court\u2019s final order enforcing an IRS summons that permitted tax agents to examine and make copies of certain records (a close parallel to the subpoenas at issue here). The Court held that although \u201ca court may not be able to return the parties to the <em>status quo ante,\u201d </em>a case is not moot if a court \u201ccan fashion <em>some </em>form of meaningful relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12-13, 113 S.Ct. 447. When documents have been provided pursuant to a subpoena later found to be unlawful, a court can fashion \u201cmeaningful relief\u2019 by ordering the documents returned. <em>Id. </em>This is because the owner of subpoenaed documents retains \u201can obvious possessory interest in [its] records.\u201d <em>Id.; see also In re Motor Fuel Temperature Sales Practices Litig., </em>641 F.3d 470, 483 (10th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Constr. Prods. Research, Inc., </em>73 F.3d 464, 469 (2d Cir.1996); <em>FTC v. Gibson Prods. of San Antonio, Inc., </em>569 F.2d 900, 903 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">Transocean contends this reasoning is inapposite because, in each of the cases we have cited, the party resisting the subpoena had a privacy interest in the subpoenaed documents or was subject to a criminal or civil enforcement action by the agency seeking the records. Transocean has repeatedly emphasized that it retains no privacy interest in the documents the CSB seeks,' many of which are publicly available as a result of earlier government investigations and civil litigation against Transocean. <em>See In Re: \u201cDeepwater Horizon\u201d </em>No. 10-md-02179 (E.D. La. filed Aug. 10, 2010). Further, although the CSB may investigate accidental releases and recommend measures to prevent future releases, it cannot enforce its own regulations. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(r)(6)(0). More than that, its \u201cconclusions, findings, or recommendations\u201d cannot be used in an \u201caction or suit for damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7412(r)(6)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">Transocean\u2019s argument is unavailing. In <em>Church of Scientology, </em>the Supreme Court held out as separate a party\u2019s possessory interest and its privacy interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>subpoenaed records. 506 U.S. at 12-13, 113 S.Ct. 447; <em>see also Soldal v. Cook County, Ill., </em>506 U.S. 56, 62-66, 113 S.Ct. 538, 121 L.Ed.2d 450 (1992) (discussing the independent nature of possessory and privacy interests under the Fourth Amendment); <em>ADAPT of Phila. v. Phila. Hous. Auth., </em>417 F.3d 390, 393-94 (3d Cir.2005) (holding that documents\u2019 return would provide relief, \u201chowever Pyrrhic,\u201d with respect to possessory interests, and would \u201calleviate, at least in part, any affront to\u201d privacy rights that had already been violated); <em>Reich v. Nat\u2019l Eng\u2019g &amp; Contracting Co., </em>13 F.3d 93, 98 (4th Cir.1993) (recognizing <em>Church of Scientology\u2019s </em>distinction between possessory and privacy interests). Although Transoeean contends that the documents\u2019 return would \u201cprovide[ ] no relief whatsoever to Transocean,\u201d the Supreme Court has held that mootness depends on whether a \u201clegally cognizable interest\u201d is still in play, <em>Already, LLC, </em>133 S.Ct. at 726, which is not necessarily the interest that is of most importance to a litigant. <em>See Church of Scientology, </em>506 U.S. at 13, 113 S.Ct. 447 (the relief provided need not be \u201cfully satisfactory\u201d). Because Transocean\u2019s possessory interest can be vindicated by ordering its records returned, this remedy\u2019s effectiveness does not depend on the documents\u2019 confidentiality. <em>See id. </em>at 12-13, 113 S.Ct. 447; <em>ADAPT of Phila., </em>417 F.3d at 393-94.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Transocean has identified no particular interest in the subpoenaed documents. If this is true, then we find it remarkable that Transocean has resisted the CSB\u2019s subpoenas for approximately thirty-one months, and continues to resist them on appeal. To be clear, Transocean has not argued that the burden of complying with the subpoenas is an irreparable injury, or that the absence of a stay will irrevocably deprive it of some other property or liberty interest. In any event, the district court correctly recognized that the harm to Transocean from producing documents that it has already provided to other government agencies \u201cis less than the burden of producing documents ... in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>instance.\u201d Further, how the lack of confidentiality strengthens Transocean\u2019s case for a stay escapes us because this means it will suffer no loss of privacy by immediately releasing the documents. Transocean cannot argue that it will suffer an irreparable injury by losing its right to vindicate an interest on appeal, but fail to enlighten us as to what that interest is. <em>See Nken, </em>556 U.S. at 433-34, 129 S.Ct. 1749. Trans-ocean points <em>only </em>to the prospect of its appeal being mooted if it complies with the subpoenas, and that argument is absolutely meritless. As the district court correctly held, Transocean cannot justify a stay merely by arguing that it should not have to comply with a subpoena enforcement order \u201cunless and until the appellate court says it must.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">C. Injury to CSB and the Public Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The \u201cinjury to the other parties\u201d and \u201cpublic interest\u201d factors \u201cmerge when the Government is the opposing party.\u201d <em>Nken, </em>556 U.S. at 435, 129 S.Ct. 1749. Accordingly, we consider them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The injury that a stay would work upon the government and the public is clear. As we have discussed, the CSB is authorized to investigate accidental releases of hazardous substances and make recommendations to prevent future releases. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(r)(6). Delaying the subpoenaed documents\u2019 release would impede the accomplishment of this mission, which is of unquestionable significance to workplace and public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The injury to the public is compounded by the great amount of time it has taken to secure enforcement of the CSB\u2019s subpoenas. Transocean has resisted the subpoenas for thirty-one months, of which twenty-one were consumed by litigation. An appeal in this court could take anywhere from one to three years. By the time the subpoenas\u2019 enforceability is finally determined, a delay in the documents\u2019 release may cause the CSB to have missed the opportunity to prevent another accident of the type that occurred on the <em>Deepwater Horizon, </em>which itself resulted in eleven deaths. If this danger were not obvious enough, a CSB lead investigator\u2019s affidavit confirms that documents Transocean is withholding are necessary to completing the CSB\u2019s report on the Macondo well incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Transocean argues that CSB will suffer no injury from a stay because various government agencies have already \u201creceived exhaustive information, documents, and records from Transocean concerning the BP Oil Spill\u201d through other investigations and the <em>Deepwater Horizon </em>litigation. The district court found, however, that the subpoenas cover some documents that have not been made available to other government agencies, and Transocean\u2019s bare argument does not satisfy its burden of proving otherwise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Nken, </em>556 U.S. at 433-34, 129 S.Ct. 1749. Moreover, Transocean has offered no authority suggesting that possession of subpoenaed documents by a different government agency can be imputed to the agency that issued the subpoena. If anything, the legal authority on this point contradicts Trans-ocean\u2019s position. <em>See United States v. Powell, </em>379 U.S. 48, 57-58, 85 S.Ct. 248, 13 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964) (to obtain enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>of a subpoena, the IRS must prove that it (not some other agency) does not already possess the sought-after information); <em>United States v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em>186 F.3d 644, 650 (5th Cir.1999) (a government agency\u2019s possession of documents does not satisfy a subpoena by the agency\u2019s independently operating inspector general).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Relying on <em>Holiday Tours, </em>559 F.2d at 843, Transocean contends that the public interest generally favors preservation of the status quo pending appeal. In <em>Holiday Tours, </em>the district court had enjoined the defendant bus tour service from operating without the appropriate certificate, but stayed its judgment pending appeal because enforcement would have meant the business\u2019s destruction. <em>Id. </em>The court of appeals explained that the plaintiff had not shown any particularized public interest that would overcome the injury to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>Transocean thus ignores that the equities in Holiday Tours favored maintaining the status quo. Moreover, the proponent of the status quo in <em>Holiday Tours </em>had prevailed below, whereas Transocean did not, and thus bears the burden of showing that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to issue a stay. Accordingly, Transocean\u2019s misreading of <em>Holiday Tours </em>is not a valid ground to perceive a public interest in any case where the status quo is disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Finally, Transocean submits that the public has an interest in having \u201cthe appellate courts ... consider! ] the serious legal questions raised in this ease\u201d \u2014 an interest that cannot be vindicated if its appeal becomes moot. Because Transocean\u2019s appeal will not be mooted by compliance with the subpoenas, we will have ample opportunity to consider the legal questions raised in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">D. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Even assuming that Transocean has made out a \u201csubstantial case\u201d with respect to a serious legal question, we find that it has given no reason why it should not immediately turn over the subpoenaed documents. The government has obtained a final enforcement order after being forced to litigate this matter for approximately twenty-one months. The CSB and the public, in addition to being \u201cgenerally entitled to the prompt execution of orders that the legislature has made final,\u201d <em>Nken, </em>556 U.S. at 427, 129 S.Ct. 1749, suffer further injury each day that the CSB is prevented from concluding its investigation into an industrial accident that resulted in eleven deaths. As we have explained, the prevention of similar accidents in the future is an important public interest. Transocean has utterly failed to justify making the government and the public wait any longer for the CSB\u2019s investigative report and safety recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Because Transocean has not established that \u201cthe balance of the equities weighs heavily in favor of granting the stay,\u201d Transocean fails to satisfy the <em>Ruiz </em>standard. 650 F.2d at 565. Transocean does not purport to have made a \u201cstrong showing that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits,\u201d and thus also has failed to satisfy its burden under the traditional test. <em>Nken, </em>556 U.S. at 435, 129 S.Ct. 1749. Even if it had made this showing, we likely would not grant a stay because the three remaining factors weigh against Trans-ocean.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">In reaching this conclusion, we find instructive the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that \u201c[a] stay is an intrusion into the ordinary processes of administration and judicial review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427, 129 S.Ct. 1749 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in finding that Transocean failed to justify such an intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>IV.

In a different part of its motion, it sets out the standard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">In order to merit a stay, the movant need establish only that the case was sufficiently close (or the issues sufficiently novel) such that the party has a reasonable likelihood of appellate success, and that there are equitable reasons for staying the relief temporarily. This standard is further loosened in cases, like this one, that present the courts with a serious legal question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-17\">Transocean Mot. at 7. This formulation is wrong, i.e., not faithful to our precedents, in all material respects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-5\">. Transocean relies on inapposite authority for its argument. In <em>Providence Journal Co. v. FBI, </em>595 F.2d 889, 890 (1st Cir. 1979), the FBI\u2019s right of appeal would have become moot absent a stay because, had the disputed documents been given to the plaintiff newspaper, their confidentiality would have \u201dbe[en] lost for all time.\" Transocean ignores that, in granting the stay, the court also considered the <em>Holiday Tours </em>factors, finding that they all weighed in the FBI\u2019s favor. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, because Transocean has disavowed any privacy interest in the subpoenaed records, <em>Providence Journal </em>is not comparable.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Transocean offers a number of cases in which the defendant\u2019s court-ordered compliance with an IRS subpoena mooted its appeal. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., </em>623 F.2d 720, 724-25 (1st Cir. 1980). These decisions have been effectively overruled. <em>See Church of Scientology, </em>506 U.S. at 15, 113 S.Ct. 447 (\u201d[T]his case is not moot because if the summons were improperly issued or enforced a court could order that the IRS' copies of the tapes be either returned or destroyed.\u201d); <em>United States v. Golden Valley Elec. Ass\u2019n, </em>689 F.3d 1108, 1112-13 (9th Cir.2012); <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>142 F.3d 1416, 1422 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">In <em>Texas Association of Business v. Earle, </em>388 F.3d 515, 517 (5th Cir.2004), a federal district court refused to enjoin enforcement of a state district attorney\u2019s grand jury subpoenas. We held that the issue of compliance with the subpoenas was moot because the state court defendants had released the documents pursuant to a state court order. <em>Id. </em>at 518. The panel did not cite <em>Church of Scientology, </em>nor did the parties mention it in their briefs. Subsequent cases discuss <em>Earle </em>in the context of abstention. Because <em>Church of Scientology </em>is squarely applicable in the instant circumstances, and <em>Earle </em>was decided in the context of an effort to obtain a ruling from a federal court enjoining a state district attorney\u2019s office from conducting a grand jury investigation (a situation far removed from ours), <em>Church of Scientology </em>provides the rule of decision that we apply today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\">. The Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, in vacating a conditional order transferring the government\u2019s enforcement petition to the MDL litigation in the Eastern District of Louisiana, similarly found that \u2018\u2018Transocean has not identified with any specificity the documents and information that it has produced in the MDL and that it believes to be responsive to the CSB's subpoenas.\u201d <em>In Re: \u201cDeepwater Horizon\", </em>No. 2:10-md-02179, slip op. at 2 (E.D.La.
