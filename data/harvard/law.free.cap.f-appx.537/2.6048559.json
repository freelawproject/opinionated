KATZMANN, Chief Judge, AMALYA L. KEARSE, RICHARD C. WESLEY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b26-18\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b26-19\">Plaintiff-Appellant Milan Cais, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment dismissing in its entirety Cais\u2019s complaint brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for alleged violations of his constitutional right to due process. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-20\">As an initial matter, to the extent that Cais seeks to challenge the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment dismissing his claims against Defendant-Appellee Keith Darin, Cais does not argue on appeal that the district court erred with respect to the claims against Darin, and indeed the judgment in favor of Darin was granted on the ground that Cais had formally withdrawn his claims against Darin. Thus, any challenge to the dismissal of the claims against Darin has been waived. <em>See Norton v. Sam\u2019s Club, </em>145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 1998) (\u201cIssues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal.\u201d); <em>LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>92-93 (2d Cir.1995) (applying the same principle to <em>pro se </em>litigants).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">As for Cais\u2019s other claims, \u201c[w]e review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.\u201d <em>Allianz Ins. Co. v. Lerner, </em>416 F.3d 109, 113 (2d Cir.2005). \u201cWe will affirm the judgment only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cHowever, reliance upon conclusory statements or mere allegations is not sufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion.\u201d <em>Davis v. New York, </em>316 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">An independent review of the record and relevant case law reveals that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees Donald Angersola and the Town of East Haddam. We affirm for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court in its July 14, 2011 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">We also deny Cais\u2019s pending motion to file a supplemental appendix and for an extension of time to file a reply brief. With respect to the proposed appendix, Cais did not present the included photographs and commentary to the district court, so we cannot consider them on appeal. <em>See Int\u2019l Bus. Machs. Corp. v. Edelstein, </em>526 F.2d 37, 45 (2d Cir.1975) (noting that, absent extraordinary circumstances, this Court will not enlarge the record on appeal to include evidentiary material not presented to the district court). And a review of Cais\u2019s defectively-filed reply brief reveals that it would not change the above analysis, as it largely relies on the impermissible new evidence in the proposed supplemental appendix, making a late submission unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">We have considered all of Cais\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
