We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-23\">Quintanilla had thirty days to timely file a petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2006). This time period is \u201cjurisdictional in nature and must be construed with strict fidelity to [its] terms.\u201d <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). The filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider with the Board does not toll the thirty-day period for seeking review of an underlying decision. <em>Id. </em>at 394, 115 S.Ct. 1537. Accordingly, our review is limited to the propriety of the Board\u2019s October 10, 2012 order denying Quintanilla\u2019s motion to reconsider and remand. We lack jurisdiction to review the August 17, 2011 order dismissing the appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s order and the April 12, 2012 order denying the first motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-24\">The Board\u2019s denial of reconsideration and reopening is reviewed for abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>discretion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2013); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Narine v. Holder, </em>559 F.3d 246, 249 (4th Cir.2009); <em>Mosere v. Mukasey, </em>552 F.3d 397, 400 (4th Cir.2009). A motion to reconsider asserts that the Board made an error in its earlier decision. The motion \u201cshall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). We will reverse a denial of a motion to reconsider \u201conly if the Board acted arbitrarily, irrationally, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Narine, </em>559 F.3d at 249 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">An alien may file one motion to reopen within ninety days of the entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (c)(7)(A), (C) (2006); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). This time limit does not apply if the basis for the motion is to seek asylum or withholding of removal based on changed country conditions, \u201cif such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii) (2006); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h). The Board\u2019s \u201cdenial of a motion to reopen is reviewed with extreme deference, given that motions to reopen are disfavored because every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Sadhvani v. Holder, </em>596 F.3d 180, 182 (4th Cir.2009) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The motion \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Such motion \u201cshall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">We conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying reconsideration or reopening. The record supports the finding that Quintanilla did not show that there was an error of law or fact in the Board\u2019s earlier decisions that would warrant reconsideration. We also note that insofar as Quintanilla sought reopening by submitting new evidence, substantial evidence supports the finding that he failed to show that his motion was timely and that the new evidence was previously unavailable and could not have been discovered or presented at his hearing before the immigration judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-6\"> Because Quintanilla submitted new evidence with the motion, the Board also construed the motion to reconsider as a motion to reopen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
