Cabrera asserts that the district court was biased against him, that the district court perpetrated a fraud by preventing Cabrera from prosecuting his claim IFP, that the district court itself should have obtained the inmate account statement which it ordered Cabrera to file in support of his IFP application, and that Cabrera was not required to pay filing fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>because his complaint was in the nature of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. Cabrera also seeks appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">By moving to proceed IFP, Cabrera is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Insofar as Cabrera challenges the district court\u2019s neutrality, the claim is based wholly on the district court\u2019s adverse ruling and Cabrera\u2019s conclusional assertions, neither of which suffice to show bias. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994); <em>Koch v. Puckett, </em>907 F.2d 524, 530 (5th Cir.1990). As to the inmate account statement, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(2) required Cabrera, as the prisoner seeking to bring a civil action without prepaying the fees, to file a copy of the statement with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Cabrera\u2019s assertion that no filing fees were required because his complaint was in the nature of a \u00a7 2255 motion is similarly not well taken. Cabrera did not seek, in this complaint, his release on the basis that his conviction was imposed in violation of the laws or Constitution of the United States, that the court lacked jurisdiction to impose the sentence, that his sentence exceeded the maximum allowed by law, or that his sentence was otherwise subject to collateral attack, as would constitute a \u00a7 2255 motion. Rather, he sought to obtain documents from various federal actors pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B), which permits an individual to file a complaint in the district court to have a federal agency enjoined from withholding agency records and ordered to produce such records. Such a civil action generally requires a party to pay a filing fee of $350, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914, or to proceed IFP under the procedures set out in \u00a7 1915(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Cabrera has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). His IFP motion is therefore denied, and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24. His request for appointment of counsel is denied as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">This court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir. 1996). Cabrera is cautioned that, if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
