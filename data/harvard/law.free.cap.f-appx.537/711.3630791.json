Willis argues that the district court improperly determined that one of his prior felony convictions\u2014 for first-degree robbery committed in Alabama at the age of 16 \u2014 was an adult conviction. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">For purposes of career offender status, a prior felony conviction is defined as a \u201cprior adult federal or state conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, Application Note 1. \u201cA conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen is an adult conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Willis argues that Alabama does not classify his robbery conviction as an adult conviction because it defines an adult as \u201c[a]n individual 19 years of age or older.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 12-15-102(1). This argument fails to account for \u00a7 12-15-204(a)(2) of the Alabama Code, which provides that \u201c[njotwithstanding any other provision of law, any person who has attained the age of 16 years at the time of the conduct charged ... shall be charged, arrested, and tried as an adult\u201d for a Class A felony. If applicable, this provision is mandatory. <em>Price v. State, </em>683 So.2d 44, 45 (Ala.Crim.App.1996) (\u201c[T]he requirements of [12-15-204]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are compulsory....\u201d); <em>see also L.R.G. v. State, </em>996 So.2d 208, 209 (Ala.Crim.App. 2008) (noting legislative intent was to require that persons subject to the statute \u201cbe treated as adults for all purposes\u201d). First-degree robbery is a Class A felony under Alabama law, Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-8-41(c), and Willis committed the offense at age 16. Therefore, \u00a7 12-15-204 applied to Willis, and his conviction constitutes an adult conviction. Willis\u2019 argument-to the contrary ignores the plain language and effect of \u00a7 12-15-204. The law does not require the use of the magic words \u201cclassified as an adult conviction\u201d to make a conviction an adult one.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">The certified court records submitted by the government to the district court only confirm that Willis\u2019 conviction is an adult conviction. The records show that Willis applied for and was denied \u201cyouthful offender\u201d status, which would have provided certain procedural protections and limited his sentence. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 15-19-1 <em>et seq. </em>The records also show a checked box by \u201cdefendant pleads guilty to Robbery first [degree],\u201d while an alternative box for \u201cdefendant pleads guilty as youthful offender\u201d was left unchecked. Further, the records show that Willis did not receive any of the protections afforded to juveniles during his court proceedings. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 12-15-121(b), 12-15-129, 12-15-219(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">Willis also argues that we should apply the rule of lenity, under which we construe ambiguous criminal statutes in favor of defendants. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>Mendez, </em>150 F.3d 1058, 1061 (9th Cir. 1998). Because the Alabama statutes applicable here are unambiguous, the rule does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b728-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-14\">.
