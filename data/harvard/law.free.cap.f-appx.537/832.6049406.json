We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-29\">(1) Whether Gillespie\u2019s non-constitutional claim that he was improperly sentenced as an armed career criminal, pursuant to <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008), was cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-5\">(2) Whether the district court erred when it concluded that Gillespie\u2019s prior Florida conviction for fleeing and attempting to elude a law enforcement officer, pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2), was a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">Gillespie, a federal prisoner serving a 195-month sentence after pleading guilty to possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence. In support, Gillespie alleged that he was erroneously sentenced as an armed career criminal under the ACCA because two of his prior convictions were not violent felonies in light of <em>Begay </em>and <em>Archer. </em>Specifically, he challenged his prior convictions for carrying a concealed weapon and armed trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">After the government\u2019s response and Gillespie\u2019s reply, a magistrate judge ordered supplemental briefing by the parties regarding intervening decisions from this court concerning the ACCA, and whether Gillespie would still qualify as an armed career criminal under the ACCA notwithstanding the challenged convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">Pursuant to the magistrate\u2019s order, the government submitted a supplemental response in which it waived non-retroactivity and procedural default as defenses, and indicated that, under <em>Archer, </em>Gillespie\u2019s prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon does not operate to enhance his sentence as an armed career criminal. The government argued Gillespie\u2019s criminal history shows that he has been convicted of three or more felony offenses that qualify as violent felonies for purposes of the ACCA enhancement. Specifically, the government identified Gillespie\u2019s prior convictions for grand theft auto, armed trespass, shooting into a dwelling and a vehicle, and fleeing and attempting to elude a police officer. Thus, Gillespie\u2019s sentence was properly enhanced pursuant to the ACCA. Gillespie replied that the government could not rely on any of his other prior convictions to classify him as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">The magistrate recommended that the district court deny Gillespie\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. He concluded Gillespie had three prior convictions that qualified as violent felonies under the ACCA: (1) shooting into a dwelling and a vehicle, (2) armed trespass, and (3) fleeing and attempting to elude an officer. Gillespie had conceded that two of these convictions \u2014 shooting into a dwelling and a vehicle and armed trespass \u2014 were violent felonies under the ACCA. <em>See Sykes v. United States, </em>564 U.S. \u2014,\u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 2273, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011) (holding fleeing police officers in a vehicle was a violent felony under the ACCA). Thus, Gillespie was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2255 because he was sentenced properly as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-15\">Over Gillespie\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation and denied Gillespie\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-17\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo. McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190, 1195 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 112, 184 L.Ed.2d 52 (2012). The scope of review in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>a \u00a7 2255 appeal is limited to issues specified in the COA. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998). We are bound by a prior panel opinion until the opinion\u2019s holding is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this Court sitting <em>en banc. Archer, </em>531 F.3d at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Under the ACCA, a defendant qualifies for the mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years of imprisonment as an armed career criminal if he has at least 3 prior convictions \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). A \u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined as any felony punishable by more than one year that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). A crime may qualify as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause if it \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d and is roughly similar \u2014 in kind as well as in the degree of risk posed \u2014 to the enumerated offenses of burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving explosives. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii); <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 143-44, 128 S.Ct. at 1585-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Florida law provides that a person commits the third-degree felony of simple vehicle flight when he \u201cwillfully flees or attempts to elude a law enforcement officer in an authorized law enforcement patrol vehicle, with agency insignia and other jurisdictional markings prominently displayed on the vehicle, with siren and lights activated.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2); <em>United States v. Petite, </em>703 F.3d 1290, 1292 (11th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Jun. 13, 2013). Simple vehicle flight carries a maximum sentence of five years of imprisonment. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.082(3)(d); <em>Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1293. It is a lesser included offense of the next subsection of the Florida statute, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-7\">(3) Any person who willfully flees or attempts to elude a law enforcement officer in an authorized law enforcement patrol vehicle, with agency insignia and other jurisdictional markings prominently displayed on the vehicle, with siren and lights activated, and during the course of the fleeing or attempted eluding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-8\">(a) Drives at high speed, or in any manner which demonstrates a wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property, commits a felony of the second degree ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-9\">(b) Drives at high speed, or in any manner which demonstrates a wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property, and causes serious bodily injury or death to another person, including any law enforcement officer involved in pursuing or otherwise attempting to effect a stop of the person\u2019s vehicle, commits a felony of the first degree ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3); <em>Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1293. Aggravated vehicle flight carries a maximum sentence of either 15 or 30 years of imprisonment, depending on whether the offender causes serious bodily injury or death to another person. Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 316.1935(3); 775.082(3)(b)-(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">We initially held that a conviction under \u00a7 316.1935(2) was not a violent felony for purposes of enhanced sentencing under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Harrison, 558 </em>F.3d 1280, 1296 (11th Cir.2009), <em>abrogated by Sykes, </em>564 U.S. at\u2014, 131 S.Ct. at 2277, <em>as recognized in Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1299. However, the Supreme Court later examined a similar Indiana vehicle flight statute, Ind.Code \u00a7 35-44-3-3, and held that \u201c[fjelony vehicle flight is a violent felony for purposes of ACCA.\u201d <em>Sykes, </em>564 U.S. at\u2014, 131 S.Ct. at 2270-72, 2277. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>The Court held that the crime fell within the residual clause of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) because it categorically presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2272. The risk is comparable to that posed by arson and burglary, the crime\u2019s closest analogs among the enumerated offenses. <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2273. When a person chooses to defy a law enforcement command by fleeing in a ear, \u201cthe determination to elude capture makes a lack of concern for the safety of property and persons of pedestrians and other drivers an inherent part of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the risk of violence is inherent to vehicle flight, as the offense is initiated and terminated by confrontation with law enforcement, and the intervening pursuit creates a high risk of crashes. <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2274.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">Relevant to this appeal, the Court discussed the significance of the Indiana statute\u2019s differentiation between types of fleeing. <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2276. Sykes\u2019s offense, under subsection (b)(1)(A) of the Indiana statute, criminalizes flight in which the offender uses a vehicle, while subsection (b)(1)(B) criminalizes flight in which the offender \u201c \u2018operates a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Ind.Code \u00a7 35 \u2014 44\u20143\u20143(b)(1)(B)). The Court rejected Sykes\u2019s argument that the statute was structured this way because the Indiana legislature \u201cdid not intend subsection (b)(1)(A)\u2019s general prohibition on vehicle flight to encompass the particular class of vehicle flights that subsection (b)(1)(B) reaches.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">In <em>Sykes, </em>the Supreme Court expressly stated that it was addressing a conflict among the circuits that included our opinion in <em>Harrison, </em>and then decided against <em>Hamson </em>and the other circuits that held that fleeing from a law enforcement officer in a vehicle does not constitute a violent felony. <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2272, 2277. In <em>Petite, </em>we held that a conviction under \u00a7 316.1935(2) constitutes a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1292, 1301. We expressly stated that our prior holding in <em>Harrison, </em>that such a conviction was not a violent felony, had been \u201cundermined to the point of abrogation\u201d by <em>Sykes. Id. </em>at 1299. We rejected Petite\u2019s argument that his case was distinguishable from <em>Sykes </em>because, unlike the Indiana statute at issue in <em>Sykes, </em>Florida has increased penalties for different levels of vehicle flight. <em>Id. </em>at 1299-1301. Although aggravated vehicle flight in violation of \u00a7 316.1935(3) presents a greater level of risk than simple vehicle flight under \u00a7 316.1935(2), we concluded both statutes criminalize the same basic conduct of intentional vehicle flight, which is an inherently risky offense. <em>Id. </em>at 1300-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">In light of our decision in <em>Petite, </em>Gillespie\u2019s argument \u2014 that his prior conviction for simple vehicle flight in violation of \u00a7 316.1935(2) does not qualify as a violent felony under the ACCA \u2014 is foreclosed on appeal. <em>See Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1292, 1301; <em>Archer, </em>531 F.3d at 1352. Gillespie attempts to distinguish this case by arguing that \u00a7 316.1935(2), unlike the Indiana vehicle flight statute at issue in <em>Sykes, </em>provides for escalating degrees of punishment depending on whether the defendant created a risk of harm. We squarely rejected that argument and concluded that each section of \u00a7 316.1935 criminalizes the same basic conduct of intentional vehicle flight, which is an inherently risky offense. <em>See Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1299-1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-15\">Gillespie further suggests that his case is distinguishable because he was convicted under an earlier version of \u00a7 316.1935(2) than the one at issue in <em>Petite. </em>However, he does not explain how the two versions were materially different. Regardless, Gillespie does not suggest that the version <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>of \u00a7 316.1935 under which he was convicted did not punish intentional vehicle flight, which we have held is an inherently risky offense that qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>See id. </em>Because Gillespie\u2019s ACCA challenge is foreclosed by <em>Petite, </em>it is <em>unnecessary for us </em>to consider whether such a challenge is cognizable under \u00a7 2255. The government has waived the defenses of procedural default and non-retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
