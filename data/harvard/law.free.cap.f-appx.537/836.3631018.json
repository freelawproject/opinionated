In October 1992, while serving his state sentence, Rainey was charged in a multi-count, multidefendant indictment in the Southern District of Alabama for conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana. In June 1995, a federal jury found Rainey guilty, and he was sentenced to 300 months\u2019 incarceration, \u201cnot ... [to] run concurrently\u201d with his state sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">At the time of Rainey\u2019s federal sentencing, the parties and the court believed that he was scheduled to be released from state custody in April 1996, based on his state good time credits. After his federal sentencing, however, Rainey learned that there had been a mistake in calculating his state good time credits, and that he was ineligible for full good time credit. As a result, his state custody release date was recalculated to be March 11, 2006. At the beginning of his federal sentence, the Bureau of Prisons denied Rainey\u2019s request for \u201cjail credit\u201d based on his time spent in state custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">On March 21, 2012, Rainey filed a motion for a writ of <em>audita querela, </em>requesting that his sentence be vacated and a new sentencing hearing be held. The district court denied the motion. On appeal, Rainey contends that the federal sentencing court based his sentence on a mistake of fact \u2014 specifically, that he would be released from state custody in April 1996\u2014 when it sentenced him to 300 months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered that his federal sentence not be served concurrently with his state sentence. Rainey maintains that the district court erred because (1) the writ of <em>audita querela </em>is available to fill gaps in the post-conviction system of relief, (2) he is seeking to correct the mistake of fact under which the sentencing court operated, and (3) the remedy he seeks is not available under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because his claim is not constitutional in nature. He also argues that the alleged mistake of fact must be corrected in order to avoid an unconscionable result. After a thorough review of the briefs and record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">\u201cWe review de novo the question of whether a prisoner may challenge his sentence by filing a motion for a writ of <em>audita querela.\" United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1174 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The writ of <em>audita querela </em>\u201cwas an ancient writ used to attack the enforcement of a judgment after it was rendered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The writ was abolished in the civil context by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(e). Nevertheless, pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, federal courts have the authority \u201cto recognize common law postconviction remedies,\u201d <em>Holt, </em>417 F.3d at 1174, and \u201cissue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). Federal courts do not, however, have unfettered discretion to issue writs under the act, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>explained by the United States Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-4\">The All Writs Act is a residual source of authority to issue writs that are not otherwise covered by statute. Where a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling. Although that Act empowers federal courts to fashion extraordinary remedies when the need arises, it does not authorize them to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-5\"><em>Pa. Bureau of Corr. v. U.S. Marshals Serv., </em>474 U.S. 34, 43, 106 S.Ct. 355, 361, 88 L.Ed.2d 189 (1985). Similarly, we have held that \u201ca writ of <em>audita querela </em>may not be granted when relief is cognizable under [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Holt, </em>417 F.3d at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Under \u00a7 2255, a prisoner may file a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence on the grounds that (1) the sentence was imposed in violation of United States laws or the Constitution, (2) the court lacked jurisdiction to impose the sentence, (3) the sentence exceeded the statutory maximum punishment, or (4) the sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack. 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2255(a); <em>see Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (noting that \u00a7 2255 relief is \u201creserved for transgressions of constitutional rights and for that narrow compass of other injury that could not have been raised in direct appeal and would, if condoned, result in a complete miscarriage of justice\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). When a prisoner \u201craises claims outside the scope of \u00a7 2255(a), that is, claims concerning execution of his sentence,\u201d however, those challenges should be brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1352 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Here, the district court did not err by denying Rainey\u2019s motion for a writ of <em>audita querela. </em>First, Rainey\u2019s challenge is not cognizable under \u00a7 2255, as his claim does not implicate any of the four grounds enumerated in \u00a7 2255(a); accordingly, it must be brought under \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Existing precedent makes clear that the common law writ is unavailable where, as here, statutory forms of relief are available. <em>See Pa. Bureau of </em>Corr., 474 U.S. at 43, 106 S.Ct. at 361. Accordingly, we hold that because Rainey\u2019s challenge is cognizable under \u00a7 2241, and therefore \u201cotherwise covered by statute,\u201d relief under a writ of <em>audita querela </em>is inappropriate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">Second, contrary to Rainey\u2019s assertion, the federal sentencing court did not base Rainey\u2019s sentence on a mistake of fact. Instead, the court explicitly ealculat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>ed Rainey\u2019s 300 month sentence by determining the mid-point between his appropriate Sentencing Guidelines range of 292 to 365 months, and then reducing that range by 28 months for the time that Rainey spent in state custody before federal charges were filed. Because there are statutory forms of relief available to Rainey, and because the sentencing court did not base Rainey\u2019s sentence on a mistake of fact, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-10\">. Rainey\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied, and we affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Rainey, </em>107 F.3d 24 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b854-7\">. Although Rainey requests that the district court vacate his original sentence and impose a new sentence, his motion actually challenges either (1) the district court\u2019s decision to order the federal sentence \"not ... [to] run concurrently\u201d with the then-undischarged state sentence, or (2) the federal Bureau of Prisons' decision not to credit him with the additional time that he served in state prison due to the good time credit miscalculation. Therefore, Rainey is challenging the execution of his sentence, not the validity of his underlying conviction or sentence, such that this argument should have been raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Antonelli, </em>542 F.3d at 1352.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b854-13\">. In addition, because Rainey exclusively argues that the district court should have granted his writ of <em>audita querela, </em>he has abandoned any argument that we should construe his motion as a \u00a7 2241 petition, and we decline to do so here. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that issues not raised in an appellant\u2019s initial brief are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b855-6\">MARTIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AIm\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">I concur in the majority\u2019s decision affirming the District Court\u2019s denial of Mr. Rainey\u2019s writ of <em>audita querela. </em>Because the record does not reflect that the length of time the state prison authorities would require Mr. Rainey to serve on his 15-year state prison sentence made any difference to the District Court at sentencing, I would affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of relief on this basis alone. Having reached that decision, I would not go on to decide whether a material mistake of fact is cognizable in a writ of <em>audita querela. </em>Neither would I decide the related questions of whether such a mistake is (or is not) cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 or 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">My review of the sentencing transcript and the presentence report lead me to conclude that the District Court did not base Mr. Rainey\u2019s sentence on a mistake of fact. I simply find no record support for Mr. Rainey\u2019s assertion that the District Court \u201cwas operating under a mistake of fact concerning [Mr.] Rainey\u2019s undischarged state sentence, or that his decision to run the two sentences consecutively was driven in any way by his understanding of how much good time [Mr.] Rainey would be granted by state corrections officials.\u201d Doc. 159 at 4. Just the opposite seems true.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">At the time of Mr. Rainey\u2019s federal sentencing in 1995, the then-mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines required the District Court to run Mr. Rainey\u2019s federal sentence consecutive to his undischarged 15-year state sentence. See USSG \u00a7 5G1.3(a) (1994) (\u201cIf the instant offense was committed while the defendant was serving a term of imprisonment ... or after sentencing for, but before commencing service of, such term of imprisonment, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment\u201d (emphasis added).). Here, the presentence report (PSR) indicated that USSG \u00a7 5G1.3 required the district court to run Mr. Rainey\u2019s federal sentence consecutive to Mr. Rainey\u2019s undischarged term of state imprisonment. See PSR \u00b6 82. And the District Court specifically overruled Mr. Rainey\u2019s objection to PSR paragraph 82 during the sentencing hearing. See Doc. 157-5 at 13 (\u201cObjection 82 ... the Court will deny that objection. The Court will not have this run concurrently.\u201d). Thus it seems clear that the District Court imposed Mr. Rainey\u2019s federal sentence to run consecutive to his 15-year state sentence of imprisonment because the Guidelines compelled it, not because of some mistake about Mr. Rainey\u2019s anticipated release date for his state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">On this record, I would not reach the question of whether a material mistake of fact is a cognizable basis for invoking the writ of audita querela or the related questions of whether a material mistake of fact is cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00b6\u00b6 2241 or 2255. While I agree with the majority that common \u25a0 law writs are unavailable where statutory forms of relief are available, see Majority Opinion at 838, I hesitate to decide the larger issue of cognizability, such as whether a material mistake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>of fact that impacts a federal sentence is cognizable under \u00a7 2241, but not \u00a7 2255. It is my understanding \u201cthat a sentencing court cannot rely on false assumptions without violating the due process clause,\u201d at least in some circumstances. <em>See United States v. Dean, </em>752 F.2d 535, 544 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 447, 92 S.Ct. 589, 592, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972) (remanding for resentencing \u201ca sentence founded at least in part upon misinformation of constitutional magnitude\u201d); <em>Townsend v. Burke, </em>334 U.S. 736, 740-41, 68 S.Ct. 1252, 1255, 92 L.Ed. 1690 (1948) (explaining the Court\u2019s concern that \u201cthis prisoner was sentenced on the basis of assumptions concerning his criminal record which were materially untrue\u201d; and that, \u201c[s]uch a result, whether caused by carelessness or design, is inconsistent with due process of law\u201d).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
