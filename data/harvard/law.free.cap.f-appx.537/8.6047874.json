July 20, 2012), <em>aff'g </em>No. A099 488 506 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 20, 2012). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA. <em>See Ming Xia Chen v. BIA </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Because, in his brief, Zhu explicitly abandons any challenge to the denial of asylum and CAT relief, the only issue before the Court is the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal. Zhu argues that he is entitled to withholding of removal based on his \u201cother resistance\u201d to China\u2019s family planning policy. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 309 (2d Cir.2007). However, because the Government correctly asserts that Zhu failed to exhaust this argument before the BIA, we will not consider it. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 118-20 (2d Cir.2007). Notably, Zhu does not address his failure to exhaust this issue or suggest any reason that the Court should review his arguments, despite having not raised them before the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Zhu\u2019s other asserted grounds for withholding of removal \u2014 his opposition to corruption in China and his political activities in the United States \u2014 were raised in his appeal to the BIA. The Government correctly argues, however, that, before the BIA, Zhu contended only that he had met his burden of proof, but did not challenge the IJ\u2019s findings that his testimony was not credible and that he had failed to provide corroborating evidence. Therefore, we will not consider Zhu\u2019s challenges to these findings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">As the determinations that Zhu was not credible and had failed to provide corroborating evidence were dispositive of his claim for withholding of removal, <em>see Chuilu Liu v. Holder, </em>575 F.3d 193, 195 n. 5 (2009) (noting that \u201ca failure to corroborate can suffice, without more, to support a finding that an alien has not met his burden of proof\u2019); <em>Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that \u201cwhere a withholding claim is based on the very fact, or set of facts, that the IJ found not to be credible ... an adverse credibility ruling will ... preclude the withholding claim\u201d), and we \u201cmust decline to consider\u201d these unexhausted issues, <em>Lin Zhong, </em>480 F.3d at 107 n. 1, the petition for review is denied. <em>See Balachova v. Mukasey, </em>547 F.3d 374, 380 (2d Cir.2008) (granting Government\u2019s motion to dismiss petition for review where the petitioner did not exhaust challenge to adverse credibility determination that was dispositive of all claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
