Payne moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>from the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. Payne alleged that Adam Parks violated his constitutional rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by summarily suspending his license to work as a private security officer after receiving notice that he had been charged with theft. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Parks and further certified that an appeal is not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">When the district court certifies that an appeal is not taken in good faith under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 24(a)(3), the movant may either pay the filing fee or contest the district court\u2019s certification decision by filing a motion to proceed IFP with this court. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, Payne\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Payne contends that the district court improperly granted Parks\u2019s second motion for summary judgment because the evidence submitted by Parks was insufficient. He also asserts, without further discussion, that he would \u201cbe able to produce admissible evidence that supports a triable issue.\u201d However, he does not address the district court\u2019s reasoning, nor does he cite to the record or to any evidence or relevant case law in support of his assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). The moving party must demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, but it does not need to negate the elements of the nonmovant\u2019s case. <em>Duffie v. United States, </em>600 F.3d 362, 371 (5th Cir.2010). If the moving party meets this initial burden, then the burden shifts to the nonmovant to set forth specific evidence to support his claims. <em>Id. </em>We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>See Dillon v. Rogers, 596 F.3d </em>260, 266 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Payne has failed to provide any evidence to support his claims and, therefore, has failed to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to his claims. <em>See Duffie, </em>600 F.3d at 371. Further, insofar as he argues that the final judgment incorrectly assessed him with costs and attorneys fees, the district court did not enter any judgment assessing such fees or costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">Accordingly, Payne\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5TH CIR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
