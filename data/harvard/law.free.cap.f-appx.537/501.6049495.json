We review preserved challenges to revocation sentences under a deferential plainly-unreasonable standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The district court properly determined that Twymon\u2019s range of imprisonment was six to twelve months under the policy statements in the sentencing guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a), p.s. (Revocation Table). His five-year term of imprisonment, although considerably higher, does not exceed the statutory maximum of five years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). We routinely affirm revocation sentences exceeding the advisory guideline range but not the statutory maximum. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 265 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>182 Fed.Appx. 343, 343 \u2014 44 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">At the revocation hearing, the district court considered the range of imprisonment in the policy statements, Twymon\u2019s arguments that his employment interfered with his ability to abide by the conditions of SR, his letter to the court, the presentence report, his criminal history, and his violations of SR. The court expressly stated that it had considered the pertinent factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. To the extent that Twymon seeks to raise, on appeal, arguments that the court considered prohibited factors from \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) and (D), he has not briefed them adequately and has thus abandoned them on appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>United States v. Charles, </em>469 F.3d 402, 408 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">The record reflects that the district court made an individualized assessment based on Twymon\u2019s multiple SR violations, his history and characteristics, and the need to protect the public and to afford adequate deterrence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843-44; \u00a7 3583(e). Contrary to Twymon\u2019s suggestion, the sentence did not \u201cunreasonably fail[ ] to reflect the statutory sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). Twymon has not shown that the revocation sentence is plainly unreasonable. <em>See Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
