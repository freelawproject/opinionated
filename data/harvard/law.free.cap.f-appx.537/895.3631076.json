After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-23\">Lee pleaded guilty in 2004 to one count of possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). At sentencing, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>court found Lee responsible for 6.6 grams of crack cocaine, which produced a base offense level of 26 under the drug-conversion tables in place at the time. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (2004). But because Lee qualified as a career offender subject to a 40-year statutory maximum, his total offense level, after other adjustments, became 31, with a corresponding guidelines range of 188 to 235 months. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4B 1.1(b). The court imposed a 190-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">In 2012, Lee moved to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 750 to the guidelines and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010(FSA), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372. The district court denied the motion, concluding it lacked authority to reduce Lee\u2019s sentence. This is Lee\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012). A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence only when he was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Lee argues he is eligible for a sentence reduction because the district court considered the drug quantity tables in applying the career-offender provision and because those tables \u201cremained a point of reference\u201d at sentencing. Because Lee was sentenced as a career offender, however, he is ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lee also contends that the FSA authorized reduction of his sentence. But Lee was sentenced in 2004, and the FSA is not retroactive to defendants sentenced before August 3, 2010, the date it took effect. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). The district court therefore correctly concluded it lacked authority to reduce Lee\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-9\">. Lee asserts that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), abrogated <em>Moore. </em>This argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
