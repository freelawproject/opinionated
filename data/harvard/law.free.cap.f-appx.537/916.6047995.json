The parties agree that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing the action with neither a clear record of delay nor a finding that lesser sanctions would not suffice. We vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-22\">On January 6, 2012, Courtesy Boat Rentals &amp; Yacht Charters (\u201cCourtesy\u201d) filed a motion to dismiss Boone\u2019s complaint. Local Rule 7(l)(c) required Boone to respond to the motion by January 23, 2012. Boone failed to file his response until February 22, 2012. The case proceeded for over three months with the court referring the case to mediation, setting the date for a pre-trial conference, and providing trial instructions. Then, without warning, the court dismissed Boone\u2019s action with prejudice because he failed to respond to the motion to dismiss within seventeen days as required by Local Rule 7(1)(C). Boone moved the court for relief from the judgment due to excusable neglect and explained that he had made a simple calendaring error. The court summarily denied Boone\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-23\">Parties must meet deadlines in order to preserve the efficiency of our busy district courts. And yet, despite an abundance of care, mistakes will no doubt occur for \u201cto err is human.\u201d The drastic sanction of dismissing a case with prejudice is only proper where \u201cthere is a clear record of delay or willful contempt and a finding that lesser sanctions would not suffice.\u201d <em>Kilgo v. Ricks, </em>983 F.2d 189, 193 (11th Cir.1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-24\">We review a district court\u2019s order dismissing an action for failure to comply with local rules for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 192. Both parties agree \u2014 and our independent review of the record convinces us \u2014 that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing this action without a clear record of delay or a finding that lesser sanctions would not suffice. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order dismissing the case and remand for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATL\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-20\">.
