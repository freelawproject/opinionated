We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Wong does not contend that he suffered past persecution. Rather, he contends that he faces a clear probability of future persecution based on his Christian religion and Chinese ethnicity. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that, even under a disfavored group analysis, Wong failed to show sufficient individualized risk to establish that it is more likely than not he would be persecuted if removed to Malaysia. <em>See Halim v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 971, 979 (9th Cir.2009); <em>Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1066 (\u201c[a]n applicant for withholding of removal will need to adduce a considerably larger quantum of individualized-risk evidence to prevail than would an asylum applicant\u201d). Accordingly, Wong\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b784-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
