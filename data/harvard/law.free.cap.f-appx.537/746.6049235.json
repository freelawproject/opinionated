We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039-40 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-22\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on an inconsistency between Lin\u2019s testimony that she got divorced in the year 2000 and a household registry indicating that she was married as of 2009. <em>See id. </em>at 1048 (adverse credibility finding reasonable under the totality of the circumstances). The BIA was not required to accept Lin\u2019s explanations for this inconsistency. <em>See Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 974 (9th Cir.2011). Because a reasonable adjudica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>tor would not be \u201ccompelled to conclude\u201d that Lin is credible, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), we uphold the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. In the absence of credible testimony, Lin\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). As a derivative petitioner, Xiao Wei Lin\u2019s claims fail with Lin\u2019s. <em>See Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 739 n. 1 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b762-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
