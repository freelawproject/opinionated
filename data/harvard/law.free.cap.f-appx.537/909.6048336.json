After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">After Morales-Sebastian pleaded guilty, the probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (PSI) calculating his base-offense level of 8, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). Because Morales-Sebastian previously had been deported after a prior conviction for a crime of violence, the PSI applied a 12-level enhancement. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). With a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, his total offense level was 17. Because Morales-Sebastian\u2019s criminal-history category was I, his ultimate guidelines range was 24-30 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s calculations but ultimately sentenced Morales-Sebastian to a below-guidelines sentence of 20 months. This is Morales-Sebastian\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court must impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s potential future criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). And the court must consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guidelines range, the relevant policy statements of the sentencing commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">Morales-Sebastian contends his sentence is unreasonable because the 12-level enhancement for his prior burglary conviction and subsequent deportation is unduly harsh because that conviction occurred over a decade ago. He asserts that \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii)\u2019s enhancement is not supported by empirical evidence that double-digit enhancements are warranted and, as a result, defendants sentenced under that provision are essentially punished again for a previous offense. Based on this injustice and on his history and characteristics, Morales-Sebastian argues, the district court abused its discretion in varying downwards by only four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">We cannot agree that, in light of the district court\u2019s thorough reasoning at sentencing, its ultimate sentence amounted to an abuse of discretion. The district court detailed Morales-Sebastian\u2019s mitigating personal circumstances \u2014 he came into the country as a child, not by his own choice\u2014 and weighed those factors against the severity of his criminal history. The court agreed with Morales-Sebastian that the enhancement was harsh in light of \u201cthe age of the underlying offense\u201d and, resultantly, sentenced him below his guidelines range, finding \u201cthe sentence imposed is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with\u201d the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). Based on the totality of the circumstances, which the district court carefully considered, we cannot say the court imposed a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
