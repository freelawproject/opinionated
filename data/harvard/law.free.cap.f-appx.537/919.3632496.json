Suhrheinrich, United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b935-20\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b935-21\">Luis Qui\u00f1ones Barcelo appeals the imposition of an 18-month sentence upon revocation of his supervised release, to run consecutive to the 93-month sentence he received on account of the crime he committed that resulted in the revocation of his supervised release. After careful consideration of the record and having the benefit of oral argument, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-22\">In January 2010, Qui\u00f1ones Barcelo was sentenced to 18-months imprisonment and 3 years of supervised release after pleading guilty to manufacturing and distributing marijuana. After he served his prison term, and while he was on supervised release, Qui\u00f1ones Barcelo was arrested for his participation in a failed armed home invasion. He pleaded guilty to two offenses relating to the home invasion and was sentenced to 93-months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-23\">Because Qui\u00f1ones Barcelo\u2019s crime violated several conditions of his supervised release, the Probation Office initiated revocation proceedings. At his sentencing for the violation of his supervised release, Qui\u00f1ones Barcelo acknowledged several of the violations and asked for a sentence that would be served concurrently, rather than consecutively, to the 93-month sentence imposed for his involvement in the failed home invasion. In support of leniency, he argued that he was a lesser participant in the underlying home invasion; that the sentence imposed for that crime was already \u201cvery lengthy\u201d at least in part because he was on supervised release at the time of the offense; and that he had been working diligently to better himself during his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>Despite these arguments, the court imposed an 18-month sentence for Qui\u00f1ones Barcelo\u2019s violation of his supervised release, which was at the top of the advisory range. The court also set this sentence to run consecutive to the 93-month sentence Qui\u00f1ones Barcelo received for the failed home invasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">The only issue in this appeal is whether Qui\u00f1ones Barcelo\u2019s 18-month consecutive sentence was appropriate in light of the identity of factors considered by the district court in imposing both his home invasion and revocation sentences. This Court reviews sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). We consider both procedural and substantive reasonableness, reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1273 n. 25 (11th Cir. 2008). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing it is unreasonable in light of both the record and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Qui\u00f1ones Barcelo\u2019s primary argument is that his revocation sentence was substantively unreasonable because each sentence was based on overlapping considerations, amounting to a \u201cdouble counting\u201d of the sentence he should serve. However, the Sentencing Guidelines clearly condone this double counting. Indeed, the Guidelines provide that revocation terms \u201cshall be ordered to be served consecutively ... whether or not the sentence of imprisonment being served resulted from the conduct that is the basis of the revocation.\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 7B 1.3(f) (Nov.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">We recognize, of course, that the preference for consecutive sentences is qualified. As Qui\u00f1ones Barcelo correctly points out, courts are required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining whether a deviation from the consecutive sentencing mandate is warranted. <em>United States v. Ballard, </em>6 F.3d 1502, 1505-06 (11th Cir. 1993). In this regard, Qui\u00f1ones Barcelo raises two objections to the district court\u2019s treatment of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors: (1) that the district court failed to explain its reasoning for imposing the consecutive sentence; and (2) that it misapplied the sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">So long as the record demonstrates the court\u2019s consideration of relevant factors, the court need not expressly consider or discuss each factor. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). On this record we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in ordering the 18-month consecutive sentence. Nothing in the record indicates that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, nor does Qui\u00f1ones Barcelo carry his burden to establish that the district court misapplied the factors. Further, Qui\u00f1ones Barcelo\u2019s sentence was within the applicable Guideline range, which also supports its reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">Qui\u00f1ones Barcelo\u2019s brief contains only passing references to the procedural reasonableness of his sentence. Because he did not \u201cplainly and prominently\u201d present his procedural arguments on appeal, we consider them abandoned. <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number><em>v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-6\">. We assume without deciding that Barcelo's objection before the district court was sufficient to warrant application of the abuse of discretion standard rather than the plain error standard normally applied when an objection is inadequate. <em>See United States v. Gresham, </em>325 F.3d 1262, 1265 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
