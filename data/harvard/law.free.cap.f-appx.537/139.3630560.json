In the alternative, Ford seeks leave to file a 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2013) motion. We conclude that Ford is not entitled to mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"Azuq\">Mandamus relief is a drastic remedy and should be used only in extraordinary <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number><em>Moussaoui, </em>333 F.3d 509, 516-17 (4th Cir. 2003). Further, mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief sought. <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Ford has not shown that he has a clear right to an order directing the United States Attorney\u2019s Office to file a Rule 35 motion. Ford is also not eligible for an order from this court authorizing leave to file a \u00a7 2255 motion. While this court may grant authorization under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (2006) to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, our review of Ford\u2019s criminal docket sheet does not show that he filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion. Thus, Ford does not need authorization from this court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The relief sought by Ford is not available by way of mandamus. Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in for-ma pauperis, we deny the petition for writ of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\"><em> </em>While we decide that Ford does not need authorization from this court to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, we take no stand on the merits of any prospective \u00a7 2255 motion he may file.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
