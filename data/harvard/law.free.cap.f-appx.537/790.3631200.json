ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b806-26\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>mously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Plaintiff and appellant, Bill Guinn, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the dismissal, without prejudice, of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 complaint. For the following reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Mr. Guinn\u2019s complaint without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Mr. Guinn was convicted of driving under the influence on August 6, 2011, and on September 27, 2011, Colorado state district court Judge DaVita imposed a 180-day sentence, to be served in the Jefferson County jail. Mr. Guinn was released from the jail on March 13, 2012. Mr. Guinn was apparently not given credit for his pre-trial confinement in jail, nor was he awarded \u201ctrusty goodtime\u201d credit he claims he was entitled to receive. Appeal at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">On July 20, 2012, Mr. Guinn filed the instant complaint, in which he alleged that defendants (various Jefferson County entities and employees)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violated his \u201cfundamental (fund.) 4th (Seizure), 5th (Due Process), 6th (Double Jeopardy/Effeetive Assistance of Counsel), 8th (Cruel and Unusual Punishment), and 14th (Due Proeess/Equal Protection) Amendment (Amend.) Constitutional (Const.) rights when they unlawfully imprisoned him in Jeffco. Jail.\u201d Appeal at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The matter was referred to a magistrate judge who, on August 6, 2012, entered an order striking the complaint and directing Mr. Guinn to submit an amended complaint. The magistrate judge found that the complaint did not comply with Fed. R.Civ.P. 8 and was not submitted using the District of Colorado\u2019s standard complaint form, in violation of D.C. Colo. L.CivR 8.1A, which states that \u201c[a] pro se party shall use the forms established by this court to file an action.\u201d The court also found that Mr. Guinn failed to number each one of his claims separately, setting forth the factual basis for each claim. After reciting the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8, the magistrate judge explained in some detail what was lacking in Mr. Guinn\u2019s complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-12\">The plaintiffs Complaint suffers from many deficiencies, not the least of which is that the Complaint is not submitted on the court\u2019s standard complaint form. \u201cA <em>pro se </em>party shall use the forms established by this court to file an action.\u201d D.C.COLO.LCivR 8.1A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-13\">The plaintiff asserts five claims against two individuals and several entities. The plaintiffs claims arise out of a citation and subsequent conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol. Most of the plaintiffs allegations refer collectively to the defendants. The plaintiff does not clearly state the actions or inactions of each defendant and how those actions or inactions violate the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-14\">The Complaint makes allegations against entities. An entity sued under section 1983 is subject to liability only when its official policies or customs are responsible for deprivation of rights protected by the Constitution. A policy is a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>or decision officially adopted and promulgated by the entities\u2019 officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-4\">In addition, the Complaint contains legal arguments and conclusory allegations of wrongdoing. Arguments and conclusory allegations of wrongdoing are not appropriately included in a complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-5\">Claim Eight is exemplary of the deficiencies throughout the Complaint. Claim Eight states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-6\">Plaint alleges that defs violated his 8th Amend, right when they deliberately subjected him to 83 days of unlawful imprisonment in Jeffco Jail for his DUI offense and conviction. Plaint alleges Defs acted with deliberate indifference toward his well established 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th and 14th Amend rights when they capriciously and arbitrarily forced him to serve 83 days of unlawful imprisonment in Jeff Co Jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-7\">Compl. at 16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-8\">Claim Eight does not identify which defendant(s) subjected him to 83 days of imprisonment, nor does it allege any specific facts to show how such imprisonment violated the plaintiffs Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Order at 2-3, R. Vol. 1 at 30-31 (footnote and citation omitted). The magistrate judge accordingly directed Mr. Guinn to file an amended complaint \u201cwhich complies with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the local rules of this court, and this order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. More specifically, the magistrate judge instructed Mr. Guinn that the amended complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-10\">must be submitted on the court\u2019s form and shall be titled \u201cAmended Complaint.\u201d The background statement shall briefly summarize the plaintiffs case and shall not exceed one double-spaced typewritten page. Each claim shall be numbered and shall be stated separately. Each claim shall state the legal basis for the claim; shall identify which defendant(s) the claim is brought against; and shall allege facts sufficient to state a claim for relief as to each of those defendants. Each claim shall not exceed two typewritten pages, double-spaced. The Complaint shall not contain conclusory allegations or argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-12\"><em>Id. </em>Mr. Guinn was ordered to submit his amended complaint on or before August 20, 2012. The magistrate judge directed the clerk of the court to enclose with its order to Mr. Guinn a copy of the court\u2019s complaint form.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">Instead of submitting an amended complaint on August 20th, however, Mr. Guinn filed a \u201cResponse to Magistrate Judge\u2019s Order\u201d on August 21. In his Response, Mr. Guinn \u201ccontest[ed]\u201d the court\u2019s order directing him to file an amended complaint, and stated that he could not present his claims any more concisely.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">The magistrate judge then responded by issuing an Order to Show Cause by September 24, 2012, \u201cwhy this action should not be dismissed for failure to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8; D.C.COLO.LCivR 8.1A; and an order of this court.\u201d Order to Show Cause at 2, R. Vol. 1 at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-15\">Mr. Guinn subsequently filed an \u201cAmended Complaint.\u201d The magistrate judge found it was still insufficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-16\">The proposed amended complaint does not comply with Rule 8, local rule 8.1A, and my order. The complaint is not submitted on the court\u2019s form, although the plaintiff acknowledges receiving a copy of the form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-17\">Claims One and Two are exemplary of the plaintiffs failure to submit a complaint in compliance with Rule 8 and my order. Claim One is five typewritten pages in length. The claim alleges that all of the defendants violated the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>tiffs Fifth Amendment right to due process. Claim Two is also brought against all defendants. Claim Two incorporates the allegations of Claim One and asserts a violation of the plaintiffs Fourth Amendment rights. However, Claim One does not contain specific factual allegations that describe actions or inactions of each defendant and how those actions or inactions violated the plaintiffs due process and Fifth Amendment rights. Instead, the claim is verbose and contains conclusory allegations and legal argument.... The plaintiff repeatedly refers to the defendants collectively instead of alleging specific facts regarding the actions or inactions of each defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Recommendation at 4-5, R. Vol. 1 at 68-69. The magistrate judge accordingly recommended that the complaint be dismissed without prejudice for \u201cfailure to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8; D.C.COLO.LCivR 8.1A; and an order of this court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. Mr. Guinn filed objections to the Recommendation, arguing that he need not comply with local rule 8.1 because his amended complaint substantially complied with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8, that his complaint contained all the necessary information to enable its review, that he had substantially followed the format of the district court\u2019s standard complaint forms, and that his allegations were not conclusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The district court disagreed with Mr. Guinn, finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-7\">[Ajfter reviewing the amended complaint, the Court finds that it is deficient for the same reasons the original complaint was deficient, i.e., neither complaint complies with the pleading requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8. Thus, because plaintiff willfully declined to follow the magistrate judge\u2019s order, and his excuses for not complying with this order are not acceptable, the Court finds no error with the magistrate judge\u2019s Recommendation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Order at 4, R. Vol. 1 at 85. The court therefore dismissed Mr. Guinn\u2019s complaint without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Mr. Guinn appeals, arguing that his complaint complied with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8 and D.C. Colo. CivL 8.1A; that the provisions of local rule 8.1 A are ambiguous because they conflict with the \u201cFederal Local Court Rules\u201d; and that he is entitled to \u201creceive a court judgment and response which addresses the general allegations contained within his Complaint.\u201d Appeal at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">We agree with the thorough analysis and explanation given by the magistrate judge in his recommendation, as adopted and supplemented by the district court\u2019s order. The district court described the deficiencies in Mr. Guinn\u2019s complaint, as amended, and we cannot improve on that description or analysis. We do note that Mr. Guinn alleges there is some conflict or confusion between local rule 8.1A, which states that a \u201cpro se party <em>shall </em>use the forms established by this court to file an action,\u201d and a court document Mr. Guinn attached to his appellate brief which provides general advice to pro se litigants and states that a non-incarcerated pro se litigant wishing to file a \u201ccivil lawsuit for a reason that is not related to employment\u201d <em>\u201cmay </em>use the General Complaint.\u201d (both emphases added). Mr. Guinn suggests that the \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d directives are in conflict. We need not resolve any such conflict, if it exists, because the district court provided ample other grounds for finding Mr. Guinn\u2019s complaint deficient, regardless of the precise form used. Furthermore, the court specifically directed Mr. Guinn to use its form, and enclosed a copy of the form. Thus, Mr. Guinn, in any event, ignored a direct order from the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>In short, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Mr. Guinn\u2019s complaint without prejudice. We deny Mr. Guinn\u2019s motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal, and we remind him that he is obligated to pay the full amount of the filing fee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b806-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-10\">. As named in Mr. Guinn's appellate brief, the defendants are: \"Jefferson County (Jeffco.) Combined Courts; Jeffco.
