After determining that GutierrezLanderos was subject to the career offender enhancements of the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court downwardly departed and sentenced him to 168 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>release. Gutierrez-Landeros appeals, arguing that his prior 1988 and 1995 drug conspiracy convictions do not constitute controlled substance offenses for purposes of the career offender provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2. Specifically, he contends that because a conviction for conspiracy under federal statutory conspiracy law does not require proof of an overt act, it does not meet the generic definition of conspiracy and does not constitute a controlled substance offense for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">As Gutierrez-Landeros concedes, we rejected materially indistinguishable arguments in <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>700 F.3d 751, 754 (5th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2044, 185 L.Ed.2d 902 (2013). Although <em>Rodriguez-Escareno </em>involved the definition of a drug trafficking offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, we discern no reason that its analysis should not apply to the nearly identical definition of a controlled substance offense for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Henao-Melo, </em>591 F.3d 798, 803 &amp; n. 7 (5th Cir.2009) (comparing the two definitions and noting that, given their similarities, this court cites decisions interpreting them interchangeably).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In light of the foregoing, GutierrezLanderos\u2019s unopposed motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b343-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
