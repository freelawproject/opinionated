He alleged in his complaint that the court-appointed attorney who represented him during his criminal proceedings had violated his constitutional rights by performing ineffectively. The district court dismissed his complaint after determining that his claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and that he had failed to show that his court-appointed attorney was a state actor for purposes of \u00a7 1983. The district court denied his motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that his appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Smith is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. </em>Taylor; 117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); FED. R. APP. P. 24(a)(5). A motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal \u201cmust be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Smith does not address the district court\u2019s determination that his claims were barred by <em>Heck. </em>Accordingly, he has abandoned any challenge to that determination, <em>see Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987), and has failed to demonstrate that his \u201cappeal involves legal points arguable on their merits.\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Smith has not shown that his appeal involves a nonfrivolous issue, we deny his motion to proceed IFP on appeal and dismiss his appeal as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5TH CIR. R. 42.2. His motion for the appointment of counsel is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We warn Smith that if he accumulates at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed in a court of the United States while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; \u00a7 1915(g) WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b503-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
