Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Rendon v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2008), and for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1070 (9th Cir.2008). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-22\">The BIA correctly determined that Singh is removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) because his conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 422, which resulted in a prison sentence of one year and four months, constitutes an aggravated-felony crime of violence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (\u201cThe term \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 means ... a crime of violence ... for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year\u201d); <em>Rosales-Rosales v. Ashcroft, </em>347 F.3d 714, 717 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201c[California Penal Code] \u00a7 422 meets the definition of a \u2018crime of violenee[.]\u2019 \u201d); <em>Latter-Singh v. Holder, </em>668 F.3d 1156, 1158 (9th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-23\">Because Singh\u2019s conviction is an aggravated felony, the BIA did not err in concluding that he is statutorily ineligible for asylum and cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii), 1158(b)(2)(B)(i), 1229b(a)(3); <em>see also Rendon, </em>520 F.3d at 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-24\">Contrary to Singh\u2019s contention, the agency applied the proper legal standard as set forth in <em>Matter of Frentescu, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 244, 247 (BIA 1982), in determining that Singh was convicted of a particularly serious crime, rendering him ineligible for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii). <em>See Anaya-Ortiz v. Holder, </em>594 F.3d 673, 679-80 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-25\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture, because Singh failed to establish that it is more likely than not he will be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>of India. <em>See Alphonsus v. Holder, </em>705 F.3d 1031, 1049-50 (9th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">In light of our disposition, we need not reach Singh\u2019s contentions concerning past and future persecution. Singh\u2019s remaining contentions are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b775-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
