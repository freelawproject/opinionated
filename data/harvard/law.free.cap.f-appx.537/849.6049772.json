He also challenges his 60 month sentence, arguing that the sentencing enhancement for abuse of a position of trust was double-counted and that the district court wrongly admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>non-victim witness testimony at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">We generally \u201creview jury instructions <em>de novo </em>to determine whether they misstate the law or mislead the jury to the prejudice of the objecting party.\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>642 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir.2011). But because Gianoli did not object to them in the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">The court instructed the jury that to convict it must find that Gianoli \u201ceither acted outside the usual course of professional practice or acted without legitimate medical purpose.\u201d Because Gianoli\u2019s indictment charged that he \u201cdid knowingly and intentionally act outside the course of professional practice\u201d by distributing Oxycodone, he argues that it was error to instruct the jury that it could convict him for acting without a legitimate medical purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Gianoli\u2019s argument is unpersuasive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There was no evidence or argument presented at trial that would lead the jury to conclude that Gianoli prescribed Oxycodone knowing it was for no legitimate medical purpose but still acted within the usual course of the medical profession. Those two things are inconsistent with each other. And the court\u2019s instructions were consistent with the law. <em>See United States v. Tobin, </em>676 F.3d 1264, 1282 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201c[A] distribution is unlawful if 1) the prescription was not for a \u2018legitimate medical purpose\u2019 <em>or </em>2) the prescription was not made in the \u2018usual course of professional practice.\u2019 \u201d). The court did not err \u2014 plainly or otherwise \u2014 in giving that instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">Gianoli also argues that the district court erred by using a general verdict form, making it impossible to know under which theory he was convicted. Gianoli proposed that a general verdict form be given to the jury, and the district court followed that request. Any error the district court may have made in giving the jury a general verdict form was therefore invited and cannot be challenged on appeal. <em>See James, </em>642 F.3d at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">Gianoli next argues that he was doubly penalized for his position as a physician because the court applied the two-level enhancement for abuse of a position of public trust or use of a special skill, provided for in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, even though his conviction was based on his conduct as a physician. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s conduct justifies the abuse of trust enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1264 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">Gianoli is correct that the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 enhancement cannot be applied if abuse of trust or skill is included in the base offense level or specific offense characteristic. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3; <em>see also United States v. Garrison, </em>133 F.3d 831, 842-843 (11th Cir.1998). But his contention that his conviction already incorporates his abuse of his position as a doctor is incorrect. The Controlled Substances Act states that, except as authorized, it is unlawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally distribute or dispense a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). That statute applies to anyone who distributes a controlled substance, not just physicians. Physician defendants are not subject to an increased base offense level based on their profession and special skills.</p>\n<p id=\"A7aT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number><em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a), (b). And the application notes state that professionals, including doctors, who used special skills in the commission of the offense may be subject to an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 8 (Nov. 1, 2011). Accordingly, it was not plain error to apply the \u00a7 3B1.3 enhancement, and we affirm Gianoli\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Finally, Gianoli argues for the first time on appeal that the district court should not have permitted any witnesses to testify at sentencing about his prescribing drugs to their relatives and neighbors because they were not direct victims of the misconduct for which Gianoli was convicted. Because he did not make that argument in the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Garey, </em>546 F.3d 1359, 1363 (11th Cir.2008). Gianoli bases his argument on the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act, which requires that certain persons classified as crime victims be given notice of and the opportunity to be heard at certain hearings, including sentencing hearings. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(a), (b). But that act does not limit the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense that a court may hear at sentencing. 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3661. The sentencing judge may conduct a broad inquiry, \u201clargely unlimited\u201d either as to the kind of information he may consider, or the source from which it may come. <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S.Ct. 589, 591, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972). Accordingly, the district court did not err \u2014 much less plainly err \u2014 by permitting the non-victim witnesses to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-10\">. It is notable that Gianoli himself introduced the \"legitimate medical purpose\u201d language, requesting that the jury be told that to convict, it must find that he dispensed Oxycodone \"other than for a legitimate medical purpose and not in the usual course of medical practice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
