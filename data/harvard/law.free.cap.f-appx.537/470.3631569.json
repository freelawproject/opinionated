He contends that his prior Texas conviction for attempted arson is not a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 or an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) and that he was therefore erroneously sentenced under the increased statutory maximum of \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Specifically, he asserts that the Texas statute under which he was convicted does not require as an element the use of physical force or the use of such force against the property of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The Government counters that Hernandez affirmatively waived the argument by raising it in his objections to the presentence report but abandoning it at sentencing. It therefore asserts that the argument is not reviewable on appeal. We do not decide the issue because, even if Hernandez\u2019s argument is forfeited rather than waived, it fails under the otherwise applicable plain error standard. <em>See United States v. Fernandez-Cusco, </em>447 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see. also Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">To show plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Subsection (b)(2) of \u00a7 1326 increases the applicable statutory maximum sentence if the defendant\u2019s prior removal was subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1326(b)(2). In the instant case, Hernandez was subject to the higher statutory penalties of \u00a7 1326(b)(2) based on his prior Texas conviction for attempted arson, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 28.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">The term \u201caggravated felony\u201d in \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Arson is not specifically listed, but one of the subsections of \u00a7 1101 defines an aggravated felony as a \u201ccrime of violence (as defined in section 16 of Title 18 ... for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F)). Section 16 of Title 18 does not list any enumerated offenses; it defines a crime of violence more generally as \u201can offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\u201d or \u201cany other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">This court has not specifically addressed whether Texas arson qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 16, or more generally as an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Consequently, the error Hernandez asserts is not clear or obvious under current law. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Parra, </em>581 F.3d 227, 231 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Trejo, </em>610 F.3d 308, 319 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">Alternatively, even if the district court clearly and obviously erred in finding that Hernandez\u2019s Texas conviction for attempted arson was a crime of violence under \u00a7 16 and, thus, an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43) and \u00a7 1326(b)(2), Hernandez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>fails to show reversible plain error. His prior attempted arson conviction is nevertheless a felony conviction under \u00a7 1326(b)(1). <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 28.02(d) and \u00a7 15.01(d). As such, Hernandez was subject to a statutory maximum sentence of at least 10 years of imprisonment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1326(b)(1). Because he received a sentence of 70 months, well less than either the 10- or 20-year m\u00e1ximums, Hernandez cannot show that any error in finding that he was subject to a 20-year statutory maximum sentence affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b488-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
