In No. 13-1248, Loy appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss the underlying Chapter 7 proceeding. Appeal No. 13-1358 is Loy\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s order adopting the bankruptcy court\u2019s report and recommendation to grant summary judgment in favor of Jeremiah O\u2019Sullivan, the trustee in Loy\u2019s English bankruptcy proceeding, on his claim seeking a declaratory judgment that two transfers of real property were void ab initio, and striking Susan Loy\u2019s affirmative defense in which she attempted to assert an ownership interest in the property. We have thoroughly reviewed the record on appeal as well as the parties\u2019 briefs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>find no reversible error. Accordingly, we grant Loy\u2019s motions to proceed in forma pauperis and affirm all appeals on the reasoning of the courts below. <em>Loy v. O\u2019Sullivan, </em>Nos. 4:12-cv-00091-RAJ-LRL; 4:12-cv-00090-RAJ-DEM; 4:12-cv-00115-RAJ-TEM; 4:12-ev-00151-RAJ-TEM (EJD.Va. Jan. 22, 2013; Feb. 12, 2013). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
