As his sole issue on appeal, Champion argues that the magistrate judge erred by denying his motions for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-18\">\u201cThis Court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion, if necessary.\u201d <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A magistrate judge has authority to hear and determine pretrial matters, such as motions for appointment of counsel. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A). However, a magistrate judge\u2019s orders are not final orders within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and may not be appealed to this court directly. <em>Donaldson v. Ducote, </em>373 F.3d 622, 624 (5th Cir.2004). Because the parties did not consent to proceed before the magistrate judge, and because Champion did not challenge the denials of his motions for appointment of counsel in the district court, this court lacks jurisdiction to address the denials of those motions. <em>See id. </em>at 624-25. Accordingly, we DISMISS Champion\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. His motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
