Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we repeat only those facts necessary to resolve the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-22\">The \u201cBIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of [petitioner\u2019s] withholding of removal claim on the basis of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, and we review adverse credibility determinations under the substantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-23\">Zhao claims that, because she violated China\u2019s one child policy, she was forced to undergo mandatory abortions and that she faces sterilization if she returns. Howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>er, Zhao concedes that there were a number of inconsistencies in her application and testimony. Although, under the Real ID Act, inconsistencies need not go to the heart of petitioner\u2019s claim, <em>Shrestha, </em>590 F.3d at 1046-47, the inconsistencies here were substantial and unexplained. The adverse credibility determination was well-founded and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Zhao claimed in her written asylum application that in China she had been forced to have two abortions for violating the one-child policy. However, at her hearing, Zhao testified that she had been forced to have four abortions, and appeared not to recall when they had taken place. Zhao also stated in her application that she was married in China in 1980, but testified at the hearing that she had never been married in China, and later at the same hearing changed her story again. Zhao\u2019s testimony about her residence in China also contradicted her application. She did not explain these discrepancies despite direct questions from the IJ. <em>See Rizk v. Holder, </em>629 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir.2011). Zhao also offered little explanation of how she survived in China for 17 years before coming to the United States, if she had genuinely been under real threat. She did not document the existence of her two children in China, despite telling the IJ that she could obtain birth certificates. <em>See Aden v. Holder, </em>589 F.3d 1040, 1044 (9th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">We also uphold the BIA\u2019s denial of Zhao\u2019s CAT claim. As the BIA noted, Zhao pointed to \u201cno evidence, beyond her discredited claim of past forced abortions, in support of her assertion that she risks torture by or with the acquiescence or \u2018willful blindness\u2019 of the government upon return to China.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b764-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
