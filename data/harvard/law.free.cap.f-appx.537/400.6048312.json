He argues that the district court imposed a procedurally and substantively unreasonable sentence by ordering that he serve a three-year term of supervised release without explanation and notwithstanding U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) (2011), which provides, inter alia, that supervised release should not ordinarily be imposed on a deportable alien. Because Rodriguez did not raise his objection in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-21\">Regarding Rodriguez\u2019s argument that the district court procedurally erred, the sentence imposed by the district court was within the guidelines range, notwithstanding \u00a7 501.1(e). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(a)(2). The requirement that the district court provide reasons for imposing supervised release is not onerous in these circumstances. <em>See United States v. Becerril-Pena, </em>714 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2013). In determining the appropriate sentence, the district court expressly discussed Rodriguez\u2019s particular facts and circumstances, including his family history and his strong reasons for wanting to return to this country, his prior illegal reentry convictions, and his prior alcohol-related convictions. While the district court did not discuss \u00a7 5Dl.l(c), this court has not imposed such a requirement where, as in , the instant case, a district court has not been asked to focus on \u00a7 5D1.1(c). <em>See United States v. Domin</em>guez-Alvarado, 695 F.3d 324, 328-30 (5th Cir.2012). Moreover, in adopting the presentence report (PSR), the district court implicitly considered \u00a7 5Dl.l(c). Thus, the district court\u2019s reasons were sufficient and do not constitute error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Becerril-Pena, </em>714 F.3d at 349; <em>Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-23\">Regarding Rodriguez\u2019s claim of substantive error, the district court implicitly considered \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) through its adoption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the PSR and expressly considered Rodriguez\u2019s history and characteristics, the need for the sentence to serve as a deterrent, and the need for the sentence to protect the public from crimes against the defendant. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(c); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B),(C). Moreover, because the sentence is within the guidelines range, we \u201cwill infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Rodriguez has thus failed to show that the district court made \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, he has failed to establish that the sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
