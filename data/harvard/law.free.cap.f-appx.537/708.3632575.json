Edmundson alleged that P &amp; G engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>false advertising for these products in violation of California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 17200-10, and Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1770. The district court dismissed Edmundson\u2019s action for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Reviewing the district court\u2019s dismissal de novo, and construing all allegations in Edmundson\u2019s favor, <em>Williams v. Gerber Prods. Co., 552 </em>F.3d 934, 937 (9th Cir.2008), we affirm. We have considered the packaging of the Fusion Power and Fusion Manual cartridges because Edmundson\u2019s complaint \u201cnecessarily relies\u201d on that packaging, and the parties do not dispute the authenticity of the reproductions in the record. <em>Marder v. Lopez, </em>450 F.3d 445, 448 (9th Cir.2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">1. Specific, quantifiable \u201cstatements of fact\u201d that refer to a product\u2019s absolute characteristics may constitute false advertising, while general, subjective, unverifiable claims are \u201cmere puffery\u201d that cannot. <em>Newcal Indus., Inc. v. Ikon Office Solution, </em>513 F.3d 1038, 1053 (9th Cir.2008). P <em>&amp; </em>G\u2019s claim that the blades in Fusion Power cartridges \u201chave a patented blade coating for incredible comfort\u201d is not a message that those cartridges are superior to Fusion Manual cartridges, and, in any event, is non-actionable puffery because it is general, subjective, and cannot be tested. <em>See Cook, Perkiss &amp; Liehe, Inc. v. N. Cal. Collection Serv., Inc., </em>911 F.2d 242, 246 (9th Cir.1990) (\u201c[Advertising which merely states in general terms that one product is superior is not actionable.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)); <em>cf. Southland Sod Farms v. Stover Seed Co., </em>108 F.3d 1134, 1145 (9th Cir.1997) (company\u2019s advertisement that its slow-growing grass required \u201c50% Less Mowing\u201d was an actionable statement of fact); <em>Sterling Drug, Inc. v. FTC, </em>741 F.2d 1146, 1151-53 (9th Cir.1984) (company\u2019s claim that its brand of aspirin was consistently better than other brands \u201cfor purity, stability, and speed of disintegration\u201d was properly determined not to be puffery). Any superiority message conveyed by the names and color coding P &amp; G uses for the two types of cartridges, or by the fact that P <em>&amp; </em>G charges more for Fusion Power cartridges, is even less specific and verifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">2. Edmundson\u2019s counter-arguments lack merit. First, the district court did not create a new standard for puffery, but rather properly held that a claim must be sufficiently specific, either by reference to particular product characteristics or \u201ccriteria for measuring a \u2018better\u2019 shave,\u201d such that the claim can be tested. <em>See Newcal Indus., </em>513 F.3d at 1053 (an actionable statement is one \u201cthat is quantifiable, that makes a claim as to the \u2018specific or absolute characteristics of a product\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Cook, Perkiss &amp; Liehe, </em>911 F.2d at 246)).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">Second, the district court\u2019s two dismissal orders, considered together, make clear that the court considered P &amp; G\u2019s advertising in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">Third, even assuming P &amp; G\u2019s advertising does convey the message that Fusion Power cartridges are generally superior to Fusion Manual cartridges, the advertising does not, contrary to Edmundson\u2019s allegations, assert superiority in terms of the specific attributes of closeness, comfort, irritation and pressure. Rather, the packaging for Fusion Power cartridges says only that the blades in the cartridges \u201chave a patented bladed coating for, incredible comfort\u201d; phrases such as \u201cless irritation,\u201d \u201cmore comfort\u201d and \u201creduee[d] pressure\u201d are found on the packaging for <em>all </em>Fusion cartridges, and are a comparison between Fusion cartridges and P &amp; G\u2019s \u201cMACH3\u201d cartridges, not between Fusion Power and Fusion Manual cartridges. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Similarly, nowhere does the packaging claim that Fusion Power blades are more comfortable \u201cvs. Fusion Manual\u201d blades.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">3. The district court properly dismissed Edmundson\u2019s claim that P &amp; G falsely advertised the compatibility of Fusion Power and Fusion Manual cartridges with different shaving handles. In his amended complaint, Edmundson expressly predicated that claim on his non-actionable superiority claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b724-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
