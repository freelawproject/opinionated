He argues on appeal that (1) his convictions under \u00a7 922(g)(1) and \u00a7 924(c) must be vacated because the reasoning of <em>National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2566, 183 L.Ed.2d 450 (2012), shows that these statutes exceed Congress\u2019 power to regulate interstate activity under the Commerce Clause; and (2) his \u00a7 924(c) conviction must also be vacated because during his plea colloquy the district court incorrectly advised him that \u00a7 924(c) carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that Mr. Broughton\u2019s claims lack merit, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">In arguing for vacatur of his convictions, Mr. Broughton invites us to overturn well-settled circuit precedent that squarely forecloses his contentions. We decline this invitation; the court\u2019s published opinions are binding on subsequent panels until overruled by our panel sitting <em>en banc </em>or the Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">We first reject Mr. Broughton\u2019s claim that the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>National Federation of Independent Business </em>decision renders \u00a7 922(g)(1) and \u00a7 924(c) unconstitutional. We have previously ruled that these statutes fall within Congress\u2019 power to regulate interstate activity under the Commerce Clause. We concluded that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is constitutional because the government must show a felon possessed a firearm that traveled in interstate commerce, <em>see United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2001), and that \u00a7 924(c) is constitutional because it involves the regulation of activity that has an effect on interstate commerce, <em>see United States v. Ferreira, </em>275 F.3d 1020, 1028 (11th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. DePace, </em>120 F.3d 233, 235 n. 2 (11th Cir.1997). Nothing in <em>National Federation of Independent Business </em>casts doubt on prior our reasoning; the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in that case pertains only to whether Congress may \u201ccompel\u201d individuals to become active in interstate commerce, i.e., whether it may regulate inactivity. <em>See Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus., </em>132 S.Ct. at 2585-93 (opinion of Chief Justice Roberts), 2644-50 (opinion of Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">We are also unpersuaded by Mr. Broughton\u2019s argument that the \u00a7 924(c) conviction must be vacated because he was misinformed by the district court that a violation of the statute carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(H), a court may only accept a guilty plea after conveying and making sure the defendant understands \u201cany maximum possible penalty, including imprisonment, fine, and term of supervised release\u201d associated with a plea of guilty. <em>United States v. Tyndale, </em>209 F.3d 1292, 1295 (11th Cir. 2000). Mr. Broughton argues that the maximum sentence he could receive for pleading guilty to \u00a7 924(c) is seven years, a conclusion he contends is supported by \u201ccomments by three Supreme Court Justices during the oral argument before the [sic] that Court in <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S. 218, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 176 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>L.Ed.2d 979 (2010).... \u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12. In light of this premise, he asserts the district court violated Rule 11 by telling him that the maximum penalty under \u00a7 924(c) is life in prison. The problem for Mr. Broughton is that his premise is flawed. Indeed, he concedes that every circuit to consider the maximum penalty for violating \u00a7 924(c) has concluded that the statute carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. We joined that group in <em>United States v. Pounds, </em>230 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2000), and have not receded from that holding. Accordingly, the district court properly explained that the maximum sentence for a conviction under \u00a7 924(c) is life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
