MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b826-15\">Federal prisoner, Kenyatta Wayne Acey, seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. The matter is before this court on Acey\u2019s request for a certif\u00edcate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (providing no appeal may be taken from a \u201cfinal order in a proceeding under section 2255\u201d unless the movant first obtains a COA). Because Acey has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this appeal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-16\">Acey pleaded guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base (crack), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). He was sentenced to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. Although the written plea agreement contained a waiver of Acey\u2019s right to directly appeal or collaterally attack his conviction and sentence, he filed a direct appeal with this court. <em>United States v. Acey, </em>419 Fed.Appx. 808 (10th Cir.2011) (unpublished disposition). This court enforced the waiver and dismissed Acey\u2019s appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-17\">Acey filed the instant \u00a7 2255 motion on June 22, 2012, asserting he should have been sentenced pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. <em>See Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2331, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). The district court concluded this claim fell within the scope of a knowing and voluntary waiver. <em>See United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1325-27 (10th Cir.2004). The court further concluded that enforcing the waiver would not result in a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, the court enforced the waiver as to the Fair Sentencing Act claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-20\">The district court resolved Acey\u2019s ineffective assistance claim relating to the negotiation of his plea agreement on the merits after determining that claim did not fall within the waiver. <em>See United States v. Cockerham, </em>237 F.3d 1179, 1183 (10th Cir.2001). The court, however, denied relief, concluding Acey\u2019s nonspecific allegations of ineffective assistance were insufficient to show deficient performance. The court further concluded Acey failed to show any prejudice flowing from counsel\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-21\">To be entitled to a COA, Acey must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make the requisite showing, he must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quotations omitted). In evaluating whether Acey has satisfied his burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of his claims. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029. Although Acey need not demonstrate his appeal will succeed to be entitled to a COA, he must \u201cprove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Having undertaken a review of Acey\u2019s application for a COA and appellate filings, the district court\u2019s order, and the entire record on appeal pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller-El, </em>this court concludes he is not entitled to a COA. The district court\u2019s resolution of Acey\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is not reasonably subject to debate and the issues he seeks to raise on appeal are not adequate to deserve further proceedings. Accordingly, this court denies Acey\u2019s request for a COA and dismisses this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
