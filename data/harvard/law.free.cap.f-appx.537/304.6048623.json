Bonnette, </em>74 F.3d 671, 674 (5th Cir.1996). M &amp; P Barge Co., as owner of the HELEN CALYX, filed such a petition after its vessel collided with another vessel, which resulted in personal injuries to the vessel\u2019s passengers. Mid-ship Marine, which built the HELEN CALYX, filed an answer in the limitation action and sought indemnification and contribution because it was also named as a defendant in several suits brought by passengers. M &amp; P Barge settled all of the personal injury suits filed against it and then sought voluntary dismissal of the limitation action. Midship Marine, which settled all but one of the suits filed against it (the Dupont suit<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>), objected to the dismissal on the ground that the federal court has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate its claim in the limitation action. The district court granted dismissal of M &amp; P Barge\u2019s action but without prejudice to Midship Marine\u2019s claims for indemnification and contribution. Midship Marine now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">We review jurisdictional issues de novo. <em>Physician Hosps. of Am. v. Sebelius, </em>691 F.3d 649, 652 (5th Cir.2012). Motions for voluntary dismissal in federal court generally \u201cshould be freely granted unless the non-moving party will suffer some plain legal prejudice.\u201d <em>Elbaor v. Tripath Imaging, Inc., </em>279 F.3d 314, 317 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(2). Midship Marine contends that the district court\u2019s dismissal of the limitation action was erroneous because Midship Marine had already filed an answer and a claim for indemnity and contribution, and the federal district court is the exclusive forum for adjudicating claims brought by a limitation claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">It is true that parties seeking indemnity or contribution from a shipowner are considered claimants under the Limitation Act, and the federal court is the usual forum where such claims are adjudicated absent unanimous consent from all claimants. <em>See Odeco, </em>74 F.3d at 675. But the purpose of the Limitation Act is to protect the shipowner, who has an absolute right to limit his or her liability, <em>id. </em>at 674, and to consolidate all actions against the owner into a single case where all claims may be disposed of simultaneously. <em>Karim v. Finch Shipping Co., </em>265 F.3d 258, 264 (5th Cir.2001). Here, all claims against the shipowner arising from the accident and for which the owner would seek to limit its liability have been settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Midship Marine has a claim for indemnification and contribution because of claims against it in the Dupont suit, but M &amp; P Barge \u201cis not \u2018required\u2019 to take advantage of\u2019 the Limitation Act\u2019s protection with respect to that claim. <em>Karim, </em>265 F.3d at 265 n. 10. As the district court found, M &amp; P Barge has given up its right to seek limitation of liability for any claim by Mid-ship Marine. Midship Marine\u2019s citation to <em>Karim </em>is not to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">In that case, an injured seaman brought claims against his vessel, and the vessel owner sought to limit its liability in a limitation action. <em>Id. </em>at 261. The vessel owner later sought voluntary dismissal after the seaman\u2019s separate state suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 262. The district court denied the motion. <em>Id. </em>We affirmed, but in that case the seaman had initiated claims for his injuries in the limitation action, <em>id. </em>at 261, and the vessel owner sought dismissal based on the district court\u2019s alleged lack of in personam jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>at 268. We held that the vessel owner could not be permitted to simply abandon the limitation action after having invoked the federal court\u2019s jurisdiction and the protections of the Limitation Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 265, 268 &amp; n. 13. <em>Karim </em>is inapposite. Here, M &amp; P Barge, unlike the vessel owner in <em>Karim, </em>initiated the limitation action because of personal injury claims that have now all been resolved. Midship Marine\u2019s claim against M &amp; P Barge is a garden variety claim for indemnity and contribution arising from the separate Dupont suit against Midship Marine. As the district court held, whatever claims for indemnity or contribution that Midship Marine may have against M &amp; P Barge may be asserted in that state court suit. Under the circumstances, we perceive no error by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\">. Although the district court\u2019s order also permitted voluntary dismissal of a limitation action by Blessey Enterprises, Inc., Midship Mari\u00f1e has not contested that portion of the order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-13\">. The plaintiffs in the Dupont suit settled their claims against M &amp; P Barge, agreed to indemnify the shipowner from claims for indemnity or contribution, and reserved their right to sue Midship Marine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b330-5\">. More specifically, the vessel owner\u2019s actions that we found objectionable were as follows: In sum, we are faced with a situation in which [the vessel owner] filed a limitation proceeding and placed the res in the hands of the court, let the proceeding pend for four years, made use of the concursus and monition, utilized the district court for its own interests by, for example, attempting to maintain a multi-claimant action by itself filing claims against other parties and opposing Karim's access to other courts, and then after the vessel was sold (and the company defunct), filed a motion to dismiss the limitation action on the basis of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-21\"><em>Karim, </em>265 F.3d at 268 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
