Blanton\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), concluding that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Blanton was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. The Government has declined to file a response brief. Following a careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-24\">Before accepting Blanton\u2019s guilty plea, the district court conducted a thorough plea colloquy, fully complying with Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 and ensuring that Blanton\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary and supported by an independent factual basis. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116 (4th Cir.1991). The court subsequently followed all necessary procedural steps in sentencing Blanton, properly calculating his Guidelines range, considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors and the parties\u2019 arguments, and providing an individualized assessment based on the facts presented. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Blanton\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence is presumed substantively reasonable on appeal, and he has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>met his burden to rebut this presumption. <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Blanton, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Blanton requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Blanton.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
