Concluding that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, and the case met the abstention criteria listed in <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 53, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), the district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous pursuant to its screening authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). We review for abuse of discretion. <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">The district court properly determined that it lacked diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332: Nixon alleges in his complaint that he resides in Dallas, Texas, and that the defendant resides in Austin, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-20\">The district court properly determined that it lacked federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. \u201cThe Declaratory Judgment Act is not an independent ground for jurisdiction; it permits the award of declaratory relief only when other bases for jurisdiction are present.\u201d <em>Jones v. Alexander, </em>609 F.2d 778, 781 (5th Cir.1980). No other basis for federal jurisdiction is apparent. The complaint states that \u201c[t] he federal question relates to civil practice and remedies code chapter 39.002.\u201d The complaint does not elaborate how a state statute addressing default judgments \u2014 Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Chapter 39.002 \u2014 gives rise to a federal question. In response to the district court\u2019s instruction to state more clearly the legal basis for his suit, Nixon reiterated that he was challenging the state court\u2019s ruling on the basis of state law, and supported his claim with citations to Texas state court decisions and rules of civil procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-21\">Having concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, we do not address the district court\u2019s alternative grounds for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-22\">Nixon\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous, 5th Cir. R. 42.2, and his motion on appeal for a preliminary injunction is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b528-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
