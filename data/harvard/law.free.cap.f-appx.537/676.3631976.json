Conlon, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b693-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">Appellant Jose Luis Nazario appeals the district court\u2019s decision granting the Defendant, City of Riverside, summary judgment in this action under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4301 et seq. In 2007, Nazario, a veteran, was employed by the Riverside Police Department (RPD) as a probationary police officer. When RPD was notified by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office that they intended to arrest, charge, and prosecute Nazario on felony charges related to alleged misconduct during his military service, RPD discharged him. After Nazario was acquitted of all charges, Nazario reapplied to RPD, but his application was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">Nazario argues that RPD\u2019s decisions to terminate, and subsequently refuse to rehire, him were improperly motivated by alleged misconduct during his military service, which he claims is included within the \u201cperformance of service\u201d protected by USERRA. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311(a) (\u201cA person who ... has performed ... in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment [or] reemployment ... by an employer on the basis of that ... performance of service----\u201d). The district court held that his alleged misconduct did not qualify as \u201cperformance of service\u201d under the statute and therefore granted the Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. However, we need not, and do not, reach the question of whether alleged misconduct during uniformed service is protected \u201cperformance of service\u201d under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-17\">An employer violates USERRA when \u201cperformance of service\u201d is a motivating factor in an adverse action unless an employer can prove that the adverse action in question would have been taken regardless of the protected status or conduct. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-18\">With respect to the initial termination decision, RPD\u2019s deputy chief affirmed that \u201cNazario was separated from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>his probationary employment with the City of Riverside Police Department because of his arrest on federal criminal charges and his impending Federal criminal trial\u201d and that he was treated no differently than any probationary police officer would have been under those circumstances. RPD\u2019s chief also affirmed that \u201c[t]he sole basis for'this decision was the U.S. Attorney\u2019s representation of the impending arrest.\u201d The deputy chief also declared that in every case where an RPD officer has been arrested for a felony offense, \u201cthe officer\u2019s employment was terminated, either through involuntary termination or resignation/retirement in lieu of termination.\u201d Thus, RPD\u2019s evidence establishes that Nazario\u2019s employment was terminated, as any officer\u2019s employment would have been, because he was arrested and charged with a felony, regardless of the alleged conduct underlying those charges. Nazario did not present any evidence to cast doubt on RPD\u2019s assertion that it would terminate any probationary police officer arrested on a felony charge, regardless of the validity or content of that charge. Therefore, RPD has demonstrated that Nazario would have been terminated regardless of the asserted protected conduct. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">With respect to RPD\u2019s decision not to rehire Nazario, RPD provided ample evidence that it would not have rehired Nazario regardless of the alleged misconduct and subsequent arrest. Several RPD witnesses consistently stated that the decision not to rehire Nazario was based exclusively on two factors: (1) an intervening restraining order issued against Nazario after alleged domestic violence against his wife and (2) the department\u2019s discovery of numerous improper statements made by Nazario on federal wiretaps. Nazario has not rebutted these statements. Therefore, RPD has established that Nazario would not have been rehired regardless of the asserted protected conduct. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that RPD has demonstrated that there are no genuine issues of fact regarding whether RPD would have taken these adverse actions against Nazario regardless of his alleged misconduct in the service and therefore is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to the Defendant, City of Riverside, on that separate ground. <em>See Crowley v. Nevada ex rel. Nevada Sec\u2019y of State, </em>678 F.3d 730, 734 (9th Cir.2012) (\u201cSummary judgment may be affirmed on any ground supported by the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b693-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
