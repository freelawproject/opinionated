We have reviewed the administrative record and Petitioners\u2019 contentions, and conclude that we lack jurisdiction over the claims challenging prior Board orders from which Petitioners failed to file a timely petition for review. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review in part with respect to those claims. Next, after reviewing Petitioners\u2019 claims relative to the instant order under review, we conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen and reconsider. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2013). We therefore deny the petition for review in part for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Karp, </em>(B.I.A. Feb. 25, 2013). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-19\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, AND DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
