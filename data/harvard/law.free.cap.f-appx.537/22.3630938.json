A litigant \u2018raising only a generally available grievance about government \u2014 claiming only harm to his and every citizen\u2019s interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large does not state an Article III case or controversy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hollingsworth v. Perry, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2652, 2662, 186 L.Ed.2d 768 (2013) (quoting <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 573-74, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)). Accordingly, Credico lacks standing to bring this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">A district court should generally give leave to amend prior to dismissing a complaint as frivolous, or make its own determination whether any amendment would be futile. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir.2002), Although the District Court did not do so here, we are satisfied after reading Credico\u2019s filings in the District Court and on appeal that any amendment would have been futile. Accordingly, we hold that this appeal is frivolous, and will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b46-13\">. Because Credico's timely appeal from the denial of his motion for reconsideration \"brings up the underlying judgment for review,\u201d we will review the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Credico\u2019s complaint as frivolous, as well as its denial of his motion for reconsideration. <em>LeBoon </em>v. <em>Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Ctr. Ass\u2019n, </em>503 F.3d 217, 225 n. 6 (3d Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-21\">2. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint as frivolous or malicious for abuse of discretion. <em>See Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992). Having granted Credico leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we must dismiss his appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it is frivolous, i.e., if it has no arguable basis in law. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). We review the denial of his motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Max's Seafood Cafe v. Quinteros, </em>176 F.3d 669, 673 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b47-9\">. We conclude that the District Court properly denied Credico's second motion for reconsideration because it did not meet the requirements under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). <em>See Lazaridis v. Wehmer, </em>591 F.3d 666, 669 (3d Cir.2010) (per curiam) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
