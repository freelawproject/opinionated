Sukul contends that his hearing counsel was so ineffective that he was unable to reasonably present his ease, depriving him of his due process right to a fair hearing. Specifically, he claims that counsel failed to prepare him to testify about an alleged incident where Sukul was kidnapped by Fijian authorities, fully review the record, consult with him and his wife, file certain documents, ask \u201cproper questions,\u201d and \u201censure adequate translation of the hearings.\u201d We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">In order to succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must comply with the following procedural requirements: (1) provide an affidavit detailing the agreement with counsel; (2) notify counsel of the allegations so that counsel has an opportunity to respond; and (3) disclose whether the alien has filed a complaint with the disciplinary authorities. <em>Correa-Rivera v. Holder, </em>706 F.3d 1128, 1131 (9th Cir.2013) (citing <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988)). Furthermore, the alien must demonstrate that counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence and that counsel\u2019s failure was prejudicial. <em>Chuen Pin Kwong v. Holder, </em>671 F.3d 872, 880 (9th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2885, 186 L.Ed.2d 933 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">Here, Sukul failed to comply with most (if not all) of the procedural requirements. Although we do not demand strict compliance where the purposes of the requirements are \u201cfully served by other means\u201d or counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance is \u201cobvious and undisputed on the face of the record,\u201d <em>Reyes v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 592, 597 (9th Cir.2004), this is not such a case. On its face, the record shows that there were several inaccuracies in the application in which Sukul described the kidnapping incident and that Sukul did not prepare it himself, stating that he had \u201cno idea\u201d what was in the application. Because Sukul failed to provide counsel with an opportunity to respond to his claims of ineffective assistance, we cannot determine whether counsel had valid reasons for declining to elicit testimony about the alleged incident. Consequently, it is \u201cimpossible to determine whether [Sukul\u2019s] ineffective assistance of counsel claim has merit.\u201d <em>Ta</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number><em>mang v. Holder, </em>598 F.3d 1083, 1090 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Sukul\u2019s failure to comply with the procedural requirements similarly precludes us from assessing his other claims of ineffective assistance. In any event, Sukul has not explained how the outcome of the proceedings might have been affected had counsel performed as he contends she should have, and consequently, Sukul has not demonstrated prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b744-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
