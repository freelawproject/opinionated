We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">In December 2011, Mi pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846. The District Court conducted a sentencing hearing in June 2012. Because Mi had three prior drug distribution convictions, he qualified for career offender status under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B 1.1. Accordingly, his base offense level was 34. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(2). Mter a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, the total offense level was 31. Combined with a criminal history category of VI, Mi\u2019s advisory Guidelines range was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">At the sentencing hearing, Mi did not dispute the Guidelines calculation or request a downward departure. Instead, he argued for a downward variance on the basis that the career offender Guideline was overly punitive when applied to him. Specifically, Mi argued that the relatively minor nature of his prior drug convictions made application of the career offender Guideline unjust and greater than necessary to meet sentencing objectives. He also noted that his conviction would have been subject to a ten-year maximum term of imprisonment if charges had been brought in state court and thus a sentence within the Guidelines range would create unwarranted sentencing disparities. Finally, Mi\u2019s mother and fianc\u00e9e testified to the positive role that Mi played in their lives and the life of his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s son. <em>After </em>considering these arguments and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the District Court determined that a within-Guidelines sentence was appropriate, and sentenced Mi to 204 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by five years of supervised release. Mi appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-16\">II<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-17\">On appeal, Mi argues that the Distinct Court\u2019s sentence was substantively unreasonable. Our review is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[W]e will affirm ... unless no reasonable sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence on that particular defendant for the reasons the district court provided.\u201d <em>United States v. Tomko, </em>562 F.3d 558, 568 (3d Cir.2009) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-18\">Mthough the District Court acknowledged Mi\u2019s arguments for a downward variance, it cited a number of reasons for its decision that a within-Guidelines sentence of 204 months\u2019 imprisonment was appropriate. It noted that Mi\u2019s long criminal history demonstrated that \u201ceven in the face of arrests and convictions and incarceration, [he] is not able to find another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>way of life.\u201d App. 82. The Court detailed Ali\u2019s numerous drug arrests and convictions, including two arrests for distribution offenses after he had been convicted and was awaiting sentencing on a third distribution charge. It also observed that in addition to the distribution convictions that provided the predicate for the application of the career offender Guideline, Ali had two convictions for possession offenses that did not qualify as predicates. Given this history and Ali\u2019s apparent inability or unwillingness \u201cto do anything with his life other than deal drugs,\u201d App. 82, the District Court found that its sentence provided just punishment for this defendant and this crime, promoted respect for the law, and protected the public from future crimes. These considerations are not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-13\">.
