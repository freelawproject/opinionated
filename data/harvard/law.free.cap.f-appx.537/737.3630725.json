R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b753-16\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-17\">Steven and Ruby Dhillon appeal the grant of summary judgment to the government on their claims that they were denied due process of law during Ms. Dhillon\u2019s removal proceedings and during the adjudication of Mr. Dhillon\u2019s 1-130 petition for an immediate relative visa for Ms. Dhillon. Because the parties are familiar with the history of the case, we need not recount it here. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-21\">The district court correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain any challenge to Ms. Dhillon\u2019s removal proceedings because \u201ca petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals ... shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5). The district court was also correct that the process by which Mr. Dhillon\u2019s 1-130 petition was denied comports with the applicable statutes and regulations. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 103.2, 103.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-22\">Finally, we also agree that the Dhillons received constitutionally adequate due process. <em>See Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976) (explaining the factors to be considered). The Dhillons do not assert that the statements they challenge are untrue or otherwise challenge the substance of those statements, and they have never proffered any theory under which the cross examination they seek would have enhanced or altered the adjudication of Mr. Dhillon\u2019s petition. The Dhillons do not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that they make an as-applied challenge to the due process they received. We hold that the process they received was adequate because the process they request \u201ccould not have made a determinative difference\u201d in their case. <em>Lassiter v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. of Durham Cnty., </em>452 U.S. 18, 33, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>particular, there was very little \u201crisk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,\u201d and seemingly no \u201cprobable value\u201d from the \u201cadditional ... procedural safeguards\u201d that the Dhillons seek. <em>Mathews, </em>424 U.S. at 335, 96 S.Ct. 893; <em>see Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 </em>U.S. 1, 14, 111 S.Ct. 2105, 115 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991) (considering, in an as-applied procedural due process challenge,- whether \u201cthe risk of error was substantial in this case\u201d). The second <em>Mathews </em>factor is dispositive of the Dhillons\u2019 due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b753-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-23\">. In <em>Lassiter, </em>the Supreme Court determined that Ms. Lassiter was not entitled to counsel in her parental termination proceedings because \u201cpresence of counsel for Ms. Lassiter could not have made a determinative difference\u201d in her case. 452 U.S. 18, 33, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981). The Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Court looked at \"all these circumstances,\u201d in \"holding] that the trial court did not err in failing to appoint counsel for Ms. Lassiter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33, 101 S.Ct. 2153; <em>see also id. </em>at 49, 101 S.Ct. 2153 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (criticizing the majority for its case-specific determination).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
