He argues that the district court erred when it characterized his prior conviction for conspiracy involving the importation of cocaine as a drug trafficking offense and increasing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-21\">According to Fernandez-Rubio, his conspiracy conviction is not a drug trafficking offense because, unlike the generic, contemporary definition of conspiracy, the federal drug conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, of which he was convicted does not require proof of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. He concedes, however, that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>700 F.3d 751, 753-54 (5th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2044, 185 L.Ed.2d 902 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-23\">In <em>Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>we concluded that a reasonable interpretation of the Guidelines provides that conspiring to commit a federal drug trafficking offense qualifies for the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) enhancement. 700 F.3d at 753-54. Accordingly, Fernandez-Rubio\u2019s motion for summary disposition is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
