We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, deny Moreira\u2019s petition with respect to his asylum and withholding claims, and grant Moreira\u2019s petition with respect to his CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">An \u201cimmutable characteristic is a sine qua non for status as a member of a \u2018particular social group.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Donchev v. Mukasey, </em>553 F.3d 1206, 1217 (9th Cir. 2009). Moreira\u2019s purported social group of \u201cmiddle class small business owners\u201d does not satisfy that standard. <em>Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1171 (9th Cir.2005) (group of \u201cbusiness owners\u201d did not share an \u201cinnate characteristic\u201d); <em>Dimitranov v. Ashcroft, </em>96 Fed.Appx. 514, 515 (9th Cir. 2004) (\u201c[Bjeing a [small] business owner is not something so fundamental to Dimitranov\u2019s identity or conscience that he cannot be expected to change it\u201d); <em>see also Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 234 (BIA 1985) (\u201c[T]he internationally accepted concept of a refugee simply does not guarantee an individual a right to work in the job of his choice\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 439 (BIA 1987). Accordingly, Moreira is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal based on his membership in a particular social group.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">The BIA denied Moreira\u2019s application for CAT relief by stating only that \u201c[t]he record fails to demonstrate that the respondent is more likely than not to be tortured by, or with the acquiescence of, anyone within governmental authority.\u201d In ruling on an application for CAT relief, <em>\u201call </em>evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture <em>shall </em>be considered,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(3) (emphasis added), and \u201ccountry conditions alone can play a decisive role in granting relief under the Convention,\u201d <em>Kamalthas v. I.N.S., </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1280 (9th Cir.2001). Thus, we \u201cgrant petitions for review in CAT cases where the BIA did not consider country conditions evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Cole v. Holder, </em>659 F.3d 762, 771 (9th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreira submitted probative documentary evidence of country conditions that the BIA did not address; the BIA may not recite the standard for CAT relief and then state summarily that the alien failed to meet it. <em>Cf. Sagaydak v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 1035, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>1040 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cUs and the BIA are not free to ignore arguments raised by a petitioner\u201d). Therefore, we grant Moreira\u2019s petition for review on his CAT claim and remand to the BIA so it may cogently address Moreira\u2019s country conditions evidence in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">PETITION DENIED on the asylum and withholding of removal claims, and PETITION GRANTED on the CAT claim. The parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b756-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-11\">. We need not remand Moreira\u2019s case for reconsideration in light of <em>Henriquez-Rivas v. Holder, </em>707 F.3d 1081 (9th Cir.2013) (en banc), because <em>Henriquez-Rivas </em>dealt only with the \"social visibility\" and \"particularity\u201d requirements for demonstrating membership in a particular social group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b756-15\">. Because it properly determined Moreira\u2019s purported social group was not cognizable, the BIA\u2019s failure to address Moreira\u2019s argument that \"changed circumstances\u201d excused the untimeliness of his asylum application was harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b757-6\">REINHARDT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AyQ\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">I agree that we should remand Moreira\u2019s CAT claim.
