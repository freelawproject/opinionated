R\u00edaseos argues for a variety of reasons that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately consider the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He asks us to reduce his sentence by 60 months to a total of 240-months imprisonment. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-18\">R\u00edaseos, with a partner, was responsible for organizing and smuggling out of Colombia over 44-thousand kilograms of cocaine with an ample amount transported to the United States. In July of 2009, the United States Navy captured R\u00edaseos in open waters and returned him to Colombia. To secure R\u00edaseos\u2019 extradition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>United States Government, in a diplomatic note with Colombia, agreed that prosecutors would not seek or impose upon Riascos a sentence of life imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">When reviewing a sentence for substantive reasonability, a sentence is substantively unreasonable if, considering the totality of the circumstances, the court weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors unreasonably and imposed a sentence that did not achieve the purposes of sentencing outlined in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc). </em>The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of proving the sentence enforced was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Riascos first argues that his impoverished background and history as a hard-worker are mitigating factors, which should reduce his culpability under the \u201chistory and characteristics\u201d prong of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1). However, under that prong the district judge must also contemplate the \u201cnature and circumstances\u201d of the offenses. The record shows the district judge took into account both prongs of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) and determined Riascos\u2019 transportation of upwards of $1 billion worth of cocaine and high-level organizational involvement were significant enough to warrant his 300-month sentence under the \u201cnature and circumstances\u201d element of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Riascos next argues that, because he will be released after the age of 70, there is no need to protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). The district judge took this into consideration and was within his discretion to reject the argument. <em>See United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.1 (\u201cwhile [a]ge may be a reason to depart downward in a ease in which the defendant is elderly and infirm and where a form of punishment such as home confinement might be equally efficient as and less costly than incarceration,\u201d age \u201cis not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure is warranted\u201d). Further, Riascos argues he received a sentence disparate to his coconspirators. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). However, the other members of the drug smuggling operation were cooperative with law enforcement, which resulted in their downward variance. In fact, multiple co-conspirators were instrumental in the aid of Riascos\u2019 prosecution. Riascos\u2019 interaction with law enforcement bears little resemblance to his co-conspirators. For those reasons, Riascos did not receive a sentence incongruent to his counterparts.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">Riascos argues his sentence was greater than necessary to promote the purposes of sentencing under \u00a7 3553(a). Riascos smuggled over $1 billion in cocaine and had a Sentencing Guidelines recommendation of life imprisonment. The district judge was well within his discretion to impose a 300-month sentence based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1189. Lastly, Riascos argues there were other types of sentences available, yet fails to state any more appropriate alternatives. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(3). Instead, Riascos conflates this contention by claiming his sentence violates the diplomatic agreement to not impose a life sentence because his 300-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>month sentence is tantamount to life. However', where a diplomatic agreement only excludes a life sentence, a term of years is a permissible punishment. <em>See United States v. Corona-Verbera, </em>509 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The district judge did not abuse his discretion in sentencing R\u00edaseos to 300-months imprisonment. The district judge considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and made his reasoning clear in fashioning a sentence. Thus, R\u00edaseos failed to meet his burden of proving the sentence was unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm Riascos\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-10\">. The reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Ruhlman, </em>711 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2013) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b916-7\">. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, Riascos' recommended sentence was life imprisonment. However, due to the diplomatic agreement, the district judge never considered life imprisonment as a viable option. Further, the record indicates the district judge was disinclined to sentence Riascos to life imprisonment based on a thorough contemplation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
