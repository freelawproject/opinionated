We dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-23\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Lopez Jauregui\u2019s motion to reopen to reapply for cancellation of removal, where the BIA concluded that the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>evidence accompanying his motion was insufficient to overcome its previous denial of cancellation of removal in the exercise of discretion. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 601 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201cIf ... the BIA determines that a motion to reopen proceedings in which there has already been an unreviewable discretionary determination ... does not make out a prima facie case for that relief, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) precludes our visiting the merits.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Lopez Jauregui\u2019s contentions that the BIA failed to state its reasons for finding no evidence of genuine rehabilitation, failed to consider or to properly weigh all of the evidence, and failed to accept his declaration as true are not sufficiently colorable questions of law to trigger our jurisdiction. <em>See Mendez-Castro v. Mukasey, </em>552 F.3d 975, 978 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201cTo be colorable in this context, the [question of law] need not be substantial, but the claim must have some possible validity.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b780-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
