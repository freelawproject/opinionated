We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Santos contends that the district court erred by denying him a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). He argues that he demonstrated acceptance of responsibility because he offered to plead nolo contendere to some of the gun charges before trial, and expressed remorse for that conduct in his post-trial statements. We review the district court\u2019s factual finding about whether a defendant has accepted responsibility for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1284 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Notwithstanding Santos\u2019s offer to plead nolo contendere and his post-trial statements, the district court did not clearly err in denying the adjustment because Santos never admitted to the conduct underlying his drug conviction and never expressed remorse or contrition for that conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 1(A); <em>United States v. Nielsen, </em>371 F.3d 574, 582-83 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b791-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
