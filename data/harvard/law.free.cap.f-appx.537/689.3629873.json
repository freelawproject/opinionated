We have jurisdiction pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The district court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous. <em>See Pannebecker v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, </em>542 F.3d 1213, 1217 (9th Cir.2008), It was not \u201cillogical, implausible, or without support ... in the record\u201d for the district court to find that: (1) the Northrop Grumman Health Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d) was in effect and available to Pollok when he became disabled; (2) there was only one \u201cBenefits Online\u201d website containing the Summary Plan Description (\u201cSPD\u201d); (3) the SPD vested discretionary authority in Unum as the Plan\u2019s administrator; and (4) the SPD provided that benefits payments could be offset against certain benefits received from other sources. <em>See United States v. Hinkson, </em>585 F.3d 1247, 1251 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Nor were the district court\u2019s legal conclusions in error. <em>See Pannebecker, </em>542 F.3d at 1217. The Plan vested discretionary authority in the Plan administrator, and therefore it was proper for the district court to review the benefits determination for abuse of discretion. <em>See Abatie v. Alta Health &amp; Life Ins. Co., </em>458 F.3d 955, 969 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc). The district court also properly concluded that Pollok\u2019s benefits payments could be offset against certain benefits received from other sources. The district court did not improperly place the burden on Pollok to show that the Plan lacked offset provisions. <em>See Zavora v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>145 F.3d 1118, 1120 &amp; n. 2 (9th Cir.1998) (explaining that the burden of establishing the existence and terms of an ERISA plan is on the insurer).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b705-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
