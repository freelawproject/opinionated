He contends that the district court erred in determining that his prior conviction of distribution of marihuana, in violation of New Mexico Statute \u00a7 30-31-22(A), was a controlled-substance offense (\u201cCSO\u201d) for purposes of the career-offender provisions of United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1. According to Gilbert-son, the state offense could have been committed by a mere offer to sell without possession of a controlled substance, an act that is not within the pertinent definition of a CSO.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-22\">We ordinarily review the district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir. 2008). Although Gilbertson argued in the district court that the New Mexico statute did not meet the definition of a CSO, he did not alert the district court to any concerns related to the statute\u2019s inclusion of the term \u201cattempted transfer\u201d insofar as the statute may \u2014 as Gilbertson now argues \u2014 include mere offers to sell. Thus, his challenge to the application of the career-offender provisions is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497-99 (5th Cir. 2012); <em>see also Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-23\">Gilbertson has not shown that the district court plainly erred in applying the career-offender provisions of \u00a7 4B1.1 based on his New Mexico conviction. The application notes to \u00a7 4B1.2 expressly provide that \u2018\u201ccontrolled substance offense\u2019 include[s] the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.2 comment, (n.l). Thus, Gilbertson has not demonstrated that the statutory language of \u00a7 30-31-22(A) includes conduct that falls outside the definition of a CSO under \u00a7 4B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-24\">Accordingly, the judgment of sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b527-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
