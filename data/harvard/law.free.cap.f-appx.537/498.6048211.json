The district court dismissed his complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and 1915A, reasoning that his claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The district court also denied Warren\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal and certified that this appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-25\">By moving to proceed IFP here, Warren is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Warren\u2019s bare assertions that <em>Heck </em>does not apply to his case are insufficient to show that the district court erred in certifying that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number><em>id.; Howard, v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1988). His remaining assertions do not concern <em>Heck </em>and likewise do not demonstrate a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Warren filed a prior civil suit that was dismissed by the district court under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) for failure to state a claim, a decision from which he did not appeal. Warren <em>v. Hunt Cnty. Criminal Justice Ctr., </em>No. 3:97-CV-705-R (N.D.Tex. Apr. 30, 1997). That prior dismissal counts as one strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir. 1996). Based on the district court\u2019s dismissal of his instant complaint and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous, Warren has accumulated two additional strikes, for a total of at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See id. </em>at 388. Thus, Warren may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In addition, we warn Warren that frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings will invite the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and/or restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction. Warren is further warned that he should review any pending appeals and actions and move to dismiss any that are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b514-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
