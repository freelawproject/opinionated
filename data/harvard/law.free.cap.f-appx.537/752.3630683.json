He appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his motions to suppress evidence derived from the x'ecording of conversations Defendant had with a confidential iixformant (\u201cCI-1\u201d) and from the Govexmment\u2019s use of wire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>taps. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">This court reviews de novo the denial of a motion to suppress. <em>United States v. Peterson, </em>353 F.3d 1045, 1048 (9th Cir. 2003). \u201cThe factual findings underlying the denial are reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">1. Defendant was not entitled to suppression of the recordings of his conversations with CI-1 because the Government recorded Defendant\u2019s conversations with CI-1 with CI-l\u2019s consent. This is specifically permitted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(c), which provides that \u201c[i]t shall not be unlawful ... for a person acting under color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication, where such person is a party to the communication or one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception.\u201d The Government\u2019s conduct also conforms with the Fourth Amendment. <em>See United States v. White, </em>401 U.S. 745, 749, 91 S.Ct. 1122, 28 L.Ed.2d 453 (1971) (citing <em>Hoffa v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966)). Nor is Defendant entitled to suppression under California law because \u201cevidence obtained from a consensual wiretap conforming to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(c) is admissible in federal court proceedings without regard to state law.\u201d <em>United States v. Adams, </em>694 F.2d 200, 201-02 (9th Cir. 1982). Finally, to the extent Defendant attempts to challenge \u00a7 2511(2)(c) on vagueness grounds, we reject his argument because the statute clearly covers the recordings here. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>49 F.3d 1398, 1403 (9th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">2. Defendant also is not entitled to suppression of the evidence derived from the Government\u2019s use of wiretaps. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(10)(a), \u201c[a]ny aggrieved person ... may move to suppress the contents of any wire or oral communication intercepted pursuant to this chapter, or evidence derived therefrom ....\u201d An aggrieved party is one \u201cwho was a party to any intercepted wire, oral, or electronic communication or a person against whom the interception was directed.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, Inc., </em>412 F.3d 1102, 1116 (9th Cir.2005) (internal citations, quotation marks, and emphasis omitted). \u201cThe Supreme Court has interpreted these provisions as limiting standing to challenge wiretaps to persons whose Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the interception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defendant lacks standing to challenge the interceptions in this case because he was not named in any of the applications and none of his phone calls were intercepted pursuant to a Title III authorization. Instead, all of Defendant conversations were properly intercepted without judicial authorization pursuant to CI-l\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b768-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
