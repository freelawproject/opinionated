Lewis, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees the New York City Police Department and Commissioner Raymond Kelly with respect to her claims for discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>as well as for discrimination and retaliation in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq., </em>and the Family Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 <em>et seq. </em>We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.\u201d <em>Allianz Ins. Co. v. Lerner, </em>416 F.3d 109, 113 (2d Cir.2005). \u201cWe will affirm the judgment only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Summary judgment is appropriate \u201c[wjhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">Here, an independent review of the record and relevant case law reveals that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the Appellees on Lewis\u2019s employment discrimination claims. Because Lewis raises no arguments on appeal that were not properly before the district court, we affirm for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court in its thorough November 8, 2012 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">We have considered all of Lewis\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
