He also challenges five sentencing enhancements applied by the district court. We affirm Young\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-16\">1. The government\u2019s evidence at trial did not constructively amend Young\u2019s Second Superseding Indictment. The challenged evidence regarding Global One\u2019s loan agreement repayments was not \u201cdistinctly different\u201d from the facts alleged in the indictment, nor did it \u201csubstantially alter[ ]\u201d the offense charged in the indictment. <em>United States v. Adamson, </em>291 F.3d 606, 615 (9th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Wilbur, </em>674 F.3d 1160, 1177-78 (9th Cir.2012). Quite the opposite: the challenged evidence was offered to prove precisely what was alleged in the indictment, that the representations regarding the repayment of the \u201cloans\u201d were not true. Therefore \u201c[t]here was only \u2018one complex of facts\u2019 alleged in the indictment and proved at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Shipsey, </em>363 F.3d 962, 974 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-17\">2. To the extent the admission of Martin Mechling\u2019s testimony was errone<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>ous, the error was harmless. <em>GCB Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. U.S. S. Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>650 F.3d 1257, 1262 (9th Cir.2011). Mechling was one of several Global One member-investors who testified against Young; it is not \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that the district court\u2019s decision to admit Mechling\u2019s testimony affected the outcome of Young\u2019s trial. Id</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">3. <em>We </em>have recognized two circumstances in which a court\u2019s exclusion of evidence may implicate constitutional concerns. <em>See United States v. Stever, 603 </em>F.3d 747, 755-56 (9th Cir.2010). First, while \u201cnot every [evidentiary] error amounts to a constitutional violation,\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Alvarez, </em>970 F.2d 583, 588 (9th Cir.1992), \u201cthe <em>erroneous </em>exclusion of <em>important </em>evidence will often rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Stever, </em>603 F.3d at 755 (emphasis added). Second, \u201cthe exclusion of relevant evidence pursuant to the <em>comet </em>application of an evidentiary rule\u201d may implicate constitutional concerns in certain cases. <em>Id </em>at 756. \u201c[T]hose cases consider the so-called <em>Miller </em>factors,\u201d which assess, <em>inter alia, </em>the evidence\u2019s probative value, reliability, significance, and whether the evidence is capable of evaluation by the trier of fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Here, Young\u2019s software demonstration had little, if any, probative value. It used new technology that Young admits did not exist at the time relevant to his charges. Furthermore, the district court correctly concluded that the proposed demonstration lacked any indicia of reliability, and was not capable of independent evaluation by the jury. Accordingly, the district court did not violate Young\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights in holding his software demonstration inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">4. The district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding under Federal Rule of Evidence 403 testimony by Timothy Cory (\u201cCory\u201d) regarding the trade aggregation software Global Edge. <em>See United States v. Wiggan, </em>700 F.3d 1204, 1210 (9th Cir.2012). Cory\u2019s brief testimony about what he had heard about Global Edge had little to do with Young\u2019s fraudulent scheme and was cumulative of other testimony regarding the aggregation program. In any event, it is doubtful that Cory\u2019s testimony could have affected the outcome of Young\u2019s trial, so any error in excluding the testimony was harmless. <em>See GCB Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>650 F.3d at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">5. The admission of a Nevada state-court judge\u2019s out-of-court statement that Global One\u2019s loan agreements were \u201csecurities\u201d was not an abuse of discretion. Although we previously have \u201cindicated our disquiet\u201d with \u201c \u2018the likely impact on the jury of a sitting state court judge pronouncing the existence of an essential element of a crime,\u2019 \u201d any \u201cimpact\u201d here was minimal. <em>Wiggan, </em>700 F.3d at 1211 (quoting <em>Chein v. Shumsky, </em>373 F.3d 978, 989 n. 6 (9th Cir.2004) (en banc)). The challenged statement could not have prejudiced the jury on the question whether the loan agreements were securities, as the district court never submitted that question to the jury in the first place.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor did the statement have a broader unfairly prejudicial effect on Young, given the relatively benign nature of the judge\u2019s comments and the district court\u2019s repeated limiting instructions to the jury. <em>See United States v. Sine, </em>493 F.3d 1021, 1034 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">6. The district court erred in failing to submit the question whether the Global One loan agreements were \u201csecuri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>ties\u201d to the jury. <em>See United States v. Morse, </em>785 F.2d 771, 775-76 (9th Cir.1986). By instructing the jury that the loan agreements were securities as a matter of law, the district court effectively relieved the jury from determining an \u201celement of [the] offense\u201d of securities fraud. <em>Medley v. Runnels, </em>506 F.3d 857, 864 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">That error, however, was harmless. <em>See Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 8-10, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999); <em>see also United States v. Jimenez-Borja, </em>378 F.3d 853, 858 (9th Cir.2004). Applying the test set forth in <em>Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, </em>494 U.S. 56, 110 S.Ct. 945, 108 L.Ed.2d 47 (1990), for determining whether a particular financial instrument is a \u201csecurity\u201d under the Securities Acts, no reasonable jury could have concluded that the loan agreements were anything other than securities. <em>See Reves, </em>494 U.S. at 66-67, 110 S.Ct. 945; <em>see also McNabb v. S.E.C., </em>298 F.3d 1126, 1131-33 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">7. The district court did not err in rejecting Young\u2019s proposed jury instruction regarding his transactional money laundering charge under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957. The relevant wire transfer underlying Young\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 1957 was not \u201ccentral\u201d to Young\u2019s fraudulent scheme; it was merely a transfer between two Global One accounts used interchangeably, and so was not necessary to the unlawful scheme. <em>See United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 511-15, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008); <em>United States v. Van Alstyne, </em>584 F.3d 803, 814-16 (9th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Bush, </em>626 F.3d 527, 536 (9th Cir.2010). For the same reason, Young\u2019s sufficiency of evidence challenge to the money laundering count fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">The district court also properly rejected Young\u2019s other proposed jury instruction concerning his \u00a7 1957 charge, which would have required the government to prove that Young transferred funds with the \u201cintent to conceal\u201d the location of the funds involved. Intent to conceal funds is not an element of \u00a7 1957. <em>See United States v. Rutgard, </em>116 F.3d 1270, 1291 (9th Cir.1997); <em>see also Bush, </em>626 F.3d at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">8. The district court did not err in applying a two-level sentencing enhancement for Young\u2019s role as an \u201cinvestment advisor\u201d at the time of the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(17)(A)(iii) (2010); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>693 F.3d 1067, 1072 (9th Cir.2012).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Young qualifies as an \u201cinvestment advisor\u201d because his offense \u201cinvolved ... a violation of securities law\u201d and, \u201cat the time of [that] offense,\u201d he offered advice to Global One members regarding foreign currency exchange trading. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 (b)(17)(A)(iii) (2010); <em>see id. </em>cmt. n.l4(A) (defining \u201cinvestment advisor\u201d); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-2(a)(11). It was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">9. Similarly, the district court did not err in applying a two-level enhancement for \u201coffense[s] ... involving] sophisticated means.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(9)(C) (2010). \u201cConduct need not involve highly complex schemes or exhibit exceptional brilliance to justify a sophisticated means enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Jennings, </em>711 F.3d 1144, 1145 (9th Cir.2013). Here, the government offered considerable evidence that Young used multiple accounts and corporations as part of his fraudulent scheme. The district court therefore did not abuse its dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>cretion in applying this enhancement. <em>Williams, </em>693 F.3d at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">10. The district court applied a four-level sentencing enhancement for Young\u2019s role as the \u201corganizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a). A \u201cparticipant,\u201d for purposes of this enhancement, \u201cis a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 1. The evidence at Young\u2019s trial established \u2014 and Young concedes \u2014 that the fraudulent scheme involved at least three participants. The evidence also demonstrated that Young \u201cused the unknowing services of many outsiders,\u201d including computer programmers, trade brokers, and an accountant. <em>See id. </em>cmt. n. 3. The district court properly applied the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">11. The parties agree that the district court should not have applied a two-level \u201cabuse of trust\u201d enhancement to Young\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, albeit for different reasons. We do not reach the precise nature of the district court\u2019s error, because any such error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Franco-Flores, </em>558 F.3d 978, 980-81 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The maximum offense level under the Guidelines is 43. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A (2010). Even without the two-level abuse-of-trust enhancement, Young\u2019s adjusted total offense level would have been 45, which still would have been treated as an offense level of 43 under the Guidelines. <em>See id. </em>cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">12. The district court applied the two-level obstruction of justice enhancement primarily because it found that Young committed perjury at trial. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 &amp; cmt. n. 4(B). Again, even discounting the abuse-of-trust enhancement <em>and </em>the obstruction-of-justice enhancement, Young\u2019s adjusted offense level would have been 43, the maximum level under the Guidelines and the one imposed by the district court. <em>See id. </em>Ch. 5, Pt. A cmt. n.2. Any error regarding the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement was therefore harmless. <em>See Franco-Flores, </em>558 F.3d at 980-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b795-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
