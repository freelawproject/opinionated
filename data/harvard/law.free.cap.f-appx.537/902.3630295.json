He asserts his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-22\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of demonstrating its unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Bane, </em>720 F.3d 818, 824 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-23\">Joseph argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not consider the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) or explain its sentence. We disagree. The district court stated that it had \u201cconsidered all of the statutory factors\u201d and that its sentence \u201creflects the seriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201cpromotes respect for the law,\u201d \u201cdeters future criminal conduct,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>\u201cprotects the public from future crimes.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(C); <em>see also United States v. Flores, </em>572 F.3d 1254, 1271 (11th Cir.2009) (noting that the district court need not discuss every statutory factor). And the district court explained that Joseph\u2019s 198-month sentence, a 64-month downward variance from the bottom of his advisory guidelines range, was warranted because Joseph \u201cha[d] drugs in a room full of children and he ha[d] a weapon.\u201d As we explained in <em>Flores, </em>\u201c[a] lengthy discussion is not required in the typical case, so long as the district court sets forth enough to satisfy the.appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1270-71 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). The district court\u2019s discussion of Joseph\u2019s culpability and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was sufficient in this case. Accordingly, Joseph has not demonstrated his sentence is procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Joseph likewise cannot show that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. He asserts that his sentence is unreasonable because his case involved a small amount of drugs, the firearm he possessed was unloaded, and his advisory guidelines range overrepresented his conduct. But the district court concluded that, although these arguments supported a downward variance, Joseph\u2019s extensive criminal history, possession of a firearm, and criminal conduct in the presence of children required a 198-month sentence. We cannot say that conclusion was an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also United States v. Bohannon, </em>476 F.3d 1246, 1254 (11th Cir.2007) (noting that the fact that a sentence is well below the statutory maximum supports a finding that it is reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
