We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), and we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-21\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding based on inconsistencies in Zeng\u2019s testimony and between her testimony and documentary evidence. <em>See Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1046-47 (9th Cir.2010). Moreover, the record does not compel a finding that Zeng provided sufficient corroboration for her claim. <em>See Aden v. Holder, </em>589 F.3d 1040, 1046 (9th Cir.2009). The record also does not compel the conclusion that further corroboration was not reasonably obtainable. <em>See Shrestha, </em>590 F.3d at 1047-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>The BIA found that Zeng failed to show that she was subjected to persecution on account of a protected ground. Therefore, the agency properly denied Zeng\u2019s claim for asylum. <em>See id. </em>at 1048. Because Zeng cannot meet the burden of proof for asylum, she necessarily cannot meet the higher burden for withholding of removal. <em>See Kumar v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 520, 525 (9th Cir.2006). Moreover, because Zeng\u2019s claim for CAT protection is based on the same discredited evidence that she relied upon for her asylum claim, substantial evidence supports the denial of her CAT claim. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156-57 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">We reject Zeng\u2019s argument that the agency failed to consider the State Department\u2019s Country Report in making its decision. The BIA and IJ\u2019s opinions indicate that they considered all relevant evidence, and the record does not suggest that they failed to consider the country report. <em>See Almaghzar v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 915, 922 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Any remaining arguments are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b754-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
