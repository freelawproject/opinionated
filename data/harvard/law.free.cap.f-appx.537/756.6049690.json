The Alaska Court of Appeals concluded that Moore was not constructively denied counsel. This was not \u201ccontrary to, or [ ] an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Failure to subject a prosecutor\u2019s case to adversarial testing will only constitute constructive denial of counsel when \u201c \u2018counsel <em>entirely </em>fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 697, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984)). Moore\u2019s lawyer presented his desired intoxication defense at trial. Additionally, the Supreme Court has never found that a criminal defendant has a right to a meaningful relationship with his attorney. <em>Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 13-14, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983). In any event, the proposition that a serious breakdown in the attorney-client relationship may rise to a constructive denial of counsel is not \u201cclearly established\u201d by Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">2. Moore cites no Supreme Court case to support his claim that the trial court\u2019s inquiry into his motion to substitute counsel was inadequate. As such, he failed to satisfy AEDPA\u2019s threshold for reviewing a state court adjudication on the merits. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b773-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
