We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir. 2006). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Chen contends the police persecuted him based on an actual and/or imputed political opinion. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Chen failed to show a protected ground was at least one central reason for the harm he suffered or fears suffering upon return. <em>See Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740 (9th Cir.2009) (the REAL ID Act \u201crequires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution\u201d); <em>cf. Hu v. Holder, </em>652 F.3d 1011, 1018-19 (9th Cir.2011) (IJ\u2019s conclusion not supported by substantial evidence where police accused petitioner of acting against the government and Communist party). We reject Chen\u2019s contention that the BIA failed to consider whether he was harmed on account of his actual political opinion. Accordingly, Chen\u2019s claim for asylum fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Because Chen failed to meet the lower burden of proof for asylum, his claim for withholding of removal necessarily fails. See <em>Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b779-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
