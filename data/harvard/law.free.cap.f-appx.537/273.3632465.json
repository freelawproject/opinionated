Rodgers was sentenced to 209 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Rodgers argues that the district court erred in allowing him to represent himself because he was not competent to act as his own counsel, and denied him a fair trial in its management of courtroom proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees not only the right to be represented by counsel but also the right to self-representation. <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 819, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). The decision to represent oneself must be knowing and intelligent, <em>id. </em>at 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525, and courts must entertain every reasonable presumption against waiver of counsel. <em>Brewer v. Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 404, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 51 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977). Because Rodgers contends he was not competent to waive counsel, we review the record to ensure that the waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. <em>United States v. Bernard, </em>708 F.3d 583, 588 (4th Cir.2013). This issue, raised for the first time on appeal, is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>Bernard, </em>708 F.3d at 587-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-15\">While a trial court must determine if a waiver of counsel is knowing and intelligent, no particular interrogation of the defendant is required, so long as the court warns the defendant of the dangers of self-representation so that \u201c \u2018his choice is made with his eyes open.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>582 F.2d 888, 890 (4th Cir.1978) (quoting <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525). \u201cThe determination of whether there has been an intelligent waiver of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>right to counsel must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938); <em>see United States v. Singleton, </em>107 F.3d 1091, 1097-98 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">We conclude that the district court did not err in granting Rodgers\u2019 request to waive counsel and proceed pro se. Our examination of the record as a whole demonstrates that Rodgers\u2019 election to proceed pro se was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. At the time he elected to proceed pro se, Rodgers was fully aware of the nature of the charges against him and the potential punishments he faced if convicted. The district court also informed Rodgers of the perils of self-representation and stated its belief that he was making a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Rodgers contends that his history of depression and learning disabilities, combined with the fact that he spent his school years in special education classes, made him incompetent to represent himself, and argues that the district court erred in failing to sua sponte terminate his self-representation when it became apparent he was unqualified to represent himself. To support this argument, Rodgers points to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Indiana v. Edwards, </em>554 U.S. 164, 171, 128 S.Ct. 2379, 171 L.Ed.2d 345 (2008), and states that \u201cthe right of self-representation is not absolute.\u201d Unlike the defendant in <em>Edwards, </em>however, Rodgers did not suffer from a severe mental illness, but merely displayed some difficulty communicating with the court and jury. We conclude that these difficulties were insufficient to require the court to terminate Rodgers\u2019 self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Rodgers next contends that he was deprived of a fair trial by the district court\u2019s allegedly prejudicial conduct. He asserts that the court interfered with his ability to put on a case, truncated his cross-examination of witnesses as well as his own testimony, and ultimately forced him to rest his case. We review these allegations for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Castner, </em>50 F.3d 1267, 1272 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Generally, \u201c[qjuestions of trial management are quintessentially the province of the district courts.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>452 F.3d 323, 332 (4th Cir.2006). The district court has two responsibilities in trial oversight \u2014 ensuring that \u201cmatters are clearly presented to the jury\u201d and preventing \u201ctrials from becoming protracted and costly affairs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court \u201cmust exercise reasonable control over the interrogation of witnesses and the presentation of evidence in order to ensure the effective determination of the truth [and] to avoid needless waste of time in the presentation of a case.\u201d <em>Castner, </em>50 F.3d at 1272 (internal quotation marks omitted). We will grant a new trial only if the district court\u2019s actions denied the appellant \u201ca fair, as distinguished from a perfect, trial.\u201d <em>United, States v. Villarini, </em>238 F.3d 530, 536 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Here, the district court did not excessively interfere with Rodgers\u2019 exercise of his right to proceed pro se, but properly required Rodgers to observe the rules of criminal procedure and evidence and exercised its discretion to limit repetitive and cumulative examination of witnesses. Thus, the district court\u2019s interventions into Rodgers\u2019 case were for the purpose of clarifying the evidence for the jury and ensuring that evidence was properly presented without undue delay. Therefore, we conclude that Rodgers has failed to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s conduct resulted in an unfair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b300-5\">DIAZ, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqv\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">I continue to doubt the wisdom of applying plain error review to the appeal of a pro se defendant alleging a defective <em>Faretta </em>waiver on the basis of mental incompetency, for \u201cit is paradoxical to expect a defendant to recognize his own \u2018gray area\u2019 competency, and then object to his own motion to proceed pro se.\u201d <em>United States v. Bernard, </em>708 F.3d 583, 596 (4th Cir. 2013) (Diaz, J., dissenting). But because the facts of this case demonstrate no error in Rodgers\u2019s <em>Faretta </em>waiver under any standard of review, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
