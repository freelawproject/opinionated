R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b787-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-23\">Santiago Vega-Ruiz, a native and citizen of Guatemala, petitions pro se for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) decision denying his applications for cancellation of removal, asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-24\">We lack jurisdiction to review Vega-Ruiz\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of his claim for cancellation of removal. <em>See de Mercado v. Mukasey, </em>566 F.3d 810, 814 (9th Cir.2009) (court lacks jurisdiction to review the discretionary determination of whether petitioner\u2019s relatives are likely to suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship). Further, contrary to Vega-Ruiz\u2019s contention, the agency fully considered the factors relevant to the hardship determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-25\">Vega-Ruiz testified he was attacked during the robbery of a liquor store, received various threats, and fears future persecution by guerrillas based on his pri- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>or military service. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that the attack and threats do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003) (mistreatment including beating and unfulfilled threats of harm or death was not \u201cso severe as to compel a finding of past persecution\u201d). Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Vega-Ruiz did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003) (crediting petitioner\u2019s subjective fear but concluding it was \u201ctoo speculative\u201d and thus \u201cnot objectively reasonable under the circumstances of this case\u201d); <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[a]n applicant\u2019s claim of persecution upon return is weakened, even undercut, ... when the applicant has returned to the country without incident\u201d). Accordingly, Vega-Ruiz\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Because Vega-Ruiz failed to meet the lower standard of proof for asylum, his claim for withholding of removal necessarily fails. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Further, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Vega-Ruiz failed to establish it is more likely than not he would be tortured at the instigation of or with the acquiescence of the government if returned to Guatemala. <em>See Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Finally, in light of our conclusions, we reject Vega-Ruiz\u2019s contention that the BIA erred in not reaching the issue of his credibility, and we do not reach Vega-Ruiz\u2019s arguments that the IJ erred in finding him not credible. <em>See Ramirez-Altamirano v. Holder, </em>563 F.3d 800, 804 (9th Cir.2009) (this court\u2019s review is limited to the actual grounds relied upon by the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b787-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
