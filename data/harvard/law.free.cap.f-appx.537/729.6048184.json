R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b745-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-23\">Petitioner Miguel Angel Morales (\u201cMorales\u201d), a native and citizen of Guatemala, petitions for review of a decision from the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) in which the BIA dismissed his appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) adverse credibility finding and denial of relief in the form of deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), and we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-24\">When the BIA issues its own decision, while emphasizing certain aspects of the IJ\u2019s decision, this court reviews both decisions. <em>Morgan v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 1202, 1206 (9th Cir.2008). We review legal questions de novo and review factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, for substantial evidence. <em>Lopez-Cardona v. Holder, </em>662 F.3d 1110, 1111 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-25\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. First, it properly relied on inconsistencies between Morales\u2019s testimony and his written application regarding the location of the beating, where on his body he was hit, whether or not gunshots were fired, and if the police asked him to gather information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>or to just disappear. <em>See Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1046-47 (9th Cir. 2010). Because the record does not compel the conclusion that Morales is credible, we uphold the agency\u2019s credibility determination. <em>See Rizk v. Holder, </em>629 F.3d 1083, 1091 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Morales\u2019s claim for relief fails because the agency properly found that he was not credible and could not satisfy his burden of proof. <em>See id. </em>We therefore decline to reach Morales\u2019s arguments on the merits. <em>See I.N.S. v. Bagamasbad, </em>429 U.S. 24, 25, 97 S.Ct. 200, 50 L.Ed.2d 190 (1976) (\u201cAs a general rule courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b745-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-26\">.
