By moving for IFP status here, Guadian is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). Guadian\u2019s brief on appeal makes only a conclusional assertion of good faith. He does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for its certification decision. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Accordingly, his challenge to the district court\u2019s certification decision is deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Guadian has not shown that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, Guadian\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-22\">The dismissal of Guadian\u2019s complaint as frivolous in the district court and the dismissal of his appeal each counts as a strike pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Ade</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>pegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Guadian is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three \u00a7 1915(g) sti\u2019ikes, he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injuxy. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
