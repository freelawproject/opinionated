The Magistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) denying the petition as untimely. Specifically, she concluded that Piskanin\u2019s judgment of sentence became final on June 29, 2006, and that Piskanin\u2019s pro se PCRA petition was filed on April 1, 2010. His PCRA petition was deemed untimely because it was not filed within one year of the date on which his judgment of sentence became final. <em>See </em>42 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9545(b)(1). The Magistrate Judge then concluded that, because Piskanin\u2019s PCRA petition was not properly filed, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2), it did not toll AED-PA\u2019s one-year limitations period, and she therefore denied his \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely. The District Court adopted the R &amp; R in its entirety. Piskanin seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-25\">In reviewing Piskanin\u2019s application, we noted that his judgment of sentence became final on October 8, 2009, <em>see Commonwealth v. Piskanin, </em>No. 2072 EDA 2005, 986 A.2d 1262 (Pa.Super.Ct. Sept. 8, 2009), and that his petition for state post-conviction relief was filed on April 1, 2010, <em>see Commonwealth v. Piskanin, </em>No. 1577 EDA 2010, 37 A.3d 1233 (Pa.Super.Ct. Oct. 17, 2011), <em>allocatur denied, </em>61 A.3d 191 (Pa. Feb. 5, 2013) (table). It appeared to us that, because his PCRA petition was properly filed within one year of the date on which his judgment of sentence became final, it tolled the statute of limitations for filing his federal habeas petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). We therefore ordered Appellees to show cause why a COA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>should not be issued as to Piskanin\u2019s claim that the District Court erred in denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus as untimely. We also ordered them to show cause why, if a COA is granted, the District Court\u2019s judgment should not be summarily vacated, and the matter remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Appellees responded to the show cause order, conceded the timeliness of Piskanin\u2019s petition, and agreed that the case should be remanded to the District Court. They have not argued that this appeal should be resolved in any particular way. We now grant Piskanin\u2019s application for a COA, as jurists of reason would debate both the District Court\u2019s procedural ruling and whether the claims noted below state valid claims of the denial of a constitutional right, particularly in light of the fact that the District Court did not reach the merits of those claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Morris v. Horn, </em>187 F.3d 333, 341 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The result reached by the District Court was not due to carelessness on its part. Appellees represented that Piskanin\u2019s judgment of sentence became final on June 29, 2006. (Dkt. No. 25, p. 4.) Piskanin filed over twenty appeals in state court alone relating to his conviction and sentence, and the record is not entirely in order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even the panel of Superior Court judges that affirmed the denial of his PCRA petition, (No. 1577 EDA 2010), was unaware of the date upon which his judgment of sentence was affirmed, (No.2072 EDA 2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">Because the record supports that Piskanin\u2019s petition was timely filed, and in light of Appellees\u2019 concession, we will vacate and remand this case to the District Court for consideration of any procedural or substantive issues other than the issue of the timeliness of Appellant\u2019s petition. All pending motions are denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-6\">. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-7\">. Appellees noted as much, stating that it had \"boxes of paperwork associated with this case\" due to Piskanin\u2019s \"multitude of frivolous filings.\" (Dkt. No. 33, p. 6 n. 2.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b50-9\">. The state courts never addressed Piskanin\u2019s claims on the merits. The Superior Court affirmed the PCRA court\u2019s dismissal of Piskanin's petition as untimely, because it, too, was under the mistaken impression that his judgment of sentence became final on June 29, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b50-22\">. Piskanin's numerous pending motions are merely vehicles through which he reiterates the same arguments in his request for a certificate of appealability, or else requests relief that is not available from this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
