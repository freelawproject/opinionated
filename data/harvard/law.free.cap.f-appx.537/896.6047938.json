Azor argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Azor was deported in 1988 twice after entering the United States illegally using two different false identities; in 1995 after attempting to reenter the country using his real name; and in May 2012 when he attempted to reenter the country using a false passport bearing his photograph and the name of a naturalized citizen of the United States, J.R.J. In September 2012, Azor again attempted to enter the United States. Azor presented using a Haitian passport and a permanent resident card, both of which bore his photograph and J.RJ.\u2019s name. Border patrol agents searched Azor and seized from him other documents bearing J.R.J.\u2019s name, including licenses issued by Florida and Georgia, credit and debit cards, and records of checks issued by an employer and governmental tax offices. Azor also had amassed criminal charges under J.R.J.\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion. The district court sentenced Azor to a term at the high end of his advisory guideline range of zero to six months of imprisonment for using fraudulent immigration documents and to a consecutive term of 24 months of imprisonment that was mandated for his offense of aggravated identity theft. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2B1.6(a) <em>&amp; </em>n. 1. Azor requested a sentence of two years and one day based on his unfortunate childhood, various tragedies in adulthood, and obligations to his children in Haiti and the United States, but the district court reasonably determined that a sentence of 30 months of imprisonment was necessary to address the statutory purposes of sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court explained that Azor required a sentence \u201cof the high end or more\u201d because \u201cdeportation [didn\u2019t] really seem to much matter\u201d to him; he \u201cneed[ed] to be punished\u201d for his \u201cserious\u201d offenses that involved \u201cusing a live person\u2019s identification\u201d; and \u201cputting him in jail ... [appeared to] be the only way\u201d to prevent him from \u201csneaking back in\u201d and returning to \u201cthe streets.\u201d Azor complains about insufficient weight being given to his professed fear of being persecuted in Haiti and his financial obligations to his families, but the district court was entitled to find that those considerations were outweighed by the need to address the seriousness of his offenses and deter future similar conduct, particularly when Azor had admitted to entering the country for economic reasons. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). Azor also argues that his sentence is unreasonably disparate from those imposed on United States citizens who can qualify for \u201cdrug treatment or release to a halfway house,\u201d but a deportable alien like Azor who has repeatedly violated our immigration laws is not similarly situated to a legal citizen of this country. <em>See United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1101-02 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cA well-founded claim of disparity, however, assumes that apples are being compared to apples.\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Mateo-Espejo, </em>426 F.3d 508, 514 (1st Cir.2005))).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">We AFFIRM Azor\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
