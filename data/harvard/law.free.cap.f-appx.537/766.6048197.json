Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for an abuse of discretion, <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir. 2002), we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider as untimely because it was filed more than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s final removal order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). We lack jurisdiction to consider any contention that the BIA abused its discretion by failing to exercise its sua sponte authority to reconsider their case. <em>See Mejia-Hernandez v. Holder, </em>633 F.3d 818, 823-24 (9th Cir. 2011). We also lack jurisdiction to consider petitioners\u2019 claim that changed circumstances arising in Indonesia should excuse their motion from the time limitations for motions to reopen or reconsider because they failed to raise that claim to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Further, we deny petitioners\u2019 motion to take judicial notice of the two versions of the 2010 U.S. Department of State International Religious Freedom Report for Indonesia. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 963 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc). In light of this conclusion, we reject as unnecessary the government\u2019s request to strike the portions of petitioners\u2019 opening brief that rely on the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Finally, we reject petitioners\u2019 requests that the court either reconsider its stance regarding a pattern or practice of persecution, or require the BIA to reconsider their motion on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b782-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
