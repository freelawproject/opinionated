SMITH, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Carrie Meeks filed insurance claims with two companies, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company (\u201cIDS\u201d) and Mississippi Farm Bureau Casualty Insurance Company (\u201cFarm Bureau\u201d), without telling either of her policy with the other. IDS and Farm Bureau sought a judgment declaring, as relevant here, that they were entitled to recover money paid to Meeks because she had violated her policies\u2019 concealment clauses, rendering the policies void. The companies appeal a mixed judgment based on a jury verdict. We amend the judgment and affirm it as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In 2009, an oak tree crashed onto Meeks\u2019s home during a windstorm. Meeks had the tree removed, covered the hole with a tarp, and reported the damage to IDS and Farm Bureau but failed to inform either company of her policy with the other. Both companies began their investigations on April 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">It was not until September 28 that Meeks told Farm Bureau about the IDS policy and not until October 7 that she informed IDS of the Farm Bureau policy. The companies learned of the existence of each other\u2019s policies by other means in late July, after they had paid Meeks $11,536.19 in duplicate payments for food spoilage, hotel bills, and other expenses. All told, IDS paid Meeks $68,531, a portion of which was paid to Chase Home Finance (\u201cChase\u201d), her mortgagee. Farm Bureau paid Meeks $34,681.48, some of which was paid to Chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Meeks\u2019s policy with IDS contains a \u201cconcealment clause\u201d that states, \u201cThis entire policy is void if an insured person has intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance relating to this insurance, or acted fraudulently or made false statements relating to this insurance.\u201d Similarly, the Farm Bureau policy\u2019s concealment clause states, \u201cThis policy is void in any case of fraud by you as it relates to the policy at any time. It is also void if any \u2018insured\u2019 intentionally conceals or misrepresents a material fact\u201d concerning the policy or a claim thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">IDS asked for a declaratory judgment against Meeks and Farm Bureau, arguing that it had fulfilled its obligations to Meeks; Farm Bureau filed a counterclaim against IDS and a crossclaim against Meeks. After a four-day trial, the jury found that IDS and Farm Bureau owed no further obligations under their respective policies other than $24,224.46, which had been paid to Chase. The jury also returned a verdict in favor of Meeks but assessed her additional damages at $0.00 and further found that she had violated the concealment clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">At the close of trial, the companies moved for a declaration that the policies were void as a matter of law, so Meeks was obligated to reimburse them the amounts paid to her before they knew her home was doubly insured. Specifically, IDS and Farm Bureau requested an order declaring that Meeks was obligated to repay IDS $52,912.39 plus costs and Farm Bureau $26,611 plus costs. The court entered judgment \u201cin favor of IDS and Farm Bureau on their claims and cross-claims and that Meeks take nothing\u201d and pay costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Because the judgment said nothing explicitly about the duplicate payments and did not declare the policies void, the companies moved for an amended judgment. Following a hearing, the court amended, awarding IDS and Farm Bureau $11,-536.19 \u2014 the amount of the duplicate payments \u2014 from Meeks. The amended judgment did not declare the policies void or order Meeks to reimburse the companies, who therefore appeal both the judgment and the refusal to enjoin Meeks from proceeding in a new and separate, but substantively identical, state-court lawsuit filed after the federal jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">We review for abuse of discretion a decision to amend a judgment. <em>Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v. City of El Paso, </em>346 F.3d 541, 549 &amp; n. 26 (5th Cir.2003). A motion to amend \u201cmust clearly establish either a manifest error of law or fact or must present newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>Simon v. United States, </em>891 F.2d 1154, 1159 (5th Cir.1990). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>Ross v. Marshall, </em>426 F.3d 745, 763 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We also review for abuse of discretion a refusal to issue an injunction. <em>Moore v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>556 F.3d 264, 269 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">IDS and Farm Bureau maintain that because the jury found that Meeks had violated the concealment clauses, the policies are void as a matter of Mississippi law. \u201cThe interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law, not one of fact.\u201d <em>Noxubee Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>883 So.2d 1159, 1165 (Miss.2004). \u201c[Ujnder Mississippi law, when the words of an insurance policy are plain and unambiguous, the court will afford them their plain, ordinary meaning and will apply them as written.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">The plain and unambiguous language of each policy provides that it is \u201cvoid\u201d if the insured intentionally conceals or misrepresents a material fact. In Mississippi, \u201c[i]t is well established that [concealment] clauses ... are reasonable and valid, and are to be given a reasonable interpretation. If breached, the insurer would be deprived of a valuable right for which it contracted.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>306 So.2d 638, 644 (Miss.1974).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">The jury was properly instructed that, for a policy to be voided under a concealment clause, the insured\u2019s statements, representations, misrepresentations, or omissions must have been false, material, and knowingly and wilfully made. <em>See Clark v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>778 F.2d 242, 245 (5th Cir.1985). The jury found that Meeks had violated the concealment clauses in both policies, which, as a matter of Mississippi law, rendered the policies void as to the windstorm loss. Therefore, because IDS and Farm Bureau were under no obligation to pay Meeks for her losses, she is obligated to reimburse IDS $52,912.39 and Farm Bureau $26,611.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">Meeks does not contend that the jury\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous, that concealment clauses are invalid or unenforceable under Mississippi law, or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the plain and unambiguous language of the policies does not render them void if the insured conceals a material fact. Instead, she asserts that the verdict was ambiguous, requiring a new trial. The district court denied Meeks\u2019s motion for a new trial, and she did not appeal or cross-appeal, so she \u201ccannot attack the district court\u2019s decree with a view either to enlarging [her] own rights thereunder or lessening the rights of [her] adversary.\u201d <em>Arne v. Broussard, </em>42 F.3d 249, 250 (5th Cir. 1994). This court cannot, therefore, grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Although we cannot order a new trial, \u201cit is an elementary proposition, and the supporting cases too numerous to cite, that this court may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any grounds supported by the record.\u201d <em>Morales v. Thaler, </em>714 F.3d 295, 302 n. 3 (5th Cir.2013), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. May 10, 2013) (No. 13-59). Meeks\u2019s arguments about ambiguity in the verdict are therefore not irrelevant; she asserts that the district court did not declare the policies void, because it was attempting to reconcile the verdict with what it believed to be the jury\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\u201cThe Seventh Amendment fashions [a] federal policy favoring jury decisions of disputed fact questions. Thus, the courts must attempt to reconcile the jury\u2019s findings, by exegesis if necessary.\u201d <em>Carr v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>312 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted, alteration in original). If the court was attempting to reconcile the jury\u2019s findings and conform the judgment to those findings by refusing to declare the policies void, it was unnecessary to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">There is no inconsistency between the jury\u2019s finding that IDS and Farm Bureau \u201cowe[d] no further obligations under their respective [p]olieies other than $24,224.46\u201d and finding that Meeks violated the concealment clauses. The former finding did not require the jury to infer, <em>contra </em>Meeks, that coverage under the policies was valid. IDS and Farm Bureau paid that sum not to Meeks but to Chase. Each policy contained a \u201cunion\u201d or \u201cstandard mortgage clause\u201d incorporated into every fire insurance policy pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated \u00a7 83-13-9. Such clauses create \u201ca separate contract of insurance between the mortgagee and the insurer,\u201d <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. Thomas, </em>555 So.2d 67, 69 (Miss.1989), so \u201cthe mortgagee is entitled to the proceeds of the policy, and the mortgagee\u2019s right to recover will not be invalidated by the act or negligence of the mortgagor of the insured\u2019s property,\u201d <em>Hartford, Fire Ins. Co. v. Assocs. Capital Corp., </em>313 So.2d 404, 407 (Miss.1975). That is to say, Chase\u2019s right to recover on the policies was not invalidated by Meeks\u2019s concealment of material information. The jury\u2019s finding that IDS and Farm Bureau owed no further obligations, except what they paid to Chase, is therefore not only consistent with but supports the jury\u2019s finding that Meeks violated the concealment clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Likewise, there is no inconsistency between the jury\u2019s finding \u201cfor the [sic ] Carrie Meeks in the amount of $0.00\u201d and finding that she had violated the concealment clauses. The former finding was the jury\u2019s response to a question entirely separate from potential concealment, namely, whether Meeks had proven by preponderance of the evidence that additional damage was caused by the windstorm, rather than by her neglect, and, if so, how much. The jury\u2019s answer \u2014 that additional damage, albeit $0.00 in amount, was caused by the windstorm and not Meeks\u2019s neglect \u2014 is not inconsistent with the finding that she had violated the concealment clause. Because there was no inconsistency in the jury\u2019s findings, there was no reason for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>district court to refrain from declaring the insurance policies void under Mississippi law based on the jury\u2019s finding that Meeks had violated the concealment clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\u201cA court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283. \u201cThe relitigation exception is intended to prevent state litigation of an issue that previously was presented to and decided by the federal court.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>556 F.3d at 273 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). For the relitigation exception to apply,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">(1) parties in the later action must be identical to or in privity with the parties in the previous action; (2) judgment in the prior action must have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) the prior action must have concluded with a final judgment on the merits; and (4) the same claim or cause of action must be involved in both suits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqeg\"><em>Id. </em>IDS and Farm Bureau assert that, because Meeks\u2019s state-court suit meets all four parts of the relitigation test, the district court abused its authority by failing to enjoin Meeks from proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The conclusion does not follow from the premise. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that this case falls squarely within the parameters of the relitigation exception, we cannot conclude, for that reason alone, that the court abused its discretion. \u201cDeciding whether and how prior litigation has preclusive effect is usually the bailiwick of the <em>second </em>court.... So issuing an injunction under the relitigation exception is resorting to heavy artillery. For that reason, every benefit of the doubt goes toward the state court.\u201d <em>Smith v. Bayer Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2368, 2375-76, 180 L.Ed.2d 341 (2011) (internal citation omitted). The insurance companies do not cite a case holding that a court abused its discretion merely by declining to exercise its authority to enjoin state-court proceedings. In light of the Anti-Injunction Act\u2019s \u201ccore message ... of respect for state courts,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2375, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion by trusting the state court to apply the principle of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">Based on the jury\u2019s finding that Meeks violated the concealment clauses, the policies are void as a matter of Mississippi law. IDS and Farm Bureau were under no obligation to pay $52,912.39 and $26,611, respectively, and are entitled to be reimbursed those amounts. We therefore AMEND the judgment to declare Meeks\u2019s insurance policies with IDS and Farm Bureau void as to the 2009 windstorm and to award $52,912.39 to IDS and $26,611 to Farm Bureau. Those amounts replace the $11,536.19 awarded by the district court. We make no other alterations to the judgment appealed from.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That judgment, as amended, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b530-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
