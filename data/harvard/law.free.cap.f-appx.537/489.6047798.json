We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Hightower formerly operated a Subway restaurant in MSU\u2019s student union. While Hightower\u2019s lease remained in effect, MSU issued a public \u201cInvitation to Negotiate\u201d (ITN), requesting proposals for the operation of MSU\u2019s dining and catering operation and stating MSU\u2019s intent \u201cto grant the successful contractor exclusive rights to the operation of campus dining services.\u201d Several companies responded to the ITN. Aramark\u2019s proposal was selected, and Aramark and MSU executed an agreement in which MSU promised to engage Aramark \u201con an exclusive basis\u201d to provide MSU with meals in its campus facilities. Hightower subsequently sued Aramark, alleging that it had tortiously interfered with Hightower\u2019s contract with MSU. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Aramark, concluding that High-tower failed to establish that Aramark had committed a wrongful act or that Hightower\u2019s contract would have been performed but-for Aramark\u2019s alleged interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">This court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">Hightower\u2019s primary argument is that the district court incorrectly applied Mississippi law. It claims that \u201cone party\u2019s intentionally entering a contract that precludes another party\u2019s performing an existing contract\u201d standing alone constitutes the tort of intentional interference with a contract under Mississippi law. This argument fails for two reasons. First, as the district court noted, Hightower belatedly raised this argument in its motion for reconsideration. This court generally considers issues raised for the first time in a motion for reconsideration waived.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">Second, even if we were to reach this argument, Hightower misstates Mississippi law. Hightower places great weight on the Mississippi Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alfonso v. Gulf Publishing Company.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> Alfonso, </em>however, reaffirmed that the elements of an intentional-interference-with-contract claim are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-14\">(1) that the acts were intentional and willful; (2) that they were calculated to cause damage to the plaintiff in his/her lawful business; (3) that they were done <em>with the unlawful purpose of causing damage and loss, without right or justi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number><em>fiable cause </em>on the part of the defendant (which acts constitute malice); and (4) that actual damage or loss resulted, and (5) the defendant\u2019s acts were the proximate cause of the loss or damage suffered by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The court emphasized that the plaintiff must show that the defendant \u201cdid a wrongful act without legal or social justification\u201d as opposed to an act \u201cin the exercise of a legitimate interest or right, which constitutes privileged interference.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And in the case before it, the court identified evidence indicating that the defendant acted with such a wrongful purpose \u2014 a letter from the defendant to the other party stating that \u201cwe are certain your current publisher was not in a profitable situation with this product\u201d and offering to publish the other party\u2019s newspaper free of charge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Given this evidence, the court reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Alfonso </em>therefore does not stand for the proposition that nothing more than the defendant\u2019s entry into a contract with knowledge that the other party is bound by an existing contract constitutes intentional interference with a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">We also agree with the district court that, applying the correct law, Aramark was entitled to summary judgment. As the district court observed, the allegedly wrongful acts identified by Hightower were perpetrated by MSU, not Aramark. The summary judgment evidence was that Aramark learned of Hightower\u2019s lease only after its proposal in response to MSU\u2019s ITN had been selected by MSU and more than a year after MSU notified Hightower that it wished to terminate Hightower\u2019s lease. Hightower identifies no evidence to suggest that Aramark took any action, much less an improper one, to induce MSU to breach its lease with Hightower. The fact that Aramark later learned that High-tower had a lease prior to the execution of its contract with MSU does not, standing alone, prove that Aramark tortiously interfered with Hightower\u2019s lease with MSU.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">Finally, to the extent Hightower contends that the summary-judgment device violates the Seventh Amendment, this argument is meritless.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b506-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
