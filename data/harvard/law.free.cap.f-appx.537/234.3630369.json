The United States sought to commit Boyd as a sexually dangerous person under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4247-48 (2006) (the \u201cAct\u201d). On appeal, Boyd contends that the Act violates his equal protection and due process rights and is criminal\u2014 and not civil \u2014 in nature. He also challenges the district court\u2019s determination that he suffers from a serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder, given that his diagnosis of paraphilia, not otherwise specified, hebephilia, is not specifically listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\u201cDSM\u201d). Boyd also contends that the district court clearly erred in finding that the Government proved by clear and convincing evidence that he would be unable to refrain from future acts of child molestation. Finally, he contends that the district court erred in denying his motions to dismiss and staying the action for two years. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">Pursuant to the Act, if, after a hearing, the district court finds by clear and convincing evidence that a person is a \u201csexually dangerous person,\u201d the court must commit the person to the custody of the Attorney General. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4248(d). A \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d is one \u201cwho has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation and who is sexually dangerous to others.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(a)(5). A person is considered \u201csexually dangerous to others\u201d if \u201cthe person suffers from a serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder as a result of which he would have serious diffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>culty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Regarding his constitutional claims, Boyd argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4248 violates equal protection because it applies only to federal prisoners, those committed to the Attorney General under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(d) (2006), and those against whom all criminal charges have been dismissed based solely on their mental condition. In addition, he argues that his detention between certification and his hearing violated due process. He further claims that the Act is a criminal statute and is not civil in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">This Court\u2019s precedent in <em>United States v. Timms, </em>664 F.3d 436, 448-49 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 189, 184 L.Ed.2d 237 (2012), forecloses these three arguments. In <em>Timms, </em>we applied rational basis review and held that \u201cCongress rationally limited \u00a7 4248\u2019s scope to sexually dangerous persons within BOP custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449. As to the due process claim, if the Government\u2019s lawful authority under \u00a7 4248 is not to blame for the delay between a certification being filed and the hearing, the delay in the proceedings does not violate due process. <em>Id. </em>at 454. Here, the district court appropriately denied Boyd\u2019s first motion to dismiss and placed the case in abeyance pending the outcome of the appellate proceedings in <em>United States v. Comstock, </em>551 F.3d 274 (4th Cir.2009), <em>rev\u2019d </em>560 U.S. 126, 130 S.Ct. 1949, 176 L.Ed.2d 878 (2010). The case proceeded without significant delay following the issuance of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Therefore, there was no due process violation.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Finally, in <em>Timms, </em>we held that \u201c \u00a7 4248 creates civil \u2014 not criminal \u2014 proceedings.\u201d 664 F.3d at 456. Thus, these claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">Next, Boyd contends that the district court clearly erred in finding that clear and convincing evidence supported its finding that he suffered from a serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder. Boyd relies in part on the absence of his particular type of paraphilia (hebephilia) from the DSM. We recently confirmed that \u201cone will search \u00a7 4247(a)(6) in vain for any language purporting to confine the universe of qualifying mental impairments within clinical or pedagogical parameters\u201d and, consequently, that \u201cit has been left to the courts to develop the meaning of \u2018serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder\u2019 as a legal term of art.\u201d <em>United States v. Caporale, </em>701 F.3d 128, 136 (4th Cir. 2012). Therefore, it was within the court\u2019s discretion to find that Boyd has a qualifying impairment even though his exact condition may not be specified in the DSM.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-15\">As to Boyd\u2019s other claims that it was error to find that his condition qualified under the Act and that he would have serious difficulty refraining from sexually violent behavior or molestation of a child, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(a)(5)-(6), we have reviewed the record, the hearing transcript, and the district court\u2019s order incorporating its ruling from the bench and find no error. <em>See United States v. Boyd, </em>5:08-hc-02061-D-JG (E.D.N.C. Jan. 27, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-16\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order committing Boyd to the custody and care of the Attorney General pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4248. We dispense with oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\"><em> </em>To the extent Boyd argues that the delay from certification to hearing was a violation of the Eighth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment does not provide him with a cause of action. <em>See, e.g., Hydrick v. Hunter, </em>500 F.3d 978, 994 (9th Cir.2007) (vacated on other grounds) (\"[T] he Eighth Amendment is not the proper vehicle to challenge the conditions of civil commitment.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
