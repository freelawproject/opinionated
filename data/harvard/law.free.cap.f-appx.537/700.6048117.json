We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">1. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, the California courts reasonably concluded that Roberts did not have a constitutional right to be present at his resentencing hearing. A defendant has the right to be present \u201cat any stage of the criminal proceeding that is critical to its outcome if his presence would contribute to the fairness of the procedure,\u201d <em>Kentucky v. Stincer, </em>482 U.S. 730, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2658, 96 L.Ed.2d 631 (1987), but not where the \u201cbenefit\u201d of his presence would be \u201cbut a shadow,\u201d <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 106-07, 54 S.Ct. 330, 78 L.Ed. 674 (1934). The California Court of Appeal concluded that, under state law, Roberts had no right to renew, and the trial court had no discretion to consider, a second motion requesting that the court strike a prior conviction for purposes of sentencing (known as a <em>\u201cRomero </em>\u201d motion). <em>See People v. Roberts, </em>2008 WL 4918216, at *3-4 (Cal.Ct.App. Nov. 18, 2008). This court is bound by those conclusions. <em>See Bradshaw v. Richey, </em>546 U.S. 74, 76, 126 S.Ct. 602, 163 L.Ed.2d 407 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-18\">Even if the trial court may have retained extremely limited discretion to dismiss his prior strikes sua sponte, it would not have done so because Roberts was clearly not a defendant who was outside the spirit of the Three Strikes Law. <em>People v. Williams, </em>17 Cal.4th 148, 161, 69 Cal.Rptr.2d 917, 948 P.2d 429 (1998); Cal.Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 667(b)-(i), 1170.12(a)-(d). Accordingly, the trial court could only impose a mandatory sentence and any benefit from Robert\u2019s presence at his resentencing hearing would have been \u201cbut a shadow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-19\">Even if Roberts had a right to be present at his resentencing hearing, his absence was harmless because he failed to show that the sentencing court likely would have granted a second <em>Romero </em>motion. Specifically, Roberts does not present any information materially different from what the sentencing judge originally considered in rejecting Roberts\u2019s first <em>Romero </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>2. Roberts is not entitled to habeas relief for his ineffective assistance of counsel claim because the California courts reasonably applied <em>Strickland, v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under the Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation of state law, counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient because any effort to pursue additional Romero-related arguments would have been fruitless. Roberts cannot show that counsel\u2019s performance prejudiced him because he failed to show that the sentencing court likely would have granted a second <em>Romero </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b717-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
