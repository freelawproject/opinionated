For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Rodriguez entered the United States in 1986 and later became a lawful permanent resident. In 2003, he pleaded guilty in New Jersey state court to distribution of a controlled dangerous substance (cocaine), in violation of N.J. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 2C:35-5a(l) and 2C:35-5b(3). He was sentenced to 90 days\u2019 imprisonment and two years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">In light of that conviction, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) initiated removal proceedings against Rodriguez, charging him with being removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and a controlled substance offense, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). Rodriguez conceded his removability and, after DHS denied his request for a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion, he applied for asylum, withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">In November 2012, the IJ denied Rodriguez\u2019s application. The IJ began her analysis by finding that Rodriguez\u2019s testimony was not credible, and that he had not corroborated his claim. Next, the IJ determined that Rodriguez\u2019s conviction rendered him ineligible for asylum, withholding of removal under the INA, and withholding of removal under the CAT. Finally, the IJ rejected Rodriguez\u2019s request for deferral of removal under the CAT, concluding that, even if his allegations were true, he had not established that he would likely be tortured if removed to the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">Rodriguez appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. In March 2013, the BIA dismissed the appeal. In doing so, the BIA \u201cadopt[ed] and affirm[ed] the Immigration Judge\u2019s determinations for the reasons stated in [her] decision,\u201d while at the same time providing \u201cbrief comments for purposes of clarification.\u201d (A.R. at 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">Rodriguez now seeks review of the agency\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">Rodriguez\u2019s brief does not challenge the agency\u2019s determination that his conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under the INA. Nor does his brief challenge the agency\u2019s denial of his request for CAT relief. Accordingly, those issues have been waived. <em>See Laborers\u2019 Int\u2019l Union of N. Am., AFL-CIO v. Foster Wheeler Corp., </em>26 F.3d 375, 398 (3d Cir.1994). Furthermore, because an alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony is ineligible for asylum, <em>Garcia v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>462 F.3d 287, 291 (3d Cir.2006) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii), (b)(2)(B)(i)), Rodriguez\u2019s waiver of the agency\u2019s aggravated felony determination forecloses relief here with respect to his asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-17\">All that is before us, then, is Rodriguez\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of his request for withholding of removal under the INA. \u201cIndividuals seeking to obtain [that relief] may not do so if they are deemed by the Attorney General to have committed a particularly serious crime.\u201d <em>Lavira v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>478 F.3d 158, 161 (3d Cir.2007), <em>overruled on other grounds by Pierre v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>528 F.3d 180 (3d Cir.2008) (en <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>banc); <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 12Sl(b)(3)(B)(ii). For the reasons set forth in the IJ\u2019s decision, <em>(see </em>A.R. at 281-83), which the BIA adopted, we agree with the agency\u2019s conclusion that Rodriguez\u2019s conviction constituted a \u201cparticularly serious crime\u201d for purposes of his claim for withholding of removal under the INA. As a result, the agency did not err in denying that relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">In light of the above, we will deny Rodriguez\u2019s petition for review. His request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-9\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). Where, as here, the BIA\u2019s decision adopts and affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, \"we have authority to review both decisions.\u201d <em>Hanif v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>694 F.3d 479, 483 (3d Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
