Fernandez, appointed counsel for Arturo Jimenez in this direct criminal appeal, has moved to withdraw from further representation of the defendant, arguing that there are no non-frivolous grounds for Jimenez\u2019s appeal. Fernandez filed a brief identifying three potential issues for appeal pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In response to Fernandez\u2019s motion, Jimenez also raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-21\">After a careful, independent review, we do not find \u201canything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. at 1400. We note that Jimenez\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not yet ripe for appellate review. This Court does not usually address claims for ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal except in the \u201crare instance when the record is sufficiently developed.\u201d <em>United States v. Merrill, </em>513 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Verbitskaya, </em>406 F.3d 1324, 1337 (11th Cir.2005)). If Jimenez wishes to appeal his conviction or sentence on ineffective assistance of counsel grounds, he should do so in a habeas proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 so that he may have an \u201copportunity fully to develop the factual predicate for the claim.\u201d <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-22\">Because our independent review of the record revealed no arguable issues of merit that are cognizable at this time, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Jimenez\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
