The District Court sentenced Pender to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment on October 2, 2012. Pender challenges that sentence. For the reasons discussed below, we will affirm the sentence imposed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">On June 23, 2011, Pender was charged with conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute more than one kilogram of heroin. Pender executed a written plea agreement in which he agreed to plead guilty to one count of the indictment. The District Court accepted the guilty plea on June 5, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-16\">In preparation for sentencing, the United States Probation Office prepared a final Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR calculated Pender\u2019s total offense level as 35:</p>\n<p id=\"b127-17\">\u2022 A base offense level of 34 because the offense involved at least 3 kilograms, but fewer than 10 kilograms, of heroin, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3);</p>\n<p id=\"b127-18\">\u2022 A four-level adjustment because Pender was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a); and</p>\n<p id=\"b127-19\">\u2022 A three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-20\">The PSR classified Pender as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 based on two predicate violent felonies. The PSR described how Pender participated as the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in 1993. After the armed robbery took place in New York, Pender and his cohorts participated in a 30-mile car chase and shootout with police that ended in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-21\">As a result of his participation in the 1993 bank robbery, Pender was sentenced on April 15, 1994, in the Southern District of New York, to a term of 111 months\u2019 imprisonment and a 5-year term of supervised release for bank robbery, armed bank robbery, conspiracy to commit armed bank robbery, and use of a firearm during a crime of violence. Then, on March 30, 1995, Pender was sentenced in the State of New York for criminal possession of a weapon for his participation in the car chase and shootout in New York. Finally, on July 24, 1996, Pender was sentenced in the State of New Jersey for aggravated assault, aggravated assault with a weapon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>possession of a weapon, and eluding, for his participation in the car chase and shootout in New Jersey. In calculating Pender\u2019s criminal history, the PSR counted each of these convictions as separate. Additionally, the PSR determined that the federal armed bank robbery conviction in the Southern District of New York and the New Jersey aggravated assault conviction were predicate convictions for the career offender enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The District Court conducted a sentencing hearing on October 2, 2012, during which Pender challenged his designation as a career offender, urging the District Court to treat his convictions as \u201crelated\u201d and not \u201cseparate,\u201d and argued that low recidivism rates counseled towards a reduced sentence. Ultimately, the District Court concluded that the career offender designation was applicable, noting that the bank robbery and subsequent shootout constituted two separate offenses. The District Court calculated an Offense Level of 35 and a Criminal History Category of VI, which resulted in a Guidelines range of 292 to 365 months. The District Court then sentenced Pender to 292 months\u2019 incarceration and five years of supervised release, as well as 6 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be served concurrently, for his violation of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Pender\u2019s challenge to his sentence is currently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">We review a district court\u2019s sentence for abuse of discretion in two stages. First, we review for procedural error \u2014 for example, failing to correctly compute the Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>642 F.3d 148, 152 (3d Cir.2011). We exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines, although \u201cwe review determinations of fact for clear error, and ... give due deference to a district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Zabielski, </em>711 F.3d 381, 386 (3d Cir.2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">\u201cIf there is no procedural error, the second stage of our review is for substantive reasonableness, and \u2018we will affirm [the sentence] unless no reasonable sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence on that particular defendant for the reasons the district court provided.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wright, </em>642 F.3d at 152 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Tomko, </em>562 F.3d 558, 568 (3d Cir.2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">Pender raises two issues on appeal: (1) that the District Court committed a procedural error by improperly characterizing him as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d for purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines; and (2) that the District Court\u2019s sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">A. Career Offender</p>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">Pender argues that the District Court erroneously concluded that he was a \u201ccareer offender\u201d within the meaning of the Guidelines because his predicate convictions should have been counted as one conviction, not two. Under the Sentencing Guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-15\">A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-16\">(2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>(3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). To determine whether to treat prior convictions as separate, the Guidelines state: \u201cIf there is no intervening arrest, prior sentences are counted separately unless (A) the sentences resulted from offenses contained in the same charging instrument; or (B) the sentences were imposed on the same day.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">In this case, where there was no intervening arrest, Pender was charged in two separate indictments and sentenced on two different days. The language of the Guidelines is unambiguous: \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) mandates that Pender\u2019s prior convictions be treated as separate. Pender recognizes as much in his brief. Indeed, he does not dispute that \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) applies \u2014 rather, he argues that \u201c[i]t is not fair that crossing over an arbitrary [state] line should have such severe repercussions as Pender has experienced in this case.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11.) Pender\u2019s approach would ignore the plain language of the text, however, which we refuse to do. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>698 F.3d 1048, 1050-51 (8th Cir. 2012) (refusing to treat \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d offenses as a single sentence because they were prosecuted in different jurisdictions and sentenced on different days).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Accordingly, we will not disturb the District Court\u2019s determination that Pender is a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">B. Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Pender also argues that his 292-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary in light of his low possibility of recidivism. Given that the District Court\u2019s sentence was procedurally sound, we will affirm it \u201cunless no reasonable sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence on that particular defendant for the reasons the district court provided.\u201d <em>Tomko, </em>562 F.3d at 568. \u201cUltimately, the touchstone of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 is whether the record as a whole reflects rational and meaningful consideration of the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ... [, which] gives district courts broad latitude in sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">Looking at the record before us, it is clear that the District Court was guided by the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The District Court considered recidivism among those factors, although it was \u201cnot one of the prime factors.\u201d (App.32.) The fact that the District Court treated recidivism as a lesser factor than Pender would have does not make it an abuse of discretion, however. Moreover, the District Court carefully considered Pender\u2019s conduct, his attitude, the scope of the criminal enterprise, the particular facts of the crime, and Pender\u2019s background. Having considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Pender\u2019s arguments, the District Court sentenced Pender to the bottom of the advisory Guidelines range. <em>Cf. United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 332 (3d Cir.2006) (\u201cA sentence that falls within the guidelines range is more likely to be reasonable than one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>outside the guidelines range.\u201d). Based on the record, we cannot say that \u201cno reasonable sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence on that particular defendant for 8 the reasons the district court provided.\u201d <em>Tomlco, </em>562 F.3d at 568. Thus, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Pender.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we \"will affirm the sentence of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-14\">. Pender had his name legally changed to \"Jabbar Pender.\u201d The District Court filed an amended judgment of conviction on December 15, 2012, reflecting Pender\u2019s legal name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\">. This language was added to the Guidelines in 2007 by Amendment 709. Prior to the amendment, the Guidelines specified that to determine whether a defendant was a career offender, prior felony convictions were to be counted separately unless they were \"related.\u201d Under that framework, \"prior sentences [were] considered related if they resulted from offenses that (A) occurred on the same occasion, (B) were part of a single common scheme or plan, or (C) were consolidated for trial or sentencing.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C, vol. III, at 236. Amendment 709 removed the concept of \"related\u201d cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
