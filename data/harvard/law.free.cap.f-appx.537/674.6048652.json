The facts are known to the parties. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Lopez v. Thompson, </em>202 F.3d 1110, 1116 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc). We VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">In <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cevidence introduced in federal court has no bearing on \u00a7 2254(d)(1) review.\u201d \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1400, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011). \u201cIf a claim has been adjudicated on the merits by a state court, a federal habeas petitioner must overcome the limitation of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) on the record that was before that state court.\u201d <em>Id.; see also id. </em>at 1400 n. 7 (noting that an unreasonable determination of fact under \u00a7 2254(d)(2) must be unreasonable \u201cin light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d and stating that \u201c[t]he additional clarity of \u00a7 2254(d)(2) on this point ... does not detract from our view that \u00a7 2254(d)(1) <em>also </em>is plainly limited to the state-court record\u201d (emphasis added)). The Supreme Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">Section 2254(e)(2) continues to have force where \u00a7 2254(d)(1) does not bar federal habeas relief. For example, not all federal habeas claims by state prisoners fall within the scope of \u00a7 2254(d), which applies only to claims \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.\u201d At a minimum, therefore, \u00a7 2254(e)(2) still restricts the discretion of federal habeas courts to consider new evidence when deciding claims that were not adjudicated on the merits in state court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 1401. After <em>Pinholster, </em>we have held that a federal habeas court may consider new evidence only on de novo review, subject to the limitations of \u00a7 2254(e)(2). <em>See Stokley v. Ryan, </em>659 F.3d 802, 808 (9th Cir .2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-15\">In December 2010, prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pinholster, </em>the federal magistrate judge conducted an evidentiary hearing. Following supplemental briefing regarding the potential effect of <em>Pinholster, </em>the magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation in which he discussed Pinholster\u2019s limitations on evidence which can be properly considered on federal habeas review. In light of <em>Pinholster, </em>the magistrate judge stated: \u201cAs will be shown below, based solely on the state court record, assuming the truth of the allegations and evidence that Petitioner presented, the Court finds that the San Bernardino County Superior Court\u2019s finding that Petitioner failed to set forth a <em>prima facie </em>showing that he is entitled to relief was objectively unreasonable.\u201d The magistrate judge continued, however, to summarize in detail the evidence that was presented at the federal evidentiary hearing in December 2010. Further, in numerous instances, the magistrate judge\u2019s analysis of McShane\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim referred to testimony presented at the federal evidentiary hearing. The district court accepted the magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation, without exception and with no discussion or explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-16\">It is apparent that the \u00a7 2254(d) review in this case was affected, perhaps unwit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>tingly, by evidence adduced at the December 2010 evidentiary hearing. However, because the California courts considered McShane\u2019s claims on the merits, proper AEDPA review in this case requires consideration of <em>only </em>the evidence that was before the state court in determining whether \u00a7 2254(d) is satisfied. <em>Pinholster, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1400-01 &amp; n. 7. It is clear from the face of the Report and Recommendation \u2014 as accepted by the district court \u2014 that the magistrate judge considered materials outside of the record that was before the state court in making its \u00a7 2254(d) determination. This was error under <em>Pinholster.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">We VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment and REMAND this case for the district court for further proceedings to properly consider both of McShane\u2019s claims pursuant to Pinholster,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b691-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-23\">. In light of the fact that the magistrate judge has extensively reviewed evidence that was outside the record before the state court and already has come to a decision based partially on that evidence, and in order to preserve the appearance of justice, we recommend that a different magistrate judge review this case on remand. We leave to the district court the question whether it should consider transferring this case to a district court judge who has not reviewed the evidence in the context of making the \u00a7 2254(d) determinations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
