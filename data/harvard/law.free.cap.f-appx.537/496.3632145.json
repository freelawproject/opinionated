California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Talbert has filed a pair of responses. Talbert previously filed a motion to proceed pro <em>se </em>which was denied on February 15, 2013. On July 8, 2013, he again filed a motion seeking to relieve counsel and represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-20\">The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Talbert\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; such a claim generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have reviewed counsel\u2019s briefs and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Talbert\u2019s responses. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The July 8, 2013 request \u201cto relieve appointed counsel,\u201d treated as a motion for reconsideration of the February 15, 2013 order, is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b512-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
