Safiy-Stewart (\u201cDefendant Officers\u201d), individually and in their official capacities as City police officers, and Angela McNeal, individually and in her official capacity as Deputy Sheriff of Corrections for the Broward County Sher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>iffs Office.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Briefly stated, Pierre complains that he was falsely arrested in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and Florida state law. Reversible error has been shown; we affirm in part and vacate in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Pierre\u2019s complaint presents these facts, viewed in the light most favorable to Pierre. Pierre heard banging on the front door of his home. Fearing that someone was trying to break in, Pierre grabbed a baseball bat and a shotgun, went outside, and inspected his yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">While outside, Pierre spoke to his neighbor, Randy Joseph, and Joseph\u2019s minor son. Joseph\u2019s son told Pierre that someone had tried to break into Pierre\u2019s house. Joseph said that he would call the police to report the attempted break-in. Pierre returned to his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Shortly thereafter, Officers Schmidt and Safiy-Stewart and at least six other police officers arrived and surrounded Pierre\u2019s home with their guns drawn. The officers interviewed Joseph about the attempted break-in, and Joseph gave the officers Pierre\u2019s cell phone number. The officers then called Pierre and ordered him to come out of his house with his hands in the air. Pierre complied. Officers kept their guns pointed at Pierre while he was patted down and searched. Schmidt asked Pierre if he owned a gun and where it was. An officer then searched Pierre\u2019s home and seized his shotgun. Defendant Officers arrested Pierre.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">About half an hour after Pierre\u2019s arrest, officers interviewed for the first time and secured an affidavit from McNeal, an off-duty Broward County corrections officer who had been visiting the Joseph home. In her affidavit, McNeal said that she was present when Pierre came out of his house carrying a shotgun and that she saw Pierre walk down the road with a shotgun in his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">According to Pierre\u2019s complaint, surveillance footage shows that McNeal was not present at the scene until after Pierre went back inside his house. Pierre alleges that McNeal falsified her statement to incriminate him falsely for a crime he did not commit, to give Defendant Officers probable cause for the arrest, and to advance her own career.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">Pierre was arrested and charged with two misdemeanor offenses: Reckless Display of Weapon, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.10, and Open Carrying of Weapon, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.053. The state later dismissed these charges, and Pierre filed this action. The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, accepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Hill v. White, </em>321 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir.2003). To survive dismissal for failure to state a claim, \u201ca plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>929 (2007) (quotations omitted). A \u201ccomplaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">\n<em>State Law Claims Against City of Mira-mar:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Pierre asserted three state law claims against the City: (1) false arrest and false imprisonment (Count I); (2) negligent hiring or retention (Count III); and (3) negligent failure to train and supervise (Count IV).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\"><em>Count I: False </em>Arrest <em>and False Imprisonment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The district court dismissed Count I, concluding that probable cause existed to arrest Pierre. Under Florida law, \u201c[t]he existence of probable cause to arrest is an affirmative defense to false arrest.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Morgan, </em>79 So.3d 926, 928 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.2012). A complaint may be dismissed for failure to state a claim \u201cwhen its allegations, on their face, show that an affirmative defense bars recovery on the claim.\u201d <em>Cottone v. Jenne, </em>326 F.3d 1352, 1357 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">For purposes of a Florida false arrest claim, \u201c[pjrobable cause for arrest exists where \u2018the facts and circumstances known to the arresting officers were sufficient to cause a reasonably cautious person to believe that the suspect was guilty of committing a crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lewis, </em>79 So.3d at 929. Under Florida law \u2014 subject to exceptions not at issue here \u2014 a law enforcement officer may make a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor only when the misdemeanor is committed \u201cin the presence of the officer.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 901.15(1). Thus, in determining probable cause to arrest a person for a misdemeanor, \u201conly the officers\u2019 own observations will be considered.\u201d <em>See Peterson v. State, </em>578 So.2d 749, 750 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">\u201c[[Information that a misdemeanor has occurred in the presence of an officer [may] be imputed from one officer to another\u201d under the \u201cfellow officer rule.\u201d <em>State v. Boatman, </em>901 So.2d 222, 224 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005). Briefly stated, the \u201cfellow officer rule\u201d allows an arresting officer to \u201cassume probable cause to arrest a suspect based on information supplied by fellow officers.\u201d <em>B.D.K. v. State, </em>743 So.2d 1155, 1157 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">The existence of probable cause to arrest Pierre is not clear on the face of the complaint. That Defendant Officers personally witnessed none of Pierre\u2019s conduct seems undisputed. Thus, for probable cause to have existed \u2014 irrespective of when McNeal first relayed the information set out in her affidavit to Defendant Officers \u2014 McNeal (as an observer) must have qualified as a \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d for purposes of section 901.15(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">At all times pertinent to this appeal, McNeal was a duly appointed corrections officer with the Broward County Sheriffs Office. We cannot say, as a matter of Florida law, that a correctional officer inherently qualifies as a \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d as that term is used in section 901.15(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">First, the statutory definition of \u201claw enforcement officer,\u201d as referenced in section 901.15, is separate and distinct from the definition of \u201ccorrectional officer.\u201d <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 943.10(1), (2);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> cf. Fla. Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>\u00a7 784.07 (for purposes of the offense of assault and battery on a law enforcement officer, \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d is defined expressly to include correctional officers, as defined in section 943.10). The definitions in section 943.10 focus largely on each kind of officer\u2019s primary responsibilities: either the enforcement of laws and the prevention and detection of crime <em>or </em>the supervision, protection, care, custody, control, and investigation of inmates. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 943.10(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Based mainly on the defined duties and responsibilities of each kind of officer, the Attorney General of Florida has twice concluded that law enforcement officers and correctional officers are different under Florida law. <em>See </em>Op. Att\u2019y Gen. Fla.1998-31 (1998) (based on the powers and duties set forth in section 943.10, law enforcement officers are considered \u201cofficers\u201d for purposes of the Florida Constitution\u2019s prohibition on dual officeholding while correctional officers are not); Op. Att\u2019y Gen. Fla.1989-62 (1989) (concluding that, because a correctional officer\u2019s responsibilities are \u201cdirected toward the supervision, protection, and control of inmates\u201d instead of toward the general public, correctional officers are under no \u201cduty to aid the injured, ill, or distressed in an emergency as are law enforcement officers.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Given the state\u2019s statutory language, the guidance of the state\u2019s attorney general, and the absence of decisional authority to the contrary, McNeal seems to be no \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d for purposes of section 901.15(1). If Pierre\u2019s conduct was not committed in the presence of a law enforcement officer, the complaint plausibly alleged that Defendant Officers lacked probable cause under Florida law to arrest Pierre. The district court erred in dismissing Pierre\u2019s claim for failure to state a claim. <em>See Cottone, </em>326 F.3d at 1357. We vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Count I and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">\n<em>Counts III &amp; IV: Negligent Hiring and Retention &amp; Negligent Training and Supervision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">In his complaint, Pierre merely recited the elements for the causes of action for negligent hiring, negligent retention, and negligent training and supervision. Conclusions are not good enough. <em>See Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1964-65. Pierre alleged no facts supporting his claims that the City failed to conduct an adequate pre-hire investigation of Defendant Officers, that the City knew or should have known that Defendant Officers were unfit for their positions, that the City later became aware or should have become aware of Defendant Officers\u2019 unfitness but failed to take action, or that the City failed to train or supervise Defendant Officers. Because Pierre failed to state plausible claims for relief, dismissal was proper. <em>See Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">\n<em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 Claims Against the City &amp; Defendant Officers: Defendant Officers (Count V):</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">Pierre asserted a section 1983 claim against Defendant Officers based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>false arrest and false imprisonment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because Defendant Officers had probable cause to arrest Pierre under federal law, Pierre cannot state a claim for relief under section 1983.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Whether officers have probable cause to arrest depends on the elements of the alleged crime. <em>Crosby v. Monroe Cnty., </em>394 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.2004). Under Florida law, it is a misdemeanor \u201cfor any person to openly carry on or about his or her person any firearm.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.053.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">According to Pierre\u2019s complaint, Joseph called the police to report the attempted break-in and, when the police arrived on the scene, the police interviewed Joseph about what happened. Pierre makes no allegations about what Joseph told the police during his interview. But, in describing his own conduct that night, Pierre alleged that he left his house with a baseball bat and a shotgun in pursuit of a potential burglar. While outside, Pierre stopped and spoke with Joseph and Joseph\u2019s son about the attempted break-in. It is reasonable to infer that, during his interview with the police, Joseph described his interaction with Pierre, including that Pierre was carrying a shotgun out of doors. Pierre also told the officers that he owned a gun, and officers seized his shotgun from his home. Based on the facts known to Defendant Officers at the time of Pierre\u2019s arrest, probable cause existed to suspect that Pierre was guilty of violating Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.053. Thus, Pierre cannot state a claim for relief under section 1983 that is plausible on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">\n<em>City of Miramar (Count VI):</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">To establish the City\u2019s liability under section 1983, Pierre must identify an official policy or unofficial custom that caused a constitutional injury. <em>See Grech v. Clayton Cnty., </em>335 F.3d 1326, 1329 (11th Cir. 2003) <em>(en banc). </em>Because Pierre has failed to allege sufficiently that he suffered a federal constitutional injury, Pierre cannot assert a section 1983 claim against the City. And, even if Defendant Officers violated Pierre\u2019s federal constitutional rights \u2014 which we conclude they did not\u2014 Pierre has still failed to state a claim for municipal liability under section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">In his complaint, Pierre alleged that the City had a policy or custom of (1) \u201cfailing to enforce the requirement that officers have probable cause for an arrest before the arrest is made and instead allowing] officers to obtain or assert probable cause after an arrest is made because the victim of the arrest will usually become frustrated and plead \u2018no contest\u2019 to avoid jail time\u201d; (2) \u201cpermitting officers to turn a blind eye to easily discoverable evidence in determining whether probabl[e] cause exists\u201d; and (3) failing to train or supervise officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">Pierre alleged no facts supporting the existence of these purported City policies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Pierre also alleged no facts demonstrating that the City ratified Defendant Officers\u2019 alleged conduct. <em>See Garvie v. City of Fort Walton Beach, </em>366 F.3d 1186, 1189 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cFor plaintiffs to state a successful \u00a7 1983 claim against a municipality based on a ratification theory, ... \u2018they must demonstrate that local government policymakers had an opportunity to review the subordinate\u2019s decision and agreed with both the decision and the decision\u2019s basis.... \u2019 \u201d). Dismissal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"A5_\">\n<em>Claims Against McNeal:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Pierre asserted two claims against McNeal: (1) violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Count VII) and (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count IX).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">\n<em>Count VII: 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">To state a claim under section 1983, Pierre must show that a person acting under color of state law deprived him of a right secured by the Constitution. <em>See Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). Pierre does not assert that McNeal was a state actor by virtue of her employment with Broward County. Instead, he argues that she was acting under color of state law because she conspired with Defendant Officers to deprive him of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">A private party may be considered a state actor if she conspired with state officials to commit the alleged constitutional violation. <em>See Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 183, 186-87, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980). To succeed under this theory, Pierre \u201cmust plead in detail, through reference to material facts, the relationship or nature of the conspiracy between the state actor(s) and the private persons.\u201d <em>See Harvey v. Harvey, </em>949 F.2d 1127, 1133 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">Even if one were to assume an underlying violation of federal law, Pierre failed to establish the existence of a conspiracy between McNeal and Defendant Officers. Pierre\u2019s conclusory allegations that Safiy-Stewart led McNeal to make specific statements in her affidavit and that McNeal fabricated her affidavit in part to give the police probable cause for the arrest do not establish that McNeal was a state actor for purposes of section 1983. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">\n<em>Count IX: Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">Under Florida law, \u201c[o]ne who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such emotional distress.... \u201d <em>E. Airlines, Inc. v. King, </em>557 So.2d 574, 575-76 (Fla. 1990). To qualify as \u201cextreme and outrageous,\u201d defendant\u2019s conduct must have \u201cbeen so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. McCarson, </em>467 So.2d 277, 278-79 (Fla.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">\u201cThe standard for outrageous conduct is particularly high in Florida.\u201d <em>Clemente v. Horne, </em>707 So.2d 865, 867 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.1998) (quotations omitted). \u201cIt is not enough that the intent is tortious or criminal; it is not enough that the defendant intended to inflict emotional distress; and it is not enough if the conduct was characterized by malice or aggravation which would entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">Accepting Pierre\u2019s allegations as true, he failed to allege enough facts to demonstrate that McNeal\u2019s conduct qualified as \u201cextreme and outrageous\u201d under Florida law. <em>See e.g., Legrande v. Emmanuel, </em>889 So.2d 991, 995 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2004) (dismissing plaintiffs claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress because false<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>ly accusing a minister of a crime was not extreme and outrageous behavior).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-14\">. Pierre also named as a defendant Keith Dunn, in his official capacity as the City\u2019s Chief of Police. We treat Pierre's claims against Dunn as claims against the City. <em>See McMillian v. Johnson, </em>88 F.3d 1573, 1576 n. 2 (llth Cir.1996) (\"A suit against a public official in his official capacity is ... treated as a suit against the local government entity he represents, assuming that the entity receives notice and an opportunity to respond.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-9\">. Although Sheriff Al Lamberti (who has now been succeeded by Scott Israel) is named as a Defendant-Appellee in this appeal, Pierre does not challenge the district court\u2019s grant of Lamberti s motion to dismiss and asserted no claims against Lamberti in his second amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b839-15\">. Because McNeal filed only a partial motion to dismiss, the district court did not dismiss Pierre's malicious prosecution claim against McNeal. That claim remains pending in the district court and is no issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b840-9\">. A \"law enforcement officer\" is defined as \"any person who is elected, appointed, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>employed full time by any municipality or the state or any political subdivision thereof; who is vested with authority to bear arms and make arrests; and whose primary responsibility is the prevention and detection of crime or the enforcement of the penal, criminal, traffic, or highway laws of the state.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 943.10(1). But a \u201ccorrectional officer\u201d is defined as \"any person who is appointed or employed full time by the state or any political subdivision thereof, or by any private entity which has contracted with the state or county, and whose primary responsibility is the supervision, protection, care, custody, and control, or investigation, of inmates within a correctional institution....\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 943.10(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b842-6\">. Pierre also raised three state law claims against Defendant Officers: (1) false arrest and false imprisonment (Count I); (2) malicious prosecution (Count II); and (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count VIII). Because Pierre leaves unchallenged the district court\u2019s decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over these state law claims, we will not address them on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b842-13\">. Although the existence of probable cause was not established under Florida law, federal law does not restrict the probable cause analysis to conduct witnessed in person by law enforcement officers. <em>See Knight v. Jacobson, </em>300 F.3d 1272, 1275-76 (11th Cir. 2002) (explaining that the Fourth Amendment does not require officers to witness a misdemeanor before conducting a warrantless arrest, even when state law imposes that requirement).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
