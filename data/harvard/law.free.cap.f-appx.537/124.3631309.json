As explained below, we will affirm substantially for the reasons provided by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-20\">I.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-21\">Because we write primarily for the parties who are familiar with this case, we need not recite the factual or essential facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-22\">The Bankruptcy Court entered an order dismissing, with prejudice, Deitrich\u2019s adversary proceeding against Wyndham Worldwide Corp. (\u201cWyndham\u201d) and Equivest St. Thomas, Inc. (\u201cEquivest\u201d). In a well-reasoned opinion dated September 30, 2011, the Honorable Juan R. Sanchez, sitting by designation, thoroughly explained why Deitrich\u2019s appeal from the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order should be dismissed in a thorough and well reasoned opinion. Nevertheless, this timely appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-23\">Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8001(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> permits the dismissal of a bankruptcy appeal for failure to prosecute or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>otherwise follow procedures. <em>See In re Harris, </em>464 F.Sd 263, 269-70 (2d Cir.2006); <em>In re Richardson Indus. Contractors, Inc., </em>189 Fed.Appx. 93, 96 (3d Cir.2006); <em>In re Olick, </em>466 B.R. 680, 695 (E.D.Pa.2011). The factors we set-forth in <em>Poulis v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Company </em>inform the court\u2019s inquiry by directing the court to: \u201c(1) the extent of the <em>paHy\u2019s </em>personal responsibility; (2) the <em>prejudice </em>to the adversary caused by the failure to meet scheduling orders and respond to discovery; (3) a <em>history </em>of dilatoriness; (4) whether the conduct of the party or the attorney was <em>willful </em>or in <em>bad faith; </em>(5) the effectiveness of sanctions other than dismissal, which entails an analysis of <em>alternative sanctions; </em>and (6) the <em>meritoriousness </em>of the claim or defense.\u201d 747 F.2d 863, 868 (3d Cir.1984); <em>see also In re Richardson, </em>189 Fed.Appx. at 96. \u201c[N]ot all of the <em>Poulis </em>factors need be satisfied in order to dismiss a complaint. Instead, the decision must be made in the context of the district court\u2019s extended contact with the litigant.\u201d <em>Mindek v. Rigatti, </em>964 F.2d 1369, 1373 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">As Judge Sanchez explained, Deitrich was personally responsible for his failure to prosecute to the extent he was aware that, after his notice of appeal was filed, approximately 10-months passed before he filed his opening brief. Wyndham and Equivest were prejudiced because Deitrich\u2019s inaction caused delay, and forced them to file numerous motions in order to make the case proceed. Deitrich had a history of dilatoriness because he ignored numerous court-ordered deadlines. His failure to comply with judicial orders on multiple occasions also showed bad faith. His failure to satisfy the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s monetary sanction indicated that sanctions aside from dismissal would have been ineffective. Lastly, although the merits of the ease may have been unclear because of Deitrich\u2019s conduct, or lack thereof, all other factors established that the dismissal for failure to prosecute was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">As we have previously explained, district court judges, \u201cconfronted with litigants who flagrantly violate or ignore court orders, often have no appropriate or efficacious recourse other than dismissal of the complaint with prejudice. The present case exemplifies the very kind of situation that warrants dismissal.\u201d <em>See Mindek, </em>964 F.2d at 1373.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting Wyndham and Equivest\u2019s motion to dismiss Deitrich\u2019s appeal with prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-14\">. The District Court had jurisdiction to consider the appeal from the order of the Bankruptcy Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(1). Because the District Court below sat as an appellate court, we conduct \"the same review of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order as did the District Court.\u201d <em>In re Nortel Networks, Inc., </em>669 F.3d 128, 136-37 n. 8 (3d Cir.2011) (citation omitted). We thus exercise plenary review over both Courts' legal conclusions, and evaluate factual findings for clear error. <em>See id. </em>at 136-37.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b149-15\">. Deitrich\u2019s brief fails to address the District Court\u2019s opinion and order dismissing his appeal and instead raises ancillary issues that are without merit. <em>See </em>Brief of Appellant at 4 (\"Whether procuring Bankruptcy Court jurisdiction by fraud and trickery of a pro [s]e litigant would make [the] judgment obtained void? Whether [the] case again[st] Wyndham Worldwide could have proceeded while the bankruptcy proceeding involving Equivest St. Thomas continued?\u201d). Therefore, under Fed. R.App. P. 28(a) and L.A.R. 28.1(a), he waives his opportunity to present arguments challenging the District Court\u2019s decision. <em>See Kost v. Kozakiewicz, </em>1 F.3d 176, 182 (3d Cir. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b149-25\">. \"An appellant\u2019s failure to take any step other than timely filing a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for such action as the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel deems appropriate, which may include dismissal of the appeal.\u201d Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8001(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
