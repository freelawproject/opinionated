For the reasons set forth below, we will deny Burnett\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-23\">On July 14, 2009, Burnett pleaded guilty in the District Court to two counts of robbery, one count of conspiracy to commit robbery, and one count of using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a violent crime. Judge Pratter presided over Burnett\u2019s plea colloquy and accepted his guilty plea. Three months later, however, Burnett filed a motion to withdraw the guilty plea, contending that, due to his grandfather\u2019s recent death, he had been in a state of emotional distress at the time of the plea. Judge Pratter denied that motion, and ultimately sentenced Burnett, in accordance with the plea agreement, to 25 years\u2019 imprisonment. Burnett then appealed to this Court, claiming that Judge Pratter had erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See United States v. Burnett, </em>452 Fed.Appx. 81 (3d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-24\">Burnett has since filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the District Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>His claims again concern his guilty plea: this time, he alleges that Judge Pratter improperly participated in plea negotiations and failed to enforce all of the plea agreement\u2019s terms. This motion remains pending. Burnett also filed a motion to recuse Judge Pratter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). Judge Pratter denied Burnett\u2019s recusal motion, and he then filed the instant mandamus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Mandamus is the proper means for the Court to review a district judge\u2019s denial of a motion to self-disqualify pursuant to \u00a7 455(a). <em>Alexander v. Primerica Holdings, Inc., </em>10 F.3d 155, 163 (3d Cir.1993). We will review the District Court\u2019s denial of the recusal motion for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Kensington Int\u2019l, Ltd., </em>368 F.3d 289, 300-01 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u201cAny justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). Section 455(a) requires an objective inquiry; that is, \u201cwhether a reasonable person, with knowledge of all the facts, would conclude that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d <em>Kensington, </em>368 F.3d at 301. Significantly, \u201copinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of the current proceedings, or of prior proceedings, do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Here, Burnett contends that Judge Pratter should have recused herself for three related reasons. First, he argues that because she presided over his criminal case, her ability to rule impartially on his \u00a7 2255 motion \u2014 which will challenge her previous rulings \u2014 could reasonably be questioned. This theory, however, is irreconcilable with Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for the United States District Courts, which specifically provides for a \u00a7 2255 motion to be assigned \u201cto the judge who conducted the trial and imposed sentence.\u201d While Rule 4 does not preclude a prisoner from seeking the recusal of the trial judge, <em>see </em>Rule 4 advisory committee\u2019s note (1976) (noting that a litigant may \u201cfile an affidavit alleging bias in order to disqualify the trial judge\u201d), Judge Pratter is not required to recuse herself from ruling on Burnett\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion merely because she presided over his criminal case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Second, Burnett argues that Judge Pratter, by virtue of her involvement in his case, has improperly prejudged his \u00a7 2255 motion. Again, we disagree. As the Supreme Court has stressed, \u201copinions held by judges as a result of what they learned in earlier proceedings\u201d cannot be \u201csubject to deprecatory characterization as \u2018bias\u2019 or \u2018prejudice,\u2019 \u201d because \u201c[i]t has long been regarded as normal and proper for a judge to sit in the same case upon its remand, and to sit in successive trials involving the same defendant.\u201d <em>Liteky, </em>510 U.S. at 551, 114 S.Ct. 1147. Indeed, one of the reasons that \u00a7 2255 motions are assigned to the trial judge is to take advantage of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>judge\u2019s previous exposure to the factual and legal issues in the case. <em>See </em>Rule 4 advisory committee\u2019s note (1976) (\u201cBecause the trial judge is thoroughly familiar with the case, there is obvious administrative advantage in giving him the first opportunity to decide whether there are grounds for granting the [\u00a7 2255] motion.\u201d); <em>see also Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74 n. 4, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977). Thus, the fact that Judge Pratter\u2019s role as the judge in Burnett\u2019s criminal matter may have caused her to develop some opinions as to the merits of Burnett\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claims does not require her recusal. <em>See generally In re Mann, </em>229 F.3d 657, 658-59 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Finally, Burnett argues that, during his plea colloquy, Judge Pratter made certain statements that were favorable to the plea agreement, and thus revealed her bias in favor of the agreement. By way of example, at one point, Judge Pratter noted that the parties\u2019 agreed sentence was significantly shorter than the potential maximum sentence. These statements, however, were consistent with Judge Pratter\u2019s obligations imposed by Rule 11(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>See generally United States v. Crowell, </em>60 F.3d 199, 204 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cthe district court is expected to take an active role in evaluating a plea agreement, once it is disclosed\u201d). Thus, Judge Pratter\u2019s statements were permissible \u201cassessments relevant to the case,\u201d <em>United States v. Ciavarella, </em>716 F.3d 705, 719 (3d Cir.2013), and did not reveal the sort of \u201cdeep-seated favoritism or antagonism\u201d necessary to show bias, <em>Liteky, </em>510 U.S. at 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Accordingly, we will deny Burnett\u2019s mandamus petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-7\">. Burnett relies on <em>Halliday v. United States, </em>380 F.2d 270, 272-74 (1st Cir.1967), where the First Circuit concluded that a sentencing judge should not normally conduct the hearing on a \u00a7 2255 motion challenging the validity of that judge's prior determination that a guilty plea was voluntary. The reasoning of <em>Halliday, </em>however, has never been adopted by this Court, and was specifically rejected by Rule 4. <em>See </em>Rule 4 advisory committee's note (1976) (discussing, and declining to adopt, rule of <em>Halliday); see also United States v. Pungitore, </em>15 F.Supp.2d 705, 714 n. 3 (E.D.Pa. 1998) (Van Antwerpen, J.) (noting that Rule 4 \u201cexpressly adopt[s] a view that is contrary to <em>Halliday </em>\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
