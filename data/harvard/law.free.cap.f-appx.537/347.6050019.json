He contends that the parol evidence rule requires his convictions be set aside. Because the government is not seeking to enforce an inconsistent or prior agreement in this criminal wire-fraud prosecution, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-28\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-29\">A federal indictment alleged that Perry \u201cclaimed to own the rights to a process for cultured marble material he at various times called \u2018Culture Pro.\u2019 \u201d It explained that Perry devised a scheme to defraud, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>telling his victims \u201cthat he would use their invested money for product testing, equipment and material purchases, marketing, business facilities, and other expenditures related to making Culture Pro a marketable commodity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Following a jury trial, Perry was convicted of ten counts of wire fraud, each a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. He appeals, challenging the jury instructions and the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions. We consider each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Perry first argues that the district court reversibly erred by not instructing the jury about the parol evidence rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cWe review challenges to jury instructions by determining \u2018whether the court\u2019s charge, as a whole, is a correct statement of the law and whether it clearly instructs jurors as to the principles of law applicable to the factual issues confronting them.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Perry relies on Texas law, which provides that \u201c[w]hen parties have concluded a valid integrated agreement with respect to a particular subject matter, the [parol evidence] rule precludes the enforcement of inconsistent prior or contemporaneous agreements.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although that rule is \u201cnot really a rule of evidence but rather a substantive rule from the law of contracts,\u201d it requires the \u201cexclusion of] evidence of prior or contemporaneous negotiations and representations that are introduced to vary, add to, or contradict the terms of a valid written instrument, which the rule presumes embodies the complete agreement between the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">The parol evidence rule \u201cis binding only between those persons who are parties to the contract or their privies, and does not apply in this case where the controversy is between the government and a party to the contract.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a criminal fraud prosecution, the government seeks enforcement of the United States\u2019s criminal code \u2014 not enforcement of an \u201cinconsistent prior or contemporaneous agreement ].\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-15\">The inapplicability of the parol evidence rule in this case is sensible. The parol evidence rule aims in part to \u201censur[e] that the contracting parties, whether as a result of miscommunication, poor memory, fraud, or perjury, will not vary the terms of their written undertakings, thereby reducing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>the potential for litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The risk of fraud is heightened in the civil context, where parties to a contract have a profit motive to fib \u2014 and need only convince a factfinder of their story by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Because the parol evidence rule is not applicable here, the district court was undoubtedly correct to deny Perry\u2019s requested jury instruction. The only remaining question is whether sufficient evidence supports his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">A false statement can support a \u00a7 1343 conviction only if the alleged victim considered the false statement to be material.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Perry argues that he had written agreements with his alleged victims; that those written agreements did <em>not </em>discuss purchases and testing; and that, as a result, purchases and testing were not material to his alleged victims. He contends that the evidence supporting his convictions is insufficient \u201cunder [the parol evidence rule\u2019s] presumption\u201d that \u201ca written agreement ] by all of the parties encompassed all their understandings.\u201d To the extent Perry intends to argue that misrepresentations made to wire fraud victims can only be \u201cmaterial\u201d if they would constitute binding terms of a contract, we must reject his argument. He cites no authority for this novel contention, nor does he provide any compelling argument for creating such an equivalence. \u201cMaterial\u201d false statements are not limited to those representations that could be enforced in a contract dispute; as the jury instructions noted, \u201cmaterial\u201d false statements are merely those that \u201c[have] a natural tendency to influence, or [are] capable of influencing, the decision of the person to whom [they are] addressed.\u201d In any event, Perry never disputes that if the parol evidence rule is inapplicable in his case, sufficient evidence supports his convictions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because the rule does not apply, this argument lacks force.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-15\">As the parol evidence rule does not apply here, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
