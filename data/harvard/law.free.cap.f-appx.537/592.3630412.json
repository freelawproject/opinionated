He contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court sentenced him to 46 months of imprisonment, the bottom of his advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-20\">The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because De La Cruz-Diaz\u2019s sentence was within his advisory guidelines range, his sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir. 2008). De La Cruz-Diaz wishes to preserve for further review the argument that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply to within-guidelines sentences calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis and double counts criminal history. As conceded by him, such an argument is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 232-33 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-21\">De La Cruz-Diaz argues that the district court failed to adequately account for his benign motive for returning to the United States and the unlikelihood that he would return again now that his family has relocated to Mexico. He also contends that his guidelines range was too severe because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis and effectively double counts a defendant\u2019s criminal history through enhancements, such as his crime-of-violence enhancement, that are based on prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-22\">The district court listened to De La Cruz-Diaz\u2019s arguments for a lesser sentence but found that a 46-month sentence was appropriate. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). De La Cruz-Diaz has not shown sufficient reason for this court to disturb the presumption of reasonableness applicable to his sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>See United States v.
