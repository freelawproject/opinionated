BACHARACH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b822-26\">Mr. Gerald Wayne Green was convicted of distributing cocaine base within 1,000 feet of a school or playground. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C), 860(a) (2006). Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, Mr. Green\u2019s sentence could be affected by the volume of cocaine base attributable to him. The sentencing judge found that Mr. Green was responsible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>all of the cocaine bought by himself and his co-defendant, Eric Vaughn Glenn. Based on that volume of cocaine base, the judge sentenced Mr. Green to a 168-month sentence and 72 months of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The scope of our review is limited: Viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the sentencing decision, did the district court commit clear error? Concluding it did not, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Sentencing and the Volume of <em>Cocaine Base Attributable to Mr. Green</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">After convicting Mr. Green of distributing cocaine base within 1,000 feet of a public school or playground, the district court had to determine the sentence. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the volume of drugs attributable to Mr. Green could affect that sentence. So, to properly sentence Mr. Green, the district court had to determine the volume of cocaine base attributable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">For this determination, the court could consider the weight of drugs purchased by both Mr. Green and Mr. Glenn. The court ultimately found Mr. Green responsible for over 4.056 kilograms of cocaine base. R. vol. 2, at 693. This finding was based on the cumulative weight of the drugs purchased by both Mr. Green and Mr. Glenn.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">In considering the cocaine base purchased by Mr. Glenn, the district court had the benefit of testimony by his girlfriend, Hyme LaFaunce. She testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-10\">\u2022 she was an addict and ordinarily purchased cocaine base from Mr. Glenn; but when he was hospitalized on two occasions, she bought from Mr. Green; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-11\">\u2022 Mr. Green and Mr. Glenn traveled together for about two to three years to buy cocaine base from their common supplier and each transaction involved at least three ounces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">\n<em>Issues on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b823-13\">Mr. Green appeals his sentence on two grounds: (1) that the evidence does not establish that he and Mr. Glenn engaged in jointly undertaken criminal activity, and (2) that Mr. Green is not responsible for the entire volume of drugs implicated in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-14\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">We must affirm unless the district court committed clear error in determining the drug quantity attributable to a defendant, including the scope of jointly undertaken criminal activity. <em>United States v. Sells, </em>541 F.3d 1227, 1235 (10th Cir.2008). In applying this standard, we construe the evidence and draw inferences in the light most favorable to the district court\u2019s determination. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>269 F.3d 1207, 1214 (10th Cir.2001). We will reverse factual findings on drug quantities \u201c \u2018only if the district court\u2019s finding was without factual support or we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>236 F.3d 1268, 1273 (10th Cir.2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-16\">\n<em>Jointly Undertaken Criminal Activity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b823-17\">On appeal, Mr. Green argues that the evidence does not establish that he and Mr. Glenn engaged in jointly undertaken criminal activity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-18\">The Federal Sentencing Guidelines define \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d as \u201ca criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with the others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.3 n. 2 (2010). In applying this definition, the district court pointed to the testimony by Ms. LaFaunce. She testified that Mr. Green and Mr. Glenn had obtained drugs for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>other on several occasions. And this testimony supported the district court\u2019s conclusion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-4\">\u2022 Mr. Green and Mr. Glenn had jointly engaged in a \u201ccriminal plan\u201d to purchase drugs for each other, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-5\">\u2022 this criminal plan satisfied the definition of \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Mr. Green had engaged in jointly undertaken criminal activity with Mr. Glenn.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">\n<em>Quantity of Cocaine Base Attributable to Mr. Given</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">The district court found Mr. Green responsible for 4.056 kilograms of cocaine base. This finding did not involve a clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">The weight of drugs attributable to Mr. Green \u201cis not necessarily based on the overall amount involved in the conspiracy for which he was convicted or on the transactions in which he personally participated.\u201d <em>United States v. Figueroa-Labrada, </em>720 F.Sd 1258, 1265 (10th Cir.2013). Instead, he is responsible for drugs: (1) that are within the scope of criminal activity he agreed to undertake, and (2) that are reasonably foreseeable in connection to the criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>(construing U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.3 n. 2 (2010)). Under the illustrations to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, a drug dealer who pools his resources and profits with other drug dealers is accountable for the other dealers\u2019 sales because they are \u201cin furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.3 illus. (c)(6) (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">Ms. LaFaunce\u2019s testimony, which the district court found credible, indicates that the two men pooled their resources by traveling together and making trips for one another for about two to three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">This evidence was sufficient for the district court to reasonably view the 4.056 kilograms of cocaine base to be both:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-13\">\u2022 reasonably foreseeable to Mr. Green and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-14\">\u2022 within the scope of his jointly undertaken criminal activity with Mr. Glenn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-15\">Thus, the court did not clearly err in calculating Mr. Green\u2019s sentence based on 4.056 kilograms of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-16\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-17\">We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining: (1) that Mr. Green and Mr. Glenn had engaged in jointly undertaken criminal activity, and (2) that the evidence was sufficient for the district court to find that 4.056 kilograms of cocaine base was reasonably foreseeable and within the scope of that criminal activity. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b822-18\"> This order and judgment does not constitute precedent. <em>See </em>10th Cir. R. 32.1(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
