Relevant to this appeal, after pleading guilty without a plea agreement, Tindle submitted a signed financial statement to the probation officer who was preparing her presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), but failed to provide the requested verifying financial documentation. Tindle then failed to appear at two separate sentencing hearings, and the district court ordered her detained until the date of the third sentencing hearing. Although the probation officer initially recommended that Tindle receive a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>determined at the sentencing hearing that it did not feel that the adjustment was appropriate and denied it over Tindle\u2019s objections. The district court explained that an 18-month sentence, at the low end of Tindle\u2019s higher resulting guideline range, was appropriate, given the statutory purposes of sentencing. On appeal, Tindle argues that: (1) her sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court should have granted her an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction; and (2) her sentence is substantively unreasonable and she should have received a 12-month sentence. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of acceptance of responsibility only for clear error, and its determination will not be set aside \u201cunless the facts in the record clearly establish that a defendant has accepted personal responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d 1305, 1320-21 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we typically perform two steps. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. First, we \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural eiTor, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a), a two-level reduction is appropriate if the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for her offense. Although entering a guilty plea prior to trial and truthfully admitting to the conduct giving rise to the offense of conviction constitutes \u201csignificant evidence of acceptance of responsibility,\u201d such evidence may be outweighed by conduct that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility. <em>Id., </em>comment, (n.3). A defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to the adjustment \u201cas a matter of right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The sentencing judge\u2019s determination regarding the adjustment is entitled to \u201cgreat deference.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">If we conclude that the district court did not proeedurally err, we consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). Applying \u201cdeferential\u201d review, we must determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[W]e will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [court] accorded to a given factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation, alteration and emphasis omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2962, 180 L.Ed.2d 245 (2011). We will not reweigh the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and will not remand for resentencing unless the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by imposing a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences. <em>United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">The party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.), cert. <em>denied., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 674, 178 L.Ed.2d 502 (2010). While we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the guideline range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect that sentence to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. A district court is not required \u201cto state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Instead, its acknowledgment that it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>considered them is sufficient. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Here, Tindle has not shown that the sentence was procedurally unreasonable. As the record shows, Tindle\u2019s post-plea conduct was so inconsistent with her guilty plea that the later conduct outweighed her willingness to plead guilty\u2014 specifically, Tindle failed to attend two separate sentencing hearings, to communicate with the probation officer, or to provide the required financial documents to the probation officer. In light of this record and the \u201cgreat deference\u201d owed to the sentencing court\u2019s determination, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred by denying the acceptance-of-responsibility adjustment. Further, because this is the only procedural reasonableness argument that Tindle argues on appeal, she has not shown that her sentence was procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Nor has she shown that her sentence was substantively reasonable. First, her sentence was within the guideline range, which means that we\u2019d ordinarily expect the sentence to be reasonable. Moreover, as the record shows, the district court indicated that it had considered the statutory factors in arriving at the 18-month sentence. For instance, the district court clearly considered Tindle\u2019s personal characteristics in arriving at the sentence when it emphasized her unwillingness to cooperate, and it also referenced the nature and circumstances of the offense when it discussed the fact that Tindle had stolen public monies via her employment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Despite Tindle\u2019s argument that the sentence is excessive, without more, we cannot say that the sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-6\">. Section 3553(a) lays out the following factors for the district court to consider: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
