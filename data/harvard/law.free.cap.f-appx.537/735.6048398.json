We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Pace, appearing pro se, filed a complaint claiming that Bank of America Corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiary FIA Card Services N.A., violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(b), by inaccurately reporting two of his credit card accounts as delinquent and then failing to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(b), Appellees\u2019 obligation to correct an error is triggered only if they receive a notice of a dispute from a credit reporting agency. <em>See Gorman v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, LLP, </em>584 F.3d 1147, 1154 (9th Cir.2009) (explaining that the \u00a7 1681s-2(b) \u201cobligations are triggered upon notice of dispute \u2014 that is, when a person who furnished information to a CRA receives notice from the CRA that the consumer disputes the information\u201d). Pace did not make this allegation. The district court properly held that Pace\u2019s claim, based the allegation that he personally sent his dispute to Appellees, failed as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[Njotice of a dispute received directly from the consumer does not trigger furnishers\u2019 duties under subsection (b)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">However, the district court erred in denying Pace leave to file the second amended complaint. The second amended complaint alleges that Pace sent dispute letters to the credit reporting agencies and Pace deletes the allegation that the credit reporting agencies did not notify Appellees of the dispute. Under \u00a7 1681i, the credit reporting agencies were required to notify Appellees of Pace\u2019s dispute within five days of receiving his dispute. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681i(a)(2)(A). Viewing the complaint in the light most favorable to the pleader, it is reasonable to infer that the credit reporting agencies obeyed the law, and that Appellees received notice of Pace\u2019s dispute from the credit reporting agencies. <em>See Daniels-Hall v. Nat\u2019l Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>629 F.3d 992, 998 (9th Cir.2010); <em>see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (\u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d). This, in turn, would have triggered Appellees\u2019 obligations under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(b). Pace adequately alleges that Appellees did not meet those obligations, and otherwise has stated a prima facie claim for relief under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss and REVERSE and REMAND the district court\u2019s denial of Pace\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. Each party to bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b752-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
