McGrath, Jr., proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment entered June 12, 2012, granting summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee Thomson Reuters (\u201cTR\u201d). By order dated June 10, 2012, the district court adopted the report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) of the magistrate judge (Francis, <em>M.J.) </em>dated April 30, 2012, and dismissed McGrath\u2019s complaint, which alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112 <em>et seq. </em>We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-18\">Upon <em>de novo </em>review, we affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s order and the magistrate judge\u2019s thorough R &amp; R.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-19\">As explained in detail in the R <em>&amp; </em>R, McGrath failed to establish the existence of triable issues of fact as to his claims of religious, age, and disability discrimination, and he failed to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could find a connection between any of his protected categories and any purported adverse employment action. Moreover, TR provided legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for each of McGrath\u2019s alleged adverse employment actions, and McGrath did not present any evidence that these actions were merely pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-20\">McGrath also failed to present evidence sufficient to show an objectively hostile work environment, with respect to his religion, his age, or his disability. And he has provided neither direct nor indirect evidence that his termination was in retaliation for his threat to file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Because we affirm the judgment of the district court on its merits, we agree with the court that it is not necessary to decide whether, under all the circumstances, McGrath waived his right to review by failing to timely file a formal objection to the R &amp; R.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">We have considered McGrath\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
