Even were we to hold that we have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), and that Malani has met her burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that she filed her application within one year of her arrival in the United States, Malani\u2019s asylum claim fails on the merits because substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">The immigration judge provided \u201cspecific cogent reason[s]\u201d for his adverse credibility finding, and Malani has therefore failed to demonstrate that \u201cany reasonable factfinder would necessarily conclude that [she] is eligible for relief from deportation.\u201d <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042-43 (9th Cir.2001). Malani\u2019s petition for review of the adverse credibility finding as it relates to her asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">Malani asserts that counsel at her removal hearing provided ineffective assistance of counsel. We decline to address Malani\u2019s argument because she has not raised it before the Board, <em>see Martinez-Zelaya v. INS, </em>841 F.2d 294, 296 (9th Cir.1988), nor has she complied with the procedural requirements established by the Board in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA <em>1988). </em>Counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance is not \u201cobvious and undisputed on the face of the record,\u201d therefore compliance with <em>Matter of hoza</em>da\u2019s procedural requirements is not excused and we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See Reyes v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 592, 596-97 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">Petition DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b698-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
