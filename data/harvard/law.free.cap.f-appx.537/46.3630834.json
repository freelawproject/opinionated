(\u201cADA\u201d), and the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, N.J.S.A. 10:5-1 et seq. (\u201cNJLAD\u201d). We will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-19\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment de novo, applying the same test that the district court is to use. <em>Chambers ex rel. Chambers v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., 587 </em>F.3d 176, 181 (3d Cir. 2009). We will affirm a district court\u2019s judgment if, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); <em>Dilworth v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>418 F.3d 345, 349 (3d Cir. 2005). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, Cottrell and Holland were required to show: (1) they engaged in a statutorily protected expression; (2) they suffered an adverse action; and (3) the adverse reaction was causally related to the protected expression. <em>Higdon v. Jackson, </em>393 F.3d 1211, 1219 (11th Cir.2004); <em>Fogleman v. Mercy Hosp., Inc., </em>283 F.3d 561, 567-68 (3d Cir.2002). We agree with the District Court that Cottrell and Holland failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-20\">Cottrell and Holland claimed in their amended complaint that defendant Zagami, LLC, which owns three related businesses (\u201cLandmark\u201d), had retaliated against them for activity protected by the ADA, specifically, they alleged that in retaliation for their complaints about unauthorized use of handicap-accessible parking spots at Landmark, Landmark issued letters banning them from entering Landmark\u2019s property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cottrell engaged in protected activity when she filed citizen\u2019s complaints against patrons of Landmark for handicapped parking violations in Oeto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>ber and November of 2005, and when she filed another such complaint against Landmark and a beer distributor on January 27, 2006.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree that being banned from Landmark properties suffices, at least at the stage of the prima facie case, to establish an adverse action. But Cottrell and Holland did not establish a prima facie case of causation. The letter banning Cottrell from Landmark, citing her \u201cprior actions ... disruptive of the regular and essential operations\u201d of the business, is dated July 6, 2006, over five months after any parking violations were issued.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This period of time is not suggestive of a retaliatory motive based on the protected activity. <em>LeBoon v. Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Ctr. Ass\u2019n, </em>503 F.3d 217, 233 (3d Cir.2007) (gap of three months between protected activity and adverse action, without more, cannot create inference of causation to defeat summary judgment). We agree with the District Court that the ban letter\u2019s timing \u201csuggests that it was causally connected to Cottrell\u2019s opposition to [Landmark\u2019s] liquor license renewal.\u201d Dist. Ct. Op. at 12. The letter was issued ten days after a public meeting, held at Cottrell\u2019s request, at which she opposed renewal of Landmark\u2019s liquor license, for reasons having nothing to do with Landmark\u2019s alleged ADA violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-17\">. The complaint also raised claims under state law, but because the same showings are required to establish a retaliation claim under both the NJLAD and the ADA, <em>see Tartaglia v. UBS PaineWebber, Inc., </em>197 NJ. 81, 961 A.2d 1167, 1192 (2008), our discussion applies equally to both of these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b72-6\">. We agree with the District Court that Holland failed to establish that he engaged in any protected activity before the time of the claimed adverse action, as he could not identify any specific incident when he documented parking violations at Landmark prior to the ban.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\">. Cottrell documented some alleged parking violations on June 26 and 27, 2006, but the complaints were not signed or issued until two weeks after the ban letter was sent, and Cottrell does not claim that Landmark was aware of this protected activity before the complaints were issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b72-23\">. Appellants\u2019 motion to file a CD containing exhibits is granted and the appellee's motion to strike the appellants\u2019 brief is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
