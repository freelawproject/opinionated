Sarvis\u2019 counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he states that he has identified no meritorious issues for appeal, but questions whether trial counsel was unconstitutionally ineffective in failing to object to the Government\u2019s drug weight calculations, which assertedly included several drug quantities that Sarvis and his wife possessed either legally or for their own personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-23\">Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the record does not \u201cconclusively\u201d demonstrate any such inefficacy, and we therefore decline to entertain Sarvis\u2019 ineffective assistance claim. <em>United States v. Powell, </em>680 F.3d 350, 359 (4th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 376, 184 L.Ed.2d 222 (2012).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-26\">Sarvis has filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he asks to be resentenced and to receive a downward departure under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2012) because he cooperated with the Government. But a court may revisit the Government\u2019s decision not to file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>motion for substantial assistance only if the Government\u2019s failure to do so was in breach of an obligation under the plea agreement, or if its decision was motivated by an unconstitutional motive or was not rationally related to a legitimate government end. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>United States v. Butler, </em>272 F.3d 683, 686-87 (4th Cir.2001). None of these exceptions are at issue in this case, and it follows that Sarvis\u2019 arguments in this respect are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Sarvis also contends that he should be resentenced because he was assigned responsibility for more drug weight than he had anticipated when he pled guilty. But his sentence was in fact based on his own stipulations as to the applicable adjusted offense level. Moreover, Sarvis was fully apprised at the time of his plea that, at sentencing, the court could assign him responsibility for a higher drug weight than he expected. His claim is therefore without merit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform Sarvis, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Sarvis requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Sarvis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-16\">. Such a claim is more appropriately raised under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\">. Sarvis' request that we accord his appeal the same treatment as that received by an appellant in a separate appeal is meritless, as the cases are procedurally and factually dissimilar.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
