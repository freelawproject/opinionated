In 1991, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Resolution Trust Corporation, the receiver for Atlantic Financial Federal, and enjoined Shemonsky from, among other things, representing that he was an agent of Atlantic Financial Federal, entering the company\u2019s property, and communicating any threat to any agent of the company. <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Shemonsky, </em>E.D. Pa. Civ. No. 91-cv-02712 (order entered on Sept. 10, 1991). In 2002, Shemonsky moved to reopen the case. The District Court dismissed the matter after Shemonsky failed to respond to a show cause order. <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Shemonsky, </em>E.D. Pa. Civ. No. 91-cv-02712 (order entered on Jan. 15, 2003). We affirmed. <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Shemonsky, </em>No. 03-2925, 112 Fed.Appx. 867 (3d Cir. July 12, 2004) (nonprecedential opinion). In 2012, Shemonsky filed a \u201cMotion for Payment of Marketable Securities,\u201d seeking money from Resolution Trust Corporation. The District Court denied the motion on the basis that it did not state any grounds for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>reopening the closed case. Shemonsky appealed, and shortly thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration. The District Court denied the motion, again on the basis that Shemonsky failed to state any grounds that would entitle him to reopen the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. More than twenty years have passed since summary judgment was granted in favor of Resolution Trust Corporation. Nonetheless, Shemonsky filed a motion in District Court seeking payment from it without presenting sufficient grounds for reopening the proceedings and altering the prior judgment. Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s orders denying Shemonsky\u2019s motions. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. Shemonsky\u2019s \u201cMotion for Obstruction of Justice\u201d and \u201cJoint Article I and III Motion\u201d are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
