We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 986 (9th Cir.2010), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because the motion was filed seven months after the BIA\u2019s final decision, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Singh failed to establish materially changed circumstances in India to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time limitations for motions to reopen, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h); <em>Najmabadi, </em>597 F.3d at 988-89 (evidence of changed circumstances must be qualitatively different from what could have been presented at prior hearing). Because our review is limited to the grounds relied upon by the BIA, we decline to address Singh\u2019s argument that he established prima facie eligibility for relief. <em>See id. </em>at 991-992.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b784-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
