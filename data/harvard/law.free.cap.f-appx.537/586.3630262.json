His advisory Guidelines sentencing range was 27 to 33 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the district court sentenced him to, <em>inter alia, </em>84 months\u2019 imprisonment, a sentence the court characterized as: an upward departure based on underrepresentation of Gutierrez\u2019 criminal history; and an upward variance based on the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-19\">Although <em>post-Boolcer, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 48-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-20\">Gutierrez first contends the court erred in concluding his 2000 Georgia conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon constituted an aggravated felony for application of the eight-level enhancement pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). The Guideline\u2019s commentary provides that \u201caggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) \u201chas the meaning given that term in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 3(A). Among the offenses defined as an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43) is \u201can offense described in\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii). Gutierrez\u2019 Georgia conviction occurred pursuant to Georgia Code \u00a7 16-11-131. The relevant inquiry is whether, under the categorical approach, the elements of \u00a7 16-11-131 sweep more broadly than the offense described in \u00a7 922(g)(1). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hernandez-Galvan, </em>632 F.3d 192, 197 (5th Cir.2011) (if prior offense of conviction sweeps more broadly than generic definition of terms used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>in Guidelines, conviction does not fall within enumerated category). Section 922(g)(1) prohibits, <em>inter alia, </em>any person \u201cwho has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d from \u201cpossessing] in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">According to Gutierrez, \u00a7 16-11-131 sweeps more broadly than \u00a7 922(g)(1) because \u00a7 16-11-131 prohibits a felon from possessing an antique firearm, whereas \u00a7 922(g)(1) does not. Because Gutierrez did not object on this ground in district court, review is only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497-98 (5th Cir.2012). To show reversible plain error, Gutierrez must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>E.g., Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). He fails to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Gutierrez has identified no precedent indicating \u00a7 16-11-131 encompasses conduct beyond the scope of the offense described in \u00a7 922(g)(1). Although he cites <em>Senior v. State, </em>277 Ga.App. 197, 626 S.E.2d 169 (2006), the dispute in <em>Senior </em>concerned only whether a shotgun need be functional to constitute a firearm under \u00a7 16-11-131. <em>See id. </em>at 170. The Georgia court\u2019s characterizing the shotgun as an antique does not demonstrate clear or obvious error in concluding the offense under \u00a7 16-11-131 constituted an offense described in \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">For the next claimed procedural error, Gutierrez contends the court erred by not granting the additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under Guideline \u00a7 3El.l(b), asserting the Government improperly declined to move for the reduction because he refused to waive his right to appeal. He acknowledges this issue is foreclosed by circuit precedent, and presents it only to preserve it for possible further review. <em>See United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 378 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Finally, Gutierrez contends his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to give mitigating weight to his alcohol problems and consider treatment for alcohol in lieu of such a lengthy imprisonment term. The record reflects the court was aware of Gutierrez\u2019 alcohol issues, but determined an 84-month sentence was appropriate in the light of his criminal history and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, particularly the need for deterrence and to protect the public from future crimes by Gutierrez. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant\u201d. <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b602-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
