R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b774-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Jesus Miguel Martel-Martinez, a native and citizen of Mexico, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s removal order. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo whether a conviction constitutes a controlled-substance violation. <em>Esquivel-Garcia v. Holder, </em>593 F.3d 1025, 1028 (9th Cir.2010). We grant the petition for review, vacate the order of removal, and remand the matter to the BIA for termination of proceedings without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The agency erred by concluding that Martel-Martinez is removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) due to his 2008 conviction for possession of more than 28.5 grams of marijuana under California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11357(c), because the record does not establish that this conviction was for \u201cother than a single offense involving possession for one\u2019s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana.\u201d <em>See Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>619 F.3d 1077, 1079 (9th Cir.2010) (per curiam); <em>see also Medina v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 1063, 1065 n. 5 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe government bears the burden of establishing that an alien\u2019s conviction does not fall within the exception for possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">First, Martel-Martinez\u2019s two prior drug convictions under California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11377 do not constitute pri- or controlled-substance offenses in that the plea agreements relating to these convictions merely recite the section and title of the statute of conviction and do not identify the substance involved. <em>See United States v. Kovac, </em>367 F.3d 1116, 1119-20 (9th Cir.2004) (finding a criminal judgment to be \u201cfacially inconclusive\u201d under the modified-categorical analysis, \u201cas it merely recite[d] the statutory section and title\u201d of the statute of conviction); <em>see also Ruiz-Vidal v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1072, 1078 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201c[T]he simple fact of a conviction under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11377 is insufficient [to establish a controlled-substance offense].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">Second, nothing in the record relating to the 2008 conviction shows that the amount of marijuana was greater than 30 grams or that Martel-Martinez possessed it for a reason other than personal use. <em>See </em>Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11357(c) (criminalizing only \u201cpossession] [of] more than 28.5 grams of marijuana\u201d); <em>see also Matter of Davey, </em>26 I. &amp; N. Dec. 37, 41 (BIA 2012) (\u201c[The government] cannot meet [its] burden ... unless the record establishes that the [alien] possessed marijuana for some reason other than personal use; an inconclusive record is not sufficient.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">Therefore, we grant the petition for review, vacate the order of removal, and remand the matter to the BIA for termination of proceedings without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b774-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
