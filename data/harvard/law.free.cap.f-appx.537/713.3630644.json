Ferguson appeals his sentence imposed following his jury convictions for three counts of mail fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341), five counts of travel fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314), five counts of promotion of unlawful activity with criminal proceeds (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i)), two counts of engaging in monetary transactions with criminally derived proceeds (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957), six counts of obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503), and two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>counts of tax evasion (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2). We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">(1) The district court did not violate Rule 32 by failing to resolve a factual dispute relevant to the court\u2019s sentencing determination because Ferguson did not actually dispute the accuracy of the relevant factual statements in the PSR. Rather, Ferguson raised a legal objection as to whether the obstruction counts related to the other charged offenses for purposes of the 2-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (2001). Such a claim does not put facts in the PSR in dispute within the meaning of Rule 32, and we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">(2) The district court erred in grouping the obstruction counts with the fraud counts under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c) (2001) and applying the two-level enhancement for obstruction to the grouped counts under \u00a7 3C1.1 as recommended by the PSR. The PSR recommended grouping the obstruction counts with the mail fraud and travel counts \u201cbecause they embody conduct that was treated as a specific offense characteristic, or other adjustment, to the guideline applicable to the money laundering counts,\u201d citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c) (2001). The PSR further noted that the obstruction counts grouped with the \u201cunderlying mail fraud, travel, and money laundering counts\u201d pursuant to Application Note 8 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c). The PSR then recommended application of a two-level increase to the offense level because the obstruction counts grouped with the \u201crelated underlying counts.\u201d The district court adopted these recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">The district court erred in relying on Application Note 8 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (2001). <em>United States v. DeGeorge, </em>380 F.3d 1203, 1222 (9th Cir.2004). Note 8 explains how the adjustment for obstructive conduct applies when a defendant is convicted of a separate obstruction offense that takes place \u201cduring the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (2001). The obstructive conduct here did not occur with respect to the mail fraud or money laundering offenses, but during a separate civil forfeiture proceeding. Linking the obstructive conduct during the civil forfeiture proceeding with the criminal investigation into the money laundering and fraud offenses \u201cserv[es] only to make Note 8 inconsistent with the text of \u00a7 3C1.1 itself, which requires the perjury to occur <em>\u2018during </em>the course of the [criminal] investigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>DeGeorge, </em>380 F.3d at 1222.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">There is not a sufficient nexus of relatedness between the civil forfeiture proceeding where the obstructive conduct occurred and the mail fraud and money laundering counts merely because the proceeds from the latter were used to purchase the house. The purchase of the house was not alleged in the indictment as conduct underlying any of the fraud or money laundering counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">Nor does our case law support the government\u2019s theory that there was a sufficient relationship because the criminal investigation into the fraud scheme began <em>before </em>the civil forfeiture action. The clauses in \u00a7 3C1.1 are conjunctive: \u201cIf (A) the defendant [obstructed justice] during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, <em>and </em>(B) the obstructive conduct <em>related to </em>(i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>(ii) a closely related offense<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, increase the offense level by 2 levels\u201d (emphasis added). The obstructive conduct thus must be related to the offense of conviction or a closely related offense <em>and </em>have taken place during the course of the investigation of the instant offense of conviction. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Williams, </em>693 F.3d 1067, 1071, 1076 (9th Cir.2012).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Nor is grouping mandatory under \u00a7 3D1.2(c), which applies when \u201ccounts in~ volv[e] substantially the same harm,\u201d meaning \u201cwhen one of the counts embodies conduct that is treated as a specific offense characteristic in, or other adjustment to, the guideline applicable to another of the counts.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Obstructive conduct is not a \u201cspecific offense characteristic\u201d listed in the Guideline used to calculate the base offense level for the fraud charges. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 (2001). Nor is it an \u201cadjustment to\u201d the fraud guideline under \u00a7 3C1.1 where that enhancement does not apply. None of the application notes to \u00a7 3C1.1 discuss adding the enhancement to charges grouped under any provision other than \u00a7 3D1.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing without grouping the obstruction counts with the fraud and money laundering accounts under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c), and without the application of the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement. Remand for resentencing is on an open record. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>278 F.3d 880, 885 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">(3) The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing supervised release condition number 10, a complete ban on self-employment. The court specifically noted at re-sentencing that the self-employment condition was \u201cbased upon the court\u2019s concern that defendant is an economic danger to the community. The evidence at trial convinces this court that the defendant\u2019s fraud scheme could be repeated by defendant where no supervision is available to his conduct in business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">(4) Ferguson did not object in the district court to the imposition of other special conditions. Thus, we review his appeal of special conditions 6, 9, and 13 for plain error. <em>United States v. Daniels, </em>541 F.3d 915, 927 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">Conditions 6 and 9 are not plain error affecting Ferguson\u2019s substantial rights, and we affirm the imposition of those conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>We vacate Condition 13, delegating to the probation officer the determination of how any windfall money should be applied to restitution, as contrary to <em>United States v. Betts, </em>511 F.3d 872, 876-77 (9th Cir .2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">(5) We vacate the order of restitution to the IRS and remand to the district court to enter the order of restitution pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663, 3663A, including the total amount of restitution due and amount of payments if restitution is awarded to the IRS as a condition of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Batson, </em>608 F.3d 630, 632-33 (9th Cir.2010) (holding that restitution for a Title 26 offense may be imposed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663 and 3663A as a condition of supervised release). Otherwise, restitution is not authorized for non-Title 18 offenses. <em>United States v. Elias, </em>269 F.3d 1003, 1021, supplemented 27 Fed.Appx. 750 (9th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">We reject Ferguson\u2019s request that this case be assigned to a different judge on remand. Remand to a new judge is reserved for \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d <em>United States v. Arnett, </em>628 F.2d 1162, 1165 (9th Cir.1979), and those circumstances are not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">We AFFIRM in part, VACATE in part, and REMAND for resentencing in accordance with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b730-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\">. \"Relevant conduct\u201d is defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(1) (2001) as \u201call acts and omissions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the' defendant ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.\u201d Section 1B 1.3(2) limits that \"solely with respect to offenses of a character for which \u00a7 3D 1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts, all acts and omissions described [in subdivision (1)] that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d Subdivision (2) only relates to counts grouped under \u00a7 3D 1.2(d), which is not at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b732-7\">. A \"closely related\u201d case is \"such as that of a co-defendant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, Application Note 1 (2001).

The government's argument that Ferguson\u2019s wrongful conduct as alleged in the civil forfeiture proceeding and the indictment involve the same victims and substantially the same harm is unavailing, as that would invoke grouping under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D 1.2(b), which was not the basis for grouping in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
