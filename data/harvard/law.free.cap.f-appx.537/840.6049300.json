Rodriguez argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court applied an upward variance which was not justified by the record and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). After thorough review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Kuhlman, </em>711 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2013). This standard \u201callows a range of choice for the district court, so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Rodriguez, as the party challenging the sentence, bears the burden of showing that it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">When reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence we check for both procedural and substantive reasonableness. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008). In analyzing procedural reasonableness we</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-12\">ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-15\"><em>Kuhlman, </em>711 F.3d at 1326 (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Neither party argues that Rodriguez\u2019s sentence is procedurally unreasonable. We likewise see no procedural infirmity, as the district court properly calculated the Guideline range, addressed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and gave an explanation as to Rodriguez\u2019s upward variance. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d). Because we are satisfied that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, we next review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-16\">In the sentencing context, a district court abuses its discretion when it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-17\">(1) fails to afford consideration to relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-18\"><em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-19\">We see no abuse of discretion because Rodriguez has not established that his sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>tence is unreasonable in light of the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Tome, </em>611 F.3d at 1378. The district court judge explicitly considered the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a) in arriving at Rodriguez\u2019s sentence and articulated reasons why he found an upward variance appropriate. [R. 72 at 100-02; R. 49 at 1.] While a district court varying from the advisory guideline range must present a justification compelling enough to support the degree of the variance, <em>see Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1186, we do not presume that a sentence outside the guideline range is unreasonable and give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the variance. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. As such, we will only reverse due to a variance if we have a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\u201d the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and selecting its chosen sentence. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Rodriguez has failed to show that the district court\u2019s imposition of a 21-month upward variance was unreasonable in light of the record and the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). At the outset, we point out that although the district court varied upward in arriving at his sentence, 84 months\u2019 imprisonment is well below the statutory maximum of 20 years (240 months) that Rodriguez potentially faced. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343; <em>see also United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir. 2006) (affirming an upward variance and observing that the sentence was appreciably below the statutory maximum). More importantly, the district court explicitly considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), including some facts that it acknowledged were mitigating; In analyzing these factors, however, the district court found that the circumstances surrounding Rodriguez\u2019s offense warranted an upward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Specifically, the district court found a variance appropriate because Rodriguez perpetrated his Ponzi scheme for an extended period of time, and the scheme had a devastating impact on the financial lives of many of his former friends and clients. The record supports this finding, as the evidence demonstrates the debilitating effect Rodriquez\u2019s conduct had on the lives of those who trusted him. Rodriguez took money from close family friends and from clients with whom he had worked with for years and who trusted him as their CPA. Moreover, Rodriguez preyed on individuals who were particularly vulnerable. For example, he extracted money from victims who were seriously ill, retirees, and on one occasion he even gulled a grieving couple out of settlement proceeds received from a wrongful death suit filed following the murder of their son. Hence, the particularly egregious circumstances surrounding Rodriguez\u2019s offense implicate several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors discussed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">In addition to taking into account the nature and circumstances of Rodriguez\u2019s offense, the district court wanted the sentence to deter others from committing similar crimes. See <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1240 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cBecause economic and fraud-based crimes are more rational, cool, and calculated than sudden crimes of passion or opportunity, these crimes are prime candidates for general deterrence.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Thus, the district court\u2019s reasoning for varying upward derived from the factors articulated in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), and we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s weighing of these considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Because Rodriguez\u2019s sentence of 84 months\u2019 imprisonment was supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, was well below the statutory maximum term, and was accompanied by a sufficient justification for the variance, we conclude that the district court did not commit a clear error in judgment or otherwise abuse its discretion. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Rodriguez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
