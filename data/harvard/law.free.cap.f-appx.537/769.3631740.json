We deny the petition. Because the parties are familiar with the history of this case, we need not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-25\">Substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility determination. Under the REAL ID Act, an inconsistency can support an adverse credibility finding even if it does not go to the heart of the claim. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1043 (9th Cir.2010). Here, Yang testified that she did not organize a protest until May 2005, well after her firing. But an August 2004 letter stated that factory officials were firing Yang because she was detained for organizing sit-in demonstrations. The immigration judge (IJ) considered Yang\u2019s explanation for this inconsistency and concluded that Yang did not explain the discrepancy. Yang\u2019s explanation that a facto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>ry leader concocted a reason to fire her that directly corresponded to events that occurred nearly a year later was neither reasonable nor plausible. Therefore, the IJ did not need to discuss her reasons for rejecting the explanation in greater detail. <em>See Rizk v. Holder, </em>629 F.3d 1083, 1091 (9th Cir.2011) (IJ did not need to offer \u201cexpress, point-by-point rejection\u201d when petitioner \u201cdid not offer a reasonable and plausible explanation for the discrepancies\u201d). Given this inconsistency, and in light of the total circumstances, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was reasonable. <em>Shrestha, </em>590 F.3d at 1044. Absent credible testimony, Yang could not establish her eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. She submitted no additional evidence that would compel the conclusion that she is entitled to relief under Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b785-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
