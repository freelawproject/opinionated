For the following reasons, we summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Plummer was sentenced to 144 months\u2019 imprisonment after pleading guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. He sought a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) following retroactive amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that lowered the Guidelines\u2019 range for certain crack cocaine offenses. The Sentencing Commission\u2019s commentary excluded from relief, however, individuals whose \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d was not lowered by the amendments, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. 1(A), which includes those sentenced as career offenders. Although Plummer was deemed a career offender at sentencing, the District Court granted a downward departure to a non-career offender Guidelines\u2019 range; on this basis, he asserted he was entitled to a reduced sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Plummer concedes on appeal that this argument is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Ware, </em>694 F.3d 527 (3d Cir.2012), in which we held that the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d is calculated prior to any variance or departure, and hence was not lowered by the amendments even where a defendant was sentenced to a non-career offender range due to a downward variance. <em>Id. </em>at 531-32. Because <em>Ware </em>renders Plummer ineligible for relief and further review of that case has been denied, no substantial question is presented on appeal. Accordingly, we summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Plummer\u2019s request for a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and his subsequent motion for reconsideration. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-8\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231.
