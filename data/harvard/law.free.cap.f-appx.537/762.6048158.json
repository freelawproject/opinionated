Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">In his opening brief, Castaneda fails to address, and therefore has waived, any challenge to the BIA\u2019s summary dismissal of his appeal for failure to provide statements specifying the reasons underlying his challenge to the IJ\u2019s decision granting voluntary departure. <em>See Lopez-Vasquez v. Holder, </em>706 F.3d 1072, 1079-80 (9th Cir.2013) (a petitioner waives an issue by failing to raise it in the opening brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review any challenge to the BIA\u2019s April 5, 2010, order of removal determining that Castaneda is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal because the petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>see also Pinto v. Holder, </em>648 F.3d 976, 985-86 (9th Cir.2011) (explaining that the BIA\u2019s order denying relief from removal and remanding to the IJ for voluntary departure is a final order of removal triggering the 30-day deadline for petitioning for review of final orders).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">In light of our disposition, we need not address Castaneda\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b779-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
