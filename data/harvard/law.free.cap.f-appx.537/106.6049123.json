MetLife\u2019s motion urged that Mathews\u2019s claim had been released in the prior Litigation. The District Court held that Mathews was bound by that Settlement and Release, and granted Met-Life\u2019s Motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-23\">The thrust of Mathews\u2019s argument on appeal is twofold: first, he urges that the release here does not bar his claim because it does not have an identical factual predicate (Br. for Appellant 18); second, he argues that he should not be bound by the class action litigation for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-24\">The latter argument \u2014 which relies on inadequate class representation, improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>certification due to lack of typicality and commonality \u2014 is essentially a collateral attack on the prior settlement, and Mathews appears to acknowledge this <em>(id. </em>at 27-28), but urges that it should be permitted in this instance. Mathews also contends that he was not properly notified because he \u201cwas not properly sent the entire Notice Package.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 47.) However, as Met-Life notes, he concedes he received part of the notice package, which contained brochures that put him on notice that the policy was part of the class and outlined the relief available in the action. (Br. of Defs.-Appellees 26; App. II 205-06.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">With respect to Mathews\u2019s argument that his claim is not barred because it does not have the identical factual predicate, Mathews misstates the context of the District Court\u2019s reference to this test and cites to one of our Court\u2019s not precedential opinions (which he relies upon as his exclusive authority). However, the District Court did not, as Mathews suggests, hold that a release cannot relinquish claims that do not have the identical factual predicate. To the contrary, the District Court noted that its analysis in this regard was relevant to its discussion of a case involving the exemption from the release for the \u201cindependently arising\u201d claims, not to whether the claims were included under the broad release language. (App. I 12.) Indeed, the District Court held that Mathews was not precluded under this exclusion from alleging claims based on \u201ckey facts arising after 1997, that do not share a common nucleus with the MDL claims.\u201d (App. I 31.) On appeal, Mathews does not rely on this exclusion, nor does he contend that his claim is not covered by the language of the release. Thus, his argument as to the permissible scope of the release must fail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Similarly, Mathews\u2019s collateral attack on the settlement must fail. He urges that such an attack is permissible here because the \u201cclass certification and settlement were summary and conclusive in nature,\u201d so that, under the jurisprudence of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Wolfert v. Transamerica Home First, Inc., </em>439 F.3d 165 (2d Cir.2006), it would be unfair to preclude collateral attack. The District Court Judge \u2014 the same Judge who had approved the settlement in the MDL \u2014 did not bar the issues raised by Mathews based on her unwillingness to entertain a collateral attack on her previous ruling. However, we will affirm the Court\u2019s ruling on that basis. We decline to find that the approval of the settlement here was so lacking as to render precluding collateral attack to be unfair. To the contrary, the record is clear that class members had a full and fair hearing. Our case law is clear that \u201c[o]nce a court has decided that the due process protections did occur for a particular class member or group of class members, the issue may not be relitigated.\u201d <em>In re Diet Drugs Prod. Liab. Litig., </em>431 F.3d 141, 146 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Therefore, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-15\">. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b130-16\">. The Motion was actually granted in part, but also denied in part. The ultimate resolution of the motion is not relevant to this appeal. He also received notice via publication. The District Court properly concluded that he received adequate notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b131-6\">. It is clear, as MetLife notes, that broad, global releases such as the one included in the settlement of this litigation are commonplace and routinely upheld by the courts. (Br. of Defs.-Appellees 27-28.).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
