He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. We find the present record does not reveal undue delay in the district court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis and deny the mandamus petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b162-18\"> We note that Ellis filed the pending motions on the same day that he noted appeals from related orders. We adjudicated these appeals and the mandate issued on May 8, 2013.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
