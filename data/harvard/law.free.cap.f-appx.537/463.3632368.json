For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Norma Alvarez-Saldana, a Mexican national, pleaded guilty to being found unlawfully in the United States after having been previously deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated her total offense level as twenty-two with a criminal history score of IV, resulting in a guidelines range of sixty-three to seventy-eight months of imprisonment. The PSR also indicated that the guidelines range for supervised release was one to three years but explained that, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c), supervised release ordinarily should not be imposed if it is not required by statute and the defendant is an alien likely to be deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">At the sentencing hearing, Alvarez-Saldana stated that she had no objection to the PSR.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court noted the PSR\u2019s advisory guidelines range, stated that \u201c[tjhere will be a period of supervised release of three years,\u201d and then gave both parties an opportunity to speak before imposing the sentence. Alvarez-Saldana did not object to the statement regarding supervised release and instead simply argued for a below-guidelines sentence, urging that she had a benign motive for reentry, had lived the majority of her life in the United States, had maintained continued employment as a housekeeper, had been the victim of domestic violence, had suffered from bouts of anxiety and depression, and had no prior illegal reentry convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">When Alvarez-Saldana completed her argument, the district court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-13\">What troubles me about this is this is not only an illegal reentry but it\u2019s what this woman was doing ... when she was in the United States. A cleaning lady, I don\u2019t know, but I do know that there appears to be about three separate convictions for selling or attempting to sell heroin[], a nasty, nasty drug that is dangerous and very addictive. And each time that she did it, she didn\u2019t profit from that. She went back out to do it. And, you know, I understand why she\u2019s wanting to do it, maybe because she wants to support her family with this, but the fact of the matter is, you had three separate chances ... to quit doing this and you didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">The court sentenced Alvarez-Saldana to a term of sixty-three months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release. Alvarez-Saldana then objected to the sentence as \u201cmore than sufficient and greater than necessary\u201d and timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b483-16\">Alvarez-Saldana challenges the term of supervised release as procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Specifically, she argues that the district court erred procedurally by failing to explain its decision to impose supervised release despite \u00a7 5Dl.l(c)\u2019s guidance that supervised release ordinarily should not be imposed in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>case involving a deportable alien. She also asserts that the supervised-release term is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to account for \u00a7 5Dl.l(c)\u2019s guidance, a factor that should have received significant weight.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u201cWe generally review sentences for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Cancino-Trinidad, </em>710 F.3d 601, 604 (5th Cir.2013). In doing so, we conduct a bifurcated analysis. First, we \u201censure that the sentencing court committed no significant procedural error,\u201d which includes, among other things, \u201cfailing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 327 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). If the sentence is procedurally proper, \u201cwe then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.\u201d <em>Cancino-Trinidad, </em>710 F.3d at 605 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the Guidelines range is presumed reasonable on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">If a defendant fails to properly object to an alleged error at sentencing, however, review is for plain error. <em>Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 327. We can remedy such an error \u201conly when it is plain and affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 361. Even when these elements are met, we generally will exercise our discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Alvarez-Saldana concedes that her objection to the sentence being \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d was insufficient to alert the district court of her disagreement with the manner in which the sentence was explained. Cf<em>. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 361 (\u201cA district court hearing an objection that a sentence is \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 would not know from those words that the defendant wanted further explanation of the sentence.\u201d). We therefore review her claim of procedural unreasonableness for plain error and her claim of substantive unreasonableness for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>(analyzing an identical objection and concluding that the claim of procedural unreasonableness would be reviewed for plain error and the claim of substantive unreasonableness for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">With respect to procedural unreasonableness, we have previously addressed the adequacy of explanations for the imposition of supervised release in cases involving \u00a7 5D1.1(c). In <em>Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>we interpreted that provision and its accompanying commentary to mean that, in the case of a deportable alien, \u201csupervised release should not be imposed absent a determination that supervised release would provide an added measure of deterrence and protection based on the facts and circumstances of a particular case.\u201d 695 F.3d at 329. The district court had imposed a sentence that included a three-year term of supervised release and justified its decision by stating, \u201cI gave the sentence after looking at the factors in 3553(a), to deter future criminal conduct, his particular background and characteristics, which apparently do not make him a welcome visitor to this country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>330 (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant did not challenge the adequacy of this explanation until his appeal, but we held that \u201c[e]ven when an objection is voiced under \u00a7 5Dl.l(c), [the district court\u2019s] particularized explanation and concern would justify imposition of a term of supervised release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, the district court did not commit any error, plain or otherwise, with its explanation. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Reyes-Serna, </em>509 Fed.Appx. 313, 314 (5th Cir.2013) (per curiam) (unpublished) (finding the district court\u2019s explanation of the supervised-release term sufficient when the district court noted the defendant\u2019s criminal history, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the need to protect the public).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Here, the district court similarly spoke of Alvarez-Saldana\u2019s criminal history, citing her repeated sales of a \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cvery addictive\u201d drug. Additionally, the court adopted the PSR, which informed the court that under \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) it ordinarily should not impose a term of supervised release in a case such as this. The court\u2019s adoption of the PSR supports our general inference that the court \u201cconsidered all pertinent sentencing considerations in imposing the sentence,\u201d <em>Cancino-Trinidad, </em>710 F.3d at 606 (internal quotation marks omitted), and its focus on the nature of Alvarez-Saldana\u2019s repeated prior convictions indicates that the court weighed the need for added deterrence and protection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, particularly the similarity between the explanation here and the one found sufficient in <em>Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>we cannot say that the court plainly erred in failing to adequately explain its reasons for the sentence imposed. We note further that even if there were clear or obvious error, Alvarez-Saldana\u2019s claim would still fail as she has not shown that an adequate explanation would have changed her within-guidelines-range sentence. <em>See, e.g., Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 365 (\u201cWhile a district court errs by failing to explain a sentence, the effect of that error on our review for reasonableness is diminished when the sentence is within the Guidelines range.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">We next consider Alvarez-Saldana\u2019s claim of substantive unreasonableness. \u201cOne basis for error in a defendant\u2019s sentence is failure by the district court to account for a factor that should receive significant weight.\u201d <em>Cancino-Trinidad, </em>710 F.3d at 607 (internal quotation marks omitted). Alvarez-Saldana argues that the relevant factor ignored by the district court is \u00a7 5Dl.l(c)\u2019s guidance that the court ordinarily should not impose supervised release in cases involving deportable aliens. Her supervised-release term, however, was within the guidelines range of one to three years. <em>See Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 329 (holding that the imposition of supervised release despite \u00a7 5D1.1(c)\u2019s guidance does not constitute an upward departure from the guidelines). \u201cWe ordinarily apply a presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentences.\u201d <em>Cancino-Trinidad, </em>710 F.3d at 607 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). As Alvarez-Saldana has not presented a compelling argument to rebut that presumption, we conclude that the sentence was not substantively unreasonable. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 607-08 (rejecting an identical claim of substantive unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>ableness and holding that the imposition of a within-guidelines-range term of supervised release \u201cwas not itself error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-17\">. Before the sentencing hearing, Alvarez-Saldana objected to the calculation of her total offense level, but that objection was resolved and is not raised in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-6\">. Alvarez-Saldana also preserves for further review her assertion that the district court's imposition of supervised release constituted an upward departure from the guidelines requiring notice, though she acknowledges that our precedent forecloses that argument. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 329 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b485-6\">. Indeed, the district court rejected defense counsel\u2019s argument that \"I don't think that it\u2019s necessary that You Honor sentence her within the guidelines to deter her from returning. The time that she\u2019s already been in prison and the fact that she has had time to reflect on the possible punishment that she may receive today is enough to deter her from coming back.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
