Historical winter-run population estimates were as high as approximately 230,000 fish in the 1960s, BiOp at 82, but declined to under 200 fish in the 1990s. Id. at 81. In recent years, population surveys of winter-run estimated a high of 17,344 fish in 2006, followed by a decline in 2007 (2,542 fish) that persisted into 2008 (2,830 fish). Id.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>Adult winter-run Chinook salmon migrate upstream from the Pacific Ocean through the Bay-Delta estuary during November through July, moving upstream past Red Bluff Diversion Dam (\u201cRBDD\u201d) from mid-December through early August, with peak passage occurring in mid-March. BiOp at 80. Spawning typically occurs in the mainstream Sacramento River downstream of Keswick Dam during April through August, with the greatest spawning activity typically taking place during May and June. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Winter-run fry begin to emerge from the gravel beds where eggs are laid in late June and early July, continuing through October. Id. Juvenile rearing and emigration typically occurs between July and February in the upper Sacramento River, with juvenile migration downstream past RBDD beginning as early as mid-July, peaking in September, and continuing through March in some years. Id. at 80-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Juvenile winter-run occur in the Delta from November through May. Id.; <em>Pac. Coast Fed\u2019n of Fisherman\u2019s Ass\u2019ns. v. Gutierrez (\u201cGutierrez II\u2019), </em>606 F.Supp.2d 1195, 1216-17 (E.D.Cal.2008). Winter-run juveniles typically remain in the Delta until they reach a fork length of approximately 118 millimeters and are from 5 to 10 months of age. BiOp. at 81. Juveniles begin exiting to the ocean as early as November and continue to do so through May. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Designated critical habitat for winter-run includes the Sacramento River, the Delta, and downstream bays to the Golden Gate Bridge. 58 Fed.Reg. 33,212 (June 16, 1993). <em>Gutierrez II, </em>606 F.Supp.2d at 1217. The following physical and biological features are identified as essential for the conservation of winter-run:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-8\">(1) access from the Pacific Ocean to appropriate spawning areas in the upper Sacramento River, (2) the availability of clean gravel for spawning substrate, (3) adequate river flows for successful spawning, incubation of eggs, fry development and emergence, and downstream transport of juveniles, (4) water temperatures between 42.5 and 57.5\u00b0F for successful spawning, egg incubation, and fry development, (5) habitat areas and adequate prey that are not contaminated, (6) riparian habitat that provides for successful juvenile development and survival, and (7) access downstream so that juveniles can migrate from spawning grounds to San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">BiOp at 90. Currently, the value of winter-run critical habitat is \u201cdegraded,\u201d by, among other things, the presence of dams, temperature control issues on the upper Sacramento River, unscreened diversions, and degraded spawning and riparian habitat. Id. at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">2. <em>Spring Run Chinook.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) (\u201cspring-run\u201d) is listed as \u201cthreatened\u201d under the ESA. 71 Fed. Reg. 834 (June 5, 2005); 70 Fed.Reg. 37160 (June 28, 2005) (critical habitat designated). There are three \u201cindependent\u201d populations of spring-run, located on Butte, Deer and Mill Creeks, several \u201cdependent\u201d populations (which rely on the three independent populations for continued existence), and a population of hatchery fish from the Feather River Hatchery (FRH). BiOp at 93-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">Spring-run Chinook have been declining over recent years. The Central Valley as a whole is estimated to have supported spring runs as large as 600,000 fish between the late 1880s and 1940s. Id. at 94. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>The 2007 escapement was 7,819 for all tributary populations (all independent and dependent populations, excluding those fish returning to FRH). Id. at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Adult spring-run enter freshwater in the spring, beginning in late January, entering the Sacramento River between March and September, primarily in May and June, and entering spawning grounds between mid-April and mid-June. Id. at 93. Adults hold over the summer in cool, high elevation streams while they sexually mature, and then spawn in the fall, between September and October, depending on water temperatures. Id. at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Juveniles typically spend a year or more in freshwater before emigrating to the ocean. Id. at 93. The emigration period for spring-run extends from November to June and is highly variable. Id. at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Designated critical habitat for spring-run includes the Sacramento River, tributaries supporting spring-run, the Delta, and downstream bays to the Golden Gate Bridge. <em>Gutierrez II, </em>606 F.Supp.2d at 1217. The value of spring-run critical habitat currently is \u201cdegraded.\u201d BiOp at 101, 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">3. <em>Central Valley Steelhead.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">Central Valley steelhead (O. mykiss) (\u201cCV steelhead\u201d) is listed as \u201cthreatened\u201d under the ESA. 71 Fed.Reg. 834 (Jan. 5, 2006). Wild CV steelhead are confined mostly to the upper Sacramento River and its tributaries. BiOp at 107. Recent surveys also have detected small, self-sustaining populations on the Stanislaus, Mokelumne, and Calaveras Rivers, as well as observations of juvenile steelhead on the Tuolumne and Merced Rivers. Id. These small populations make up the remaining representatives of the Southern Sierra Nevada Diversity Group (\u201cSSNDG\u201d) of CV Steelhead. Id. at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">While there is limited information on population size, NMFS estimates that the current population for the <em>entire </em>distinct population segment (\u201cDPS\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (including the SSNDG as well as all other populations) in the Central Valley is less than 3,628 spawning females, compared with 40,000 spawners in the 1960s. BiOp at 106. The CV Steelhead population has shown a pattern of negative growth since the late 1960s, and there is no indication that the trend has changed. BiOp at 108-09 &amp; Figures 4-4 <em>&amp; </em>4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">CV steelhead generally leave the ocean from August through April and spawn from December through April in small streams and tributaries where cool, well-oxygenated water is available year-round. Id. at 104. Unlike Pacific salmon, steel-head are capable of spawning more than once before death. Although one-time spawners are the great majority, approximately 17.2 percent in California streams are repeat spawners. Id. at 103-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">Steelhead eggs hatch approximately 30 days after spawning, and fry emerge from the gravel four to six weeks later into shallow areas where they feed. Id. at 105. Steelhead rear during the summer and emigrate \u201cepisodically\u201d from their natal streams during fall, winter, and spring high flows. Id. at 106. Emigrating CV Steelhead use the lower reaches of the Sacramento River and Delta for rearing and as a migration corridor to the ocean. Id. Juvenile CV steelhead typically emi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>grate through the Delta from late September through June. Id. at 105 (Table 4-6).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Approximately 80% of historical CV Steelhead range is blocked by dams. Id. at 109. CV steelhead critical habitat is degraded. Id. at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">4. <em>Green Sturgeon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The southern distinct population segment of the North American green sturgeon (\u201cgreen sturgeon\u201d) (Acipenser medirostris) is listed as \u201cthreatened\u201d under the ESA. 71 Fed.Reg. 17757 (Apr. 7, 2006); 73 Fed.Reg. 52,084 (critical habitat designated).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Green sturgeon are anadromous fish that spawn and rear in freshwater rivers and estuaries but spend most of their lives in the ocean. See BiOp at 114-15. They are a long-lived, slow-growing species. 68 Fed.Reg. 4,433, 4,436 (Jan. 29, 2003). Juvenile green sturgeon are present in the Delta year round. BiOp at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">There are no definitive population counts or figures for the Southern DPS green sturgeon. Evidence available at the time the BiOp was written suggests that the population in the Delta watershed is \u201crelatively small,\u201d ranging from several hundred to a few thousand adults. Id. at 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Critical habitat for the Southern DPS of green sturgeon was proposed on September 8, 2008, 73 Fed.Reg. 52,084, but had not been adopted as of the issuance of the BiOp. Proposed critical habitat included \u201capproximately 325 miles of riverine habitat and 1,058 square miles of estuarine habitat in California, Oregon, and Washington, and 11,927 square miles of coastal marine habitat off California, Oregon, and Washington within the geographical area presently occupied by the Southern DPS of green sturgeon.\u201d BiOp at 126. In addition, approximately 136 square miles of habitat within the Yolo and Sutter bypasses, adjacent to the Sacramento River, are proposed for designation. Id. The BiOp concluded that the current condition of proposed critical habitat for the Southern DPS of green sturgeon is \u201cdegraded over historical conditions.\u201d Id. at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">5. <em>Southern Resident Killer Whale.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">The Southern Resident DPS of killer whale (Orcinus orea) (\u201cSouthern Residents\u201d) was listed as \u201cendangered\u201d under the ESA on November 18, 2005, 70 Fed. Reg. 69,903 (Nov. 18, 2005), and the DPS is designated as \u201cdepleted\u201d under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. BiOp at 158\u2014 59.

BiOp at 575. As required by law, the BiOp includes an RPA designed to allow the projects to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>operating without causing jeopardy to the species or adverse modification to its critical habitat. Id. at 575-671. The RPA \u201cis composed of numerous elements for each of the various project divisions and associated stressors,\u201d which, according to the BiOp, \u201cmust be implemented in its entirety to avoid jeopardy and adverse modification.\u201d Id. at 578. The BiOp provides a succinct overview of the RPA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-4\">There are several ways in which water operations adversely affect listed species that are addressed in this RPA. We summarize the most significant here:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-5\">1) Water operations result in elevated water temperatures that have lethal and sub-lethal effects on egg incubation and juvenile rearing in the upper Sacramento River. The immediate operational cause is lack of sufficient cold water in storage to allow for cold water releases to reduce downstream temperatures at critical times and meet other project demands. This elevated temperature effect is particularly pronounced in the Upper Sacramento for winter-run and mainstem spring-run, and in the American River for steelhead. The RPA includes a new year-round storage and temperature management program for Shasta Reservoir and the Upper Sacramento River, as well as long-term passage prescriptions at Shasta Dam and re-introduction of winter-run into its native habitat in the McCloud and/or Upper Sacramento rivers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-6\">2) In Clear Creek, recent project operations have led to increased abundance of Clear Creek spring-run, which is an essential population for the short-term and long-term survival of the species. Nonetheless, in the proposed action, continuation of these operations is uncertain. The RPA ensures that essential flows and temperatures for holding, egg incubation and juvenile survival will be maintained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-7\">3) Red Bluff Diversion Dam (RBDD) on the Sacramento River impedes both upstream migration of adult fish to spawning habitat and downstream migration of juveniles. Effects are significant for winter-run and spring-run, but are particularly pronounced for green sturgeon and its proposed critical habitat in that a significant portion of the population is blocked from its spawning and holding habitat. The RPA mandates gate openings at critical times in the short term while an alternative pumping plant is built, and, by 2012, opening of the gates all year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-8\">4) Both project and non-project effects have led to a significant reduction in necessary juvenile rearing habitat in the Sacramento River Basin and Delta. The project\u2019s flood control operations result in adverse effects through reduced frequency and magnitude of inundation of rearing habitat. To minimize these effects, the RPA contains both short-term and long-term actions for improving juvenile rearing habitat in the Lower Sacramento River and northern Delta.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-9\">5) Another major effect of water operations is diversion of out-migrating juveniles from the north Delta tributaries into the interior Delta through the open DCC gates. Instead of migrating directly to the outer estuary and then to sea, these juveniles are caught in the interior Delta and subjected to pollution, predators, and altered food webs- that cause either direct mortality or impaired growth. The RPA mandates additional gate closures to minimize these adverse effects to winter-run, spring-run, and steelhead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-10\">6) Similarly, water pumping causes reverse flows, leading to loss of juveniles migrating out from the Sacramento River system in the interior Delta and more juveniles being exposed to the State and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Federal pumps, where they are salvaged at the facilities. The RPA prescribes Old and Middle River flow levels to reduce the number of juveniles exposed to the export facilities and prescribes additional measures at the facilities themselves to increase survival of fish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-3\">7) The effects analysis shows that juvenile steelhead migrating out from the San Joaquin River Basin have a particularly high rate of loss due to both project and non-project related stressors. The RPA mandates additional measures to improve survival of San Joaquin steel-head smolts, including both increased San Joaquin River flows and export curtailments. Given the uncertainty of the relationship between flow and exports, the RPA also prescribes a significant new study of acoustic tagged fish in the San Joaquin Basin to evaluate the effectiveness of the RPA and refine it over the lifetime of the project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-4\">8) On the American River, project-related effects on steelhead are pronounced due to the inability to consistently provide suitable temperatures for various life stages and flow-related effects caused by operations. The RPA prescribes a flow management standard, a temperature management plan, additional technological fixes to temperature control structures, and, in the long term, a passage at Nimbus and Folsom Dams to restore steelhead to native habitat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-5\">9) On the Stanislaus River, project operations have led to significant degradation of floodplain and rearing habitat for steelhead. Low flows also distort cues associated with out-migration. The RPA proposes a year-round flow regime necessary to minimize project effects to each life-stage of steelhead, including new spring flows that will support rearing habitat formation and inundation, and will create pulses that cue out-migration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">10)Nimbus Fish Hatchery steelhead program contribute to both loss of genetic diversity and mixing of wild and hatchery stocks of steelhead, which reduces the viability of wild stocks. The Nimbus and Trinity River Hatchery programs for non-listed fall-run also contribute to a loss of genetic diversity, and therefore, viability, for fall-run. The RPA requires development of Hatchery Genetics Management Plans to improve genetic diversity of both steelhead and fall-run, an essential prey base of Southern Resident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Id. at 576-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">III. <em>STANDARD OF DECISION</em></p>\n<p id=\"AC8\">Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings and the record demonstrate that \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).

Previous rulings in this and the related <em>Consolidated Delta Smelt Cases </em>have discussed at length why the use of such data is <em>not </em>consistent with standard practice in the fields of fish biology and population dynamics.

The comparisons of salvage to negative OMR flows relied upon in the BiOp utilize raw salvage numbers, rather than scaling salvage to population size. See Doc. 179, Declaration of Richard B. Deriso at \u00b6\u00b6 3-5. Scaling salvage to population size is standard fisheries science practice and could have been accomplished for several of the Listed Species based on existing population data. See id. at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. <em>This failure is a fundamental and inexplicable error. Salvage may have been higher in some years simply because the population was higher, not because of any differences in negative OMR flows.

If, in those years when salvage was greatest, population sizes overall were 10 or 100 times larger than other years, the effects might not be jeopardizing. Without adjustment for population size, NMFS\u2019s reliance on that figure was arbitrary and capricious. 127. As to the CV steelhead, for which no population numbers are available, it is less clear whether the use of raw salvage numbers is always inappropriate. Figures 6-65 and 6-66 ambiguously reference monthly CVP and SWP \u201cOlder Juvenile Loss\u201d on the y axis. Were most of the salvaged fish represented on these charts Chinook salmon? No reason is offered why NMFS did not segregate the steelhead figures from those of Chinook salmon. If the species had been evaluated separately, would it have been reasonable for NMFS to fail to adjust the steelhead figures for population size? Separate analysis was not done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-5\"><em>Consol. Salmonid Cases, </em>713 F.Supp.2d 1116, 1142-43 (E.D.Cal.2010) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Federal Defendants attempt to explain their use of these figures in two ways. First, Jeffrey Stuart, NMFS Fisheries Biologist and the primary author of the Delta section of the BiOp, opines that \u201cthe general trend in fish loss should still be apparent regardless of scaling.\u201d Fourth Stuart Deck, Doc. 485 at \u00b6 72. He insists that this data \u201cindicates that additional loss of fish occurs with increasing export levels as measured by the OMR flow values.\u201d Id. This explanation simply defies common sense. When trying to discern trends from data points that range across many years, an obvious \u201cconfounding variable\u201d is population size. A trend observed in data that is unsealed for population size may change or completely disappear when scaled for population size. See Deriso Deck, Doc. 440 at \u00b6\u00b6 13 \u2014 31. Federal Defendants had the information needed to perform such a simple analysis of the available data, but did not do so, and unjustifiably relied on the unsealed data to form a quantitative conclusion that salvage rates increased sharply above \u2014 5,000 cfs OMR. This was a clear scientific error.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">DefendanWlntervenors argue that the agency cannot violate the ESA by failing to take an additional step to scale the salvage data to salmonid population abundance. They maintain that all the ESA requires is that NMFS consider the \u201cavailable\u201d evidence not that it create new data or \u201cfollow scientific practices defined by Export Plaintiffs experts.\u201d Doc. 484 at 51. It is true that the best available science standard does not require NMFS to create new data or apply new models to existing data, <em>Building Indus. Ass\u2019n, </em>247 F.3d at 1246. However, here, NMFS put data to a use for which it is not appropriate, as it produces unreliable results. Cf. <em>NWF v. EPA, </em>286 F.3d at 565 (a court may reject agency\u2019s choice of model when it \u201cbears no rational relationship to the characteristics of the data to which it was applied\u201d). Every biostatistics expert who presented evidence in this and related fish cases has agreed that it is wholly inappropriate and scientifically unreasonable to draw management conclusions from a plot comparing unsealed salvage data to OMR flows collected over a period of years when population varied.

No party has provided authority that a harmless error rule applies when the agency commits a substantive error under the ESA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Arguendo, Defendants\u2019 alternative evidence is considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">(1) <em>Record Citations Provided by Mr. Stuart.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Mr. Stuart states: \u201c[additional assessment of the effects of the OMR flow levels on salmon loss was derived from data provided by NMFS staff for the BDCP.

Mr. Stuart does not explain how the voluminous referenced information was used or analyzed. It is impossible to determine whether these referenced pages provide a sufficient alternative basis for the BiOp\u2019s conclusions. NMFS has provided no explanation for an alternative to its scientifically unreliable conclusions. <em>Humane Soc. v. Locke, </em>626 F.3d at 1048 (holding NMFS did not offer a satisfactory explanation for its findings); <em>Am.

Citing this information and then failing to explain it is arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">(2) <em>Particle Tracking Model Results.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">The BiOp also relied on outputs from computer model runs utilizing the so-called Particle Tracking Model (\u201cPTM\u201d). Export Plaintiffs\u2019 and DWR\u2019s 2010 PI Motion challenged the use of PTM, arguing that while PTM is useful to track the fate of neutrally buoyant particles, it does not accurately reflect the behavior of salmonids, which are strong, volitional swimmers. These challenges were rejected in the May 18, 2010 PI Decision on the grounds that the BiOp acknowledged the limitations of PTM and reasonably relied on PTM studies to support certain conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-12\">120. This is a dispute among scientists. While DWR criticizes PTM modeling, Stuart and NMFS recognized its limitations and found PTM studies helpful to support its conclusions that: (a) as exports increase, negative OMR flows also increase; and (b) that at Station 815 (the confluence of the Mokelumne River and the San Joaquin River), particle entrainment increases from 10% at -2,500 cfs, to 20% at -3,500 cfs, to 40% at -5,000 cfs, and 90% at -7,000 cfs. NMFS, through Mr. Stuart, took into account inherent differences in the movement of neutrally buoyant particles and then-speed and direction of travel. Administrative law requires deference to the Agency. Additional record analysis is necessary to determine the extent of support for NMFS\u2019s additional opinion that exports affect salmonid survival.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASh\"><em>Consol. Salmonid Cases, </em>713 F.Supp.2d at 1141. These challenges are discussed in other sections of this decision. Here, it is sufficient to note that the PTM results are not a complete replacement for Figures 6-65 and 6-66, as they only explain how particles, not actual fish, would respond to increased OMR flow. Nor do Federal Defendants point to any other information in the record that delineates \u201cwhere along the spectrum of OMR flows any significant change in salvage could be observed,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>purposes for which Federal Defendants use 6-65 and 6-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The same reasoning applies to acoustic tag studies and other data the BiOp relies upon. This other data was treated in the May 18, 2010 decision and below in greater detail. It is undisputed that none of these studies or additional data pinpoint for management purposes at what point negative OMR flows must be controlled. Doc. 347 \u00b6\u00b6 128-138.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">It is not appropriate to speculate how NMFS\u2019s analysis and/or conclusions would have changed had the data used in figures 6-65 and 6-66 been scaled to population size. This must be done on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Whether there is sufficient data to scale CV steelhead salvage information to population size is unclear. Compare BiOp at 107 (discussing existing population data and difficulties posed by \u201clack of monitoring program\u201d) with Doc. 431 at 11 (citing Burnham Deck, Doc. 439 at \u00b6 42 (\u201cNMFS has access to the number of hatchery-produced salmon each year\u201d), for the proposition that NMFS had \u201creadily available\u201d data regarding how many CV Steelhead were released from hatcheries each year)). That scaling for population size may not be possible for all species may limit NMFS\u2019s efforts. If population data is unavailable for certain species, the agency must nevertheless explain how it can make management conclusions without such information. The extent to which any such limitations mitigate NMFS\u2019s failure to scale raw salvage data cannot be discerned from the present record.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">(3) <em>Figures 6-71, 6-72, and 6-73.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">The BiOp also relies on a series of plots, taken directly from Reclamation\u2019s Biological Assessment (\u201cBA\u201d or \u201cOCAP BA\u201d), of monthly juvenile salmonid \u201closs\u201d against average exports. The first set of plots, Figure 6-71, depicts loss of juvenile Chinook salmon versus average monthly CVP and SWP exports for a period from 1995 through 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>BiOp at 370. This plot was specifically cited as quantitative evidence of a relationship between exports and loss at the pumps:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-4\">The CVP/SWP operations BA presented data that regressed the loss of older juvenile Chinook salmon against exports (figure 6-71) and found that a significant relationship existed. The relationship was stronger for exports at the SWP (p = 0.000918) than for exports at the CVP (p = 0.0187). The months of December through April resulted in the most informative relationship based on the historical number of older juvenile Chinook salmon salvaged each month and the relationship of each month to salvage and exports. Conversely, regressions performed for monthly salvage of YOY Chinook salmon against exports did not result in a significant relationship at either the SWP or CVP facilities....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Id. at 368-69. In this way, the BiOp used Figure 6-71 as quantitative evidence of a statistically significant connection between loss of older juvenile Chinook salmon and export levels. These plots suffer from the same flaw of misusing raw salvage data. They must be re-analyzed and explained on remand if they are to be used as scientific justification for the BiOp\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Figures 6-72 and 6-73 present a more difficult issue, as they concern CV steel-head salvage, for which much less data is available.

The 2010 PI Decision found that \"[a]s to the CV steelhead, for which no population numbers are available, it is less clear whether the use of raw salvage numbers is always inappropriate.\u201d <em>Consol. Salmonid Cases, </em>713 F.Supp.2d at 1143. Export Plaintiffs do not explain how it would be possible to scale to overall population size the wild CV steelhead salvage data, referenced in Figure 6-73 as \u201cundipped\u201d CV steelhead. However, plaintiffs point out that the exact number of hatchery CV steelhead released each year is known, and therefore argue that NMFS could have scaled the hatchery or \u201cclipped\u201d CV Steelhead data to population size. Doc. 431 at 11. Federal Defendants do not respond to this assertion. There appears to be no reason to distinguish between the clipped CV steelhead analyses and Chinook salmon analyses, for which population scaling is the best available scientific methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">More importantly, Federal Defendants do not explain how these figures, even if valid, serve the same purpose as Figures 6-65 and 6-66, 66, which were cited to demonstrate that \u201c[l]oss of older juveniles at the CVP and SWP fish collection facilities increase sharply at [OMR] flows of approximately -5,000 cfs and depart from the initial slope at flows below this.\u201d Id. at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">None of the alternative bases offered by Federal Defendants are sufficient to render NMFS\u2019s reliance on Figures 6-65 and 6-66 \u201charmless error.\u201d The significance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>Mr. Stuart\u2019s voluminous record citations is unexplained.

This is several million times smaller than 0.05. Dr. Burnham opines that while \u201c[sjuch a P-value is not impossible ... it would be surprising and especially so with this graph\u201d because \u201c[t]he scatter of the data points indicates that the regression is not a very good fit.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Dr. Burnham describes the R2 value of 0.62 as not very strong. The R2 value is a statistical measure of how well the regression explains the data. \u201cRoughly speaking an R2 of 0.5 means that the regression accounts for 50% of the variation observed in the data, while the other 50% is explained by other, unknown factors.

See, e.g., BiOp at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Mr. Stuart also provides a substantive rebuttal to Dr. Burnham\u2019s critique of the statistical analyses, premised on Dr. Burn-ham\u2019s argument that it was clear error to use monthly data points in the correlation analysis because they are highly correlated within years. Mr. Stuart opines that this premise is flawed because \u201c[m]onthly exports do not necessarily correlate with each other between months or between years.\u201d Fourth Stuart Deel., Doc. 485 at \u00b6 76.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-10\">For example, exports in March do not correlate with exports in April and May from 2000 to 2006, as Dr. Burnham has alleged, since exports are curtailed in April and May for the VAMP experiment during this time period. So regardless of what the March pumping rate is, the exports in April and May will be lower. Likewise, exports in January are allowed to reach a maximum of 65 percent of the inflow to the Delta, while exports from February through June are only allowed to reach a maximum of 35 percent of inflow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">Id.

Id. at 19</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">a. <em>IOS.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">The BiOp discussed its decision not to use IOS, which was designed to evaluate the influence of different Central Valley water operations on the life cycle of winter-run using simulated historical flow and water temperature inputs.\u201d BiOp at 65.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH4\">NMFS did not use the results of the IOS model for our analysis in this Opinion because the intended application of the model in the CVP/SWP operations BA was not useful for estimating, in an overall sense, how winter-run might respond to the proposed action. For example, the CVP/SWP operations BA cautions the use of the IOS model results in making inferences related to how winter-run abundance is affected by the proposed action: \u201cIn evaluating effects of the proposed actions, differences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>between the three studies rather than absolute trends should be examined\u201d (Appendix 0 in CVP/SWP operations BA). Thus, it seems that the IOS model results presented in the CVP/SWP operations BA are not intended to reflect either abundance estimates observed in the past or future abundance with implementation of the proposed Project. Estimates based on observations are much different than estimates based on modeling without observation input. Results of the IOS model presented in the CVP/ SWP operations BA show an increasing trend in winter-run escapement throughout the entire simulation period (i.e., from 1923 through 2002), such that by 2002, escapement is above 40,000 fish for all CALSIM II studies examined (figure 11-5 in CVP/SWP operations BA). Those results contrast with observed winter-run escapement estimates, which show a dramatic population crash during this period (see Grandtab at http://www.delta.dfg.ca.gov/afrp/), eventually leading to their endangered status under the ESA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-4\">In the Opinion, NMFS must consider how winter-run is expected to respond to implementation of the proposed action. Model results, such as the IOS model results presented in the CVP/ SWP operations BA, that are not intended to at least generally approximate past or future conditions, do not inform us in this consideration. If the IOS model results in the CVP/SWP operations BA are intended to be used strictly as an alternatives comparison tool, as the CVP/SWP operations BA indicates, instead of one that produces somewhat meaningful trend information for individual model runs, then the utility of those results for the Opinion is limited, particularly considering that a model alternative representing just baseline conditions does not exist. The CALFED Peer Review Panel stated that, \u201cThe default should be comparing the CAL-SIM studies of future scenarios (with different scenarios for climate change) to baseline\u201d(Anderson et al.2009). The context of this statement was that comparisons among alternatives such as those used in the IOS model (e.g., CAL-SIM studies 6, 7, and 8) are inconsistent with the Opinion\u2019s analytical approach. As such, NMFS did not use the IOS model results presented in the CVP/ SWP operations BA as evidence for analyzing how winter-run will be affected by the proposed action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-6\">Another consideration for not using the IOS model in the Opinion is that the model has not yet been published in peer reviewed scientific literature, and NMFS does not understand either the model\u2019s limitations or its extent. As described in Paine et al. (2000), mathematical models intended to help guide management of natural populations must be used wisely and with understanding of limitations. One potential limitation associated with applying large scale models over the entire life cycle of a species, as is done in the IOS model, is whether enough data are available to reliably estimate model parameters. Paine et al. (2000) state: \u201cWhen the data are not available for the needed estimates of parameter values, there is a tendency to insert values based on opinion or expert testimony. This practice is dangerous. The idea that opinion and \u201cexpert testimony\u201d might substitute for rigorous scientific methodology is anathema to a serious modeler and clearly represents a dangerous trend.\u201d With these considerations in mind, NMFS did not utilize the IOS model in this Opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Id. at 65-65 (italics in original). It is ironic that NMFS\u2019s reverence for \u201crigorous scientific methodology\u201d is honored in the breach by the agency\u2019s failure to utilize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>the most rigorous method possible in the disputed BiOp.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Garwin Yip, supervisor for the Water Operations and Delta Consultations branch of NMFS\u2019s Sacramento Area Office, elaborated on the first explanation provided in the BiOp \u2014 that IOS estimates did not match actual historic winter run population levels \u2014 by pointing out that even Plaintiffs\u2019 expert Dr. Burnham stated that: \u201cIf the data does generally not match the model, then we know that our assumption is somehow incorrect and needs refinement.\u201d Yip Decl., Doc. 481 at \u00b6 9 (citing Burnham Decl., Doc. 489, at \u00b6 24). Mr. Yip points out that \u201c[h]ad NMFS based our conclusion for winter-run on the quantitative approach of the IOS life cycle model results contained in the BA, we would have erroneously concluded that the proposed CVP/ SWP operations would help a great deal in recovering the species, rather than jeopardizing it.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Second, Mr. Yip points out that the CalFed Science Panel, in its review of the December 11, 2008, draft BiOp, discussed NMFS\u2019s decision not to use IOS in the BiOp and acknowledged that \u201cthe IOS model is relatively new and has not been extensively vetted and published, but all of these types of models are flexible and the Panel wonders if, with sufficient time and with some adjustments and modifications, whether a new version of the IOS could be used.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 11 (citing AR<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 00108178 (Anderson, et al.2009)). The CalFed Science Panel did not recommend or encourage the use of IOS in its current state at the time the BiOp was being developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Mr. Yip points out that the NMFS Central Valley Office requested that NMFS\u2019s Southwest Fisheries Science Center (\u201cNMFS-SWFSC\u201d) review various models, including IOS, for overall assumptions and limitations. According to Yip, NMFS-SWFSC \u201cdid not have the considerable staff resources and time it would take to adequately review and comment on the IOS model, it did have previous experience with similar models developed by Cramer Fish Sciences, and therefore, offered some comments.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-11\">To adequately review such a model [IOS model] one must thoroughly examine the model\u2019s foundation, functional relationships, error structure, and parameter values in order to assess the quality of the model\u2019s resulting inferences. The range of elements incorporated in similar models developed by this contractor [Cramer Fish Sciences] is extensive, many of which are hypothetical in nature and remain the focus of active research. For those model elements that are well-founded, many of the parameter values will, given the data poor situation we find ourselves in, have been set using data from other populations, locations, species, or simply by assumption. <em>Adequate review of the appropriateness of the assumed functional relationship and parameter values would require a significant amount of </em>time.... <em>Parenthetically, we note that the use of large and complex models in data-poor situations runs directly counter to the advice given to NMFS by expert scientific review panels concerned with salmon recovery.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">AR 00101045-6 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">NMFS contends that the IOS 'model was not available in a reliable, appropriate, and usable form at the time the BiOp was developed, and denies that IOS could have been adapted in a reasonable amount of time for use in the BiOp. NMFS knows all experts agree a life cycle model is the best methodology for measuring population effects. The agency continues to dodge seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>ous questions the parties are entitled to have answered by refusing employ existing models. At the same time, NMFS continues to plead poverty by describing this case as a \u201cdata-poor situation.\u201d If the data is so sparse that a workable model cannot be formulated, when does NMFS\u2019s failure to ensure appropriate data collection is taking place constitute bad faith? After more than five years of dispute, future pleas of data poverty will no longer be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">As to the IOS model, although it is a close call, Federal Defendants\u2019 contention that IOS was not available in a reliable form at the time the BiOp issued has not been rebutted. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that NMFS violated the ESA by failing to apply IOS in the BiOp is DENIED; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">b. <em>OBAN.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Plaintiffs further argue that NMFS acted unlawfully by failing to apply the OBAN model in the BiOp. The BiOp mentions OBAN, but does not specifically address it, opting instead to generally explain that because existing life-cycle models only address population abundance, leaving out other aspects of the Viable Salmonid Population (\u201cVSP\u201d) framework (e.g., spatial structure and genetic and life history diversity), the BiOp\u2019s analysis is superior because it encompasses these other factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-7\">An alternative approach recommended by the CALFED Science Review Panel for estimating an ASR for the Central Valley includes the use of computer models. In particular, the IOS model (Cavallo et al.2008) and the Oncorhynchus Bayesian Analysis (OBAN) model (Hendrix 2008) were referenced as potentially useful tools. IOS is a detailed mechanistic model that describes the entire life cycle of both winter-run and spring-run in the Sacramento River, while the OBAN model is a Bayesian statistical model for winter-run in the Sacramento River. Although the CALFED Science Review Panel identified these models as potentially viable options either in combination or independently, it acknowledged the necessary refinement and implementation of this type of model by NMFS for the Opinion may not have been practical because of time constraints and the need for additional modeling expertise. Further development of mortality rates at different life stages specific to the Central Valley could be incorporated into the model to reduce the amount of assumptions currently required, and lead to more realistic and informative results. However, as previously mentioned, this type of information will not be available in the near term. Moreover, in order to sufficiently address the issue of fish routing through the Delta, identified as a critical component by the CALFED Science Review Panel, additional data collection and modeling over the long term (i.e., beyond the timeline allowed for the development of this Opinion) would be required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-9\">As discussed above, this Opinion equates a listed species\u2019 probability or risk of extinction with the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of the species, and uses \u201clikelihood of viability\u201d as a standard to bridge between the VSP framework (McElhany et al.2000) and the jeopardy standard. Assessing the viability of salmonid populations requires the consideration of other parameters in addition to population abundance, including productivity (i.e., population growth rate), spatial structure, and genetic and life-history diversity (McElhany et al.2000). All four VSP parameters are deemed important in evaluating a population\u2019s ability to persist, especially when faced with cata<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>strophic disturbances (Lindley et al.2007). Although the life cycle modeling approaches discussed above have the potential to provide information on all VSP parameters at some point in the future, it would require substantial data collection and model refinement. Any present attempt to complete such an exercise would only address one of those parameters (i.e., abundance), and any results would include making many assumptions. Therefore, although a method for evaluating impacts during a specific life stage in terms of the overall loss in numbers of fish would be useful, there are other potential consequences resulting from project operations that need to be considered. For example, are mortalities at different life stages, or the loss of historical habitats, likely to have effects on the other VSP parameters? The analyses within this Opinion, in an attempt to encompass this broader range of effects, focused on determining whether or not appreciable reductions were expected from the proposed action, rather than trying to quantify the absolute magnitude of those reductions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Id. at 67-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">NMFS staff from the Seattle office collaborated with Dr. Nobel Hendrix, the author of the OBAN model, during the model\u2019s development.

Such an analysis can be done in a matter of hours, and NMFS has dozens of scientists at the Science Centers who could have done this analysis. I find no explanation in the BiOp or the administrative record why such an analysis was not performed.

Dr. Hilborn suggests that NMFS should have performed a statistical regression analysis to identify whether or not various environmental factors were related to, for example, the cohort replacement rate. Hilborn Reply Decl. \u00b6 7, \u00b6 30. While it\u2019s true that building a multiple regression model can be relatively simple and straightforward using available programs such as Excel, it is also true that many data are not suited for analysis with a straightforward multiple regression model. For example, Newman and Rice (2002, NMFS 127363-73) note that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-4\">\u201cThe work of Kjelson et al. (1989) was closely scrutinized by numerous interested parties, and their methodology was criticized on a number of grounds. The assumptions and methods for estimating the indices, the application of standard linear regression to dependent variables ranging between 0 and 1, and the selection of covariates were major criticisms. In light of these criticisms, the interested parties chose to bring in statisticians previously unaffiliated with this work (namely, the authors) in an attempt to develop an alternative approach for modeling the release-recovery data. This article describes the resulting model.

Indicative of the sophistication of the Newman and Rice (2002) analysis is the fact that it was published not in a fisheries or ecological journal, but rather in the Journal of the American Statistical Association.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-6\">24. Further warning of the potential pitfalls of using a \u201cbasic procedure\u201d comes from p. 285 of Hilborn and Walters (1992), on the page immediately following the excerpt quoted by Dr. Hilborn, Hilborn Reply Decl. \u00b6 7. After providing general equations for including multiple environmental terms in the Ricker and Beverton-Holt models, Hilborn and Walters (1992) ask \u201cWhy is this dangerous?\u201d and proceed to say that \u201cas tempting as it is to add environmental variables to stock-recruitment data, this is a potentially dangerous practice.\u201d On the same page, an explicit \u201cwarning\u201d message reads \u201cBe very, very cautious in fitting environmental variables, as it is almost impossible to make sure the apparent correlation is not spurious.\u201d (see Exhibit 1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-8\">25. The devil is in the details, of course. I do not disagree with Dr. Hilborn\u2019s view that a basic regression analysis, possibly including an assessment of environmental terms in a standard stock-recruitment relationship, can be useful in many situations. However, in the specific case of evaluating the effects of CVP/SWP operations on cohort replacement rates of ESA-listed fish in California\u2019s Central Valley, I note that the \u201cbasic procedure\u201d he suggests grows rather quickly either into a more complicated procedure, or into a \u201cbasic procedure\u201d that relies on a set of assumptions that make interpretation and. application of the analysis result more complicated. Consider, for example, a simple regression of cohort replacement rate (CRR) for winter-run Chinook salmon, against a single environmental factor. Below, I discuss several issues that would either complicate the analysis, or require simplifying assumptions: the interaction of age structure with the environmental variable of interest, and the selection of specific environmental measures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-9\">26. First, how would the age structure of the spawning population in a given year be handled? One could, as did NMFS in the CRR summary provided in the status section for winter-run Chi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>nook salmon (BiOp at 83), assume that the spawning population was composed entirely of three year olds. Using this assumption, the CRR is calculated as the spawning population at time t divided by the spawning population at t-3. While this assumption keeps the life-history model simple, it introduces an inaccuracy into the estimate of cohort replacement rate (unless one makes yet additional assumptions), since the 2- and 4-year olds in the spawning population at time t have actually been produced by spawners at time t-2 and t-4, respectively. The assessment of potential environmental influences on CRR can also be affected by this assumption of no age structure in the spawning population, depending on the environmental factor being considered. For example, an assessment of attraction flows in year t (the year of return) as a factor affecting CRR would still be very appropriate, since all returning fish, regardless of age, would have experienced the flows observed in year t. In contrast, an assessment of OMR flows (or Sacramento River flow, or exports) during the juvenile outmigration period in year t-3 (the brood year) as a factor affecting CRR would be less appropriate, since the 2- and 4-year olds would not have experienced those OMR flows (or Sacramento River flow, or exports). Even if 3-year olds do make up the majority of spawners in a given year, 2- and 4-year old fish may well introduce sufficient mismatch into the model as to mask any environmental effect. Adjusting the model to allow appropriate matching of environmental factor with each age class of spawner leads down a yet more complicated analysis path.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-5\">27. Second, what measure would one use to assess \u201csimple\u201d effects like exports or OMR? Looking at row 16e of the stressor table for winter-run Chinook salmon (Table 9-1, BiOp at 452-460), one might choose to assess the impacts of OMR flows during the juvenile emigration period on CRR. Row 16e notes that OMR flows are a potential stressor in the Delta for juvenile winter-run Chinook salmon from November through May, so that\u2019s one possible averaging period, though clearly winter-run are more prevalent in the Delta in some months within that period than in others. Dr. Deriso, in his basic analysis of winter-run population growth rate against OMR flows, used the average OMR flow from December through March. Mechanistically, the impacts of OMR are likely to occur on the scale of days to weeks \u2014 it is not clear how to capture the effects of OMR variability at this temporal resolution in a model that (unless it is made more complex) calls for an environmental time series with a single value per year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-7\">28. As described in the previous paragraph, a single, \u201csimple\u201d effect could be modeled in many ways. If one wants to consider additional effects (e.g., temperature during the spawning period, exports), each of which also can be modeled in various ways (and for factors such as temperatures, may have watershed-specific values), the possible list of environmental time series grows large very quickly. With this abundance of possible environmental effects, one needs to be very cautious about the risks of overfitting the model (which is an increasing risk as one includes more and more environmental factors into a single regression analysis) or the risks of increasing the Type 1 error rate by performing a large number of simple, single-factor comparisons. While there are various stepwise model-fitting procedures and multiple comparison procedures available to address these two issues, respectively, I note yet again that even the seemingly simple analysis pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>posed by Dr. Hilborn requires a not insignificant set of assumptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-4\">29. NMFS did perform some basic analyses in evaluating effects of the projects, (e.g. for estimating reasonable OMR targets to manage entrainment), and has been roundly criticized by other plaintiffs\u2019 experts (e.g., Dr. Burnham, Dr. Deriso) for the statistical imperfections of those analyses. On the whole, NMFS used a mix of quantitative and qualitative analyses, including analyses provided in the BA and selected scientific literature, in order to come up with its assessment of project effects and the suite of actions necessary to avoid jeopardy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Third Yip Decl., Doc. 518. The application of these \u201csimple\u201d models is not as straightforward as Plaintiffs claim. The law relegates their use and application to the discretion of the agency unless clearly erroneous. Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that NMFS\u2019s use or non-use of these models is more than scientific dispute, which is resolved in favor of the agency. A court cannot lawfully second-guess the agency, unless clear scientific error or bad faith is so manifest that the agency\u2019s judgments can no longer be trusted.

The Peer Review Panel addressed this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-9\"><em>The preparation of the RPAs shifts the questions from jeopardy/no-jeopardy to questions like: Will proposed export and other modifications in the Delta provide the expected benefit for targeted species? </em>Will water withdrawals through a new pumping facility at Red Bluff impose new mortality on downstream migrants that largely offsets the reduced mortality from lifting the dam gates at RBDD? Will remedial actions be effective or will they become expensive projects that show little improvement in species status? How will specific RPAs affect other listed species (e.g., delta smelt) and unlisted species (e.g., fall-run Chinook salmon)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-10\">Tier 1 comments, especially related to defining baseline and lack of quantitative integrative tools, become even more important in addressing these and similar RPA related questions. The long-term solution to this challenge is targeted research on the critical issues; careful monitoring of responses to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>plemented actions; and further development of models for generating baseline conditions, downscaling temporally and spatially coarse outputs, and simulating life cycle dynamics. The modeling and monitoring before and after implementation of actions is needed to highlight or test key uncertainties and to increase our understanding of the system in order to facilitate improved management in the future. <em>We believe that lack of quantitative integrative tools luill hinder the development of RPAs because NMFS cannot presently quantify the relative contributions of the different project effects to population status nor can NMFS quantitatively determine the potential benefits of specific remedial actions to population recovery.

Doc. 431 at 55-58. This is based in part on the Science Panel\u2019s recommendation that NMFS model a baseline that represents a \u201chypothetical situation in which physical project infrastructure exists, but no project operations are performed except those mandated by prior agreements or those that are not part of the proposed actions.\u201d AR 00108175. The Panel offered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-8\">For example, the decline of stream habitat because the dams block gravel recruitment from upstream would be part of baseline, <em>as would providing water to fulfill senior water rights agreements. </em>Modeling in the Delta seemed to use recent conditions rather than an estimate of baseline conditions (i.e., recent conditions minus effects of project-related actions). This definition of baseline was described in words (although too succinctly, in the opinion of the Panel) in the draft BO but never quantified with model results. This can be a serious omission because without a proper baseline, one struggles to make straightforward comparisons of scenarios that differ only by whether proposed project operations are included or not. Much of the draft BO involves comparing results of various simulations, but we had difficulty interpreting results without direct comparisons of the correct baseline to the correct baseline with project operations ....

Implicit in both these definitions is a need to anticipate future effects, including the future component of the environmental baseline. Future effects of Federal projects that have undergone consultation and of contemporaneous State and private actions, as well as future changes due to natural processes, are part of the future baseline, to which effects of the proposed project are added.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-8\"><em>In constellations on continuing actions such as CVP/SWP operations, it is quite difficult to separate future baseline effects from the anticipated effects of the proposed action. </em>Operations of existing structures, such as dams and gates, for water supply, flood control, and other purposes \u2014 the proposed action \u2014 are integrally related to the existence of the structures themselves, but effects of the mere existence of the structures are not effects of the proposed action. See <em>National Wildlife Federation v. National Marine Fisheries Service, </em>524 F.3d 917, 930-31 (9th Cir.2008).

Consequently, it is not surprising that in its review of NMFS\u2019 December 11, 2008, draft OCAP Opinion, the CALFED Science Review Panel (Anderson et al.2009) commented that a clearly defined baseline was lacking. Reclamation' (2009) provided similar comments. NMFS acknowledges that it was not easy to discern a uniform approach to characterizing the environmental baseline in the draft Opinion. <em>NMFS believes, however, that this is due to the nature of the action under consultation and available information, rather than a flawed approach to the analysis. </em>NMFS clarifies its approach here and in relevant sections of the Opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-10\">In National Wildlife Federation, a case regarding consultation on the effects of operating hydropower dams on the Columbia River, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected NMFS\u2019 attempt to narrow the \u201ceffects of the action\u201d by defining the baseline to include operations that NMFS deemed to be \u201cnondiscretionary.\u201d <em>The Court observed that many of the actions NMFS deemed \u201cnondiscretionary\u201d actually were subject to the action agencies\u2019 discretion, and it held that it was impermissible to create an imaginary \u201creference operation\u201d excluding these actions, to which the effects of the action could be compared.

For example, table 2-1 in the CVP/SWP operations BA identifies the major proposed operational actions for consultation, including implementation of the water quality control plan (WQCP), but it is not clear whether implementing the WQCP, or some portion of it, is a non-discretionary action.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-6\"><em>Consequently, we determined that if NMFS were to propose a \u201cno project operations\u201d scenario to characterize the environmental baseline, it would be speculative and not supported by the model runs. </em>Following the 9th Circuit\u2019s reasoning, with limited exceptions, NMFS assumed that all CVP and SWP operations are subject to the discretion of the project agencies and, thus, that all effects of future operations are effects of the proposed action. The only project effects considered to be within the future baseline (and thus not effects of the proposed action) are those caused by activities that are clearly outside the agencies\u2019 authority. For example, as in National Wildlife Federation, it is not within the agencies\u2019 discretion to remove dams, so the effects of their existence are part of the baseline.

Indeed, NMFS\u2019s interpretation is neither mandated nor intimated by the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Home Builders. </em>The Court\u2019s concern in <em>Home Builders </em>was that \u201c[a]n agency cannot simultaneously obey the differing mandates set forth in \u00a7 7(a)(2) of the ESA and \u00a7 402(b) of the CWA.\u201d 127 S.Ct. at 2534. In this context, compliance with the CWA provision is problematic because the provision \u201caffirmatively mandates that [a specific action which conflicts with the ESA] \u2018shall\u2019 be [taken] if the specified criteria are met. The provision operates as a ceiling as well as a floor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2533. Here, in contrast, Congress has imposed broad mandates which do not direct agencies to perform any specific nondiscretionary actions, but rather, are better characterized as directing the agencies to achieve particular goals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-9\">The 2004 BiOp itself recognizes that Congress has not quantified any of those broad goals, or otherwise specified the manner in which the agencies must fulfill them. NMFS found, for instance, that Congress has mandated that dam operations include flood control, though \u201cCongress has not prescribed precisely how the Corps must achieve its flood control responsibilities.\u201d 2004 BiOp at 5-5. Similarly, Congress has mandated that the BPA market and transmit \u201csome level of power, although the precise level is not defined.\u201d Id. Thus, the 2004 BiOp recognizes that Congress has not specified the manner in which the agencies must fulfill their various obligations. In other words, while the goals themselves may be mandatory, the agencies retain considerable discretion in choosing what specific actions to take in order to implement them. The agencies are therefore obligated to satisfy the ESA\u2019s requirements. See <em>Pac. Coast Fed\u2019n, </em>426 F.3d at 1084-85 (\u201cThe ESA obligates federal agencies \u2018to afford first priority to the declared national policy of saving endangered species.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>TVA v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 185, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978)).[FN8] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>FN8. Moreover, at least some of the competing statutory mandates clearly acknowledge that implementing agencies must accommodate wildlife needs. See Northwest Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 839 (providing for purposes of 1980 Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act \u201cto be construed in a manner consistent with applicable environmental laws\u201d); <em>ALCOA </em>175 F.3d at 1163 (\u201cThe Northwest Power Act\u2019s goal of providing economical power, however, does not supplant the BPS\u2019s obligation to comply with environmental mandates.\u201d); <em>Confederated Tribes &amp; Bands of the Yakima Indian Nation v. FERC, </em>746 F.2d 466, 473 (9th Cir.1984) (finding Northwest Power Act places \u201cfish and wildlife concerns on an equal footing with power production\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-4\">NMFS may not avoid determining the limits of the action agencies\u2019 discretion by using a reference operation to sweep so-called \u201cnondiscretionary\u201d operations into the environmental baseline, thereby excluding them from the requisite ESA jeopardy analysis. And <em>Home Builders </em>cannot be read, as the State of Idaho would have us do, to immunize discretionary agency actions simply because they are taken in pursuit of a non-discretionary goal. The concern that an agency cannot \u201csimultaneously obey\u201d with both the ESA and the broad mandates relevant to this case is simply not at issue here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-5\">ESA compliance is not optional. \u201c[A]n agency cannot escape its obligation to comply with the ESA merely because it is bound to comply with another statute that has consistent, complementary objectives.\u201d <em>Washington Toxics Coal. v. EPA, </em>413 F.3d 1024, 1032 (9th Cir.2005). As the Court emphasized in <em>Home Builders, </em>\u201cESA\u2019s no-jeopardy mandate applies to every discretionary agency action-regardless of the expense or burden its application might impose.\u201d 127 S.Ct. at 2537. When an agency, acting in furtherance of a broad Congressional mandate, chooses a course of action which is not specifically mandated by Congress and which is not specifically necessitated by the broad mandate, that action is, by definition, discretionary and is thus subject to Section 7 consultation. Because NMFS\u2019s approach in the 2004 BiOp produces the opposite result, it is inconsistent with the ESA and its accompanying regulations, and cannot stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 928-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\"><em>NWF v.

Practically speaking, in all but the most obvious of situations or for obligations that have previously been determined to be \u201cmandatory,\u201d it is not feasible for the action agency to finely parse the legal determinations required to distinguish discretionary aspects of the action from non-discretionary ones in the prepa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>ration of a biological opinion, especially in a system as complex as the joint Project operations. This is reflected in the 2009 Salmonid BiOp\u2019s explanation that NMFS could not reliably propose a \u201cno project operations\u201d scenario to characterize the environmental baseline.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 ultimate argument is that if non-discretionary project operations are backed out of the \u201ceffects of the action\u201d and instead are included in the \u201cbaseline\u201d the effects of the action will no longer be \u201cappreciable.\u201d This identical argument was explicitly rejected by <em>NWF v. NMFS II's </em>holding that comparison of the effects of the action against a hypothetical \u201creference operation\u201d is not appropriate because the jeopardy analysis must focus on \u201cwhether the action[\u2019s] effects, when added to the underlying baseline conditions, would tip the species into jeopardy.\u201d 524 F.3d at 930.

Nor does it have the effect of preventing any federal action once background conditions place a species in jeopardy. To \u201cjeopardize\u201dthe action ESA prohibits-means to \u201cexpose to loss or injury\u201d or to \u201cimperil.\u201d Either of these implies causation, and thus some new risk of harm. Likewise, the suffix \u201c-ize\u201d in \u201cjeopardize\u201d indicates some active change of status: an agency may not \u201ccause [a species] to be or to become\u201d in a state of jeopardy or \u201csubject [a species] to\u201d jeopardy. American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed.).

An agency may still take action that removes a species from jeopardy entirely, or that lessens the degree of jeopardy. However, <em>an agency may not take action that will tip a species from a state of precarious survival into a state of likely extinction. Likewise, even where baseline conditions already jeopardize a species, an agency may not take action that deepens the jeopardy by causing additional harm.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-10\">Our approach does not require NMFS to include the entire environmental baseline in the \u201cagency action\u201d subject to review.[FN9] It simply requires that NMFS appropriately consider the effects of its actions \u201cwithin the context of other existing human activities that impact the listed species.\u201d <em>ALCOA, </em>175 F.3d at 1162 n. 6 (citing 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02\u2019s definition of the environmental baseline).

Recent evidence suggests that marine survival among salmonids fluctuates in response to 20- to 30-year cycles of climatic conditions and ocean productivity (Hare et al.1999, Mantua and Hare 2002). <em>This phenomenon has been referred to as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. </em>In addition, large-scale climatic regime shifts, such as the El Ni\u00f1o condition, appear to change productivity levels over large expanses of the Pacific Ocean. A further confounding effect is the fluctuation between drought and wet conditions in the basins of the American west. During the first part of the 1990s, much of the Pacific Coast was subject to a series of very dry years, which reduced inflows to watersheds up and down the west coast. \u201cEl Ni\u00f1o\u201d is an environmental condition often cited as a cause for the decline of West Coast salmonids (NMFS 1996b). El Ni\u00f1o is an unusual warming of the Pacific Ocean off South America and is caused by atmospheric changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean [El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) ] resulting in reductions or reversals of the normal trade wind circulation patterns. El Ni\u00f1o ocean conditions are characterized by anomalous warm sea surface temperatures and changes to coastal currents and upwelling patterns. Principal ecosystem alterations include decreased primary and secondary productivity in affected regions and changes in prey and predator species distributions. Cold-water species are displaced towards higher latitudes or move into deeper, cooler water, and their habitat niches are occupied by species tolerant of warmer water that move upwards from the lower latitudes with the warm water tongue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-7\"><em>A key factor affecting many West Coast stocks has been a general 30-year decline in ocean productivity. </em>The mechanism whereby stocks are affected is not well understood, partially because the pattern of response to these changing ocean conditions has differed among stocks, presumably due to differences in their ocean timing and distribution. It is presumed that survival in the ocean is driven largely by events occurring between ocean entry and recruitment to a sub-adult life stage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-8\">The freshwater life history traits and habitat requirements of juvenile winter-run and fall-run are similar. Therefore, <em>the unusual and poor ocean conditions that caused the drastic decline in returning fall-run populations coast wide in 2007 (Varanasi and Barloo 2008) are suspected to have also caused the observed decrease in the winter-run spawning population in 2007 (Oppenheim 2008). Lindley et al. (2009) reviewed the possible causes for the decline in Sacramento River fall-run in 2007 and 2008 for which reliable data tuere available. They concluded that a broad body of evidence suggested that anomalous conditions in the coastal ocean in 2005 and 2006 residted in unusually poor survival of the 200i and 2005 broods of fall-run. However, Lindley et al. (2009) recognize that the rapid and likely temporary deterioration in ocean conditions acted on top of a long-term, steady degradation of the freshwater and estuarine environment.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-9\">4.2.4.11.2 Ocean Productivity The time at which juvenile salmonids enter the marine environment marks a critical period in their life history. Studies have shown the greatest rates of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>growth and energy accumulation for Chinook salmon occur during the first 1 to 3 months after they enter the ocean (Francis and Mantua 2003, MacFarlane et al.2008)... .Therefore, the conditions that juvenile salmonids encounter when they enter the ocean can play an important role in their early marine survival and eventual development into adults. It is widely understood that variations in marine survival of salmon correspond with periods of cold and warm ocean conditions, with cold regimes being generally favorable for salmon survival and warm ones unfavorable....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-4\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-5\">The generally warmer ocean conditions in the California Current that began to prevail in late 2002 have resulted in coastal ocean temperatures remaining 1-2\u00b0C above normal through 2005.

(2006) on the NWFSC Climate Change and Ocean Productivity website shows the transition to colder ocean conditions, which began in 2007, has persisted throughout 2008. All ocean indicators point toward a highly favorable marine environment for those juvenile salmon that entered the ocean in 2008.... Therefore, ocean conditions in the broader California Current appear to have been favorable for salmon survival in 2007 and to a greater extent in 2008, which bodes well for Chinook salmon populations returning in 2009 and 2010. <em>These ecosystem indicators can be used to provide an understanding of ocean conditions, and their relative impact on marine survival of juvenile salmon, throughout the broader, northern portion of the California Current. However, they may not provide an accurate assessment of the conditions observed on a more local scale off the California coast.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-8\">Wells et al. (2008a) developed a multivariate environmental index that can be used to assess ocean productivity on a finer scale for the central California region. This index (also referred to as the Wells Ocean Productivity Index) has also tracked the Northern Oscillation Index, which can be used to understand ocean conditions in the North Pacific Ocean in general. The divergence of these two indices in 2005 and 2006 provided evidence that ocean conditions were worse off the California coast than they were in the broader North Pacific region. The Wells et al. (2008a) index incorporates 13 oceanographic variables and indices and has correlated well with the productivity of zooplankton, juvenile shortbelly rockfish, and common murre production along the California coast (MacFarlane et al.2008). In addition to its use as an indicator of ocean productivity in general, the index may also relate to salmon dynamics due to then-heavy reliance on krill and rockfish as prey items during early and later life stages. For instance, not only did the extremely low index values in 2005 and 2006 correlate well with the extremely low productivity of salmon off the central California coast in those years, but the index also appears to have correlated well with maturation and mortality rates of adult salmon from 1990-2006 in that region (Wells and Mohr 2008). Although not all of the data are currently available to determine the Wells et al. (2008a) index values for 2007 and 2008, there is sufficient information to provide an indication of the likely ocean conditions for those 2 years, which can then be compared to 2005 and 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>A review of the available information suggests ocean conditions in 2007 and 2008 have improved substantially over those observed in 2005 and 2006. For instance, the spring transition, which marks the beginning of the upwelling season and typically occurs between March and June, was earlier in 2007 and 2008 compared to 2005 and 2006. An early spring transition is often indicative of greater productivity throughout the spring and summer seasons (Wells and Mohr 2008, Peterson et al.2006). Coastal upwelling, the process by which cool, nutrient rich waters are brought to the surface (perhaps the most important parameter with respect to plankton productivity), was also above average in 2007 and 2008. Moreover, coastal sea surface temperature and sea level height (representative of the strength of the California current and southern transport) values were also characteristic of improved ocean productivity (Wells and Mohr 2008). Thus, contrary to the poor ocean conditions observed in the spring of 2005 and 2006, the Wells et al. (2008a) index parameters available at this time indicate spring ocean conditions have been generally favorable for salmon survival off California in 2007 and 2008. In contrast to the relatively \u201cgood\u201d ocean conditions that occurred in the spring, the Wells et al. (2008a) index values for the summer of 2007 and 2008 were poor in general, and similar to those observed in 2005 and 2006. Summer sea surface temperature followed a similar pattern in both 2007 and 2008, starting out cool in June, and then rising to well above average in July before dropping back down to average in August (Wells and Mohr 2008). The strong upwelling values observed in the spring of 2007 and 2008 were not maintained throughout the summer, and instead dropped to either at or below those observed in 2005 and 2006. Finally, sea level height and spring curl values (a mathematical representation of the vertical component of wind shear which represents the rotation of the vector field), which are negatively correlated with ocean productivity, were both poor (Wells and Mohr 2008). Therefore, during the spring of 2007 and 2008, ocean conditions off California were indicative of a productive marine environment favorable for ocean salmon survival (and much improved over 2005 and 2006). However, those conditions did not persist throughout the year, as Wells et al. (2008a) index values observed in the summer of 2007 and 2008 were similar to those experienced in the summer of 2005 and 2006, 2 years marked by extremely low productivity of salmon off the central California coast. Evidence exists that suggests early marine survival for juvenile salmon is a critical phase in their survival and development into adults. The correlation between various environmental indices that track ocean conditions and salmon productivity in the Pacific Ocean, both on a broad and local scale, provides an indication of the role they play in salmon survival in the ocean. Moreover, when discussing the potential extinctions of salmon populations, Francis and Mantua (2003) point out that climate patterns would not likely be the sole cause but could certainly increase the risk of extinction when combined with other factors, especially in ecosystems under stress from humans. Thus, the efforts to try and gain a greater understanding of the role ocean conditions play in salmon productivity will continue to provide valuable information that can be incorporated into the management of these species and should continue to be pursued. <em>However, the highly variable nature of these environmental factors makes it very difficult, if not impossible, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number><em>to accurately predict what they will be like in the future. Because the potential for poor ocean conditions exists in any given year, and there is no way for salmon managers to control these factors, any deleterious effects endured by salmonids in the freshwater environment can only exacerbate the problem of an inhospitable marine environment. Therefore, in order to ensure viable populations, it is important that any impacts that can be avoided prior to the period when salmonids enter the ocean must be carefully considered and reduced to the greatest extent possible.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVp\">BiOp at 149-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Plaintiffs do not argue that the BiOp <em>entirely </em>failed to consider ocean conditions and/or the PDO.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rather, they argue that NMFS should have evaluated the impact ocean conditions have on salmon populations <em>quantitatively, </em>so that the effect of ocean conditions can be compared to the effects of project operations.

The paper concluded that human manipulation of the freshwater environment likely \u201cplayed a significant role in making this stock susceptible to collapse during periods of unfavorable ocean conditions.\u201d AR 00123551.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">The law does not require a quantitative, comparative fault type analysis. If the species is in decline and one of the causes is Project operations, the agency has discretion to address and mitigate the resulting harm. The extent to which the record affirmatively demonstrates that Project operations cause separate harm is examined below in connection with Plaintiffs\u2019 challenges to the effects analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that NMFS violated the ESA by failing to quantitatively analyze ocean conditions is DENIED; Federal Defendants\u2019 and DefendanNIntervenors\u2019 cross motions are GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">b. <em>Consideration of Ocean Harvest Impacts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">Plaintiffs also argue that NMFS acted unlawfully by failing to quantify the effect of ocean <em>harvest </em>on the Listed Salmonids. Their argument is that: (1) NMFS has sufficient quantitative data to analyze the effects of ocean harvest on the Listed Salmonids because it manages the ocean harvest; (2) that data, if it had been quantitatively analyzed in the BiOp, would have revealed that the losses caused by Project operations are miniscule in comparison to losses caused by ocean harvest. Doc. 431 at 37-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-14\">The ESA requires NMFS to evaluate to what extent the losses are caused by the proposed action, here the operation of the CVP and SWP. The action in question does not include ocean harvest, which in part is the result of separate government activity. NMFS quantitatively evaluated the impacts of ocean harvest on the Listed Species in a separate biological opinion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>The Salmonid BiOp acknowledges that ocean -harvest is a part of the environmental baseline affecting species viability, see BiOp, at 144-46 (discussing ocean commercial and ocean and inland sport harvest as \u201cfactors responsible for the current status\u201d of the Listed Species), but does not quantitatively integrate the impact of ocean harvest into the analysis of Project-related impacts on the species.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">NMFS\u2019s obligation under the ESA is to evaluate how Project operations affect the Listed Species, in light of a depleted population impacted by ocean harvest and other conditions. It is inexplicable that these species are being managed in a piecemeal fashion, without considering all aspects of their life cycle in the same analysis, which would facilitate description of the true effect Project operations have on the species in light of other conditions. What population is available to be affected by Project operations is entirely relevant, as all Defendants have sought to attribute the species\u2019 decline to Project operations. Nonetheless, under <em>NWF v. NMFS, </em>the analytical focus is not on the relative contribution \"of the Projects to the species\u2019 condition, but whether the Projects cause additional, independent harm. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that NMFS acted unlawfully by failing to quantitatively analyze ocean harvest impacts to determine whether, relatively speaking, they overwhelm Project impacts is DENIED; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendanb-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">C. <em>Effects Analysis Challenges.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">1. <em>Use of a 100-Year Timeframe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The BiOp evaluated how the proposed action would impact the species\u2019 risk of extinction over a 100-year time period. BiOp at 51. The BiOp explains that the jeopardy standard has been interpreted in the Joint Consultation Regulations as \u201ca requirement that Federal agencies ensure that their actions are not likely to result in appreciable reductions in the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of the species in the wild by reducing its numbers, reproduction, or distribution.\u201d Id. at 42 (citing 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02). This means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqf\">.... NMFS equates a listed species\u2019 probability (or risk) of extinction with the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of the species in the wild for purposes of conducting jeopardy analyses under section 7(a)(2) of the ESA. In the case of listed salmonids, we use the Viable Salmonid Populations (VSP) framework (McElhany et al.2000) as a bridge to the jeopardy standard. A designation of \u201ca high risk of extinction\u201d or \u201clow likelihood of becoming viable\u201d indicates that the species faces significant risks from internal and external processes that can drive it to extinction. The status assessment considers and diagnoses both the internal and external processes affecting a species\u2019 extinction risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">BiOp at 42. The VSP framework estimates the viability of salmonid populations by defining a viable salmonid population as one that \u201chas a negligible probability of extinction over a 100-year time frame.\u201d Id. at 51. More specifically, the BiOp sets the threshold for jeopardy as the point at which the effects of the action, in the context of the baseline, result in a risk of extinction of greater than five percent over 100 years. The threshold combines two types of information: a probability of extinction expressed as the percentage likelihood of extinction and a timeframe within which that probability may come to pass, expressed in years. NMFS utilizes a NMFS technical memorandum by McElhany et al. (2000), AR 00124576, and a 2007 article by Lindley et al., AR 00123475, as \u201ca bridge to [this] jeopardy standard.\u201d BiOp at 42-43, 51-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>The five percent probability of extinction component of the BiOp\u2019s standard is derived Lindley (2007), which opines: \u201cWe assume a 5% risk of extinction in 100 years is an acceptably low extinction risk for populations (Thompson, 1991).\u201d AR 00123477 (emphasis added). Lindley (2007) describes specific criteria for assessing the risk of extinction, and \u201cassumefs] that a 5% risk of extinction in 100 years is [] acceptably low....\u201d AR 00123477. Lindley (2007) characterizes a risk of extinction of less than five percent within 100 years as \u201clow,\u201d greater than five percent within 100 years as \u201cmoderate,\u201d and greater than 20% within 20 years as \u201chigh.\u201d AR 00123478.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The BiOp appears to derive the 100-year timeframe from McElhany (2000). See BiOp at 51. McElhany (2000) describes a viable salmonid population as \u201can independent population of any Pacific salmonid [] that has a negligible risk of extinction due to threats from demographic variation (random or directional), local environmental variation, and genetic diversity changes (random or directional) over a 100-year time frame.\u201d AR 00124594. Regarding the selection of the 100-year time frame, McElhany (2000) states: \u201cWhile it is ultimately an arbitrary decision, the 100-year time scale was chosen to represent a \u2018long\u2019 time horizon for evaluating extinction risk.\u201d Plaintiffs claim that neither the BiOp nor McElhany provide a reasoned basis for the decision to choose a time frame of 100 years, as opposed to any other, shorter, timeframe. When the Mc-Elhany (2000) sentence is read in context, an explanation is provided for the 100-year time scale emerges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-6\">While it is ultimately an arbitrary decision, the 100-year time scale was chosen to represent a \u201clong\u201d time horizon for evaluating extinction risk. It is necessary to evaluate extinction risk at a long time scale for several reasons. First, many recovery actions (such as habitat restoration) are likely to affect population status over the long term. Second, many genetic processes important to population function (such as the loss of genetic diversity or accumulation of deleterious mutations) occur over decades or centuries and current actions can affect these processes for a long time to come. Third, at least some environmental cycles occur over decadal (or longer) time scales (e.g., oceanic cycles-Beamish and Bouillon 1993, Mantua et al.1997, Hare et al.1999). Thus, in order to evaluate a population\u2019s status it is important to look far enough into the future to be able to accommodate large-scale environmental oscillations and trends.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">AR 00124595. Plaintiffs identify no record evidence suggesting that this explanation is irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">Plaintiffs also argue that the 100-year timeframe is arbitrary in light of the fact that NMFS used a 24-year time frame just a year earlier in the biological opinion for the Federal Columbia River Power System (\u201cFCRPS BiOp\u201d). AR 00130923. The FCRPS BiOp addressed critiques suggesting that it use a 100-year extinction risk period as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-10\">Some suggested that NOAA Fisheries evaluate a 100-year extinction risk time horizon, rather than a 24-year period, or else set standards for both periods. The rationale was that the 24-year extinction risk is lower than the 100-year extinction risk (i.e., it \u201cinflates\u201d survival probability compared to the 100-year time horizon). It has been well-documented that extinction risk increases with longer time horizons, with the probability of extinction \u201capproaching 100% for all species if the period is long enough\u201d (NRC 1995). For example, Oregon\u2019s comments (page 5) include a Figure 2 that shows a low likelihood of extinction over 24 and 48 years and a high likeli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>hood of extinction over 100 years for Upper John Day spring Chinook. This population is not listed under ESA, and is considered by the state of Oregon to be healthy (ODFW 2006a). While NOAA Fisheries is not familiar with the data or assessment methodology used in Oregon\u2019s 100-year extinction risk estimates for this population, their result suggests that even healthy salmon stocks may appear to have a high likelihood of extinction under this assumption. It has been equally well-documented that the precision of the risk estimate decreases with longer time horizons. For example, Fieberg and Ellner (2000) estimated that reliable estimates of extinction risk may only be possible when the number of base period observations is 5-10 times greater than the number of years in the time horizon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-4\">NOAA Fisheries continues to rely primarily on the 24-year time horizon for this analysis because the main purpose of the metric is to inform our judgment regarding the ability of the species to survive while actions to promote recovery are implemented under the Prospective Actions and through other processes. The 24-year period is more than twice that of most of the Prospective Actions and is identical to the short-term period considered in the 2000 FCRPS Biological Opinion (NMFS 2000b). However, NOAA Fisheries did calculate extinction risk over the 100-year time horizon to allow comparison of the 24-year extinction risk results with the 100-year extinction risk results of interest to some parties in the region. The 100-year extinction risk estimates and associated confidence intervals are reported in the Aggregate Analysis Appendix.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">AR 00130937.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">Plaintiffs maintain that these paragraphs' from the FCRPS BiOp demonstrate that NMFS adopted a \u201cprior practice\u201d of using a 24-year extinction period and that NMFS failed to supply a reasoned basis for departing from that prior practice. See <em>River Runners for Wilderness v. Martin, </em>593 F.3d 1064, 1075-76 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cPart of the discretion granted to federal agencies is the freedom to change positions.... [A]n agency\u2019s view of what is in the public interest may change, either with or without a change in circumstances. But an agency changing its course must supply a reasoned analysis.\u201d) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">Plaintiffs suggest there is conflict between these two biological opinions. The FCRPS BiOp utilizes a 24-year timeframe to quantitatively evaluate short-term extinction risk where sufficient data was available to do so. AR 00131546. That was only possible for six of the 13 species covered by that biological opinion. NMFS did not have sufficient data to perform a 24-year analysis for the remaining seven species, so NMFS used a qualitative analysis of the VSP factors that considers a 100-year timeframe. See FCRPS BiOp, Chapter 8.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Plaintiffs have not established that the 2009 Salmonid BiOp is a marked departure from prior and/or contemporaneous practice for the risk of extinction assessment. No evidence shows the shorter time span represents the best available science. This is another dispute that ends by default, with NMFS claiming the absence of data to permit it to engage in its preferred analysis. What has not been explained is whether or not a 100-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>period introduces bias toward an extinction finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Based on limited precedent, the agency\u2019s partial justification, and the lack of any evidence demonstrating the agency\u2019s approach was irrational, the law defers to the agency. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that NMFS acted unlawfully by failing employing a 100-year timeframe is DENIED; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">2. <em>Winter-Run Viability Analysis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Plaintiffs contend that the BiOp\u2019s determination that winter-run are at a \u201chigh risk of extinction\u201d is not based on the best available science because that determination is an unexplained departure from a \u201cnearly contemporaneous classification\u201d to the contrary by Lindley (2007). AR 00123478. In addition, Lindley (2007) incorporates assessments of spatial distribution, as well as genetic and life history diversity. Plaintiffs maintain that Lindley classified the winter-run as \u201clow risk\u201d in 2007 and that the BiOp\u2019s reclassifying the species as being at \u201chigh risk\u201d of extinction is unexplained. Doc. 431 at 64-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">This argument is unconvincing for two reasons. First, Lindley (2007) did not unequivocally classify the winter-run as \u201clow risk.\u201d Lindley (2007) assesses a population\u2019s viability by examining criteria relating to: (1) population size, (2) population growth rate, (3) the occurrence of catastrophic declines, and (4) the degree of hatchery influence. AR 000123478. In Table 1 of Lindley (2007) the thresholds for finding \u201chigh,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d or \u201clow\u201d risk as to each of these four criteria are defined.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-10\">Table 1.

Lindley (2007) also factors in spatial distribution, as well as genetic and life-history diversity as part of an overall assessment of viability. AR 00123481. Applying these additional criteria to winter-run, Lindley (2007) concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-5\">The Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon ESU does not currently satisfy the representation and redundancy rule because it has only one population, and that population spawns outside of the ecoregion where it evolved. For the Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon ESU to satisfy the representation and redundancy rule, at least two populations would need to be reestablished in the basalt-and-porous-lava region. This may require passage past Shasta and Keswick dams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-6\">Obviously, an ESU represented by a single population at moderate risk of extinction is at high risk of extinction over the long run. A single catastrophe could extirpate the entire Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon ESU, if its effects persisted for four or more years. The entire stretch of the Sacramento River used by winter run Chinook salmon is within the zone of influence of Mt. Lassen. Some other possible catastrophes include a prolonged drought that depletes the cold water storage of Lake Shasta or some related failure to manage cold water storage, a spill of toxic materials with effects that persist for four years, or a disease outbreak.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">AR 00123487.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Lindley (2007) advocated that an alternative assessment, population viability analysis (\u201cPVA\u201d), be applied where possible and that the results of the PVA be compared to the \u201csimpler\u201d criteria described in Lindley (2007). The authors opined that, at the time the paper was published, winter run were at a \u201cmoderate extinction risk\u201d according to the PVA. AR 00123486.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Federal Defendants accurately described the Lindley (2007) findings and identified more recent information, including the 2007 population crash, that render Lindley (2007)\u2019s specific conclusions outdated. NMFS first focused on the catastrophe criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-11\">At the time of publication, Lindley et al. (2007) indicated that winter-run satisfies the low-risk criteria for population size, population decline, and catastrophe. However, they also acknowledged that the previous precipitous decline to a few hundred spawners per year in the early 1990s would have qualified it as high risk at that time, and the 1976-77 drought would have qualified as a high-risk catastrophe. In consideration of the almost 7-fold decrease in population in 2007, coupled with the dry water year type in 2007, followed by the critically dry water year type in 2008 (which could be qualified as a high-risk catastrophe) and likely a similar forecast for 2009, NMFS concludes that winter-run are at a high risk of extinction based on population size.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">BiOp at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-13\">Plaintiffs argue that the BiOp\u2019s conclusion that the almost seven-fold decrease in population in 2007, and resulting conclusion that winter run were at \u201chigh risk\u201d of extinction based on population size is without support in the record, because, according to Lindley, even the 2007 population decline does not meet the \u201chigh risk\u201d criteria (see Table 1 above). The population never fell to or below 500 spawners, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>did the 2007 decline meet or exceed the 90% \u201corder of magnitude\u201d decline definition. Cramer Decl., Doc. 448 at \u00b6\u00b6 42, 44.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Federal Defendants do not attempt to refute this criticism, and it appears that the record does not support a high risk finding in light of Lindley (2007)\u2019s definition of a \u201chigh risk\u201d designation based on population.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Plaintiffs also challenge this determination on the ground that Lindley (2000) defines a \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d as an event occurring within the last 10 years that caused \u201can order of magnitude decline within one generation,\u201d which \u201cis created by a 90% decline in population size\u201d over that generation. AR 00123478. Plaintiffs point out, and Federal Defendants do not dispute, that the 2007 population decline of 76% in one generation, while significant, did not meet this standard. Doc. 487 at 46. A 76% decline arguably meets the standard for \u201cmoderate\u201d catastrophe, which is described as one that is \u201csmaller\u201d than a high-risk catastrophe, but \u201cstill [a] significant decline.\u201d NMFS\u2019s conclusion that the three subsequent years of drought caused a \u201chigh-risk\u201d catastrophe is not supported by the record. It is at most a \u201cmoderate-risk\u201d catastrophe.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Federal Defendants point out that in order for a population to be considered viable, it \u201cmust meet all the low-risk thresholds.\u201d Doc. 477-1 (citing BiOp at 84). Whether the drought was a \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d risk catastrophe or whether the population should actually have been classified as \u201clow-risk\u201d based on population size, does not change the fact that the winter-run are \u201cnot viable,\u201d because a classification of \u201cmoderate\u201d is justified as to at least one criteria: catastrophe.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">In addition, the BiOp found that winter-run are at a high-risk of extinction based on spatial structure. BiOp at 86-87. Although \u201cspatial structure\u201d was not one of Lindley (2007)\u2019s primary criteria for population viability, it was considered. AR 00123481, 00123487. Lindley (2007) concluded that the winter-run \u201cdoes not currently satisfy the representation and redundancy rule because it has only one population and that population spawns outside of the ecoregion where it evolved.\u201d AR 00123487. To satisfy this rule at least two populations would need to be re-established. Id. Plaintiffs emphasize that this situation is \u201centirely attributable to baseline conditions (i.e., dams).\u201d Doc. 487 at 48. Lindley acknowledges this, noting that establishment of additional winter-run populations \u201cmay require passage past Shasta and Keswick dams.\u201d AR 00123487. But, this does not render spatial structure irrelevant to the BiOp\u2019s analysis. \u201c[A]n agency may not take action that will tip a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>species from a state of precarious survival into a state of likely extinction. Likewise, even where baseline conditions already jeopardize a species, an agency may not take action that deepens the jeopardy by causing additional harm.\u201d <em>NWF v.

Plaintiffs cite Steven Cram-er\u2019s Reply Declaration to support their argument that the BiOp used the \u201chigh-risk\u201d designation to \u201cjustify its failure to do a careful, scientific analysis of the RPA because immediate radical action supposedly is necessary.\u201d Doc. 487 at 44 (citing Cramer Reply Deck, Doc. 487 at \u00b6\u00b6 \u201c20-17[sic]\u201d). Cramer opines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-5\">.. .Although \u201chigh-risk\u201d of extinction is not a necessary criteria for determination of jeopardy, NMFS uses the \u201chigh risk\u201d rating that stems from its misapplication of Lindley et ah (2007) to indicate that immediate additional constraints on water operations are needed to avoid extinction. In other words, from its initial, scientifically incorrect premise, NMFS implies that substantial new restrictions are necessary because the population is supposedly at high risk of extinction, so any careful analysis of the RPAs is inconsequential compared to a claimed urgent need to take radical action.

And yet, NMFS relied instead on an earlier quantitative analysis, produced February 4, 2009, which it never updated or revised to reflect the new state of the agency\u2019s own science represented by the Orea BiOp. (BiOp, App. 3, AR 00107119-136.) The earlier study contained in Appendix 3 did not include any of the analysis of Southern Resident metabolic needs, location, or seasonal migration \u2014 all of which were described as \u201cnecessary\u201d in the NMFS Orea BiOp study issued a full month before the final publication of the Salmonid BiOp. In fact, Appendix 3 of the BiOp does not even mention the Orea BiOp, despite its obvious relevance and its status as the best available science on the effect of the take of adult salmon on Southern Residents. This, on its own, was a failure to use the best available science in violation of the ESA. What Appendix 3 did instead was to quantitatively analyze the effect of the projects on adult salmon abundance under the various Reclamation Study scenarios. It compared these analyses with a scenario representing salmon production without the water projects (\u201cNo Project\u201d), which it defined as the highest salmon production year on record. (BiOp, App. 3 at 1, AR 00107119.).... What does this study show? It shows that in the worst case scenario-which is a comparison of the best possible outcome and the worst possible outcome\u2014 the reduction in total number of adults would be 13.9% (see highlighted figures above).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-7\">It is useful to look at this very worst case scenario in terms of numbers: the total projected population reduction caused by that 13.9% reduction is 120,-945 adult salmon. To put that in perspective, that hypothetical worst case scenario is smaller than the actual reported total loss in the lowest ocean harvest on record (161,845 adult salmon). RJN, Ex. 2, Ocean Harvest BiOp at 31. Looking at the average projected reduction in Study 7.1 and Study 8.0 (the column labeled \u201cMean\u201d) compared with the \u201cNo Project\u201d scenario, the result of the projects is a much more modest take of about 20,150 fish, which is eight times less than the lowest salmon ocean harvest ever recorded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Doc. 431 at 35-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">Federal Defendants maintain that the two biological opinions are not inconsistent because they address impacts over different time frames and from different actions. The Orea Salmon Harvest BiOp describes short-term impacts to prey availability in specific months during high abundance Chinook years. The 2009 Salmonid BiOp considered impacts to Southern Residents caused by long-term increase in the risk of extinction for winter-run and spring-run Chinook, in addition to long-term impacts to fall-run. BiOp at 573. The Orea Salmon Harvest BiOp concluded the long-term impact of ocean harvest is not likely to appreciably reduce the survival and recovery of the listed Chinook and other salmon affected by harvest, in part because the fishery is managed to adjust harvest levels annually according to the actual salmon population available for harvest, thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>avoiding harm to the species. AR 00131776-81. The 2009 Salmonid BiOp concluded that Project operations <em>would </em>increase the risk of extinction of winter-run and spring-run, which \u201cincreases the risk of a permanent reduction in prey available to Southern Residents, and increases the likelihood for local depletions of prey in particular locations and times.\u201d Id. at 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Although these biological opinions facially consider different time frames and different actions, it is undeniable that they are temporally and factually interrelated. The Salmonid BiOp specifically concludes that Project operations will reduce the abundance of naturally produced CV fall run Chinook salmon, a source of prey to the Southern Residents. BiOp at 574. As a result, the Salmonid BiOp concludes \u201cSouthern Residents would likely experience nutritional, reproductive, or other health effects from reduced prey as a result of the proposed action.\u201d Id. In contrast, the Orea Salmon Harvest BiOp concludes that, even in the long run, implementation of the Pacific Coast Salmon Plan will <em>not </em>have long-term deleterious effects on Chinook salmon. AR 00131776-77. It is true that the Pacific Coast Salmon Plan is designed to manage commercial and recreational salmon harvest to meet salmon recovery goals and requires conservation measures, including suspension of all harvest if necessary, when Chinook stocks are doing poorly. AR 00131777. This amounts to a \u201cdo no harm\u201d approach to managing the fishery. However, under such a management approach, it is plausible that any impact to fall-run Chinook, and any related impact to orea, caused by Project operations could be automatically mitigated by reduced harvest in the ocean. How these two sets of human actions (Project operations and harvest restrictions) interplay, and how this interplay might impact the likelihood that Project operations would harm the Southern Residents, is not discussed in the Salmonid BiOp, which postdates the Orea Salmon Harvest BiOp, albeit by only one month. NMFS\u2019s own findings in the Orea Salmon Harvest BiOp are certainly \u201crelevant factors\u201d NMFS should have taken into consideration before issuing the Salmonid BiOp. Federal Defendants, through counsel, provide a partial, but insufficient, post hoc explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that the Orea jeopardy analysis is unlawful is GRANTED; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are DENIED. On remand, NMFS must explain how the findings of these two biological opinions can be reconciled.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">4. <em>Interior Delta Mortality as an Indirect Effect.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">Plaintiffs assert that the BiOp unlawfully classifies mortality from predators, pollution, and other adverse conditions in the interior delta, as \u201cindirect effects\u201d caused by Project operations. Doc. 431 at 66-72.</p>\n<p id=\"ARB\">a. <em>Applicable Legal Standard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">The Joint Consultation Regulations promulgated by FWS and NMFS explain that \u201ceffects of the action\u201d refers to \u201cthe direct and indirect effects of an action on the species or critical habitat... that will be added to the environmental baseline.... \u201d 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02. \u201cIndirect effects are those that are caused by the proposed action and are later in time, but still are <em>reasonably certain to occur.\" </em>Id.

The ESA\u2019s definition differs from NEPA\u2019s definition of indirect effects of an action: \u201c[ijndirect effects, which are caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in distance, but are still <em>reasonably foreseeable.\u201d </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (emphasis added). In the preamble of the Final Rule adopting the ESA regulations, NMFS and FWS explained that it intended a narrower regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>tory definition of indirect effects under the ESA than applied in the NEPA context (i.e., compare \u201creasonably certain to occur\u201d with \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d). 51 Fed. Reg. 19,926 (June 3, 1986). NMFS and FWS distinguished the ESA from NEPA and expressly explained the intent and rationale for adopting the more narrow \u201creasonably certain to occur\u201d standard for indirect and cumulative effects under the ESA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-5\">If the jeopardy standard is exceeded, the proposed Federal action cannot proceed without an exemption. This is a substantive prohibition that applies to the Federal action involved in consultation. In contrast, NEPA is procedural in nature, rather than substantive, which would warrant a more expanded review of cumulative effects. Otherwise, in a particular situation, the jeopardy prohibition could operate to block \u201cnonjeopardy\u201d actions because future, speculative effects occurring after the Federal action is over might, on a cumulative basis, jeopardize a listed species. Congress did not intend that Federal actions be precluded by such speculative actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-c\">51 Fed.Reg. at 19,933.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Shortly after adoption of the ESA regulations, the Ninth Circuit confirmed \u201c \u2018[t]he reasonably certain to occur\u2019 standard applies to \u2018indirect effects ... caused by the proposed action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sierra Club v. Marsh, </em>816 F.2d 1376, 1388 (9th Cir.1987); <em>Ctr. for Biological Diversity v.

Salazar, </em>760 F.Supp.2d at 946-47. Here, NMFS resists such a finding, arguing that Plaintiffs (and by implication the December 14, 2010 MSJ Decision in the <em>Consolidated Delta Smelt </em>Cases) confuse the BiOp\u2019s discussion of \u201cindirect mortality\u201d with the regulatory term \u201cindirect effect.\u201d Doc. 477-1 at 55. Federal Defendants argue that the \u201creasonably certain to occur\u201d standard does not refer to the certainty of the effect on the species, but rather to the certainty of whether a <em>future activity </em>(i.e. the activity that may have an effect on the species) will occur. The federal register notice promulgating the relevant regulations explains that NMFS considers \u201ceffects to listed species from such <em>future activities that are reasonably certain to occur </em>under the analysis of \u2018indirect effects.\u2019\u201d 51 Fed.Reg. 19,926, 19,932 (June 3, 1986)(emphasis added). Indirect effects are further defined as \u201cthose that are caused by the action <em>and are later in time </em>but are still reasonably certain to occur.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Federal Defendants point out that the kinds of \u201cindirect mortality\u201d discussed in the BiOp are not \u201cfuture activities.\u201d Rather, they are a category of effects that are purportedly occurring all the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Plaintiffs rejoin by citing a single sentence from the Final ESA Section 7 Consultation Handbook, jointly prepared by FWS and NMFS, which explains that \u201c[ijndirect effects may <em>include </em>other Federal actions that have not undergone section 7 consultation but will result from the action under consideration.\u201d AR 00217743 (\u201cConsultation Handbook\u201d) at 4-29 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Plaintiffs argue that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>use of the word \u201cinclude\u201d suggests \u201cthat NMFS considers effects from future activities to be only a subset of possible indirect effects, and that indirect effects are not limited to future activities.\u201d Doc. 487 at 57. Plaintiffs do not mention the very next sentence of the Consultation Handbook. The entire paragraph reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-4\">Indirect effects may include other Federal actions that have not undergone section 7 consultation but will result from the action under consideration. In order to treat these actions as indirect effects in the biological opinion, <em>they must be reasonably certain to occur, as evidenced by appropriations, work plans, permits issued, or budgeting; they follow a pattern of activity undertaken by the agency in the action area; or they are a logical extension of the proposed action.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Id. (emphasis added). Here, the indirect mortality findings challenged by Plaintiffs do not constitute \u201cindirect effects.\u201d The indirect mortality discussed in the BiOp is caused by the action subject to consultation, not by some other action that is the subject of work plans, permits, or budgeting. The emphasized language specifies actions \u201creasonably certain to occur,\u201d not those that have occurred. This suggests but does not explicitly reference actions other than the action under consultation.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">The \u201creasonably certain to occur\u201d standard does not apply to the indirect mortality analysis in the BiOp.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, this does not immunize the indirect mortality findings from review. \u201cJeopardize\u201d means to \u201cengage in an action that reasonably would be expected, directly or indirectly, to reduce appreciably the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of a listed species in the wild but reducing the reproduction, numbers and distribution of that species.\u201d 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02. The BiOp finds project operations cause indirect mortality. Whether such findings are reasonable must be addressed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">a. <em>Does the Record Support a Finding that Project Operations Can Reasonably Be Expected to Cause More Salmonids to Enter the Interior Delta?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">Plaintiffs concede that the mortality rate of migrating salmonids is generally higher for fish traveling through the interior Delta than for fish that remain in the main-stem Sacramento River. Doc. 431 at 68. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>Plaintiffs argue, however, that the record does not support the BiOp\u2019s conclusion that project operations cause more salmon-ids to take the more dangerous routes through the interior Delta. Id. at 67-70. Plaintiffs fault the BiOp for not providing any \u201canalysis or articulation whatsoever of [what] additional fraction of emigrating salmonids \u2014 above the baseline number that will enter the Delta irrespective of the projects \u2014 will be induced to enter the interior Delta solely as a result of proposed project operations.\u201d Doc. 431 at 68. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the arguments made by DWR in its challenge to Action IV.2.1. Id. at 69-70. As Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge turns on the merits of DWR\u2019s challenge, which is thoroughly discussed below in the context of Action IV.2.1, there is no need to separately discuss them here,</p>\n<p id=\"AVe\">b. <em>Does the Record Support a Finding that Project Operations Can Reasonably Be Expected to Cause Indirect Mortality from Exotic Species, Pollution, and/or Food Limitations in the Interior Delta?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Plaintiffs also contend that there is no record evidence to support the BiOp\u2019s implied conclusion that project operations cause indirect mortality from exotic species, pollution, and other adverse environmental conditions in the interior Delta. Doc. 431 at 70-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">(1) <em>Exotic Species.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Among other things, the BiOp concludes that Project operations create conditions that favor exotic over native species:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-8\">In addition to the \u201cdirect\u201d effects of the CVP and SWP operations manifested by flows and exports, the modification of the Delta hydraulics for the conveyance of water has altered the suitability of the Delta for native species of fish, such as Chinook salmon, steelhead, and green sturgeon. Since the inception of the CVP and later the SWP, the natural variability in the hydrology of the Delta has been altered. As previously explained, the amount and timing of runoff from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers has been altered and shifted to accommodate human needs. When large-scale exports of water were initiated in the South Delta, it became necessary to \u201cfreshen up\u201d the Delta to guarantee high quality fresh water was available to export from the facilities on a reliable basis (e.g., construction of the DCC). This necessitated an increase in the stability of the Delta\u2019s hydrology and the formation of a large freshwater \u201clake\u201d for the reliable conveyance of water from the river sources to the export facilities. <em>The enhanced stability of the freshwater pool in the Delta enabled non-native species, such as centrarchids and catfish, as well as invasive plants, such as </em>Egeria densa <em>and water hyacinth, to thrive in this \u201cnew\u201d Delta hydrology (Brown and Michniuk 2007). In addition, the altered ecological characteristics of the Delta have been proposed as a contributing factor in the recent Pelagic Organism Decline (POD) observed in the Delta. The combination of these exotic species and altered ecological characteristics of the Delta interact to decrease the suitability of the Delta for native species offish and have increased the potential for predation and loss (see 2008 CVP/SWP operations BA, Delta smelt sections for a more detailed explanation).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">BiOp at 382 (emphasis added). Elsewhere, the BiOp concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-11\">As described earlier in the Delta effects analysis, many of the sources of loss associated with moving fish through the Delta, such as predator populations and the increased prevalence of non-native aquatic weeds such as Egeria densa, have their own interconnections with the operations of the CVP and SWP, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>their continued presence is linked to maintaining an artificially stable Delta environment conducive to moving freshwater towards the pumps.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Id. at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Plaintiffs do not directly contest the conclusion that the altered hydrologic conditions are favorable for invasive species. Nor do Plaintiffs challenge the BiOp\u2019s conclusion that CVP and SWP operations contribute to this ecosystem alteration. Rather, they argue that the operators of the CVP and SWP did not release the exotic predators or introduce the exotic weeds, nor can the operators of the projects control these alien species. Doc. 431 at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">This is not disputed. The BiOp does not assert, as it cannot, that the Projects were the <em>o\u00f1gin\u00e1l </em>cause of these problems. The BiOp concludes that the hydrologic conditions created by the projects favor the continued presence of these exotics and that proposed project operations are likely to make this situation worse. See BiOp at 382 (\u201cContinued operations of the CVP and SWP are unlikely to benefit the health of the Delta, and increases of the facility operations are likely to degrade the system beyond their current conditions, rather than return the Delta to a more natural condition, with more functional hydraulics conducive to a healthy ecosystem.\u201d). The BiOp cites recent studies, including Brown and Michniuk (2007), see BiOp at 382, to support its conclusion that this \u201cnew\u201d Delta hydrology favors exotic species over native ones. Plaintiffs do not challenge the BiOp\u2019s reliance on these studies.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">However, assuming the BiOp properly found a Project-exotics connection, NMFS failed to adequately consider this factor in its jeopardy analysis. What effect do these exotics have on the Listed Species? To what extent does the contribution of the Projects to the continued presence of these exotics contribute to the jeopardy finding? Could altered project operations reduce the presence of exotics? NMFS\u2019s logic taken to the extreme means the Projects cannot operate, as no analysis has been done to evaluate the impact on the Listed Species from this indirect effect at varying pumping levels. It may be that there is insufficient information to answer these questions, but this is pure speculation, as the sufficiency of information is not discussed. This is another example of the need for a realistic analysis of relative effect from Project operations on conditions that are not related to pumping.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">The BiOp\u2019s analysis of the influence of Project operations on the continued presence of exotic species, and how this relates to indirect mortality to the Listed Species, must be explained. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on this issue is GRANTED. Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">(2) <em>Pollution and Food Limitation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">Plaintiffs also argue that the BiOp unlawfully \u201cblames the project for pollution and food limitation by labeling them effects of the action.\u201d Doc. 431 at 72. This is the logical inference drawn from the focus on predators and contaminants, which are mentioned throughout the BiOp. The agency does not explain how the projects influence contaminants or cause food limitations. Plaintiffs point to a statement in the biological assessment that \u201cthere is no direct evidence of food limitation for salmon in the delta or lower estuary,\u201d AR 00143672. It is not clear that the BiOp actually asserts that there is a food limitation in the lower estuary. This imprecision contributes to the inadequacy of the BiOp. There is no way to understand the BiOp\u2019s attribution of adverse indirect effects to the Projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that the record does not support the BiOp\u2019s conclusions about the connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>between Project operations and pollution and food limitation, causing indirect mortality to the Listed Species is GRANTED.

These cases do not support Plaintiffs argument. <em>Gifford Pinchot </em>rejected FWS\u2019s interpretation of \u201cadverse modification\u201d in a manner that only triggered an adverse modification finding where there is \u201can appreciable diminishment of the value of critical habitat for both survival and recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1069. After rejecting FWS\u2019s rationale for applying the regulation, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that the various biological opinions at issue could nevertheless be found valid if they actually evaluated the impact to recovery. The <em>Gifford Pinchot </em>plaintiffs raised concerns about FWS\u2019s complete failure to address the issue of recovery in that biological opinion\u2019s critical habitat analysis. The Appeals Court specifically found that FWS detailed the percentage loss of critical habitat but did not discuss the specific impact of that loss on recovery, rendering the BiOp insufficient. 378 F.3d at 1074.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-11\">Following <em>Gifford Pinchot, NWF v.

NMFS\u2019 argument \u201cthat it \u2018implicitly\u2019 analyzed recovery in its survival analysis\u201d was rejected as a \u201cpost hoc justification,\u201d because a court cannot consider \u201can analysis that is not shown in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 932 n. 10 (internal citations and quotations omitted). Plaintiffs do not directly challenge the BiOp\u2019s recovery analysis; rather, they argue that the BiOp should have set a \u201cthreshold\u201d for adverse modification. Nothing in <em>Gifford Pinchot </em>or <em>NWF v. NMFS II </em>requires FWS to set a \u201cthreshold\u201d for adverse modification. <em>Butte Environmental Council v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, </em>607 F.3d 570, 582-83 (9th Cir.2010), suggests exactly the opposite. Butte upheld FWS\u2019s determination that destruction of a very small percentage (less than 1%) of designated critical habitat would not adversely modify the species\u2019 critical habitat. Relevant here is the Ninth Circuit\u2019s rejection of a demand that FWS address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>the rate of loss of critical habitat, finding that nothing in the statute or regulations requires FWS to perform such a calculation. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-4\"><em>San Luis v.

Plaintiffs maintain that this reads the word \u201cappreciably\u201d out of the regulatory definition of adverse modification. Doc. 431 at 75-76. The record provides a reasoned basis for this statement in the BiOp and demonstrates that NMFS has not read the term \u201cappreciably diminish\u201d out of the definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">In 2005, after <em>Gifford Pinchot </em>invalidated FWS\u2019s application of the regulatory definition in 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02 because FWS had not evaluated whether the amount of habitat anticipated to be lost would impact recovery, NMFS issued a guidance memo on how to conduct \u201cdestruction or adverse modification\u201d determination. See AR 00005204-209. That memo explicitly directs NMFS to identify the current condition of the Primary Constituent Elements (\u201cPCE\u201d)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> of each critical habitat designation before examining how the proposed action will affect the function and conservation role of each PCE. Id. Federal Defendants do not assert that this guidance has invalidated the \u201cappreciably diminishes\u201d aspect of the critical habitat regulation. Doc. 515 at 29. Rather, the guidance memo, which instructs NMFS to \u201cdiscuss the <em>significance </em>of anticipated effects to critical habitat,\u201d is sufficient to implement an \u201cappreciably diminish\u201d standard.

For each species, the BiOp describes the PCEs of that species\u2019 critical habitat, examines the current status of the critical habitat and describes factors responsible for the current status, evaluates the impacts of current and future non-project (i.e., baseline) impacts, and describes the anticipated impacts of proposed project operations on that habitat.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">a. <em>Winter-Run Habitat Analysis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">The evaluation of winter-run critical habitat provides a representative example. There are seven PCEs of Chinook critical habitat: (1) access from the Pacific Ocean to appropriate spawning areas in the Upper Sacramento River; (2) clean gravel for spawning; (3) adequate river flows for spawning, egg incubation, fry emergency, and juvenile downstream migration; (4) appropriate water temperatures for spawning, egg incubation, and fry development; (5) uncontaminated habitat and food sources; (6) riparian habitat for juvenile development and survival; and (7) downstream migration access to the Pacific Ocean. BiOp at 90. The BiOp evaluates the current status of each of these PCEs. Id. at 90-92. In addition, the BiOp contains a lengthy section describing the factors responsible for the current status of the species, many of which also affect the species\u2019 habitat. See id. at 134-142. The BiOp concludes that the current condition of critical habitat is degraded and has low value for the conservation of the species. Id. at 93.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-8\">Critical habitat for winter-run is composed of physical and biological features that are essential for the conservation of winter-run, including up and downstream access, and the availability of certain habitat conditions necessary to meet the biological requirements of the species. Currently, many of these physical and biological features are impaired, and provide limited conservation value. For example, when the gates are in, RBDD reduces the value of the migratory corridor for upstream and downstream migration. Unscreened diversions throughout the mainstem Sacramento River, and the DCC when the gates are open during winter-run outmigration, do not provide a safe migratory corridor to San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-10\">In addition, the annual change in TCP has degraded the conservation value of spawning habitat (based on water temperature). The current condition of riparian habitat for winter-run rearing is degraded by the channelized, leveed, and riprapped river reaches and sloughs that are common in the Sacramento River system. However, some complex, productive habitats with floodplains remain in the system (e.g., Sacramento River reaches with setback levees (i.e., primarily located upstream of the City of Colusa) and flood bypasses (i.e., Yolo and Sutter bypasses)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-11\">\n<em>Based on the impediments caused by RBDD when the gates are in, unscreened diversions, annual changes to the TCP, the time when the DCC gates are open during the winter-run outmigration period, and the degraded condition of spawning habitat and riparian habitat, the current condition of winter-run critical habitat is degraded, and has low value for the conservation of the species.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">Id.

See id. at 273. The BiOp\u2019s section on the \u201cEffects of the Action on Critical Habitat in the Sacramento River\u201d in particular on \u201cSpawning Habitat\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-6\">For winter-run and spring-run, potential spawning habitat is constrained by temperature control to smaller and smaller areas below Keswick Dam. The impacts of operations on cold water have already been described above. However, the changes to the habitat downstream are far more widespread and difficult to detect. The volume of water stored in Shasta reservoir tends to dampen the seasonal variation in water temperatures. This moderation of water temperatures, combined with a loss in spawning habitat above Shasta and Keswick dams, may have profound effects on life history patterns. Warmer water temperatures during the spring-run and CV steelhead egg incubation have resulted in earlier emergence time. Spawning habitat, which is now located 60 to 240 miles downstream from historical sites above Shasta Dam, truncates the juvenile emigration timing by 2-3 months. Therefore, juveniles leave the spawning area at much smaller size and are less likely to survive downstream. For steelhead the cold summer-time flow regime favors residency over anadromy, which reduces the variability in life history that distinguished runs. In addition, with more spatial and temporal overlap between the listed anadromous salmonid species, competition for space reduces the value of the spawning habitat for the conservation of any one species.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-8\">The value of spawning habitat for the conservation of the species is also reduced by flow fluctuations twice a year every year to install and remove the ACID diversion dam. These sudden drops in flow strand and/or isolate juveniles rearing along 5 miles of habitat above the diversion dam, and likely for miles downstream. Flow fluctuations can also dewater winter-run and fall-run redds. Since the majority of winter-run have shifted to spawning above the ACID diversion dam (e.g., 62 percent in 2006), flow fluctuations are likely to have greater impacts in future years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-9\">Climate change, as a modeled future baseline stressor, is likely to reduce the conservation value of the spawning habitat PCE of critical habitat by increasing water temperatures, which will reduce the availability of suitable spawning habitat. Cold water in Shasta Reservoir will run out sooner in the summer, impacting winter-run and spring-run spawning habitat. This reduction in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>essential feature of the spawning habitat PCE will reduce the spatial structure, abundance, and productivity of salmon-ids.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-17\">Id. at 273. Spawning habitat has been impacted by baseline conditions (such as the presence of Shasta and Keswick Dams) and climate change. The BiOp provides explanation for its conclusion that additional Project operations will <em>add </em>to those baseline impacts. As to winter-run spawning habitat, the section references an earlier discussion of \u201cthe impacts of operations on cold water;\u201d addressing CALSIM II modeling runs, comparing temperature conditions (and resulting egg mortality) between baseline operations and operations under the proposed action. Figure 6-14, which depicts winter-run egg mortality by water year type, permits comparison of the baseline (Study 7.0), near future project operations (Study 7.1) and future project operations (Study 8.0).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">Id. at 259. These results show that in critical years, which are 15 percent (15%) of the years modeled, egg mortality more than doubles between Study 7.0 and Study 7.1, and increases by 50 percent between Study 7.0 and Study 8.0, under past and future operations. (No explanation is given for why study 7.1 shows higher mortality than Study 8.0.) Because egg mortality is a direct result of temperature conditions in winter-run spawning habitat, this demonstrates that Project operations will significantly reduce spawning habitat in critical years.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">(2) <em>Project Impacts to Rearing and Migratory Habitat.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">Information to support NMFS\u2019s finding of significance for winter-run rearing and migratory habitat is less apparent. In Section 6.3.8 (\u201cEffects of the Action on Critical Habitat in the Sacramento River\u201d), the BiOp reviews impacts to rearing and migratory habitat very generically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-15\">6.3.8.2 Rearing Habitat</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>Stream flows within the Sacramento River have been altered by the operations of Shasta and Keswick dams. Generally, the changes have increased flows during the summer and fall, and decreased flows in the winter and spring compared to historical conditions (figure 5-13). The result of the change in historical flow patterns has been a decrease in the hydrologic variability and a loss of complexity in the freshwater aquatic habitat. Specific areas of rearing habitat loss due to changes in the flow pattern include fewer oxbows, side channels, braided channels, less LWD, and less shaded aquatic riparian habitat. The Nature Conservancy (2007) model shows that these are necessary for proper functions of riverine ecosystems. A more natural flow regime with higher spring flows and lower summer flows would support riverine functions like the creation of oxbows, side channels and more varied riparian communities. In turn, this would increase cottonwood regeneration, shaded aquatic habitat, food supply, rearing areas, and LWD recruitment, all important components that are being degraded under continued project operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-4\">The decrease in the biological value of the rearing habitat is due to the simplification of the processes that create these important areas. The CVP and SWP have for years used the river as a conveyance system, neglecting the natural processes that are necessary to support river dependent species. This altered stream flow pattern has indirectly led to an increase in bank stabilization, levees, riprap, and armoring to keep the river in place. The reduction in rearing habitat quality has decreased the survival of juvenile salmonids and favored the proliferation of introduced non-native species that prey or compete with juvenile salmonids. Due to the stream flow changes, introduced warm water predators are much more numerous today than historically. Therefore, the conservation value of rearing habitat along the entire 300 miles has been degraded by project operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-6\">Rearing habitat for CV steelhead has been modified in the Sacramento River to cooler summer time releases for winter-run spawning. This change in summer temperature regime has increased the resident rainbow trout population. The change in summer temperatures may reduce the number of steelhead that choose to migrate to the ocean because conditions are too favorable. If the resident trout population is as large as the trout population above Shasta dam (i.e., estimated at 10,300 trout per mile), then competition for food and space could reduce the value of the rearing habitat PCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-7\">Climate change, as modeled future baseline stressor, is likely to reduce availability of rearing habitat, and in turn, the value of the rearing habitat PCE of critical habitat, by increasing water temperatures. As the juveniles migrate downstream, they will emigrate earlier, encounter thermal barriers sooner, and be subjected to predators for longer periods of time. This reduction in the essential elements of critical habitat will reduce the spatial structure, abundance, and productivity of salmonids. Juveniles would be expected to concentrate in areas of cold water refugia, like in the few miles below Keswick Dam, where competition for food, space, and cover would be intense. Those individuals that stayed to over summer would be forced into one life history pattern consistent with project operations (i.e., yearling life history and emigration during the following spring). Those juveniles that did emigrate early would be exposed to greater stress regimes as they encounter higher water tempera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>tures and greater concentrations of predators downstream.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-4\">6.3.8.3 Migratory Corridors</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaQ\">The conservation value of the migratory corridor along the mainstem Sacramento River for all 4 listed species is degraded by the presence of barriers to upstream and downstream migrations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-5\">An essential feature of the migratory corridor PCE is unobstructed passage of emigrating fish through the upper Sacramento River to the spawning areas. This characteristic of the PCE will continue to be degraded by the continued operation of the RBDD and ACID diversion dam. Adult salmonids are blocked and/or delayed in passing these obstructions. Juveniles are subjected to higher concentrations of predators at these locations. Entrainment losses will continue into the future from operation of fish screens at these diversions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-6\">RBDD backs up water on the Sacramento River to form Lake Red Bluff during the summer months, when juvenile winter-run are migrating downstream. This action reduces the conservation value of the critical habitat within the 6-mile lake (or 15 miles of shoreline) for winter-run, spring-run and CV steelhead (TCCA 2008). The inundation of the Sacramento River slows down flows, covers riparian areas, warm water predators become more numerous, and the value of the habitat is reduced. Juvenile salmon and steelhead are disoriented and confused as they migrate downstream through the lake, similar to what happens on the Columbia River above its dams. Stranding and isolation occur in sloughs adjacent to the lake when the gates come out in September (USFWS 1998). The rising waters in the spring kill any vegetation along the sides by submerging it underwater and covering it with silt. Water temperatures increase in the lake as flows are slowed and surface water is heated by the sun. Large shade trees and riparian areas are prevented from becoming established leaving the near shore areas devoid of vegetation. Food supply, shelter and cover are reduced by this action and will continue to 'be reduced under future operations until a new pumping plant is built and operational.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-8\">Approximately, 8 miles of river habitat is modified (or 13.3 percent of the available habitat above RBDD) to less suitable lake habitat for 4 to 6 months of every year when the diversions are in place (i.e., 6 miles above RBDD, and 2 miles above ACID). This seasonal loss of habitat reduces food availability, shelter, and cover, and causes permanent changes that reduce the value of that habitat for the rest of the year (i.e., from sedimentation, loss of shaded aquatic habitat, loss of riffle areas that produce food). The loss of habitat value leads to a reduction in the abundance of juvenile winter-run and spring-run that enter the Delta. Productivity and growth are also reduced from modified habitat and reduced complexity. Juvenile salmonids reach the Delta sooner and at a smaller size, making them more vulnerable to predation. Larger fish are more likely to survive the stressful transition into the marine environment than smaller fish, which have less energy reserves stored in their bodies. Therefore, salmonids with life history stages (representing a year in freshwater) like spring-run yearlings and CV steelhead smolts are less likely to be affected by these habitat changes in the migratory corridor, since they move through main-stem quickly prior to entering the ocean.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">BiOp at 273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">The BiOp\u2019s \u201cSynthesis of Effects\u201d provides the following additional discussion of rearing habitat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>9.2.2 Project Effects on Sacramento River Winter-Run Chinook Salmon Critical Habitat</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-4\">Critical habitat for winter-run is comprised of physical and biological features that are essential for the. conservation of winter-run, including freshwater spawning sites, rearing sites, and migration corridors to support one or more life stages of winter-run.

Food supply, shelter, and cover will continue to be reduced during the 4 months that the gates are in. In the future full build out scenario, the value of rearing habitat will improve when the gates are out for up to 10 months of each year. However, stranding and isolation in sloughs adjacent to the lake would still occur, and riparian habitat will not likely establish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-8\">9.2.2.3 Migratory Corridors</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-9\">The value of upstream and downstream migratory 'corridors will continue to be degraded as a result of the continued operation of RBDD and the ACID diversion dam, which preclude unobstructed passage. The creation of Lake Red Bluff results in the reduction in value of rearing habitat and degradation 'of 15 miles of shoreline that slows down flows, inundates riparian areas, and increases habitat for warm water predators. The value of the migratory corridor will also continue to be degraded when the RBDD gates come out in September and cause stranding and isolation in sloughs adjacent to the lake. In the future full build out scenario (2030, which we assume the effects will be realized starting in year 2019), the 10-month gates out and 2-month (which is really <em>2% </em>months) gates in scenario will improve the value of the migratory corridor by providing unobstructed passage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-11\">During outmigration, the DCC, when the gates are open, continues to degrade the value of the mainstem Sacramento River as a migratory corridor by en-training a portion of the outmigrating juveniles into the Central Delta, where survival and successful outmigration to the Pacific Ocean is lower than if the juveniles remained in the main migratory corridor of the Sacramento River. The proposed action exacerbates this problem by altering water movement through the Sacramento River and Delta such that water in the north part of the Delta (e.g., immediately upstream of the DCC) is pulled southward towards the Federal and State pumping plants through the DCC and/or Georgiana Slough.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">Id. at 469-70.

As a result of implementing the proposed action, some of those physical and biological features will likely remain the same, which will keep their conser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>vation value low. However, the conservation value of many of the physical and biological features will likely be further degraded. For example, the proposed action will further degrade the value of spawning, rearing, and migratory habitat. Reoperation of RBDD in the future full build out scenario, so that the gates are down for months instead of the 4-month near-future (i.e., 2009-2019) scenario, will slightly improve the value of rearing and migratory habitat. However, the conservation value of these habitats will remain degraded by other stressors related to both the proposed action and the baseline (see figure 9-4). The effects of the proposed action under climate change scenarios would likely further degrade the value of spawning and rearing habitat by increasing water temperatures. Cold water in Shasta Reservoir will run out sooner in the summer, degrading winter-run spawning habitat, and the value of rearing habitat would likely be further degraded by juveniles emigrating earlier, encountering thermal barriers sooner, and be subjected to predators for longer periods of time. Juveniles that do not emigrate earlier will likely congregate in areas of cold water refugia, like in the few miles below dams where competition for food, space, and cover would be intense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-5\">Based on the analysis of available evidence, NMFS concludes that the proposed action is likely to reduce the conservation value of the critical habitat, as designated, for the conservation of Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon (table 9-3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Id. at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">All of these discussions of impacts to rearing and migratory habitat on the Sacramento River focus on the operation of Red Bluff Diversion Dam (\u201cRBDD\u201d) and Anderson Cottonwood Irrigation District (\u201cACID\u201d) diversion dam, which obstruct passage and alter large areas of habitat. For example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-9\">Reclamation will continue to operate RBDD (modification of 6 miles of free-flowing riverine habitat to lake-like habitat) and the ACID diversion dam (modification of 3 miles of free-flowing riverine habitat to lake-like habitat) for 4 to 6 months of every year.

In the future full build out scenario, the value of rearing habitat will improve when the gates are out for up to 10 months of each year.

Although the BiOp does not offer a numerical analysis of what percentage of the designated rearing and/or migratory habitat is disturbed by these operations, at least for those fish that must pass these structures (the entire winter and spring-run populations) the significance of such barriers is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">Similar evidence of significant impacts for other aspects of critical habitat exists for each of the species. E.g., id. at 260 (demonstrating significant impacts to the spring-run spawning habitat); id. at 501-503, 504 (summarizing project impacts to spring-run habitat), id. at 549-53 (same as to steelhead); id. at 570-71 (same as to green sturgeon proposed critical habitat, noting that \u201c[w]hen the gates are down, RBDD precludes access to 53 miles of spawning habitat for 35-40 percent of the spawning population of green sturgeon\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is simply that Federal Defendants acted unlawfully by failing to directly articulate that project operations have \u201cappreciable\u201d or \u201csignificant\u201d impacts on critical habitat. The test is that the agency\u2019s reasoning should reasonably be discerned from the BiOp.

The record reflects a number of adverse modifications of the species\u2019 critical habitat. Although the BiOp does not show what proportion of the population will be affected, this is not required. The explanation of the adverse effects on habitat and how these changes have the ability to effect harm to the species is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that the critical habitat analysis is unlawful because NMFS did not apply the proper standard for adverse modification is DENIED; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">E. <em>Use of Surrogates.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">In the effects analysis, the BiOp utilized fall-run Chinook salmon as a surrogate for steelhead, and hatchery Chinook salmon as a surrogate for wild Chinook salmon. Plaintiffs argue that NMFS violated the best available science standard by failing to \u201cvalidate\u201d its use of surrogate species. Doc. 431 at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 expert Kenneth Cummins opines that there is a consensus in the scientific community that, whenever possible the use of surrogates should be avoided. Cummins Decl., Doc. 445 at \u00b6 8. Surrogates should be a \u201ctool of last resort.\u201d Id. This is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">Dr. Cummins further opines that \u201cfor a surrogate to be appropriate, it should share the same key ecological or behavioral traits, that make the target ... sensitive to environmental disturbance and the relationship between population vital rates (for example, survival) and level of disturbance should match that of the target.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 11 (citing .Caro et al. (2005)). Dr. Cummins maintains that because \u201call species are different to some degree in regards to their life history strategies, ecological relationships with other species, and selection and use of habitat, substituting data from one species to draw inferences about another for purposes of conservation planning without validating that decision a priori is not justified.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14. He continues: \u201csince no two co-occurring species are biologically identical, that would seem to rule out management planning for one species that is informed using biological information that is available for another unless use of a surrogate species for the target species is validated.\u201d Id. Dr. Cummins cites a study by Favreau, et al. (2006), which found that \u201cin less than 2 percent of the cases examined did a surrogate represent the target species better than a random selection of potential surrogates. Further, in less than 4 percent of the cases could the surrogate be considered as effective in representing the target species.\u201d Id. From this, Dr. Cummins concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-10\">This makes it clear that without detailed data supporting very similar responses of juvenile Chinook salmon and juvenile steelhead to specific stressors, such as a given set of flow conditions, there is no scientific justification to choose Chinook as a surrogate over any other eo-occurring species.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">Id. Dr. Cummins describes \u201cvarious approaches to validation that scientists may employ before relying on surrogate data.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azh7\">One approach to validation sets forth three criteria that must be met in order to use a surrogate confidently: (1) establish the relationship between levels of environmental disturbance and demographic vital rates for the surrogate species; (2) identify the key traits that affect demographic viability in both the surrogate and target species with -regard to the environmental disturbance; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>(3) establish the relationship between the key trait and the disturbance threshold Caro et al.

The problem with Plaintiffs validation argument, and Dr. Cummins\u2019 related opinions, is that they require that NMFS conduct new experiments to justify reliance on existing experimental data.

However, when direct evidence or similar evaluations are not available for the species under analysis, NMFS has utilized data and results from the use of surrogates that exhibit strong similarities in physiological needs, in life history stages, and in general behaviors. In the absence of data on salmonids and green sturgeon in the wild, NMFS considers these studies one of the best available sources of information used to determine the potential effects of CVP/SWP operations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">BiOp at 62.

First, the Action requires a minimum flow, as measured at Vernalis, based on an index of storage at New Mel-ones Reservoir (\u201cNew Melones Index\u201d). BiOp at 642; BiOp App. 5 at 71. The Vernalis flow requirement is not challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-18\">The second requirement of Action IV.2.1 restricts combined CVP and SWP export pumping based on the flows at Vernalis, with the permissible level of exports rising in relation to increased flows at Vernalis. BiOp at 642; BiOp App. at 71-72. The action is phased.

A secondary purpose of Action IV.2.1 is to more generally \u201cenhance the likelihood of salmonids successfully exiting the Delta at Chipps Island by creating more suitable hydraulic conditions in the main stem of the San Joaquin River for emigrating fish, including greater net downstream flows.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-29\">Both the Export Plaintiffs and DWR have twice previously sought injunctive relief against the imposition of Action IV.2.1.

Doc. 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">A second motion for injunctive relief was filed against Action IV.2.1 in February 2011, Doc. 538, and then withdrawn in light of wet hydrologic conditions that obviated the need to implement the challenged aspects of the Action in this water year.

Doc. 446-1 at 11. DWR\u2019s expert, Bradley Cavallo, refers to various statistical analyses of San Joaquin River salmonid experiments that reveal either no statistically significant relationship, or a positive one. His citation to a study by Kjelson, Loudermilk, Hood, and Brandes, \u201cThe Influence of San Joaquin River Inflow, Central Valley and State Water Project Exports and Migration Route on Fall-Run Chinook Smolt Survival in the Southern Delta During the Spring of 1989,\u201d published in 1990, is representative of these critiques. Kjelson, et al. (1990) concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-8\">Survival of tagged smolts released under low export conditions was not greater than for those released under high export conditions (Table 4). This was an unexpected result as we believed conditions for survival should have improved when exports were lowered, since direct losses at the Project facilities were decreased, flow in the mainstem San Joaquin was increased and reverse flows in the Delta were eliminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">AR 00122358-59 (cited in Cavallo Decl., Doc. 452 at \u00b6 8a).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Mr. Stuart, the lead author of the Delta section of the BiOp, asserts that Mr. Cavallo has selectively quoted from the relevant studies. For example, as to the Kjelson, et al. study:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-12\">... Mr. Cavallo selectively cites a paragraph from the Kjelson et al. (1990) study without including the discussion concerning the results of the study. Kjelson et al. reached a different conclusion as to the potential role of exports than would be arrived at by reading Mr. Cavallo\u2019s excerpt from his declaration. Starting on page 11 of the Kjelson et al. study, the authors discuss the potential reasons for the lower survival during lower export levels. NMFS 122357. These included: (1) the duration of the low export period in May 1989 under the low San Joaquin River flow conditions was too short, thereby not allowing the tagged smolts sufficient time to successfully exit the Delta before high export conditions were resumed, (2) a short curtailment period may be sufficient if San Joaquin River flows are high compared to the export rates at the time of smolt migration, (3) the relatively low number of tagged fish released under each export period that would make recovery at Chipps Island difficult if survival was low, and (4) elevated temperatures and poor trucking survival for the Stanislaus River releases that potentially lowered initial survival rates, thus biasing the export relationship. Kjelson et al. finishes with recommendations for future studies, including: (1) a wider range of inflow to export ratios assessed, particularly between 1 and 5 when river flows are above 5,000 cfs in the San Joaquin River, and (2) document the proportion of fish that enter upper Old River under various flow, export, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>tidal conditions. The fact that Mr. Cavallo did not offer these additional points in his declaration limits the utility of his opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Fourth Stuart Decl., Doc. 485 at \u00b6 13. The BiOp specifically discussed Kjelson, et al. (1990)\u2019s conclusions in Appendix 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-8\">In a study assessing the influence of San Joaquin River inflows, state and federal exports and migration routes, Kjelson et al. (1990) released experimental fish (coded wire tagged hatchery Chinook salmon) during the spring of 1989 at Dos Reis on the San Joaquin River below the head of Old River, and in Old River itself downstream of the head under conditions with low San Joaquin River flow (/E 2,000 cfs) and high/low export conditions (10,000 cfs and 1,800 cfs). The results of the study were unexpected as the rate of survival was not greater for the low export conditions compared to the higher export conditions. Upon further examination of the data, Kjelson et al. found that survival was comparatively lower for all upstream release groups that year compared to other studies conducted in previous years. In addition, Kjelson et al. surmised that the short period of reduced exports (7 days) was not long enough to allow fish to exit the system and move beyond the influence of the exports when higher pumping resumed. Based on the times to recovery at Chipps Island, it was concluded that a sizeable proportion of the released fish were still in the Delta when the higher export levels resumed. This conclusion is further reinforced by the salvage of fish released at Jersey Point, indicating that fish were drawn upstream into the interior of the Delta and towards the pumps. The study, although having several significant flaws, did conclude that survival was higher in the main stem San Joaquin River compared to Old River and that survival in the Delta interior was lower compared to the western Delta (i.e., Jersey Point releases). The authors cautioned about drawing conclusions about export rates and survival from the data due to its obvious flaws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">BiOp App. 5 at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">DWR correctly rejoins that Mr. Stuart does not contest that Kjelson, et al. (1990) concluded that survival Was lower during low exports than high exports. DWR is also correct that Mr. Stuart does not explain how the study \u201caffirmatively supports the United States\u2019 claim that a relationship exists between project exports and smolt survival sufficient to justify the Inflow/Export ratio.\u201d Doc. 495 at 16. Mr. Stuart never opined that Kjelson\u2019s study provides such affirmative support.

If the measurement metric of production cohort is used, instead of escapement 2.5 years later, the curvilinear regression correlation relationship improves (r-square value rises from 0.44 to 0.58) (Figure 18). This seems to suggest that both flow and exports are influencing salmon production in the SJR basin. However, in every instance where salmon production was high, Vernalis flows are in excess of 10,000 cfs. Conversely when salmon production was low, Vernalis flow levels are less than 2,000 cfs (Figure 18). The question becomes is it the flow, or the exports? In an attempt to answer this question, the Department took a closer look at smolt survival data that has been collect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>ed in recent years (data from P. Brandes USFWS). Smolt survival data collected during VAMP shows that juvenile survival increases as exports increase (Figure 19). In addition smolt survival as a function of the export to Vernalis flow ratio has a low correlation (Figure 20), indicating that Delta export level, relative to Delta inflow level, does not influence juvenile salmon survival on a regular, normal, or repetitive pattern. When exports are combined with Vernalis flow in a multiple regression against juvenile survival (both with the Head of Old River Barrier in or out), a strong positive regression occurs (as both exports and Vernalis flow increase, juvenile salmon survival increases (Figures 21 and 22)). <em>For both cases, with either the HORB in or out, export level has a slightly stronger positive influence upon survival than does inflow level. What is surprising about this occurrence is not that export level influences survival, but that there is a positive, rather than a negative, response in juvenile survival as export level increases. </em>It is noted that due to VAMP, when exports are up, Vernalis flows are increased with export level tied to Vernal-is Flow level. This is a noteworthy Delta system operational change, as prior to VAMP there was no correlation between South Delta spring inflow level (e.g. Vernalis flow) and spring Delta export level (unpublished data). Here again, the variable that seems to be controlling salmon production (e.g. survival) is spring Delta inflow not spring Delta export.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-5\">When Delta exports are subtracted from Vernalis flow levels (Figure 23) and escapement is regressed against this difference, a statistically significant regression correlation results. There is no correlation between exports and adult salmon escapement in the Tuolumne River two and one-half years later (Figure 24). When spring Vernalis flow and spring Delta exports are regressed against salmon escapement two and one-half years later, no improvement in the flow to salmon escapement correlation occurs (VAMP 2005), suggesting that spring flow level, not exports, is the variable limiting salmon production in the South Delta.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-7\"><em>To summarize the relationship between exports, flow, and SJR salmon production the primary relationship suggesting that exports influence SJR salmon production is that when the ratio of exports to Vernalis flow decreases both escapement and cohort production increases. </em>The relationships that suggest that <em>flow, not export, is the primary factor </em>influencing SJR salmon production are: 1) when the ratio of spring exports to spring Vernalis flow decreases, Vernalis flow greatly increases and SJR salmon production greatly increases; 2) when the ratio of spring exports to spring Vernalis flow increases, Vernalis flow greatly decreases and SJR salmon production substantially decreases; 3) juvenile salmon survival increases when spring Vernalis flow increases; 4) spring export to spring Vernalis flow ratio has little influence upon juvenile salmon survival; and 5) as the difference between spring Vernalis flow level and spring export flow level increases, escapement increases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-8\">In conclusion, while the influence of Delta export upon SJR salmon production is not totally clear, overall it appears that Delta exports are not having the negative influence upon SJR salmon production they were once thought to have. Rather it appears that Delta inflow (e.g. Vernalis flow level) is the variable influencing SJR salmon production, and that increasing flow level into the Delta during the spring months results in substantially increased salmon production.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>AR 00212423-24 (footnotes omitted)(emphasis added).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Although the CDFG report supports Mr. Cavallo\u2019s assessment that flows are the primary driver of salmon abundance in the SJR, the report acknowledges that as the exportrflow ratio \u201cdecreases\u201d (i.e., as the flow:export ratio increases) escapement and cohort production increases. This supports NMFS\u2019s use of a flowrexport ratio. NMFS\u2019s minimization of the CDFG study was scientifically undesirable, but the law does not prevent it, by extending discretion to be mistaken.

The 2010 PI Decision discussed NMFS\u2019s treatment and critiques of these studies in detail:</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Evaluating the data from the Delta Action 8 studies, Newman (2008) first explained that there was a high level of environmental variation in the data. [3/30/10 Tr.] at 78:18-23. Dr. Newman performed further analysis to reduce the amount of environmental variation and subsequently found a 98% probability that a negative relationship between exports and survival is present. Id. at 79:5-7. Mr. Stuart stated the significance of Newman\u2019s finding is that as exports increased, survival decreases for those salmonid smolts that are moving down into the San Joaquin River, where they would be exposed to the influences of the export pumps. 4/2/10 Tr. 32:8-34:12. For those fish released into Georgiana Slough, survival was better when exports were lower.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">This study is relevant to assessing the impacts of export pumping on fish migrating through the San Joaquin River, because fish released into Georgiana Slough must exit into the San Joaquin River, where they are subject to the influence of the pumps. 3/31/10 Tr. 76:20-23. <em>The Georgiana Slough fish share a common migratory pathway with fish that exit the San Joaquin River basin.

Mr. Stuart testified that Newman\u2019s studies are the best available and the fact that Newman could find a relationship given the considerable amount of \u201cenvironmental noise\u201d and the very low signal to noise ratio \u201cshows that the relationship is probably very real.\u201d Id. at 159:6-10.

Newman and Brandes 2008 reached this conclusion because \u201cthe evidence for an association between exports and survival is somewhat weak\u201d and because of the study\u2019s inability to randomize export levels within a given outmigration season. 4/1/10 Tr. 68:1-12; DWR Ex. 507 at 22-23.

Mr. Cavallo opines that it is inappropriate to rely on the Delta Action 8 studies to reach conclusions about San Joaquin basin salmonids. Cavallo Deck, Doc. 452 at \u00b6\u00b6 19-25. He also opines that the overall effect even on migrating salmon smolts in the Sacramento River is relatively small. Id. at \u00b623. NMFS acknowledged the limitations of these studies in the BiOp, yet relies on them to support Action IV.2.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">The Delta Action 8 studies marginally support Action IV.2.1. Newman\u2019s analysis of the Delta Action 8 studies revealed that for those fish passing through Georgiana slough and the interior Delta, survival was negatively impacted by exports. Those fish share a common migratory pathway with all of the fish exiting the San Joaquin Basin. Fourth Stuart Deck, Doc. 485 at \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. It continues to be marginal logic to apply the admittedly weak correlative results of Newman\u2019s analysis to San Joaquin salmonids. Mr. Cavallo\u2019s criticism that Georgiana Slough, which is not a tidally influenced watercourse and which nev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>er experiences reverse flows, is distinct from the SJR, which is tidally influenced and regularly experiences reverse flows, Cavallo Reply Decl., Doc. 497 at \u00b6 55, does not abrogate the use of Delta 8 studies. Once fish exit Georgiana Slough, they must travel into the Mokelumne River system and the lower SJR, where they are influenced by tidal movements and exports. Fourth Stuart Decl., Doc. 485 at \u00b628. Mr. Cavallo\u2019s criticisms represent another dispute among experts, to which the agency is due deference, even recognizing that DWR and Mr. Cavallo have no apparent incentive to reach objective opinions contrary to NMFS, while Mr. Stuart makes every call in favor of the species, no matter how questionable the basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">(3) <em>Treatment of Data Related to the Use of Bubble Curtains at HORB.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Export Plaintiffs argue that NMFS ignored record evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of non-physical barriers, such as bubble curtains, which use sound, lights, and air bubbles, to guide fish. Doe. 431 at 91. A May 18, 2009 transmittal of \u201cpreliminary data\u201d from Reclamation Biologist Dr. Mark Bowen showed that a bubble curtain kept a substantial percentage of fish in the San Joaquin River, rather than allowing them to move into the Old River toward the pumps. AR 00093348. Export Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that NMFS did not consider this data in developing Action IV.2.1 is incorrect. NMFS considered Dr. Bowen\u2019s preliminary data, Fourth Stuart Decl., Doc. 485 at \u00b6 91, and recognized Dr. Bowen\u2019s warning that the results were preliminary and was \u201cNOT to be cited!\u201d AR 00093348 (emphasis and punctuation in original).

Recent conditions in which high flows did occur in the San Joaquin River basin and which would have given flow to export ratios greater than 3:1 in 2005 and 10:1 in 2006 were confounded by poor ocean conditions during the smolts entry into the marine environment, and returning adult fall-run Chinook salmon escapement numbers from these brood years were very low (brood years 2004, 2005 which returned in 2007 and 2008). <em>From the available data, including the information contained in figures 10 and 11, flow to export ratios should be at least 2:1 and preferably higher to increase survival and abundance.

To date, most VAMP experiments have utilized San Joaquin River flows to export pumping ratios of approximately 2:1.

Historical data indicates that high San Joaquin River flows in the spring result in higher survival of outmigrating Chinook salmon smolts and greater adult returns 2.5 year later (Kjelson et al.1981, Kjelson and Brandes 1989, USFWS 1995) and that when the ratio between spring flows and exports increase, Chinook salmon production increases (CDFG 2005, SJRGA 2007).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A74\">NMFS 00106725 (BO at 645) (emphasis added); see also NMFS 00107220-21 (BO, App. 5, at 74-75). Figure 11 in Appendix 5 of the BiOp depicts data of flow/export ratios over a 50 year period (1951 to 2003) and reveals that increasing the flow/export ratio was positively correlated with increased escapement of fall-run Chinook salmon 2 1/2 years later. See NMFS 00107166-67 (BO, App. 5, at 21-22).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-22\">The BiOp\u2019s rationale for the 4:1 flow/export ratio is likewise clearly set forth and logical:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-23\">The data from the ongoing VAMP experiments provided useful information in developing the ratio. Current VAMP studies have ratios of flow to exports clustered around 2:1, which have provided low survival indices for upstream releases compared to downstream releases, particularly in recent years.

NMFS went on to explain that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-24\">From the available data, ... flow to export ratios should be at least 2:1 and preferably higher to increase survival and abundance. In light of these factors, NMFS initially developed flow to export ratios of 4:1 for wet, above normal, below normal, and dry years, based on the minimum export level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>1,500 cfs and a targeted minimum Vernalis flow of 6,000 cfs. Flows in critically dry years were targeted to be a minimum 3,000 cfs which gives a flow to export ratio of 2:1 when exports are targeted to be 1,500 cfs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArmR\">Id.

DWR has indicated that the RPA is unfeasible as it [is] currently written. They have proposed alternative actions that NMFS has investigated.\u201d NMFS 00107214 (App. 5 at 68). Among the alternative proposals made by DWR was \u201creal time monitoring at Mossdale utilizing additional Kodiak trawling.\u201d NMFS responded, reasonably, by stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-5\">[Recoveries of steelhead in the Moss-dale trawl are a rare event and in many years only a handful of fish are recovered. Given these rare recoveries of fish, an appropriate trigger to initiate flow increase or export reductions in a timely manner to protect outmigrating fish would be difficult to determine.... Therefore, what parameters would DWR suggest to indicate when the pulse of steelhead is exiting the system?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">NMFS 00107214 (BO, App. 5, at 68).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">The analysis discussed above amply demonstrates that, rather than base Action IV.2.1 solely on feasibility concerns, as Export Plaintiffs incorrectly argue, see Export Br. at 94-96, NMFS used the VAMP fish experiments as a starting point for the agency\u2019s analysis of a flow/export ratio. See NMFS 00107168 (BO, App. 5, at 22). The results of those VAMP studies established that a 2:1 ratio (involving a 1,500 cfs export limit) resulted in \u201clow survival indices,\u201d and that a larger ratio was preferable when possible to \u201cincrease survival\u201d and adequately protect the species. Id. After modeling results showed that it would be difficult to increase this ratio in dry years, NMFS reasonably set the Phase II ratios at 1:1 for critically dry years and 2:1 for dry years. NMFS 00107219 (BO, App. 5, at 73). In below normal and above normal years, however, NMFS reasonably concluded that more water would be available to meet the more protective ratios, thus allowing a 3:1 ratio in below normal years and a 4:1 ratio in above normal years. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">In its PI ruling, this Court questioned whether Action IV.2.1 was \u201cprotective enough\u201d or whether a \u201c5:1 or higher\u201d ratio was necessary. PI Findings, CoL \u00b6 51; id. FoF \u00b697. As NMFS explained in Appendix 5 of the BiOp, there are no conclusive studies of flow/export ratios greater than 2:1, but the best available data supports a minimum feasible flow of 6,000 cfs in most years, along with a ratio somewhat higher than the historically tested 2:1 ratio, which had proved insufficiently protective as discussed above. See NMFS 00107164-68 (BO, App. 5, at 18-22). Specifically, the 6,000 cfs target minimum flow was determined based on (1) water reasonably available based on historical flow patterns since 1922; and (2) flow-to-escapement relationships indicating that flows over 5,000 to 6,000 cfs \u201cwere required to move into the linear phase of increasing fish escapement.\u201d NMFS 00107167-68 (BO, App. 5, at 21-22). Unless NMFS reduced exports to even less than 1,500 cfs \u2014 the minimum believed necessary to protect human health and safety \u2014 simple math reveals that it would be impossible to achieve a 5:1 or higher ratio, assuming 6,000 cfs as the target minimum flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>As to whether a less restrictive ratio (e.g., 3:1) was biologically appropriate, NMFS did adopt a 3:1 ratio for below normal years. Only in \u201cabove normal\u201d or \u201cwet\u201d years is a 4:1 ratio required. Given the parameters for a flow/export ratio that could feasibly be implemented using a 6,000 cfs target for flows \u2014 somewhere between 2:1 and 4:1 \u2014 and the lack of data on any of the ratios in between, NMFS reasonably adopted a sliding scale that allows the absolute minimum ratio during drought conditions but increases protections for species when it is feasible to do so, as determined by hydrological conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Of course, NMFS cannot prove with absolute certainty that the 4:1 ratio is protective enough for the species. The existing data simply does allow it. But, given the record evidence of harm to salmon and the need to modify the flow/export ratio, the best available science standard does not require that NMFS stand by and do nothing, paralyzed by a lack of perfect data. To the contrary, NMFS had to act and reasonably exercised its expertise by adopting a flow/export ratio that is both feasible and more protective of the species than the status quo. See <em>Greenpeace Action, </em>14 F.3d at 1337 (upholding biological opinion even though FWS admitted that it was \u201cuncertain about the effectiveness of its management measures\u201d because it \u201cpremised these measures on a reasonable evaluation of available data, not on pure speculation\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-7\">Thus, rather than base its decision on \u201cno evidence,\u201d as was the ease in <em>Pacific Coast I, </em>here NMFS\u2019s conclusions are explicitly based on scientific evidence, although some of that data may be \u201cless than conclusive.\u201d 426 F.3d at 1094. As acknowledged in <em>Pacific Coast I, </em>this is reasonable and consistent with the ESA. Accordingly, DefendanNIntervenors respectfully urge the Court to reconsider and reverse its preliminary finding that NMFS failed to articulate a reasonable basis for RPA Action IV.2.1. See PI Findings, FoF \u00b6\u00b6 97, 98; CoL \u00b6\u00b6 50, 51.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">Doc. 484 at 68-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">This explanation for the basis for the ratios imposed by Action IV.2.1 is supported by record references, which now explain in part NMFS\u2019s choice of ratios, aided by hindsight and judicial review. This is another close call. DWR opposes the flow ratings as infeasible and arguably unnecessary. NMFS uses VAMP flow data to corroborate its position that a 2:1 ratio is insufficiently protective. It justifies the use of a 3:1 ratio when possible (e.g., in below normal years) as necessarily more protective than a 2:1 ratio. The consequences of imposing a 4:1 ratio in above normal and wet years demand a clearer explanation of NMFS\u2019s rationale for imposing a 4:1 ratio, rather than a 3:1 ratio in above normal and wet years. The ESA Handbook requires \u201ca <em>thorough explanation of how each </em>component of the [RPA] is <em>essential </em>to avoid jeopardy and/or adverse modification.\u201d ESA Handbook at 4-43 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This is not to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>done by attorneys, post hoc, in litigation.

At flows more negative than \u2014 5,000 cfs, the risk of entrainment increases at an even greater rate, reaching approximately 90 percent at \u2014 7,000 cfs. Even if salmonids do not behave exactly as neutrally buoyant particles, the risk of entrainment escalates considerably with increasing exports, as represented by the net OMR flows. The logical conclusion is that as OMR reverse flows increase, risk of entrainment into the channels of the South Delta is increased. Conversely, the risk of entrainment into the channels of the South delta is reduced when exports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>are lower and the net flow in the OMR channels is more positive \u2014 that is, in the direction of the natural flow toward the ocean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-4\">BiOp at 652.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-5\"><em>This is a dispute among scientists.

DWR argues that NMFS disregarded these \u201cwords of caution.\u201d Doc. 446-1 at</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">20. This is inaccurate. NMFS convened a group of State and federal scientists to discuss PTM simulations, including DWR representatives, who raised some of the same criticisms asserted here. AR 00106021-25 (June 3, 2009 Memo Re: PTM \u201cresults for [OMR] flow manipulation\u201d (\u201cPTM Memo\u201d)). NMFS considered the length of simulation at multiple meetings, AR 00106021-22 (PTM Memo discussing meetings from January through March 2009 and durations of PTM tracking);. AR 00061290-91 (communication between Jeffrey Stuart and Tracy Hinojosa at DWR regarding PTM simulations), AR 00060023-24 (agenda items for discussion at \u201cModeling work group), and addressed concerns raised in the PTM Memo, see AR 00105025-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">Second, DWR highlights that Kimmerer and Nobriga (2008) notes that the PTM model \u201chas not been calibrated.\u201d AR 00122262. DWR argues that NMFS should not have used an un-calibrated model. Doc. 446-1 at 20. This ignores the fact that DWR and others have in fact performed validation and calibration on the PTM to ensure that it accurately depicts hydrodynamics. Fourth Stuart Deck, Doc. 485 at \u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">Finally DWR argues that NMFS\u2019s reliance on this study to \u201canalyz[e] the potential \u2018zone of effects\u2019 for entraining emigrating juvenile and smolting salmonids,\u201d BiOp at 361, conflicts with the recommendations of Kimmerer and Nobriga, Doc. 446-1 at 21. Specifically, Kimmerer and Nobriga stated: \u201c[w]e are ... not inclined to define a \u2018zone of influence\u2019 of the pumps on the basis of our results.\u201d AR 00122263. The entire paragraph goes on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-15\">A consequence of this is that simple questions (e.g., what proportion of particles are entrained under a given set of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>conditions) have no clear answer. Instead, the answer depends on the time horizon, which in turn depends on the overall flow conditions and the site of the release. We are, furthermore, not inclined to define a \u201czone of influence\u201d of the pumps on the basis of our results, since the probability of entrainment depends on time horizon which, in many cases, is too long to be useful for analyzing the movements of larval fish. By the end of the modeled time period, the fish would already have metamorphosed, and their behavior would have become more complex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">AR 00122263. Kimmerer and Nobriga (2008) addresses both larval delta smelt and juvenile salmonids. Their reluctance to define a \u201czone of influence\u201d is focused on the difficulties posed by modeling larval delta smelt, which may metamorphose to a more complex state within the time horizon of the PTM simulation. This apologetic does not suggest there are not problems with using PTM to define a of zone of influence, it is simply a statement that endeavors to explain uncertainty. Although NMFS\u2019s interpretation and use of Kimmerer and Nobriga (2008) was not accurate, again it is the agency\u2019s spin on the science. It is not unlawfully erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">(2) <em>DWR\u2019s Argument that NMFS Failed to Address Evidence in the Record Critical of the Use of PTM to Explain Salmonid Behavior.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">DWR revisits the issue of whether NMFS gave adequate consideration to record evidence critical of the use of PTM to explain salmonid behavior. DWR specifically cites a 2001 article by Baker and Morhardt, AR 00108384-403, and an analysis conducted by DWR included in DWR\u2019s April 24, 2009 comments on the draft BiOp. See Doc. 446-1 at 22-23. Baker and Morhardt (2001) demonstrated that the fate of particles in the PTM was different from actual salmon behavior. AR 00108394 (\u201cfor the hydraulic simulations available to us ... 77% of the tracer [PTM] particles ended up at the export pumps, while only 13% of the smolts arrived there\u201d). Likewise, the DWR (2009) analysis concluded there \u201cis no correlation\u201d between coded wire tagged (\u201cCWT\u201d) Chinook recoveries and PTM particle behavior. AR 00105430.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">These additional studies do not undermine the reasoning of the 2010 PI Decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-10\">NMFS recognized the limitations of applying the PTM model simulation to salmonids. 4/1/10 Tr. 144:2-8.

To validly rely on the PTM results to impose management measures designed to aid salmonid survival, the movement of water described by the PTM must be reasonably related to the movement of salmonids. Citing the Baker and Morhardt (2001) study and DWR (2009) comments, Mr. Ca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>vallo opines that this \u201chas been shown to be incorrect.\u201d Cavallo Decl., Doc. 452 at \u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">NMFS justifies reliance on PTM simulations as a proxy for salmonid behavior:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq7\">NMFS uses the findings of the PTM simulations to look at the eventual fate of objects in the river over a defined period of time from a given point of origin in the system. While salmonids and green sturgeon are not \u201cneutrally buoyant particles\u201d, they can be represented to some degree by the PTM modeling results. The fish occupy a given body of water in the river and that body of water has eventual fates in the system, as represented by the dispersion of the injected particles. The salmonids have volitional movement within that body of water and react to environmental cues such as tides, water velocity vectors, and net water flow movement within the channel. The eventual fate of that body of water signifies the potential vulnerabilities of fish within that body of water to external physical factors such as export pumping or river inflows. For example, if exports increase, and the eventual fate of the water body indicates that it has a higher probability of entrainment compared to other conditions (i.e., lower export pumping), then NMFS believes that salmonids within that same body of water will also experience a higher probability of entrainment by the export pumping. Conversely, under conditions where the eventual fate of injected' particles indicate a high probability of successfully exiting the Delta at Chipps Island, NMFS believes salmon-ids traveling in the same body of water will have a higher probability of exiting the Delta successfully. Furthermore, conditions which delay movement of particles out of the Delta yet don\u2019t result in increased entrainment at the export facilities would indicate conditions that might delay migration through the Delta, which would increase vulnerabilities to predation or contaminant exposure. Finally, flow conditions at river channel splits indicate situations where migrating fish must make a \u201cdecision\u201d as to which channel to follow. If water is flowing into a given channel, then fish closer to that channel bifurcation are more likely to be influenced by the flow conditions adjacent to the channel opening than fish located farther away from the channel mouth. Burau et al. (2007) describes the complexity of these tempo- ' ral and spatial conditions and their potential influence on salmonid movement. PTM simulations currently do not give the necessary fine scale resolution both temporally (minutes to fractions of hours) and spatially (three dimensional on the scale of meters) to give clear results at these channel splits. Burau states that spatial distribution of fish across the river channel occurs upstream of the channel splits and is dependent \u201cupon the interaction between local hydrodynamic processes (e.g., secondary currents) and subtle behaviors that play out in a Lagrangian reference frame. These spatial structures evolve over fractions of hours to hours. Junction interactions, on the other hand, happen very rapidly, typically within minutes. Thus, route selection may only minimally depend on behavioral responses that occur in the junction, depending to a greater degree on spatial distributions that are created by subtle behavioral responses/interactions to geometry-mediated current structures that occur up-current of a given junction.\u201d This description illustrates the complexity of route selection. Based on Burau\u2019s explanation, fish upstream of the split are dispersed by the environmental conditions present in the channel into discrete locations across the channel\u2019s cross seetion. The proximity of these locations to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>the channel mouth is predictive of the risk of diversion into the channel itself. PTM data can be useful to indicate the magnitude of the net movement of water through the channel after the junction split (and the route selected by the fish), and thus can be used to infer the probable fate of salmonids that are advected into these channels during their migrations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">BiOp 366-67.

What support for these conclusions does the record contain?</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">(3) <em>Salvage Data.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">The BiOp relies in part on the plots of juvenile loss versus monthly OMR flows in Figures 6-65 and 6-66 discussed above to link the PTM results to salmonid behavior.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ani8\">Based on particle tracking modeling, the Delta smelt work group concluded that net river flows greater than -2000 \u00b1 500 cfs in the Old River and Middle River complex reduced the zone of entrainment so that particles injected into the central Delta at Potato Slough would not be entrained towards the pumps (Kimmerer and Nobriga 2008 op cit. CVP/SWP operations BA). NMFS considers this information useful in analyzing the potential \u201czone of effects\u201d for entraining emigrating juvenile and smolting salmonids. A similar pattern is observed in material (figures 6-65 and 6-66) provided to NMFS by DWR (Greene 2009). Loss of older juveniles at the CVP and SWP fish collection facilities increase sharply at Old and Middle River flows of approximately - 5,000 cfs and depart from the initial slope at flows below this. Given the data derived from the CVP/SWP operations BA Appendix E, flows in Old and Middle River are consistently in excess of the -2000 \u00b1 500 cfs threshold for entrainment (i.e., more upstream flow). Assuming that in the normal (natural) flow patterns in the Delta, juvenile and smolting Chinook salmon and steelhead will use flow as a cue in their movements and will orient to the ambient flow conditions prevailing in the Delta waterways, then upstream flows will carry fish towards the pumps during current operations. General tendencies of the modeling results indicate that Old River and Middle River net flows trend towards greater upstream flow in the near future and future conditions, resulting in even more fish carried towards the pumps.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">BiOp at 361. The BiOp\u2019s reliance on figures 6-66 and 6-66 has been found unlawful. Without scaling for population size, the trends seen in Figures 6-65 and 6-66 are meaningless, because data points indicating greater salvage may simply be the result of a greater absolute number of individuals present in the entire Delta. The number of individuals lost to salvage could go up simply because the volume of water pumped through the salvage facility increases, not because increasing exports causes a greater percentage of the population to make its way toward the salvage facilities than would otherwise be present there.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>(4) <em>Other Studies.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">In addition to Figures 6-65 and 6-66, NMFS relied on other studies, namely Vogel (2004), Perry &amp; Skalski (2008), Newman (2008), and Newman and Brandes (2009), to conclude that as exports increase, greater numbers of salmonids are drawn into the interior Delta.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">(a) <em>Vogel (200k).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">The 2010 PI Decision addressed the BiOp\u2019s reliance on Vogel (2004):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-7\">The BiOp also relied upon Vogel (2004), which reviewed telemetry-tagging data to investigate fish route selection in the channels leading to the south Delta.

However, that sentence and several following paragraphs were eliminated by Newman and Brandes from the final, published version of the study. See AR 00089883.

One potential bias in the 1989 and 1990 data is that as mentioned earlier, smolts released at Dos Reis in 1989 were from the Merced River Fish Facility while those released at Jersey Point were from Feather River hatchery. Using different stocks to estimate smolt survival between two locations may introduce bias. In addition, results in 1989 and 1990 also showed that survival indices of the upper Old River groups relative to the Jersey Point groups were also higher during the higher export period, but overall still about half that of the survival of smolts released at Dos Reis (Table 11).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">AR 00109602. That the study\u2019s authors question the validity of the results from the years showing a positive relationship between exports and survival and do not critique the results from the year showing a negative relationship, lends minimal support to NMFS\u2019s conclusion that exports influence salmonid survival.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">\n<em>(f)Kimmerer 2008.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">DefendanWIntervenors point to a Kim-merer 2008 that unequivocally found that \u201c[t]he estimated proportion of migrating fish salvaged at the export facilities increased with increasing export flow.\u201d AR 00122236.

Most of the evidence does not show a negative relationship between levels of exports and salmon survival. It is impossible to discern the effect of exports on salmon behavior from the record. Despite these numerous criticisms, NMFS chose to use PTM as a modeling tool for salmonid behavior. DWR\u2019s own staff biologist, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>Sheila Greene, testified in a related case by declaration that \u201cGiven the insufficiency of behavioral data, particle tracking is the best available science to estimate the proportions of juvenile Chinook salmon that emigrate through the Delta.\u201d AR 00118803. DWR is bound by this statement. Whether to use PTM modeling then becomes a matter of agency discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">b. <em>Justification for the Specific Flow Prescriptions in Action IV.2.3.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Existence of record support for NMFS\u2019s reliance on the PTM does not end the inquiry. The BiOp applied the PTM to generate flow prescriptions using the following approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-7\">The data output for the PTM simulation of particles injected at the confluence of the Mokelumne River and the San Joaquin River (Station 815) indicate that as net OMR flow increases southwards from -2,500 to -3,500 cfs, the risk of particle entrainment nearly doubles from 10 percent to 20 percent, and quadruples to 40 percent at -5,000 cfs. At flows more negative than -5,000 cfs, the risk of entrainment increases at an even greater rate, reaching approximately 90 percent at -7,000 cfs. Even if salmonids do not behave exactly as neutrally buoyant particles, the risk of entrainment escalates considerably with increasing exports, as represented by the net OMR flows. The logical conclusion is that as OMR reverse flows increase, risk of entrainment into the channels of the South Delta is increased. Conversely, the risk of entrainment into the channels of the South delta is reduced when exports are lower and the net flow in the OMR channels is more positive \u2014 that is, in the direction of the natural flow toward the ocean.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">BiOp at 652. Even if the PTM is the best available mechanism for modeling salmonid behavior, NMFS has failed to justify this leap of logic, which in essence assumes that salmonids will be drawn toward the export facilities to the same extent as neutrally buoyant particles. In light of undisputed record evidence discussed above demonstrating the many deficiencies in the PTM and that it is far from a perfect proxy for salmon behavior, NMFS has not provided \u201ca thorough explanation of how each component of the [RPA] is <em>essential </em>to avoid jeopardy and/or adverse modification.\u201d ESA Handbook at 4-43 (emphasis added). Conclusory explanations of the value of RPA actions are insufficient. <em>PCFFA v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, </em>426 F.3d 1082, 1093 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 and DWR\u2019s motion challenges to Action IV.2.3 is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART, as are Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions. There is nominal record support for the imposition of some form of OMR flow restriction, but the Action must be remanded for further explanation of the necessity the specific flow prescriptions imposed, which are derived primarily from PTM simulations, a method that is undisputedly an imperfect predictor of salmon behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">3. <em>Action IV.3.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">From November 1 through December 31, Action IV.3 restricts combined CVP and SWP exports to 6,000 cfs or 4,000 cfs when certain salvage thresholds are met. BiOp at 653. The 6,000 cfs export limit is triggered when daily SWP and CVP older juvenile loss density is greater than 8 fish per thousand acre feet (\u201cTAF\u201d), daily loss is greater than 95 fish per day, or the Coleman National Fish Hatchery coded wire tagged late fall-run Chinook salmon (\u201cColeman CWT fish\u201d) or Livingstone Stone National Hatchery coded wire tagged winter-run (\u201cL-S CWT fish\u201d) cumulative loss is greater than 0.5%. Id. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>more restrictive 4,000 cfs export limit is triggered when the daily older juvenile loss density is greater than 15 fish per TAF, daily loss is greater than 120 fish per day, or the Coleman CWT or L-S CWT fish cumulative loss is greater than 0.5%. Either export restriction remains in place for three days, or until daily older juvenile loss density is less than 8 fish per TAF. Id. Action IV.3 also establishes an \u201calert,\u201d which signals that export restrictions may need to be altered when either the Knights Landing or Sacramento catch index is greater than 10 fish captured per day from November 1 to February 28, or greater than 15 fish captured per day from March 1 to April 30. Id. at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">The objective of Action IV.3 is to \u201c[r]educe losses of winter-run, spring-run, CV steelhead, and Southern DPS of green sturgeon by reducing exports when large numbers of juvenile Chinook salmon are migrating into the upper Delta region, at risk of entrainment into the central and south Delta and then to the export pumps in the following weeks.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">DWR does not challenge this RPA Action. Export Plaintiffs, however, raise several objections. First, Export Plaintiffs challenge NMFS\u2019s underlying assumption for Action IV.3 that \u201c[ejxport pumping changes flow patterns and increases residence time of ... diverted fish in the central Delta, which increases the risk of mortality from [other factors], as well as the likelihood of entrainment at the pumps.\u201d Id. at 653. They argue that this assumption is not supported by the best available science, reiterating the argument that the studies relied upon by NMFS do not \u201cconnect mortality in the interior delta to export levels,\u201d and that NMFS\u2019s use of PTM studies to show \u201cpotential vulnerabilities of fish\u201d is not appropriate. Doc. 431 at 106-108. Although the evidence supporting a survival effect of increased exports weak and disputed, NMFS\u2019s conclusion that export pumping negatively impacts salmonid survival has marginal support in the record and is not unlawfully erroneous. The BiOp\u2019s related use of PTM as a modeling tool for salmon-ids is a highly disputed scientific choice, described by DWR as the best available science in at least one application.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">Export Plaintiffs also challenge the specific triggers used in Action IV.3, on the grounds that: (1) as was the case with the plots of raw salvage used to justify other Actions, the triggers do not account for the relative size of the various salmonid populations; and (2) \u201cNMFS nowhere explains how it arrived at these thresholds. Doc. 431 at 108-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">Federal Defendants respond that Plaintiffs\u2019 concern that Action IV.3 fails to scale the loss triggers against the population size is \u201ca red herring\u201d because \u201cNMFS did not conclude that Action IV.3 alone is avoiding jeopardy. Rather, the measure simply reflects NMFS\u2019s conclusion that it is important to have increased protections when you have more fish at the salvage facilities.\u201d Doc. 477-1. This is a total abdication from NMFS\u2019s self-imposed requirement that the RPA provide \u201ca thorough explanation of how each component of the [RPA] is <em>essential </em>to avoid jeopardy and/or adverse modification.\u201d ESA Handbook at 4-43 (emphasis added). Federal Defendants cannot impose a complex and burdensome RPA, damaging of other interests, without specifically justifying each of its components. Adoption of Federal Defendants\u2019 \u201ctrust me\u201d approach would mean that the more complex an RPA, the more obscured it is from judicial review. Each component need not eliminate jeopardy on its own, but that does not excuse NMFS from separately justifying individual Actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">While there is record explanation for an action designed to prevent large numbers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>of fish from being killed or harmed at the export pumping facilities, Export Plaintiffs raise serious questions related to the need to scale the triggers to the overall size of the salmonid populations they aim to protect. Given previous findings about the use of raw salvage figures, the best available science calls for an index related to population size, rather than a fixed number. More importantly, even if this were not a problem, Federal Defendants have entirely failed to provide any record explanation for why the specific triggers were chosen. NMFS must address and correct this failure on remand. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion is GRANTED on this issue; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">G. <em>Compliance with 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">ESA section 7(b)(3)(A) provides that, \u201c[i]f jeopardy or adverse modification is found, the Secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not violate subsection (a)(2) of [Section 7] and can be taken by the Federal agency ... in implementing the agency action.\u201d Id. \u201cReasonable and prudent alternatives refer to alternative actions identified during formal consultation [1] that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, [2] that can be implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agency\u2019s legal authority and jurisdiction, [3] that is economically and technologically feasible, and [4] that the Director believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.\u201d 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02 (the \u201cfour RPA requirements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">NMFS and FWS\u2019s joint Consultation Handbook explains that during the formal consultation period, NMFS should \u201cmeet or communicate with the action agency ... to gather any additional information necessary to conduct the consultation.\u201d Consultation Handbook at 4-6.

Section 7(b) of the Act requires the Service to include reasonable and prudent alternatives, if any, in a \u201cjeopardy\u201d biological opinion. An alternative is considered reasonable and prudent only if it can be implemented by the Federal agency and any applicant in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, and if the Director believes it would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat of such species. Further, the Service should be mindful of the limits of a Federal agency\u2019s jurisdiction and authority when prescribing a reasonable and prudent alternative. An alternative, to be reasonable and prudent, should be formulated in such a way that it can be implemented by a Federal agency consistent with the scope of its legal authority and jurisdiction. However, the Service notes that a Federal agency\u2019s responsibility under section 7(a)(2) permeates the full range of discretionary authority held by that agency; i.e., the Service can specify a reasonable and prudent alternative that involves the maximum exercise of Federal agency authority when to do so is necessary, in the opinion of the Service, to avoid jeopardy. The Service recognizes that economic and technological feasibility are factors to be used in developing reasonable and prudent alternatives, as requested by one commenter.

One of those commenters urged the Service to limit the scope of recommended alternatives to those \u201cconsistent with the scope, magnitude, and duration of the project as well as the extent of its adverse effects.\u201d First, because there is a distinction between \u201creasonable and prudent alternatives\u201d (that satisfy section 7(a)(2)) and \u201cconservation recommendations\u201d (that are authorized by section 7(a)(1)), the Service declines to include conservation measures within the scope of the definition. Second, the Service agrees that reasonable and prudent alternatives should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>consistent with the intended purpose of the action and should therefore be economically and technologically feasible, but the Service cannot limit its range of choices to the criteria suggested by the commenter.

According to the BA, \u201c[t]he proposed action is the continued operation of the CVP and SWP.\u201d (CVP and SWP operations BA, P. 2-1) Specifically, Reclamation and DWR \u201cpropose to operate the Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP) to divert, store, and convey CVP and SWP (Project) water consistent with applicable law and contractual obligations.\u201d (CVP and SWP operations BA, p. 1-1) Changes in operation of the projects to avoid jeopardizing listed species or adversely modifying their critical habitats require that additional sources of water for the projects be obtained, or that water delivery be made in a different way than in the past (e.g., elimination of RBDD), or that amounts of water that are withdrawn and exported from the Delta during some periods in some years be reduced. These operational changes do not, however, preclude operation of the Projects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">BiOp at 724. The BiOp also discussed the various purposes of the CVP:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-8\">----The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1937, which established the purposes of the CVP, provided that the dams and reservoirs of the CVP \u201c \u2018shall be used, first, for river regulation, improvement of navigation and flood control; second, for irrigation and domestic uses; and, third, for power.\u201d \u2019 (CVP and SWP operations BA, p. 1-2). The CVP was reauthorized in 1992 through the CVPIA, which modified the 1937 Act and added mitigation, protection, and restoration of fish and wildlife as project purposes. The CVPIA provided that the dams and reservoirs of the CVP should be used \u201c \u2018first, for river regulation, improvement of navigation, and flood control; second, for irrigation and domestic uses and fish and wildlife mitigation, protection and restoration purposes; and, third, for power and fish and wildlife enhancement.\u201d (CVP and SWP operations BA p. 1-3) One of the stated purposes of the CVPIA is to address impacts of the CVP on fish and wildlife. CVPIA, Sec. 3406(a). The CVPIA gives Reclamation broad authority to mitigate for the adverse effects of the projects on fish and wildlife, and nothing in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1937 requires any set amount of water delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-10\">In addition to adding protection of fish and wildlife as second tier purposes of the CVP, the CVPIA set a goal of doubling the natural production of anadromous fish in Central Valley rivers and streams on a long-term sustainable basis, by 2002. Sec. 3406(b)(1). This goal has not been met. Instead, as detailed in this Opinion, natural production of anadromous fish has declined precipitously. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">Id. at 724-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">Export Plaintiffs challenge NMFS\u2019s finding that the RPA is consistent with the multiple purposes of the Projects. First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>Export Plaintiffs argue that NMFS ignored warnings about the water costs of the RPA. For example, DWR commented that \u201cthe average combined water supply impact to the SWP and the CVP of the NFMS proposed RPA is roughly 900 [thousand acre feet (\u201ctaf\u2019) ] to 1.1 [million acre feet (\u201cMaf\u2019) ] (or about 16% to 19%).\u201d AR 00086760. DWR\u2019s estimate continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1Il\">By taking an alternative approach and layering the NFMS proposed RPA on top of the terms of the USFWS 2008 [Smelt] BiOp RPA that have been provisionally accepted by Reclamation, the average combined water supply impact of the NMFS draft RPA to the SWP and CVP is roughly 150 taf to 750 taf, or about 3% to 15% <em>above </em>the impact of the USFWS 2008 [Smelt] BiOp RPA depending on the range of adaptive actions implemented by the USFWS under the terms of the [Smelt] BiOp. When compared to OCAP Study 7.0, the average combined water supply impact of the collective USFWS [Smelt] RPA and NMFS draft RPA to the SWP and CVP is roughly 1.3 Maf to 1.6 Maf (or about 23% to 29%).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-6\">[I]t should be noted that these estimated impacts are incomplete, and we would expect them to be greater because they do not include reoperation of CVP reservoirs as specified in the draft NMFS RPA. In addition, these studies do not include.any assessment of the USFWS Fall X2 measure which has not been accepted by Reclamation as reasonable or prudent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">Id. Plaintiffs also point to Reclamation\u2019s comments on the RPA, which express general concerns over water supply impacts. AR 00210461-69, 00210473-76, 00105273.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">That there are water supply impacts does not necessarily render the RPA inconsistent with the purposes of the action. However, NMFS is absolutely obligated do more than simply check to ensure that the proposed operational changes do not \u201cpreclude operation of the Projects.\u201d See BiOp at 724. Assumedly, if the Projects delivered ten AF of water in a water year, the Projects would be \u201coperating.\u201d An RPA that effectively eliminates Project water deliveries to parts of the CVP\u2019s service area is inconsistent with one of the coequal purposes of that project.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> What is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>the ultimate impact of the salmonid BiOp RPA? The BiOp does not provide explicit answers to these questions. The BiOp predicted a lower estimate of water supply costs than DWR:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-4\">NMFS estimates the water costs associated with the RPA to be 5-7% of average annual combined exports: 5% for CVP, or 130 TAF/year, and 7% for SWP, or 200 TAF/year. The combined estimated annual average export curtailment is 330 TAF/year. These estimates are over and above export curtailments associated with the USFWS\u2019 Smelt Opinion. The OMR restrictions in both Opinions tend to result in export curtailments of similar quantities at similar times of year. Therefore, in general, these 330 TAF export curtailments are associated with the NMFS San Joaquin River Ratio actions in the RPA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-5\">NMFS also considered that there may be additional localized water costs not associated with South Delta exports. These may include, in some years, localized water shortages necessitating groundwater use, water conservation measures, or other infrastructure improvements in the New Melones service area, and localized impacts in the North of Delta in some years, associated with curtailments of fall deliveries used for rice decomposition. NMFS considered whether it was feasible to model and estimate any water costs associated with the Shasta or American River RPA actions, and discussed this issue with Reclamation. In general, it was decided that modeling tools were not available to assess these costs and/or that costs would be highly variable depending on adaptive management actions, and therefore, not meaningful to model.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">BiOp at 720-21 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">The agency abandoned its legal duties and said in effect: \u201cwe can\u2019t model, we won\u2019t do it.\u201d However, much of the Defendants\u2019 support for the BiOp and its RPA actions is based upon the same highly variable and questionable modeling of species populations and effects from exports. As this agency practices, what is \u201cscience\u201d for the \u201cgoose\u201d is clearly not \u201cfor the gander.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">Export Plaintiffs argue that NMFS has failed to explain why its estimate is more reliable than the 900,000 \u2014 1,100,000 AF water cost estimate (16%-19% of the Projects\u2019 combined water supply) provided by DWR, one of the Project co-operators. Doc. 431 at 113-14. In particular, Export Plaintiffs challenge the BiOp\u2019s consideration of only the impacts of export curtailments \u201cassociated with the NMFS San Joaquin River Ratio actions in the RPA,\u201d presumably a reference to Action IV.2.1. The BiOp explains that many of the OMR restrictions in both the Salmon and Smelt BiOps \u201ctend to result in export curtailments of similar quantities at similar times of year,\u201d but does not explain why it is appropriate to entirely ignore the effects of those curtailments that may overlap with those mandated by the Smelt BiOp. This requires further clarification and revision in light of competent and meaningful impact studies.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>Even assuming, arguendo, the BiOp\u2019s water cost prediction is correct, is such a reduction \u201cconsistent\u201d with the irrigation purpose of the CVP? How should the RPA analyze the extent of water supply reductions that are consistent with the co-equal legislative irrigation purpose? The ESA provides no guidance, nor do the joint ESA regulations or any other authority identified by any party. It cannot simply be said that if an ESA-listed species\u2019 protection is at stake, the \u201cno balancing of hardships\u201d principle excludes such consideration. This would impermissibly rewrite Reclamation law to eliminate the regulatory requirement that NMFS consider the RPA\u2019s effect on the co-equal statutory purpose of irrigation. Federal Defendants\u2019 examination of this factor is insufficient. Export Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on this issue is GRANTED; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">2. <em>Consistency with the Action Agency\u2019s Legal Authority and Jurisdiction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Export Plaintiffs dispute the BiOp\u2019s conclusion that the RPA can be implemented in a manner consistent with the legal authority and jurisdiction of Reclamation and DWR. The BiOp reasons that \u201c[t]he CVPIA gives Reclamation broad authority to mitigate for the adverse effects of the projects on fish and wildlife, and nothing in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1937 requires any set amount of water delivery.\u201d BiOp at 724-25. The BiOp also recognizes that the CVPIA contains a goal of doubling the natural production of anadromous fish in Central Valley rivers and streams, and that this goal has not yet been met. Id. at 725. As Federal Defendants well know, the CVPIA dedicates a finite 800,000 AF of annual CVP yield to the fish-doubling objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">The BiOp reasons that Reclamation has broad powers to restore anadromous fish populations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-8\">A 2008 report on the CVPIA anadromous fish program by independent reviewers (Cummins et al.2008), recommended by the Office of Management and Budget and requested by Reclamation and the USFWS, stated that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxV\">\u201cit is far from clear that the agencies have done what is possible and necessary to improve freshwater conditions to help these species weather environmental variability, halt their decline and begin rebuilding in a sustainable way. A number of the most serious impediments to survival and recovery are not being effectively addressed, especially in terms of the overall design and operation of the [CVP] system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-9\">One of the review panel\u2019s specific recommendations was that the agencies</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcN\">\u201cshould develop a more expansive view of the authorities at their disposal to address the problems, especially with regard to water management and project operations. The agencies have followed a more restrictive view of their authorities than appears legally necessary or appropriate to the seriousness of the mission. \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-10\">The report notes that the CVPIA contains a \u201clong list of operational changes, actions, tools, and authorities \u2014 some quite specific and discrete, some general and on-going \u2014 that Interior is to use to help achieve the anadromous fish restoration purposes of the CVPIA .... \u201d (Cummins et al.2008 at 5) The report then describes development of a Final Restoration Plan that would utilize these authorities, but concludes that \u201c[t]he agencies implement the CVPIA ... in a way that bears little resemblance to the integrated, coordinated, holistic vision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>the Final Restoration Plan.\u201d (Cummins et al.2008 at 9)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-4\">Most relevant to this consultation, the review panel observed that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlVk\">\u201c[i]t would seem that CVPIA activities and personnel should be central to the OCAP plan, the Section 7 consultation, and the agencies\u2019 efforts to satisfy the requirements of the ESA (that is, after all, one of the directives of the CVPIA). The panel received no information or presentations on the involvement of the CVPIA program or personnel in the ESA consultation effort ... and in the determination of what actions the agencies should be taking to meet the ESA.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">(Cummins et al.2008 at 11)</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Id. The CVPIA contains prescriptives; it does not elevate the ESA over all other statutory purposes for use of Project water. Although specific provisions of the law may authorize finite increase in fish protection water appropriation, there is no indefinite, unlimited power for NMFS to take whatever Project water it deems essential for the species.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">The BiOp also finds that \u201cstate law gives DWR authority to provide for needs of fish and wildlife independent of the connection of the two water projects.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-8\">According to the [Biological Assessment], DWR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-9\">\u201cis required to plan for recreational and fish and wildlife uses of water in connection with State-constructed water projects and can acquire land for such uses (WatCode Sec. 233, 345,346, 12582). The Davis-Dolwig Act (WatCode Sec. 11900-11925) establishes the policy that preservation of fish and wildlife is part of State costs to be paid by water supply contractors, and recreation and enhancement of fish and wildlife are to be provided by appropriations from the General Fund.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-10\">(CVP/SWP operations BA, page 1-4) DWR, like Reclamation, has broad authority to preserve and enhance fish and wildlife.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">Id. at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">Although \u00a7 402.02\u2019s RPA requirements demand that NMFS engage in an evaluation of its legal authority to implement the RPA Actions, NMFS\u2019s interpretations of these laws set forth in the BiOp are not entitled to deference, as they were neither promulgated through notice and comment rulemaking procedures, see <em>Chevron v. NRDC, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), nor contained within an agency policy statement, manual, enforcement guideline, or other document entitled to limited deference, see <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944); <em>Christensen v. Harris County, </em>529 U.S. 576, 587, 120 S.Ct. 1655, 146 L.Ed.2d 621 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-13\">State and federal law impose upon Reclamation and DWR a nondiscretionary duty to comply with state water rights law. See 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 383; <em>California v. United States, </em>438 U.S. 645, 675, 98 S.Ct. 2985, 57 L.Ed.2d 1018 (1978). Export Plaintiffs point to the \u201cobligation imposed upon both Reclamation and DWR by D-1641 to comply with the reasonable and beneficial use requirements and prohibition against waste [of water] set forth in Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution, in their respective operations of the CVP and SWP.\u201d Doc. 431 at 117. The argument continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-14\">Because there is no indication in the record that NMFS undertook any analysis of whether DWR and Reclamation have jurisdiction and authority under the reasonable and beneficial use requirements of California law to annually reallocate hundreds of thousands of acre feet of project water, particularly where the benefits to listed salmonid species <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>have not been demonstrated, the requirements of Section 402.02 and the ESA have been violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">It is undisputed that California law identifies the preservation of fish and wildlife as a beneficial use of water. Cal. Water Code \u00a7 1243. In addition to requiring compliance with California\u2019s reasonable and beneficial use standard, D-1641 imposes a condition upon both Reclamation\u2019s and DWR\u2019s water rights requiring both to \u201cmeet[ ] all requirements of the applicable Endangered Species Act for the project authorized under [their respective] permit[s]/license[s].\u201d D-1641 at 148. When jeopardy is found, the ESA requires implementation of a RPA. D-1641 authorizes Reclamation\u2019s implementation of lawful RPAs.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">However, several of the specific RPA prescriptions have failed to demonstrate compliance with the Handbook\u2019s requirement that every RPA be <em>\u201cessential </em>to avoid jeopardy and/or adverse modification.\u201d Obviously, to the extent that any RPA Action has been found unlawful, Federal Defendants cannot establish that implementation of that RPA is consistent with Reclamation\u2019s legal authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">Export Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that NMFS failed to demonstrate the RPA\u2019s consistency with Reclamation and DWR\u2019s legal authority is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART, as are Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions. To the extent individual RPA Actions are otherwise lawful, Export Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Federal Defendants\u2019 failed to demonstrate Reclamation\u2019s authority to implement those Actions is belied by D-1641, which expressly <em>requires </em>implementation of lawful RPA Actions. Correlatively, to the extent individual RPA Actions are unlawful, Federal Defendants cannot find authority for their implementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">3. <em>Economic and Technical Feasibility.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">The BiOp contains a lengthy discussion of economic and technical feasibility. Export Plaintiffs attack the discussion as insufficient in several respects. First, Export Plaintiffs argue that NMFS ignored objections and evidence submitted by Reclamation and DWR suggesting that the RPA was not technologically or economically feasible. A March 23, 2009 letter from Reclamation to NMFS details a number of concerns with the proposed RPA. See AR 00105277-84. A March 20, 2009 letter from DWR to NMFS describes some specific feasibility concerns and a general objection that several of the RPA actions were not economically feasible. See AR 00105285-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">Export Plaintiffs object generally that NMFS failed to articulate a reasoned response to DWR and Reclamation\u2019s objections. Doc. 431 at 114. The BiOp explained that the relevant state and federal agencies engaged in a back-and-forth exchange of information regarding feasibility of the RPA and adjustments were made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADAm\">Some of the more complex RPA actions, including Shasta Storage, Habitat Rearing Actions, Passage Program, Stanislaus Flows and the San Joaquin River Inflow Export Ratio, went through many iterations of review, re-drafting, and refinement, involving interagency staff and management expertise, including biology, ecology, hydrology, and operations, in order to ensure that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>actions were based on best available science, would be effective in avoiding jeopardy, and would be feasible to implement. NMFS also secured outside contractual services to provide additional modeling expertise in evaluating draft RPA actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-4\">Examples of Feasibility Concerns in RPA Actions As a result of this iterative consultation process, NMFS considered economic and technological feasibility in several ways when developing the CVP/ SWP operations RPA. Examples include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-5\">1) Providing reasonable time to develop technologically feasible alternatives where none are \u201cready to go\u201d \u2014 e.g., the Delta engineering action (Action IV.1.3), and lower Sacramento River rearing habitat action (Action 1.6.1);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-6\">2) Calling for a stepped approach to fish passage at dams, including studies and pilot projects, prior to a significant commitment of resources to build a ladder or invest in a permanent trap and haul program. A reinitiation trigger is built into this action in the event passage is not deemed feasible, prior to construction of permanent infrastructure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-7\">3) Considering limitations of the overall capacity of CVP/SWP systems of reservoirs in determining feasibility of flow actions below reservoirs, and considering the hydrologic record and CALSIM modeling results (Shasta/Sacramento River, Folsom/American River, New Melones/Stanislaus River).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-8\">4) Tiering actions to water year type and/or storage in order to conserve storage at reservoirs and not unduly impact water supplies during drought (e.g., see appendix 5);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-9\">5) Providing health and safety exceptions for export curtailments;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-10\">6) Using monitoring for species presence to initiate actions when biologically supported and most needed, in order to limit the duration of export curtailments;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-11\">7) Incorporating scientific uncertainty into the design of the action, when appropriate, in order to refine the action over time (e.g., 6-year acoustic tag study for San Joaquin steelhead).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-12\">8) Incorporating performance goals into more complex actions (for example, Shasta storage, rearing habitat and San Joaquin acoustic tag study). A performance goal approach will allow for adaptation of the action over time to incorporate the most up-to-date thinking on cost-effective technologies or operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-13\">9) Allowing for interim, further constrained, water deliveries to TCCA through modified RBDD operations for 3 years, while an alternative pumping plant is being built.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-14\">Id. at 719-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-15\">NMFS viewed adaptive management as another tool to address feasibility issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKi\">The RPA includes collaborative research to enhance scientific understanding of the species and ecosystem, and to adapt actions to new scientific knowledge. This adaptive structure is important, given the long-term nature of the consultation and the scientific uncertainty inherent in a highly variable system. Monitoring and adaptive management are both built into many of the individual actions and are the subject of an annual program review. This annual program review will provide for additional opportunities to address any unforeseen concerns about RPA feasibility that may arise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-16\">Id. at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-17\">Export Plaintiffs do not identify any specific technological feasibility objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>that was not addressed by NMFS\u2019s adjustments to the draft RPA. Export Plaintiffs do argue that NMFS ignored \u201cextensive evidence\u201d submitted by DWR about economic feasibility. DWR informed NMFS of its opinion as to the economic impact of the RPA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-5\">For the 2004 scenario, the NMFS draft RPA would have a net economic impact of about $320 million to $390 million per year while the combined costs of both the USFWS and NMFS opinions would be about $500 million to $670 million per year. For the 2030 scenario, the NMFS draft RPA in the Delta would have a net economic impact of about $320 million to $390 million per year while the combined costs of both the USFWS and NMFS opinions would be about $480 million to $620 million per year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">AR 00113831-32. Export Plaintiffs argue that according to DWR\u2019s figures, the net cost of the NMFS RPA over a 20-year implementation period could exceed $8 billion dollars. Doc. 431 at 115. Based on its own figures, DWR urged NMFS to find that the RPA did not meet the standard for economic feasibility. AR 00113831-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">Does section 402.02 contemplate consideration of economic costs to third parties or just to the action agencies? Without any analysis or legal authority, the district court in <em>Kandra </em>concluded: \u201cRead in context ... the RPAs must be economically and technically feasible <em>for the government to implement.\u201d Id. </em>at 1207 (emphasis added). The regulation itself does not specify whether feasibility should be limited to the economic impact on the action agencies or on others affected by the agency action. Defendants contend the regulation must be interpreted in a manner that does not violate <em>TVA v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 184, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978), which concluded that Congress enacted the ESA to \u201chalt and reverse the trend toward species extinction, <em>whatever the cost.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This language directs the conclusion that the economic feasibility requirement refers only to the costs to the action agency, requiring analysis of whether the corrective measures required by an RPA can be implemented from a purely budgetary perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">NMFS engaged in such an analysis. Starting with its 330,000 AF water supply impact projection, which has been remanded for other reasons, NMFS examined the impact of water supply reductions on Reclamation and DWRs costs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-10\">In evaluating economic feasibility, NMFS examined the direct costs of the modified operations to the Federal action agency, Reclamation. According to the [California State Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office (\u201cLAO\u201d) ], 85% of Reclamation\u2019s costs are reimbursed by water users, and 95% of DWR\u2019s SWP costs are reimbursed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-11\">Irrigation water users pay about 55 percent of CVP reimbursable costs ($1.6 billion), while municipal and industrial water users are responsible for the remaining 45 percent (or about $1.3 billion). These reimbursements are paid through long-term contracts with water agencies. The total capital cost to construct the CVP as of September 30, 2006, is about $3.4 billion. The federal Bureau of Reclamation calculates how much of the capital construction cost is reimbursable from water users. Currently, users pay about 85 percent of total costs. In contrast, more than 95 percent of SWP\u2019s costs are reimbursable from water users. The costs assigned to such CVP purposes as flood control, navigation, and fish and wildlife needs are not reimbursable and are paid by the federal government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-12\">(LAO, 2008) Through this arrangement, costs to the action agency itself are minimized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>BiOp at 723. NMFS also evaluated direct Project Costs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-4\">In addition to water costs, Reclamation and DWR will incur project costs associated with certain RPA actions (e.g., the fish passage program). The State of California has authorized $19.6 billion in water-related general obligation bonds since 2000, and these bonds often contain provisions for environmental conservation related purposes (LAO, 2008).

While there is some record support for the general approaches used in these RPA Actions, the specific prescriptions imposed are not sufficiently justified.

Action IV.4 does not relegate the 75% target to the status of a \u201cperformance goal.\u201d The action sets a requirement for the Bureau and DWR \u201cshall each achieve a whole facility salvage efficiency of 75 percent.\u201d Id. at 653.

DWR maintains that NMFS arbitrarily took the \u201cgoal\u201d of Action IV.4, namely achieving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>75% salvage efficiency for the Skinner Fish Facility, turned it into an \u201caction,\u201d and \u201cslapped a date for compliance on the goal.\u201d Doc. 446-1. DWR\u2019s first premise \u2014 that the 75% efficiency target in Action IV.4.2 is a \u201cgoal\u201d' \u2014 is mistaken. Nor is it inherently illogical for NMFS to impose a compliance deadline for the 75% target. DWR has been studying salvage efficiency and ways to improve the salvage process for many years, see, e.g., AR 00109712-31, and NMFS was warned by a Reclamation biologist with experience working with individuals at the facility that without a deadline, improvements might never take place, AR 00105052. The deadline of December 31, 2012 provided DWR with approximately three and a half years from the adoption of the BiOp in June 2009. DWR has not demonstrated that imposing this deadline was irrational or arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">DWR next argues that the record does not support the conclusion that the standard of 75% efficiency at the Skinner Fish Facility is technologically or economically feasible. DWR points to its assertion in a March 20, 2009 letter to NMFS that it might not be possible to meet the December 31, 2012 deadline.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-5\">Part 1 of this action is infeasible because it requires DWR to operate Skinner Fish Protection Facility to achieve a minimum 75% salvage efficiency for salmonids and green sturgeon by December 31, 2012. While DWR can strive to achieve this rate of success by that date, there is uncertainty that it can occur within that timeframe. To incrementally improve the salvage efficiency within Skinner Fish Protection Facility will require the efficiency of each component to be determined and a strategy developed to identify the most effective improvements to be made. Testing within a hydraulic lab may be required to evaluate the improvements of potential structural changes within the facility. In addition, making the actual modifications will take time. It is quite likely that these efforts will extend past the required implementation date. We recommend that a process involving the annual progress reports required by January 31st be incorporated into this action. The process would involve the review of the annual status report by DWR and NMFS to determine if satisfactory progress is being made toward meeting the salvage requirement and, if it is determined that satisfactory progress is being made but the deadline of December 31,2012 will not be met, NMFS will adjust the deadline accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">AR 00078204. That DWR\u2019s expressed \u201cuncertainty\u201d to NMFS that it could not meet the higher target by the end of 2010 does not mean the action is \u201cinfeasible.\u201d One and one-half years remain to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">DWR also maintains that NMFS had information indicating that DWR could not even complete the necessary studies on the current facilities\u2019 efficiency by the deadline. Steelhead studies had been ongoing since 2005, AR 00003660, 3642, 4105, 4128-29. DWR maintains that \u201c[tjhere are no similar studies as to sturgeon and salmon and \u201c[f]rom the steelhead facility study, NMFS was aware that a study on facility efficiency would take at least three years to perform.\u201d However, DWR provides no record citation to support this three-year timeframe. To the contrary, the methods described in a 2008 technical study plan for the Tracy Fish Facility suggest that the actual experiments would be run over a period of only several months. AR 00078557, 00078563 (explaining that efficiency experiments for fiscal year 2009 will be \u201ccompleted during the months of March-June,\u201d with results available by August 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>DWR next argues \u201cthe standard for efficiency imposed by NMFS seems to have changed from 90%, to 80%, to 75%\u201d without explanation as to whether one or any of the standards was economically or technologically feasible. Doc. 446-1 at 6. Federal Defendants emphasize that a study cited by DWR found that the Skinner Fish Collection Facility is already operating at an estimated 74% efficiency for steelhead. AR 00113798 (cited in BiOp at 346). Federal Defendants further explain the reasoning behind the 75% efficiency standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-5\">... NMFS\u2019s decision to require this efficiency rate was based on numerous studies and NMFS\u2019s own technical experience working with both the state and federal facilities over the last 20 years. In choosing the 75% salvage efficiency at the Skinner Fish Facility, NMFS considered, among other things: (i) the fish facilities\u2019 original design, which was 90-95% efficiency based on juvenile striped bass similar in size to Chinook salmon smolts; (ii) historical efficiency testing performed by the California Department of Fish and Game; (iii) and current efficiency estimates performed by DWR, which is 74% \u00b1 7%. NMFS 00113798. NMFS considered whether the original 90-95% design efficiency could be met at the facilities. However, over the years the efficiency of both the State and the Federal facility has varied due a variety of problems in the southern Delta, including, among other things, surface water levels, aquatic weeds, corrosion, introduced species like the mitten crab, and infrastructure age. NMFS 50871-73; NMFS 112963 (DWR noting similar \u201cchallenges\u201d). Thus, given these changes in Delta conditions, NMFS concluded it would be unreasonable to assume the original 90-95% design efficiency could be met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-6\">To determine a reasonable efficiency rate, NMFS also reviewed the history of the facilities and consulted with the Denver Technical Center. Contrary to DWR\u2019s claim that \u201cfacility efficiency is currently unknown,\u201d DWR Br. at 6, there have been a number of studies to determine the what that efficiency rate is in order to mitigate for the loss of striped bass and Chinook salmon (i.e., mitigation requirements established in the 1986 4-Pumps Agreement between DFG and DWR). A study conducted by DFG and DWR in 1994 based on 13 years of data established methods and a process for DWR to use to calculate the facility efficiency at each one of its four bays. NMFS 109712-731 (Brown et al.1996). A review of the salmon losses related to the CVP and SWP export pumping in that study found that facility efficiency ranged from 70 \u2014 85% at the primary louvers, and 70 \u2014 95% at the secondary louvers for the Skinner Fish Facility. NMFS 109712-731 (Brown et al.1996). NMFS\u2019s 75% criteria is within the established range and conservatively lower than the average efficiency as stated in previous studies. Similarly, the first biological opinion on winter-run Chinook salmon assumed 75% salvage efficiency in calculating the loss at Skinner Fish Facility. NMFS 127399-454 (NMFS 1992).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-8\">Moreover, the current Skinner Fish Facility efficiency, which is calculated on a daily basis by DFG in order to estimate the loss at facility, uses a efficiency rate for the louvers is 0.630 for fish &lt; 101 mm and 0.568 for fish 100 mm, plus the primary channel flow divided by the primary channel volume. Overall, calculated louver efficiencies are typically in the range of 70-80% for most salmon that enter the facility. See e.g., NMFS 109725-26 (estimating \u201c70 and 85 percent\u201d at primary louvers and \u201c70 to 95 percent\u201d at secondary louvers, and noting CDFG \u201ccombined the data to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>an overall ... screen efficiency ... calculated as 0.630 for fish &lt; 101 mm, and 0.568 for fish 100 mm, divided by an approach velocity\u201d). Critically, DWR\u2019s own brief states that the Skinner Fish Facility efficiency \u201cwas estimated to be 74% +7%\u201d in a 2008 DWR study, DWR Br. at 6, which meets the criteria set forth in the BiOp. NMFS 113798. Thus, it is possible that no further action may be necessary, except to initiate a study to determine efficiency for green sturgeon through the facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Doc. 477 at 104-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">DWR argues that Brown, et al. (1996) is based upon obsolete data collected at the louvers approximately 40 years ago, in 1970 and 1971. AR 00109725. The Brown study recognized that changes to the Skinner Fish Facility had been made between the time the data was collected and the article\u2019s publication. AR 00109728. Therefore, DWR argues that the data relied upon in Brown, et al. (1996) does not reflect the current or potential efficiency at the Skinner Fish Facility. Doc. 495 at 10. Nor does the data reflect the entire process by which DWR protects fish at Skinner, which involves handling, trucking, and releasing entrained fish. The focus of Action 4.2.1(1) is the overall efficiency of the Skinner Facility, not just the louver facility. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Federal Defendants do not respond to these critiques of the obviously outdated Brown (1996) study, but instead focus on the fact that DWR\u2019s own 2007 study predicted that efficiency at the entire Skinner Facility was estimated to be \u201c74 \u00b1 5% (mean \u00b195% Confidence Interval) for the 2007 study period. AR 00113798. DWR objects that \u201ceven this data does not support Federal Defendants\u2019 conclusion that an improvement of 1% to 75% overall efficiency standard for operating the Skinner Fish Facility as to Chinook salmon, steel-head trout, and green sturgeon, is economically and technologically feasible by the date imposed under the BiOp.\u201d Doc. 495 at 10-11. Based on the information before NMFS, was it unreasonable to conclude that a 1% improvement was technologically or economically feasible? NMFS justifies its conclusion on the ground that DWR \u201cdid not say it <em>could not </em>possibly reach a one percent higher efficiency target by 2012.\u201d Doc. 477-1 at 107 (emphasis added). Rather, DWR\u2019s comment letter stated that DWR had \u201cuncertainty\u201d as to whether the efficiency improvements were feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">To uphold an agency\u2019s decision, its rationale must \u201creasonably be discerned,\u201d from the record. See <em>Modesto Irr. Dist., </em>619 F.3d at 1035. Here, NMFS has failed to cite any record evidence indicating that the efficiency improvement, albeit a minor one, is economically or technologically feasible.

AR 00117410-441 (Gingras 1997). DWR con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>cedes that pre-screen loss at the Forebay is estimated at between 63 and 99% for juvenile Chinook salmon. Doc. 446-1 at 7 (citing BiOp at 348 and AR 00106736).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">It is also undisputed that reducing predation would improve survival across the Forebay. See AR 00113817 (DWR (2008)). However, DWR argues that the record does not support Action IV.4.2(2)\u2019s imposition of the specific requirement that DWR reduce \u201cpredation\u201d in the Forebay to 40%. In support of Action IY.4.2(d), NMFS cites a 2008 DWR study that in turn cites a 1952 study by Ricker. Doc. 477-1 (citing AR 113817). Ricker concluded that when survival rates are below 25%, a reduction of <em>predator numbers </em>to below 50% can double the survival rate of the prey. But, DWR points out that Ricker\u2019s finding that <em>predator numbers </em>should be reduced to below 50% is distinct from whether <em>predation </em>should be reduced to below 50%.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In response, Federal Defendants disclaim reliance on Ricker, asserting that NMFS considered DWR (2008) as support for the proposition that predator removal is a method of reducing pre-screen loss. Doc. 515 at 44. Rather than rely directly on Ricker\u2019s work, NMFS \u201creasoned by simple math that if predation was reduced by half to no more than 40%, giving 60% survival rather than 20-25% survival, overall survival through the Skinner Facility would reach approximately 39%, roughly equivalent to the current CVP survival efficiency.\u201d Id. Federal Defendants provide no record citation related to this imprecise guestimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">Even if the 40% target is scientifically justified, whether predation in the Fore-bay is a problem and/or whether a reduction to 40% is a reasonable goal is an entirely different inquiry from whether reducing predation to 40% is <em>feasible. </em>NMFS mentions numerous examples of methods of reducing predators on juvenile salmon and steelhead, but nothing in the record indicates whether the 40% target can be met, or whether it could be met by the deadline imposed by the BiOp.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> It cannot be determined from the existing record whether NMFS\u2019s feasibility determinations are supportable.

Dam construction and water diversion for mining and irrigation purposes began during and after the Gold rush. Goodwin Dam, constructed in 1913, was probably the first permanent barrier to significantly affect Chinook salmon access to upstream habitat. Goodwin Dam had a fishway, but Chinook could seldom pass it. Steelhead may have been similarly affected. The original Melones Dam, completed in 1926, permanently prevented access to upstream areas for all salmonids. Currently, steelhead can ascend over 58 miles up the Stanislaus River to the base of Goodwin Dam. Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>though steelhead spawning locations are unknown in the Stanislaus, most are thought to occur upstream of the City of Oakdale where gradients are slightly higher and more riffle habitat is available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-5\">The Fishery Foundation of California (Kennedy and Cannon 2002) has monitored habitat use by juvenile steel-head/rainbow since 2000 by snorkeling seven sites from Oakdale to Goodwin Dam every other week. Steelhead fry begin to show up in late March and April at upstream sites, with densities increasing into June and distribution becoming more even between upstream and downstream sites through July. Beginning in August and continuing through the winter months, densities appeared highest at upstream sites (Goodwin to Knights Ferry). Age 1-plus fish were observed throughout the year with densities generally higher at upstream sites (Goodwin to Knights Ferry). Low densities were observed from late December until April. It is unknown whether fish left the system in December or if, with the cooler winter water temperatures, they were less active and more concealed during the day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-6\">Since 1993, catches of juvenile steel-head/rainbow in rotary screw traps (RSTs) indicate a small portion of the Stanislaus River steelhead/rainbow population displays downstream migratory characteristics at a time that is typical of steelhead migrants elsewhere. The capture of these fish in downstream migrant traps and the advanced smolting characteristics exhibited by many of the fish indicate that some steelhead/rainbow juveniles might migrate to the ocean in spring. However, it is not known whether the parents of these fish were anadromous or fluvial (they migrate within freshwater). Resident populations of steelhead/rainbow in large streams are typically fluvial and migratory juveniles look much like smolts. Further work is needed to determine the parental life histories that are producing migratory juveniles. The Stanislaus River Weir has been installed annually since 2003 at RM 31.4. The primary purpose of the weir[] is to monitor escapement of fall-run Chinook salmon, so it is installed from September through June each year. Fish passing the weir are monitored using a Vaki infrared RiverWatcher Fish Counter. From 2003 through 2007, O. mykiss have been observed passing the weir a total of 16 times. Scale analysis of one individual indicated that it was a steelhead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-8\">Smolts have been captured each year since 1995 in RSTs at Caswell State Park and at Oakdale (Demko et al.2000). Captures occurred throughout the time the traps were run, generally January through June. Most fish were between 175 and 300 mm at the Caswell site, with only six fish in seven years less than 100 mm. Larger numbers of fry were captured upstream at Oakdale. During 2001, 33 smolts were captured at Caswell and 55 were captured at Oakdale, the highest catch of all years. Although improved traps were used, the higher catch in 2001, was likely due to more fish present and not due to better trap efficiencies (Doug Demko, personal communication, 2001). RSTs are generally not considered efficient at catching fish as large as steelhead smolts and the number captured is too small to estimate capture efficiency so no steelhead smolt outmigration population estimated has been calculated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">USBR AR 007670-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">The BiOp describes the impacts of proposed operation of New Melones on survival of CV steelhead and its critical habitat, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>BiOp at 296-313, and imposes a number of RPAs that affect the New Melones Unit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-4\">\u2022 Action III.l. \u2014 Establishes a real-time operational decision-making team, the Stanislaus Operations Group (\u201cSOG\u201d), to \u201cprovide direction and oversight to ensure that the East Side Division actions are implemented, monitored for effectiveness and evaluated.\u201d Id. at 620.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-5\">\u2022 Action III.1.2 \u2014 Requires Reclamation to make releases from New Melones to achieve specified water temperatures at two locations downstream of Goodwin Dam.

The ESA\u2019s consultation requirement applies to \u201cagency actions.\u201d See 16 U.S.C. 1536(a)(2). The ESA implementing regulations define \u201caction\u201d to mean \u201call activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>ties or programs of any kind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.\u201d 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02. No regulation defines the scope of the action to be considered. The question is whether NMFS\u2019s definition of the scope of the action is reasonable in light of the record. See <em>PCFFA, </em>426 F.3d at 1090 (\u201cEven when an agency explains its decision with less than ideal clarity, a reviewing court will not upset the decision on that account if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">SR Plaintiffs make two attacks on NMFS\u2019s decision to include New Melones in the Project Description. They first argue that the touchstone of inclusion in the action appears to be \u201ccoordination\u201d of the Unit in question with Project operations. For example, the SWP is included in the action because its operations are closely coordinated with those of the CVP through the Coordinated Operating Agreement. BiOp at 31; USBR AR 007495 (BA 1-4) (\u201cSWP operations are coordinated with CVP operations and, as such, are consulted on as part of the proposed action described in the BA.\u201d). In contrast, the Friant Unit was deliberately excluded from the action because it operates separately from the rest of the CVP and is not integrated into the CVP OCAP.\u201d BiOp App. 1 at 79. ' SR Plaintiffs argue that while \u201cNew Melones is an element of the CVP, it is also clear that operation of New Melones is not coordinated with the operation of the rest of the CVP and/or SWP.\u201d Doc. 454 at 37. This assertion is belied by the record. Stanislaus Plaintiffs admit that New Mel-ones is one of the major reservoirs in the CVP system and releases from it are needed to meet non-consumptive downstream purposes, such as water quality and the preservation and enhancement of fish and wildlife in both the Stanislaus and San Joaquin rivers. Id. at 37-38; see also Sixth Milligan Decl., Doc. 517 at \u00b6 10 (explaining that \u201c[rjeleases from New Mel-ones down the Stanislaus River affect Reclamation\u2019s ability to comply with Vernalis flow and water quality requirements.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">SR Plaintiffs also argue that inclusion of New Melones in the action subject to consultation will lead to \u201cabsurd results\u201d because the Incidental Take Statement provides that the RPAs must be implemented as a whole and if Reclamation and/or DWR fail to comply with the terms of the ITS, they may no longer comply with the ESA. See BiOp at 728. SR Plaintiffs maintain that this is \u201cabsurd given the lack of coordination\u201d between New Melones and other operations of the CVP and SWP. Doc. 454 at 38. \u201cSimply put, what happens on the Sacramento River as a result of actions taken by the CVP and/or SWP has nothing to do with the listed species contained in the Stanislaus River, and vice-versa.\u201d Id.

Baseline Effects.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">SR Plaintiffs argue that the BiOp is unlawful because NMFS improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>identified as \u201ceffects of the action,\u201d effects caused by the existence of New Melones Dam. Doc. 454 at 18-21. Specifically, SR Plaintiffs point to the BiOp\u2019s conclusions that the action (1) altered flows, which impact habitat conditions and survival at various life history stages, and (2) modified the hydrograph to dampen peak flood flows, mute flow variability, and reduce or eliminate channel forming flows. Id. at 19. SR Plaintiffs maintain that \u201c[t]hese are effects associated with the fact that the dam exists, rather than effects associated with the operational plan.\u201d Id. at 20. SR Plaintiffs\u2019 seminal argument is that NMFS has \u201cfailed to identify with any clarity how continued operations, as opposed to the basic existence of the dam itself, cause any additional incremental harm to steelhead, deepen their jeopardy, or otherwise \u2018tip\u2019 them into extinction.\u201d Doc. 454 at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">The record does explain how continued operations will cause additional incremental harm. The BiOp compares effects of the action both to pre-dam \u201cunimpeded\u201d conditions and to the \u201cfuture baseline\u201d which includes the existence of the dams:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4I8\"><em>The future baseline of the existing dams prevents </em>access <em>to historical habitat, but the proposed operations of the dams control the quality and quantity of available alternative habitat below Goodwin Dam and the suitability of the physical conditions to support CV steel-head at various life history stages. </em>Survival of CV steelhead may be affected by operations of the East Side Division in the following ways:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-5\">\u2022 Operational releases control extent of cool water habitat available below Goodwin Dam.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-6\">\u2022 Operational release levels control the quantity and functionality of in-stream habitat for spawning, egg incubation, juvenile rearing and smoltifieation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-7\">\u2022 Operational releases are typically lower than unimpaired flows, requiring smolting juveniles to expend more energy to outmigrate and lower stream velocities increase the exposure of juveniles and smolts to predation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-8\">sfc * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-9\">The proposed New Melones operations will create an altered hydrograph as compared to the unimpaired flows and <em>as compared to the future baseline. </em>The dampening of flood events and freshets eliminates the geomorphic processes that are important to CV steel-head to replenish and rejuvenate spawning riffles and to inundate floodplain terraces to provide nutrients and rearing habitat for juvenile salmonids. The Corps has limited controlled flood releases from New Melones Dam to 8,000 cfs. The dampening of flood events also eliminates or reduces the intensity and duration of freshets and storm flows that would otherwise convey smolting CV steelhead to the ocean and create a clear signature for the river. A more moderated hydrograph has eliminated periodic channel forming flows. The dams (a future baseline condition) capture sediment that would otherwise be transported downstream for geomorphic processes. Operations of the dams result in channel incision that further reduces the chance of inundated floodplain habitat and degrades spawning habitat quality. Releases from New Melones can affect downstream temperatures at critical times to affect adult migration, spawning, egg incubation success, juvenile survival and anadromy. Predicted increases in temperature as a result of climate change will affect in-stream water temperatures directly, and will affect New Melones operations as more precipitation will fall as rain, rather than snow, and as storm event intensity is expected to increase. Cli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>mate change may affect the types and cover rates of vegetation upslope of the river, potentially increasing the rate of f\u00edne sediment transport to the river and to spawning areas. Future baseline stressors that are exacerbated by the proposed East Side Division operations include increased vulnerability to nonnative fish predators owing to flow velocities and downstream temperatures conducive to these species and competition from resident 0. mykiss, which may be more abundant as a result of less variability in instream conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APu\">BiOp at 300-301 (emphasis added). The subsequent pages provide more specific support for these conclusions. Id. at 302-309.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">SR Plaintiffs specifically challenge only one aspect of this analysis; NMFS\u2019s reliance on a 2001 Kondolf, et al. study to support the assertion that available steel-head spawning gravel habitat decreased 40% since 1994. BiOp at 308. Kondolf, et al. (2001) concluded that spawning gravel habitat decreased 40% between 1972 and 1993, and thereafter decreased by a smaller percentage, within the study\u2019s margin of error, between 1993 and 2000, excluding gravel augmentation efforts. The significance of this minor error to SR Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is unclear. The BiOp does not specifically attribute this 40% loss to Project operations. Rather, later in the same paragraph, NMFS explains with specificity the ongoing impact of dam operations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-6\">Operational criteria have resulted in channel incision of 1-3 feet since the construction and operation of New Mel-ones Reservoir (Kondolf et al.2001). This downcutting, combined with operational criteria, have effectively cut off overbank flows which would have inundated floodplain rearing habitat, as well as providing areas for fine sediment deposition, rather than within spawning gravels, as occurs now. Additionally, the flow reductions in late spring and early summer are too rapid to allow recruitment of large riparian trees such as Fremont cottonwoods. Consequently, within 10 to 20 years as existing trees scenes and fall, there will be no younger riparian trees to replace them, resulting in less riparian shading, higher instream temperatures, less food production from allochtonous sources, and less LWD for nutrients and channel eomplexity[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">BiOp at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">SR Plaintiffs do not dispute the science underlying this conclusion, nor do they suggest that the impacts of operations, per se, are de minimis. Rather, they argue that the real issue is whether the amount of New Melones water within Reclamation\u2019s <em>discretion </em>is significant enough to cause appreciable harm to CV Steelhead and/or appreciable diminishment of its critical habitat. See Doc. 492 at 4-6. The median historical unimpaired runoff in the Stanislaus River Basin is 1.1 million acre feet per year (\u201cMAFY\u201d). BiOp App. 1 at 69. OID and SSJID are legally entitled to the first 600,000 AF. USBR AR 011751-53. In addition, Reclamation must release between 98,300 and 302,000 AF for fish pursuant to its agreement with CDFG.

See Doc. 515 at 49. For example, while OID and SSJID have an entitlement to 600,000 AF, past water use data demonstrates that this full amount is not always requested, which in turn changes the amount of water available for other beneficial uses. See Hilts Decl., Doc. 480, Ex. 1 (showing that during the 1987-1992 drought, OID and SSJID never requested full allocation). In addition, Reclamation has the ability to request temporary exemptions from SWRCB conditions such as for dissolved oxygen and Vernalis flow objectives when warranted, and assumptions to reflect this option were inserted into the CalSim II modeling for the Stanislaus River. Fifth Milligan Decl., Doc. 479 at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Hilts Decl., Doc. 480 at \u00b6 12. Defendants do not suggest these are not Home Builders non-discretionary obligations on Reclamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">SR Plaintiffs argue that NMFS must independently demonstrate that discretionary operations alone satisfy the jeopardy/adverse modification standard. This contention was rejected above. The ESA does not require the agency to segregate discretionary from non-discretionary impacts for the purposes of the effects analysis. (Whether an agency can implement an RPA within its legal authority if an insufficient amount of discretionary water is available is a different question.) Given that there is some discretionary water in the New Melones system and that Reclamation authority over how make discretionary deliveries, is there enough discretionary project water to cause appreciable harm to the species?</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">The BiOp identifies several negative impacts caused by Project operations, including increasing the likelihood that CV Steelhead will be exposed to unfavorable temperatures at various life stages and, by lowering instream flows, the amount of energy juveniles and smolts must expend to avoid predation is increased. BiOp at 301. SR Plaintiffs do not challenge these underlying findings. The BiOp does not have to demonstrate that these negative effects, alone, satisfy the jeopardy standard by \u201creducing] appreciably the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of [the] listed species in the wild by reducing the reproduction, numbers, or distribution of that species.\u201d Rather, the jeopardy analysis must determine the overall impact on the species of the <em>entire project, </em>not just the New Melones unit. See 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.14 (NMFS\u2019s obligation during formal consultation is to determine \u201cwhether the action, taken together with cumulative effects, is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">SR Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that the BiOp\u2019s effects analysis is unlawful because it does not properly distinguish between baseline effects and effects of the action is DENIED; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are GRANTED on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">2. <em>Challenge to Critical Habitat Adverse Modification Finding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">SR Plaintiffs complain that NMFS has not specifically identified how the proposed action will cause \u201cadverse modification\u201d to the steelhead\u2019s critical habitat.

Doc. 492 at 8. The BiOp found that steelhead spawning habitat would be \u201cmaximized\u201d if instream flows were maintained at 200 cfs. However, operations for the protection of fall-run Chinook require higher flow rates may \u201cconflict\u201d with the needs of steelhead. BiOp at 311. SR Plaintiffs argue that habitat \u201cmaximization\u201d is not a requirement of the ESA and is not relevant to the effects analysis. Doc. 492 at 8. NMFS does not explain why it set the benchmark for evaluating project impacts at the spawning habitat \u201cmaximum.\u201d To ascertain whether project operations will impact the likelihood of CV steelhead survival and recovery, the more appropriate benchmark is that amount of habitat that is \u201cessential\u201d for survival and recovery. The BiOp does not identify the extent of this \u201cessential\u201d habitat or how it relates to the \u201cmaximum\u201d habitat. The use of the \u201cmaximum\u201d habitat benchmark necessarily resulted in a finding of adverse modification to this aspect of CV habitat. That finding is not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">SR Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment that the record does not support NMFS\u2019s findings regarding spawnable area is GRANTED; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">b. <em>Spawning Gravel Quality and Quantity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">SR Plaintiffs dispute the BiOp\u2019s findings related to \u201cSpawning Gravel Quality and Quantity.\u201d The entire section on this topic provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-10\">Pebble counts and sediment size analysis of spawning areas has shown an increase in sand and fine material in spawning beds since construction of New Melones Dam (Kondolf et al.2001, Mesick 2001).

This is not of sufficient volume to offset the deficits created by the loss of recruitment from upstream sources (over 1 million cubic yards, Kondolf et al.2001).

The BiOp explains that \u201c[bjecause CV steelhead are unable to reach their historical spawning areas above Goodwin Dam, they are dependent on East Side Division operations maintaining temperatures suitable for spawning below the dam...\u201d and concludes that appropriate temperature conditions likely cannot be met for April and May for future operations.

The relevant section of the BiOp provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-11\">Under proposed operations the freshwater migration corridors on the Stanislaus River will continue to require juvenile CV steelhead to pass through predator-rich abandoned mining pits, incised channels that limit channel complexity and water temperatures that may be physiologically lethal or sublethal. The spring pulse flows defined in VAMP are generally less than the spring pulse flows measured in 1989, a critically dry year (Kondolf et al.2001), hence the operational assistance provided to assist CV steelhead outmigrants is only representative of the lowest migratory volumes historically experienced by CV steelhead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-12\">Channel incision resulting from post New Melones operations has produced overhanging large wood and river edge aquatic vegetation but the lack of scouring and channel forming flows has effectively channelized and simplified the corridor.

Obstruction of access to historic spawning and rearing habitat requires CV steelhead to utilize these freshwater migration corridors at times that may not be optimal with respect to temperature, forage availability and exposure to predators. Adult CV steelhead migrating upstream frequently are delayed entering the river owing to poor water quality conditions in the Delta. Fall attraction flows released for Fall Run typically improve conditions for steelhead migration also, hence steelhead tend to be observed on the Stanislaus River earlier in the year than in other Central Valley streams.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADl-\">BiOp at 312-13.

For out-migration, the BO explains that steel-head are larger than fall-run smolts and may be less dependent on pulse flows to convey them out of the Stanislaus River (Id.). Without any evidence that the existing population of steelhead in the Stanislaus River that has been unable to outmigrate due to impaired flows, the BO states that the late spring flows in Action III.1.3 are needed to \u201callow more smolted fish to migrate out of the system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Doc. 492 at 9.

The 2008 OCAP BA described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>the modified operating plan that was the subject of consultation as a \u201cTransitional Operating Plan\u201d (\u201cTOP\u201d). See USBR AR 0007513. The TOP differs from the NMI-PO in several ways, which are described in Table 2-11 of the BA. USBR AR 0007576. SR Plaintiffs note that under the NMIPO, allocations to CVP contractors are capped at 90,000 AF, while under the TPO Reclamation provides for the full 155,000 AF allocation in \u201chigh allocation years.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">It is undisputed that NMFS used the TOP as the basis for its effects analysis. See Doc. 477-1 at 119; Doc. 492 at 4. SR Plaintiffs object instead to NMFS\u2019s decision to use the NMIPO assumptions to model RPA options. NMFS elected to use the NMIPO assumptions after it concluded that the TPO would not provide sufficient water for fishery needs in 59% of years. BiOp at 306. The BiOp explained that a 1993 study by Aceituno applied the so-called \u201cinstream flow incremental methodology\u201d to the Stanislaus River between Riverbank and Goodwin dam and \u201cdetermined that 155 TAF was needed to maximize weighted usable habitat area for salmon, not including outmigration flows or fall attraction flows.\u201d Id. The BiOp then determined that the proposed allocation strategy for the East Side Division under the TPO only commits to providing this level of water for fisheries in 41 percent of years (meaning insufficient supplies would be present in 59% percent of years). Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">SR Plaintiffs assert in a footnote that this conclusion is \u201cbogus\u201d because NMFS did not explain to \u201c[wjhich fisheries\u201d it was referring, nor how much water is \u201csufficient.\u201d Doc. 492 at 4 n. 4. More importantly, the BiOp nowhere explains why it is \u201cessential\u201d to achieve flows designed to \u201cmaximize\u201d steelhead habitat area. Is the status of the species so dire that improvement to 60, 70, 80, or 90% of the \u201cmaximum\u201d would be insufficient, even if that marginal difference from the maximum saved large amounts of water? The record provides no explanation of the decision to aim for \u201cmaximum\u201d habitat in a system of limited resources. This must be specifically addressed and explained on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">NMFS admits that the modeling used to support the RPA builds upon this unexplained decision to set a \u201cmaximum habitat\u201d goal. Doc. 477-1 at 119. The agency\u2019s own internal guidance requires an explanation why operating to this goal is \u201cessential.\u201d None is provided. It is impossible to determine how a change in this goal impacts the overall rationale for the RPA. This too must be addressed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">SR Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that Federal Defendants erred by modeling RPA actions based on inappropriate assumptions is GRANTED.

It is undisputed that OID and SSJID hold perfected water rights to Stanislaus River water that are senior to Reclamation\u2019s rights to divert from the Stanislaus. OID and SSJID receive water from New Melones under a 1988 Agreement with the United States designed to fulfill their prior rights. USBR AR 0007571-72; USBR AR 0011751. That agreement requires Reclamation to provide to OID and SSJID:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-5\">\u2022 The inflow into New Melones plus the amount derived by the formula of (600,000 minus inflow) divided by 3, not to exceed 600,000 AF per year, USBR AR 011751; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-6\">\u2022 The right to conserve up to 200,000 AF in New Melones, USBR AR 011752.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">SR Plaintiffs point to studies in the record that they claim indicate the RPAs will require Reclamation to short OID and SSJID 13,000 AF on average. AR 00219154. They maintain that this is actually an under-estimate of the amounts they will be shorted under the Stanislaus River RPA Actions because of certain of NMFS\u2019s modeling assumptions. Specifically, the modeling assumed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-8\">(1) OID and SSJID\u2019s senior water rights would be shorted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-9\">(2) non-compliance with a Court order to limit non-flood flows to no more than 1500 cfs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-10\">(3) relaxation of dissolved oxygen (\u201cDO\u201d) requirement that is a condition of Reclamation\u2019s water right for New Melones;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-11\">(4) a successful petition to the SWRCB to relax D-1641 salinity requirements at Vernalis; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-12\">(5)a successful petition to the SWRCB to relax D-1641 flow requirements at Vernalis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">Doc. 492 at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-14\">Neither the underlying study purportedly demonstrating that water rights will be shorted, nor the inclusion of the listed modeling assumptions require Reclamation to short senior water rights or demonstrated that it is likely they will be unable to comply with the RPA without doing so. The study cited by SR Plaintiffs was restricted to modeling two years, 2010-2011, when the Phase I requirements of Action IV.2.1 were in place. AR 00219154. Reclamation complied with the RPA during this period and there is no indication that Reclamation shorted senior water rights. More to the point, neither NMFS nor the Bureau has discretion to violate these water rights. It is inappropriate to speculate they will break the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-15\">As for the modeling assumptions, each is justified based on past practice and experience and has long been included in the CALSIM II modeling process. The Calsim II model inputs do not assume that OID and SSJID\u2019s rights will be shorted. They cannot be. Rather, the RPAs assume that <em>demand </em>from these districts will be reduced under certain circumstances, based upon land use projections developed by the California Department of Planning and Local Assistance. Hilts Decl., Doc. 480 at \u00b6 6 (\u201chydrology-land-use-demand input [data] set ... was best available... [and] suggest that OID and SSJID will not use their full entitlement in most years\u201d); Fifth Milligan Decl., Doc. 479 at \u00b6 5 (SR Plaintiffs\u2019 expert Mr. Steiner participated in 2005 update of land use demand assumptions, which were used in the BA and relied upon in the BiOp). In addition to the land-use based assumptions, the relevant modeling included assumptions designed to reasonably reflect water usage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>by the Stanislaus basin stakeholders during sustained dry periods. Hilts Deck, Doc. 480 at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">SR Plaintiffs cite a number of cases in which mitigation measures were deemed unsatisfactory to satisfy an agency\u2019s burden to insure against jeopardy because those measures were not \u201creasonably specific, certain to occur, [ ] capable of implementation, [and] subject to deadlines or otherwise-enforceable obligations.... \u201d <em>Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Rumsfeld, </em>198 F.Supp.2d 1139, 1152-54 (D.Ariz.2002). But, the eases cited are distinguishable, and it is unclear whether the \u201creasonably certain to occur\u201d language should be applied to RPAs. Rumsfeld concerned a biological opinion\u2019s \u201cno jeopardy\u201d finding that relied upon the action agency to mitigate groundwater impacts of its activities through participation in a regional plan to protect groundwater resources, despite the fact that the action agency had no authority to ensure the regional plan was implemented. Nor did the biological opinion set any goals or deadlines regarding groundwater protection. Rumsfeld reasoned that necessary mitigation measures designed to prevent adverse impacts to groundwater must be identified and included either in the proposed action or as RPAs. <em>Id. </em>at 1154. Without these adjustments there was no rational basis for the \u201cno jeopardy conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rumsfeld address the requirements for mitigation measures, not RPAs. See also <em>NWF v. NMFS, </em>254 F.Supp.2d 1196, 1213-14 (D.Or.2003) (requiring reasonable certainty when NMFS relied upon off-site federal actions to conclude that jeopardy will not occur).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Rumsfeld relied upon <em>Sierra Club v. Marsh, </em>816 F.2d 1376 (9th Cir.1987), which addressed whether an agency was required to reinitiate formal consultation after failing to acquire certain mitigation lands. Those lands were considered a \u201cvital\u201d RPA by FWS in its biological opinion concerning the agency\u2019s action. <em>Id. </em>at 1378. Marsh explained that the \u201creasonably certain to occur\u201d standard applies to \u201c[i]ndirect effects ... caused by the proposed action,\u201d not to RPA actions. See <em>id. </em>at 1388 (citing 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02). Rather, Marsh applied the regulatory criteria from 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.16 to determine whether the action agency unlawfully failed to reinitiate consultation. <em>Id. </em>at 1388-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Even if reasonable certainty is the benchmark, it is satisfied here. The RPAs in question here require Reclamation to use its own water resources for particular purposes. Reclamation has reasonably examined past patterns of Project water use by third parties and concluded that water will be available to implement the RPAs. See <em>S.W. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, </em>143 F.3d 515, 518-19 (9th Cir.1998) (upholding generalized RPA requiring agency to protect 1,400 acres without identifying the particular location or timeframe). SR Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that reliance on past practice is unreasonable. If, however, Reclamation\u2019s predictions prove incorrect and make the RPAs\u2019 implementation infeasible, the burden cannot be imposed on senior water rights holders. Rather, Reclamation must then re-initiate consultation.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Federal Defendants have reasonably explained the remaining modeling assumptions about acquisition of waivers from the SWRCB regarding dissolved oxygen and D-1641 flow and salinity requirements. Fifth Milligan Decl., Doc. 497 at \u00b6 7-8; Hilts Decl., Doc. 48 at \u00b6 12 (explaining it is \u201creasonable to assume the SWRCB will take a holistic approach and grant such petitions\u201d under relevant conditions). This is speculation and may be mistaken, however the law does not require more. If no Petitions are granted, absent available existing water, NMFS must reinitiate consul <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>tation. SR Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that these assumptions were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">SR Plaintiffs\u2019 final challenge to the modeling assumptions is based on a March 10, 1982 injunction imposed in <em>United States v. California, </em>purportedly requiring Reclamation to limit non-flood flows to no more than 1,500 cfs. It is undisputed that Action III.1.3 calls for spring pulse flow releases as high as 5,000 cfs, BiOp at 623, Fig. 11-1, and Action IV.1.2 requires releases from New Melones to meet higher Vernalis flow rates, BiOp at 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">The Ninth Circuit\u2019s March 10, 1982 injunction \u201cpending determination of appeal,\u201d required the United States to provide the State of California with a plan to protect downstream property from damage caused by inundation or seepage. SR Plaintiffs\u2019 Request for Judicial Notice (\u201cSRJN\u201d), Doc. 453-7, Ex. 7 at 2. That plan, set forth in a February 1982 memo drafted by the Bureau, indicated that flows above 1,500 cfs would \u201ccreate water tables high enough to have the potential to damage the almond and walnut orchards adjacent to the [Stanislaus] river.\u201d Id., Ex. 8, at 1.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> But, the injunction, by its own terms, was limited to the time period pending appeal. The appeal was decided nine months later on December 20, 1982. <em>United States v. California, </em>694 F.2d 1171 (9th Cir.1982). The Ninth Circuit\u2019s re manded with instructions that \u201c[t]he injunction previously issued by the court may be modified or amended by the district court as it deems necessary and appropriate in view of this opinion and the present circumstances of the dam and its storage facility,\u201d <em>id., </em>but there is no evidence in the record that the district court ever imposed a similar 1,500 cfs ceiling on non-flood flows. NMFS reasonably concluded that the limitation no longer applies and could be omitted from Stanislaus River modeling.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This is not the appropriate forum for SR Plaintiffs to attempt to enforce a nineteen-year-old injunction, which has no continuing validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">SR Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that the RPA improperly requires Reclamation to infringe on OID and SSJID\u2019s prior rights to Stanislaus River water is DENIED; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">3. <em>Use of the San Joaquin River Temperature Model.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">Federal agencies must use \u201cthe best scientific and commercial data available\u201d in developing reasonable and prudent alternatives. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536(a)(2); 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.14(g)(8). SR Plaintiffs assert that Federal Defendants did not use the best available science in formulating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>the Stanislaus River RPAs because they did not model the feasibility of the RPAs using the San Joaquin River Water Temperature Model (\u201cSJRWTM\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">There is no dispute that temperature modeling is critical to the management of the Stanislaus River and to implementation of the Stanislaus River RPAs. NMFS relied on Reclamation\u2019s \u201cUSBR Temperature Model,\u201d to run an operational scenario involving a draft RPA for new minimum flow releases on the Stanislaus. AR 00105890.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">SR Plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Avery Dotan, opines that no reasonably prudent modeler would choose to use the USBR Temperature Model, which can only simulate the mean monthly vertical temperatures, to assess the feasibility of meeting a seven-day average daily maximum temperature requirement, such as Action III.1.2. See Dotan Decl., Doc. 442 at \u00b6\u00b6 53-58</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">The agencies had numerous discussions throughout 2009 regarding temperature modeling, including some specific requests to look into the use of the SJRWTM. See, e.g., AR 00065939 (Feb. 6, 2009 email regarding modeling), 00070965, 00074969 (requesting use of a different model), 00077217 (Feb. 18, 2009 email asking questions about \u201cDerek\u2019s model run\u201d), 00077613 (Mar. 20, 2009 inquiry regarding application of the SJRWTM), 00078887 (Mar. 29, 2009 email containing information about SJRWTM), 00079052 (Mar. 27, 2009 email containing information about SJRWTM), 00085078 (Apr. 10, 2009 email asking for assistance from \u201cDon Smith and Avry Dotan\u201d as the \u201cSJR-Basin wide temperature modelers\u201d). CalFed\u2019s Science Program held a special workshop on temperature modeling for the BO in April 2008 and advised the agencies to utilize the \u201clatest technology\u201d in temperature modeling, including adopting models with \u201csmaller time-steps to better assess biological effects.\u201d AR 00038723. The CalFed Science Review Panel, in reviewing the draft BiOp, specifically recommended that Federal Defendants utilize the SJRWTM, a sub-daily temperature model developed for the Stanislaus River by Avry Dotan and Resources Management Associates. See AR 00219651. Several federal agencies, including NMFS, FWS, and Reclamation, participated in its development. Do-tan Deck, Doc. 442 at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 23-34. The model was funded by CalFed and peer reviewed by CalFed scientists. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 21, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">The SJRWTM could have modeled temperatures on a seven-day average daily maximum basis, a more appropriate time scale according to Mr. Dotan. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 53, 80. SR Plaintiffs assert that the SJRWTM was the best available science and should have been used to evaluate the feasibility of the RPA actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">The model runs in the AR using the USBR Temperature Model predict that the new flow requirements in Action III.1.3 will occasionally cause temperatures to exceed the objectives set forth in Action III.1.2. Dotan Deck, Doc. 442 at \u00b6\u00b6 73-77. Mr. Dotan opines that these results are unreliable because the model could only predict monthly mean temperatures and was not capable of determining when the seven-day average daily maximum temperature was or was not met. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 52-72. To demonstrate that this error is material, Mr. Dotan repeated the analysis using the SJRWTM. The results of this analysis are depicted in Figure 7 to his Declaration, which shows that in February, March, April, May, June, July, August, and September the Bureau\u2019s model estimates fewer exceedances than does the SJRWTM. Doc. 441-15. (Mr. Dotan does not discuss the fact that this figure also shows that in October and November, the SJRWTM indicates fewer exceedances than the Bureau\u2019s model. Id.)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>The SJRWTM model also predicts that the water cost associated with meeting Action III.1.2 vary between 22,000-190,000 AF per year with an average cost of 84,000 AF, Dotan Decl., Doc. 442 at \u00b6 87; that operating for temperature control will deplete the volume of water in New Melones by as much as 717,000 AF during 1987-1995, id. at \u00b6\u00b6 86; and that this successive operation for temperature control will eventually cease to be effective as New Melones\u2019 pool of cold water is depleted, id. at \u00b6\u00b6 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Federal Defendants do not dispute the superiority of the SJRWTM. Rather, they strenuously object that contemporaneous documents in NMFS administrative record demonstrate that the model was not \u201cavailable\u201d to the agencies during the consultation. Doc. 477-1 at 131. Although employees of the Federal Defendants were trained to use the model between 2001 and 2009, Dotan Decl., Doc. 442 at \u00b6\u00b6 35-42, and Mr. Dotan answered specific questions posed by NMFS and Reclamation regarding the use of model, see, e.g., NAR 00093319 <em>&amp; </em>00094138, there were concerns that documentation of the complex model was insufficient to allow others to run it, AR 00089101 (May 1, 2009 email indicating \u201cNMFS has the model\u201d but discussing problems with the contract for technical support); AR 00089027 (model in public domain but difficult to run unassisted). The BiOp explains why it did not use the SJRWTM:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-6\">\"When evaluating the effect on salmonids of an operational strategy on the Stanislaus River, [USBR] would normally take the CalSim modeled results and conduct post-processing to determine temperature effects. When we met in early March to discuss the March 3 version of the RPA with the action agencies, we requested help from [USBR] to do temperature modeling on these flows using their tools. In subsequent discussion with USFWS and CDFG, the need to perform temperature modeling on these flows was also identified, but NMFS and USFWS lacked internal expertise to perform the modeling. CDFG was unable to assist with running the San Joaquin River Basin temperature model because of funding freezes. Tetra Tech was hired by NMFS to assist with such activities... [but] [insufficient time was available to them to learn and apply the specifics of the operating model.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">AR 00105884.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">Record evidence demonstrates that the model was not self-explanatory, even for staff with background in a related model used as the basis for the SJRWTM: HEC-5Q. NMFS had to seek outside help to use the model, and encountered implementation issues. See AR 00077320 (NMFS discussing hiring Tetra Tech to help run SJRWTM), 00092267 (NMFS seeking assistance from Bureau engineer with' model), 00093101 (NMFS obtaining promise of documentation from FWS), 00093319 (Dotan answering NMFS\u2019s questions about application of model), 00093538 (discussing \u201cnumerous issues (above and beyond downscaling) with bringing CalSim data into the SJ temp model\u201d), 00094138 (Dotan answering NMFS\u2019s questions about application of model). Once NMFS engaged a consultant to run the modeling, the model\u2019s other co-developer, Don Smith, resisted providing the assistance necessary to run the model. See AR 00089096. In addition, the material provided with the then-available version of the SJRWTM did not allow the model to be correctly utilized. Reed Decl., Doc. 482 at \u00b6\u00b6 10-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">SR Plaintiffs concede that Federal Defendants are only required to use the best science available, and not the best science possible. See Doc. 492 at 17 (citing R.W. <em>Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Babbitt, </em>215 F.3d 58, 60-61 (D.C.Cir.2000)). How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>ever, SR Plaintiffs assert it \u201cstretches credulity\u201d to accept that the Government was unable to run this model because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-4\">[its] development began in 1999 with the assistance and participation of Reclamation and FWS (Dotan Decl., \u00b6 6), [it] is based upon the HEC-5Q platform that has been around since the 1980s and which is the platform of the USBR\u2019s Upper Sacramento River Water Temperature Model used in this consultation (Id., \u00b6 8; BA, App. H, p. H-5), [it] was completed for the Stanislaus River only in 2001 (Dotan Decl., \u00b6 19), and [it] has been used by Reclamation for its Friant Restoration Project and Delta-Mendota Canal Recirculation Project. (Dotan Decl. \u00b6 33).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Id. This argument continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-6\">All of this, coupled with the fact that representatives from NMFS, FWS and Reclamation sit on the TAC and Super TAC committees overseeing the development and use of the SJRWTM, and that employees from these agencies have received specific training on how to run the model (Dotan Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 36-43), shows that the Government\u2019s defense is, at best, one of willful ignorance that should not be tolerated. Moreover, the Government was told repeatedly to use a temperature model with a smaller time-step, and specifically the Stanislaus River portion of the SJRWTM, well before the BO was due, yet the Government failed to do so at every turn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-7\">In April 2008, the CALFED Science Program told the Government that it needed to use the latest technology in temperature modeling by utilizing models with smaller time-steps (NMFS AR at 00038723), but the Government chose not to take this advice in regards to the Stanislaus River. In January 2009, a mere six months before the final BO was due and eight months after the Science Program recommended using models with shorter time-steps, a draft of the BO was reviewed by the CALFED Science Review Panel. The Panel again noted the paucity of relevant temperature data for the Stanislaus River and specifically recommended that the Government incorporate into the BO the \u201cconsiderable temperature work\u201d that had been done on the Stanislaus River with the Stanislaus River portion of the sub-daily SJRWTM. (NMFS AR at 00219651). Again, the Government did nothing. In fact, only in March 2009\u2014 almost a full year after being told to use a model with shorter timesteps and only three months before the final BO was due \u2014 did the Government finally have internal discussions with its modeler TetraTech about its ability to conduct water temperature modeling for the Stanislaus River. (Reed Decl., \u00b6 15). Any inability to run the SJRWTM has more to do with the Government\u2019s delay in responding to the advice of the CALFED review teams than with the Government\u2019s lack of knowledge or resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">Id. at 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">Ms. Reed, an NMFS employee with significant involvement in the development of the BiOp disagrees with Plaintiffs\u2019 assessment of the circumstances. She declares that the SJRWTM was not functionally available during the consultation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-11\">8. ... NMFS was aware of the development of the SJRWTM and participated in some of the advisory group meetings, but NMFS\u2019s attempts to use this model in developing the BiOp were not successful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-12\">9. NMFS disagrees with Mr. Dotan\u2019s assertion that the November 2008 version of the SJRWTM was sufficiently complete to utilize. Mr. Dotan states that the final version of the SJRWTM was submitted to CALFED October 2009, months after the June 4, 2009 completion date of the BiOp.

He goes on to state that this version \u201cwas almost identical\u201d to the November 19, 2008 pre-release version that he made available to stakeholders including NMFS. Dotan Decl. \u00b6 42. However, the flaws in the November 2008 version and supporting documentation made it so that NMFS was unable to run the model.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-5\">10. On December 10, 2008, Mr. Craig Anderson, hydrologisi/modeler for NMFS, attended a Super TAC meeting. Dotan Decl. Exhibit C. This was his first introduction to the model and its availability. He subsequently downloaded a version of the SJRWTM and documentation from the ftp site, as directed by Mr. Dotan. Mr. Anderson forwarded this model and associated information to Mustafa Faizullabhoy at Tetra Tech who was under contract with NMFS to conduct temperature and other modeling related to the biological opinion development. NMFS 85074-7. Mr. Faizullabhoy has extensive experience with developing, implementing, and evaluating water quality and flow models for environmental analyses including applications of the BASINS, QUAL2E, EFDC, and CE-QUAL-W2 models amongst others. However, Mr. Faizullabhoy had substantial difficulty running the model based only on the information provided at the ftp site and sought advice from Mr. Dotan and Mr. Don Smith, Mr. Do-tan\u2019s partner in developing the model. NMFS 85074-77, 86560-1, 87111-3, 92267-8, 93310-18, 93319-20, and 94185.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-6\">11. The communication between NMFS, Mr. Faizullabhoy, and the model developers reflects that the material was not self-explanatory, and that it was still in development mode. See e.g. NMFS 93319-20. For example, the Tetra Tech modeler had difficulty running the model because the documentation he received had an old version of a table necessary to run the model, which Mr. Dotan admitted \u201creflects our early work on the Stanislaus model.\u201d NMFS 93320. In any case, the model files made available on the FTP site did not include the source code necessary to fully evaluate model numerical schemes and mechanics and important pre-and post processing algorithms. Essentially, the pre-release modeling package contained compiled source code that limits an outside user\u2019s ability to effectively alter the model in any substantial way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-8\">12. Mr. Dotan also asserts that he provided training to NMFS and Reclamation staff so that they should have known how to run the model as a result of this participation. Dotan Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39, 40, 41. NMFS disagrees with this contention. While staff participated in the coordination meetings during the development of the SJRWTM, Mr. Dotan\u2019s implication that attendees were all fully trained to run the model is incorrect. For example, in response to a request to run the SJRWTM to evaluate early versions of the RPA Actions, Mr. Dean Marston of the California Department of Fish and Game responded that DFG had no resources to run the model, despite the fact that Mr. Marston attended almost all the meetings. NMFS 77613-5; Dotan Decl. Exhibit C. Based on personal communication with other attendees of these trainings, I understand that these sessions were more like demonstrations of the model\u2019s features, rather than a training course intended to prepare the participant to be able to run the model (Pers. comm. Mr. Craig Anderson, now USFWS, and Mr. Russ Yaworsky, Reclamation).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-9\">13. In order to apply the SJRWTM to the RPA or to Reclamation\u2019s proposed action, the CalSim II results that govern allocations would have to be disaggregated from a monthly time step for use with the SJRWTM, which operates on a 6-hour time step. The manner in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>the disaggregation is done is important, as indicated in Mr. Milligan\u2019s declaration. Milligan Decl. \u00b6 9. The November 2008 documentation available for running the SJRWTM stated the following regarding using CalSim II data in the model:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-4\">\u201c2.8 Using Addition Tools</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUj\">The Dss file viewer, HecDssVue, is provided as a tool within the application for viewing and editing dss file data. It can be accessed through the Tool menu in the main HWMS application window. Downscale CalSim will also be included. This tool is used to modify the CalSim output files for use in the HEC5Q model.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATO\">HWMS-HEC5Q User Interface at 8, Exhibit 1. This is the only reference to how to use CalSim II inputs to the model and it indicates that while a tool to downscale CalSim II information will be included in a future version of the model, it was not included in the version available in November 2008. In the absence of that data, there was no explanation which would have allowed NMFS staff to perform the disaggregation process on their own.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-5\">14. Mr. Dotan states that the SJRWTM has already been used in several proceedings, including the Stanislaus River studies, Friant Restoration Project, presentations for the SWRCB [303(d)/305(b) ] workshop, and the USBR Delta Mendota Recirculation Project. However, Mr. Dotan does not disclose that the operation of this model was usually performed by Mr. Dotan or his partners who worked with him in the development of the code. Dotan Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 21, 25 and 33, SJRGA 2007 at 52, Exhibit 2. Their intimate and proprietary knowledge of the model made use of the model possible in those proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-6\">15. In November 2008, NMFS advertised a contract solicitation to contract for outside modeling expertise. This contract was announced on http://www. gsa.gov/portal/conteni/103541, a public website for advertising Federal contract opportunities. Mr. Dotan did not submit a bid as a direct contractor or subcontractor. NMFS could only have contracted for Mr. Dotan\u2019s services through this sort of public, competitive solicitation given that this model is based on public domain code and is intended to be nonproprietary. It would have been inappropriate for NMFS to attempt to justify contracting Mr. Dotan\u2019s services as a sole-source contractor. In December 2009, the contract was awarded to Tetra Tech Inc. Early efforts by Tetra Tech were focused on modeling the Shasta Reservoir carryover storage RPA actions. Initial, internal discussions regarding Stanislaus River water temperature modeling by Tetra Tech occurred in late March 2009 (see NMFS 77320-1), and an official response from Tetra Tech re: their ability to conduct said water temperature modeling occurred on April 16, 2009. NMFS 86560-1. As discussed above, Tetra Tech staff (primarily Mr. Faizullabhoy) subsequently transmitted five emails to Mr. Anderson ( NMFS 87111-3, 88597-602, 93310-18, 00093319-20, and 94185) containing model specific technical questions through the remainder of April 2009 into May 2009, with the final email transmission occurring on May 22, 2009 (NMFS 94185). Where appropriate, Mr. Anderson sought the assistance and technical advice of SJRWTM experienced practitioners, including Mr. Do-tan. Despite these efforts neither NMFS nor their contractor was able to conduct runs with the SJRWTM for the BiOp analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-8\">16.In summary, NMFS disputes that the model was sufficiently available for use in the preparation of our BiOp, without the direct and extensive intervention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>of the developer, Mr. Dotan or his consulting firm, and he did not choose to make his services available to NMFS through a legal contracting process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Reed Decl., Doc. 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">NMFS claims it did not have the expertise and could not get Dotan to respond. This is a factual dispute over whether NMFS could use the model. There is no dispute using the shorter time step was the best science. The Supreme Court has \u201crepeated time and again, an agency has broad discretion to choose how best to marshal its limited resources and personnel to carry out its delegated responsibilities.\u201d <em>Massachusetts v. EPA, </em>549 U.S. 497, 527, 127 S.Ct. 1438, 167 L.Ed.2d 248 (2007). Although the record suggest that the resources required to run this model properly would be modest, that the model results would be preferable to those presented in the BiOp, and that NMFS had knowledge of the model for over 8 years, a court does not have the authority to order the agency how to direct and allocate its resources. Congress has chosen to partially immunize such agency \u201cmis-performance.\u201d SR Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that Federal Defendants acted unlawfully by failing to utilize the SJRWTM is DENIED; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">4. <em>Exceptions Built into Action III. 1.2.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ak4\">Even if, arguendo, Federal Defendants\u2019 failure to employ the SJRWTM was unlawful, Federal Defendants alternatively argue that that exceptions built into Action III.1.2 render any dispute over the model used irrelevant. Action III.1.2 was developed to address the impacts of adverse temperatures on the species. The temperature compliance schedule is purportedly based on the species\u2019 biological and physiological needs. Reed Deck, Doc. 482 at 3-4. Because the modeling indicated these temperatures could not always achieved, the RPA action has a built-in exception, which can be exercised any time temperature requirements of Action III.1.2 will be exceeded on a three-day average daily maximum temperature. BiOp at 621. Operational adjustments to address such exceptions will be coordinatthrough the SOG and WOMT. Id. NMFS concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-10\">Because every year is a bit different, we determined that matching temperature requirements to the appropriate life cytiming and providing for exceptions was an appropriate way to provide necessary protections for listed species while allowing for occasional off-ramps when meeting temperatures was not feasible. That is, an approach using feasibility-based exceptions to biologically-based temperature criteria was deemed more protective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-11\">Reed Decl., Doc. 482 at \u00b6 29. Because the exception provision \u201chas no limitations,\u201d Federal Defendants argue it is immaterial whether the SJRWTM would have shown more instances of exceeding the RPA Action\u2019s seven-day average daily maximum temperatures. Doc. 477-1 at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">This argument presents a conflict between the adaptive management scheme and the ESA Regulations\u2019 explicit demand that Federal Defendants demonstrate the necessity and feasibility of implementing every RPA Action. Flexibility is the essence of adaptive management, a tool that is indisputably beneficial both to the species and impacted stakeholders. But, Federal Defendants describe an exception that \u201chas no limitations.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> How often can the exception be triggered without rendering the Action ineffectual? This is not examined. Without such an analysis, the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>to which this RPA is essential\u201d to avoiding jeopardy cannot be evaluated. This makes the RPA unlawful and it must be addressed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">5. <em>Does the Record Support the Finding that Action III.l.S Will Avoid Jeopardy to or Adverse Modification of CV Steelhead or Critical Habitat?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">The objective of Action III.1.3 is to operate the East Side Division<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> dams to optimize CV steelhead habitat for all life history stages and to incorporate habitat maintaining geomorphic flows in a flow pattern that will provide migratory cues to smolts and facilitate out-migrant smolt movement on [the] declining limb of pulse.\u201d BiOp at 622. Specifically, the Action requires the Bureau to achieve a minimum flow schedule prescribed in Appendix 2-E and generally described in Figure 11-1, copied below:</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">Id. at 623. SR Plaintiffs take issue with the requirement of releases as high as 5,000 cfs in the spring of wet years, which represents a drastic change from the prior flow regime and such high flows are unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">NMFS explains in a May 31, 2009 memo from Rhonda Reed to Maria Rea that the flow requirements of Action III.1.3 are based on a 1993 study by Aceituno, which uses \u201cIn-stream Flow Incremental Methodology\u201d (\u201cIFIM\u201d). AR 00105879. NMFS then conferred with CDFG and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>FWS biologists regarding CV Steelhead\u2019s need for pulse flows. AR 00105881-82. These consultations revealed that a fall attraction pulse was needed. This is included in Action III.1.3 and is not challenged by SR Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">NMFS also assessed whether CV steel-head needed a spring pulse flow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-6\">Do steelhead need spring pulse flows, or can they just swim out on their own? CV steelhead are captured at the RSTs before the pulse flows, so early smolts may not need a spring pulse. However, the spring pulse does improve downstream water quality conditions for smolts that are leaving later, and this may be more important than for swimming assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">AR 00105882. SR Plaintiffs object that this language is equivocal and that a life stage of the species \u201cmay\u201d need a particular pulse flow is not sufficient justification for requiring one.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">Although this passage from the Reed Memo does admit that \u201cearly smolts may not need a spring pulse,\u201d AR 00105882, Defendants point to other record evidence supporting the imposition of a spring pulse flow requirement. Spring pulse flows cue more smolts to migrate, protecting the anadromous form. BiOp at 306-307; AR 00105882 (variability in flow triggers important to anadromy), AR 00105883 (flow variability important to anadromy).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">SR Plaintiffs do not directly challenge this rationale. Rather, they argue that even if some form of spring pulse is justified, nothing in the BiOp justifies a 5,000 cfs pulse flow. SR Plaintiffs point out that Aceituno\u2019s 1993 IFIM study called for flows ranging from between 50-500 cfs. Aceituno\u2019s study focused on instream needs, and did not include an assessment of water needed for spring <em>pulse </em>flows to convey steelhead to delta. BiOp at 307 (\u201cIFIM analysis did not include an assessment of the volume of water needed for a spring pulse flow to convey CV steelhead or fall run from the Stanislaus River into the Delta\u201d); AR 00107828 (Aceituno (1993) explicitly acknowledging that \u201c[t]his study did not directly provide information on flows needed for smolt emigration in the spring\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">CDFG\u2019s initial draft recommendation for the RPA Action called for a spring pulse flow of 3,500 cfs. AR 00105882. CDFG\u2019s highest recommendation was for a pulse of 4,000 cfs. AR 00061652. NMFS raised the pulse to 5,000, reasoning that this would provide \u201cminimum channel forming flows.\u201d AR 00105887. In support of providing such \u201cchannel forming flows,\u201d NMFS cites Kondolf (2001), which provides an analysis of pre- and post-New Melones flood frequency rates at Knights Ferry on the Stanislaus River. Kondolf (2001) concludes: \u201cflows in excess of 5,000 to 8,000 cfs are needed to mobilize the bed and thereby maintain channel form and gravel quality.\u201d AR 00122645. Such flows are \u201cimportant to rejuvenate spawning beds and floodplain rearing habitat and to recruit allochthonous nutrients and large wood into the river.\u201d BiOp at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">According to Kondolf (2001), channel-forming flows occurred every 1.4-1.8 years prior to the construction of New Melones, but only once every 5 to 20 years since construction of New Melones. Id. Kondolf further explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-13\">The frequent floods, those with return intervals of one to five years, and the flows that move the most sediment over time in many natural alluvial channels (commonly considered the \u201cchannel forming\u201d flows) (Kondolf et al.1999; Leopold et al.1964), are three to four times smaller since the construction of New Melones Dam. For example, the Ql.s (i.e., the flow equaled or exceeded once per 1.5 years), considered the bankfull flow in many rivers, has been reduced from 5,340 cfs to 1,840 cfs. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>Qlo and Q20 were reduced by six to eight times after construction of New Melones Dam.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">AR 00122626. Kondolf (2001) then evaluated the post-dam flood frequency, and concluded that the two-year return flow is 3,070 cfs, meaning that such a flow returns every two years. AR 00122714. A 5,000 cfs flow has a return rate of just over three years. Id. Kondolf (2001) supports a regime that would provide for high pulse flows to maintain gravel quality. In general, this is what Action III.1.3 attempts to achieve.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">However, in light of Kondolf (2001)\u2019s conclusion that \u201cflows in <em>excess of </em>5,000 to 8,000 cfs are needed to mobilize the bed and thereby maintain channel form and gravel quality,\u201d SR Plaintiffs challenge whether RPA Action III.1.3, which calls for peak flows of 3,000 cfs in above normal years and 5,000 in wet years, would maintain channel form and gravel quality. Kondolf (2001) provides the only record support for flows above the 3,000 suggested by CDFG, yet Action III.1.3 does not actually implement the flow regime suggested by Kondolf (2001). The record provides no support for the conclusion that the regime imposed by Action III.1.3 is <em>sufficient </em>to maintain gravel quality. Particularly in light of the potentially high water costs of these pulse flows, the rationale for Action III.1.3 must be lawfully explained and justified on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">SR Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that the record does not support the imposition of Action III.1.3\u2019s 5000 cfs spring pulse flow is GRANTED; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">6. <em>DFG Salmon Population Model </em>a. <em>Use of the Model to Set Out-Migration Flows.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">In calculating the flows CV Steel-head need for outmigration, NMFS relied upon the \u201cSJR salmon model (V.1.0) (output for doubling salmon and calculating the Stanislaus flow contribution....)\u201d AR 00105883. It is undisputed that this is a reference to a CDFG model used to determine flows needed to double salmon in the San Joaquin River. SR Plaintiffs complain that NMFS\u2019s use of the model was inappropriate because: (1) steelhead are not salmon; and (2) the \u201cdoubling\u201d goal is distinct from the goal of \u201cavoiding jeopardy.\u201d Doc. 454 at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-12\">The former argument is identical to the surrogate challenges raised by Plaintiffs and rejected above. Salmon are the best available surrogates for CV steelhead, for which the available data is inadequate for modeling purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-13\">Nothing in the record explains why it is appropriate to use a model designed to <em>double </em>the existing salmon population to set numeric flow targets to <em>avoid jeopardy </em>to the CV steelhead. The BiOp must explain why each aspect of the RPA is essential to avoid jeopardy or adverse modification. The facial disconnect between the goal of the salmon-doubling model and the goal of ESA section 7 consultation requires explanation on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-14\">SR Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that the BiOp unlawfully utilized the CDFG salmon doubling model is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; and Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. That the model used salmon as a surrogate for CV Steelhead was not inappropriate, but the record does not support the use of a model designed to double salmon to set flow targets to avoid jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-15\">b. <em>NMFS\u2019s Reliance on Draft Model Runs from Outdated Version 1.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-16\">The record further suggests that NMFS relied on runs from an outdated version of the CDFG Salmon Model. When it pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>duced the data to NMFS, CDFG explained that the results were preliminary and based upon version 1.0, AR 00061644, which was subsequently subject to peer review and further clarification, AR 00103255-58. CDFG specifically warned NMFS that the results would need to be confirmed through the performance of several checks. AR 00061644. The record reveals no evidence that such corrections were made. The need for confirmation must be addressed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">SR Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that the BiOp unlawfully and unreasonably relied upon an outdated version of the CDFG salmon model is GRANTED; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">7. <em>SR Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cImpermissible Major Changes\u2019\u2019 Argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">SR Plaintiffs originally advanced the argument that the Stanislaus River RPAs were unlawful because they constituted \u201cimpermissible major changes\u201d to the New Melones Project. This argument was based on SR Plaintiffs citation to 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.14(i)(2) which provides that \u201c[r]easonable and prudent measures, along with the terms and conditions that implement them, cannot alter the basic design, location, scope, duration, or timing of the action and may involve only minor changes.\u201d However, reasonable and prudent measures (\u201cRPMs\u201d) are those measures \u201cnecessary or appropriate to minimize [the] impact\u201d of incidental take. 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02. No RPMs are imposed upon Stanislaus River operations. There is no \u201cimpermissible major changes\u201d language associated with the imposition of RPAs. SR Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on this ground is DENIED; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are GRANTED.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">8. <em>Challenges to the BiOp\u2019s Feasibility Analyses?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">SR Plaintiffs argue that it is impossible to determine from the record whether certain of the Stanislaus River RPA Actions are feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">a. <em>General Objection that Feasibility Modeling Employed Erroneous Assumptions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">First, SR Plaintiffs argue that the feasibility modeling employed erroneous assumptions, such as assumptions that constrain allocations to OID and SSJID below their entitlements. Doc. 492 at 12-13. This objection has been rejected, as the modeling captures the actual operation of these districts with reasonable accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-14\">SR Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that the BiOp\u2019s feasibility modeling employed erroneous assumptions is DENIED; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">b. <em>Objection that Action III.1.2\u2019s Exception Procedure Renders the BiOp\u2019s Feasibility Analysis of that Action Arbitrary and Capricious.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">Second, SR Plaintiffs argue that the RPA\u2019s exception procedures render any feasibility analysis irrational. Id. at 13. SR Plaintiffs do not specifically identify which Action, III.1.2, III.1.3 or IV.2.1, they assert is rendered infeasible by its exception procedures; but they must be refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>ring to Action III.1.2, which contains the broad exception procedure discussed above, see BiOp at 621. Action III. 1.3 contains no exception procedure, BiOp at 622-26, and Action IV.2.1\u2019s exception procedure is narrowly limited, BiOp at 644. SR Plaintiffs succeeded on their argument that Action III.1.2\u2019s exception procedure is so broad that it has the potential, without further refinement, to render the RPAs ineffectual. Relatedly, an exception procedure without any guarantees as to whether the exception may be successfully invoked when necessary renders any feasibility analysis impossible. Although Federal Defendants\u2019 feasibility analysis need not be perfect, it must be rational. Federal Defendants must reconsider their approach to the feasibility analysis in light of the numerous problems with the exception process identified above.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">SR Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that the BiOp\u2019s feasibility analysis for III.1.2 is arbitrary and capricious is GRANTED; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendanb-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">c. <em>Feasibility of Action III.2.2.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">SR Plaintiffs also challenge the feasibility of Action III.2.2, which calls for Reclamation to confer with the SOG to develop an operational strategy to meet the purpose of achieving floodplain inundation flows on a one to three year schedule.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> See Doe. 454 at 32. As this RPA defines no action per se, it is impossible to perform a feasibility analysis of it. Federal Defendants cannot escape the requirement of a feasibility analysis simply because they delay the design of this RPA. Before implementation, Federal Defendants must ensure that any action implemented under RPA Action III.2.2 complies with the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">SR Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to this feasibility analysis is correct to the extent there is no validly formulated RPA Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">9. <em>Are Actions III.1.3, III.2.2 Consistent with the Purposes of the Project?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-12\">SR Plaintiffs also argue that implementation of Actions III.1.3 and III.2.2 conflict with one of the express project purposes of New Melones, namely flood control, in violation of 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02\u2019s requirement that an RPA be \u201cconsistent with the intended purpose of the action.\u201d See Doc. 454 at 32. As to Action III.2.2, which calls for a plan to provide flows large enough to \u201cinundate floodplains\u201d in the winter or spring, no action has yet been defined. SR Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to this feasibility analysis is valid to the extent there is not yet a validly formulated RPA Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-13\">Action III.1.3 imposes certain pulse flows to benefit CV Steelhead, including the 5,000 cfs pulse flows in wet years discussed above. SR Plaintiffs suggest that these pulse flows, designed to be \u201cchannel forming,\u201d will conflict with New Melones\u2019 flood control purpose. Doc. 454 at 32. However, the BiOp specifically explains that Action III.1.3 is to be implemented for ten days or less in order to limit seepage impacts to nearby landowners. BiOp at 624.

The Bureau must comply with non-conflicting state water law. Reclamation Act of 1902, Pub.L. No. 57-161, 32 Stat. 288, at \u00a7 8 (June 17, 1902); <em>California v. United States, </em>438 U.S. 645, 675, 98 S.Ct. 2985, 57 L.Ed.2d 1018 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">The California Constitution states that the right to water is limited to reasonable use, and does not extend to waste or unreasonable use:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-9\">The right to water or to the use or flow of water in or from any natural stream or water course in this State is and shall be limited to such water as shall be reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served, and such right does not and shall not extend to the waste or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use or unreasonable method of diversion of water.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">Cal. Const. art. X, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">SR Plaintiffs concede that release of water for fish is a beneficial use of water in California. However, they argue that the spirit of Article X, Section 2 dictate that any releases must be carefully tailored to \u201cjust what is needed to avoid jeopardy so that the remaining water can be reserved for other equally important beneficial uses.\u201d Doc. 454 at 35. SR Plaintiffs then argue that Actions III.1.2, III.1.3, III.2.2 and IV.2.1 violate Article X, Section 2 \u201cabsent record evidence to support a finding that these RPAs-use only as much water as is reasonable and necessary to avoid jeopardy.\u201d Id. SR Plaintiffs underestimate the complexity of the waste and unreasonable use standard and the process by which <em>they </em>must establish waste and unreasonable use is occurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">SR Plaintiffs cite no caselaw to support their assertion that the California Constitution\u2019s reasonable use doctrine demands that an RPA \u201cbe carefully tailored to just what is necessary to avoid jeopardy.\u201d To the contrary, the reasonable use doctrine protects a broad range of interests, including fish protection interests that go far beyond prevention of jeopardy. See, e.g., <em>Nat\u2019l Audubon Soc\u2019y v. Superior Court, </em>33 Cal.3d 419, 443, 189 Cal.Rptr. 346, 658 P.2d 709 (1983) (use of water to maintain scenic and recreational values consistent with the reasonable use doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">Nor do Federal Defendants bear any burden to affirmatively demonstrate that the RPA\u2019s comply with the California Constitution. The ESA\u2019s implementing regulations specifically enumerate in 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02 the analyses NMFS and the Bureau must undertake when promulgating an RPA. It is Plaintiffs who bear the burden in a challenge based upon Article X. <em>State Water Resources Control Board Cases, </em>136 Cal.App.4th 674, 762, 39 Cal.Rptr.3d 189 (2006) (rejecting allegation that releases of water pursuant to D-1641 constituted waste and unreasonable use because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the releases \u201cnecessarily result[] in an unreasonable use of water.\u201d). The reasonableness of a use of water is a question of fact that depends on the particular cir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>cumstanees of each case. <em>Id. </em>Any such claim arises under state law, not the APA, and is not limited to the administrative record. The briefing in this case has not addressed in any analytic respect the unreasonable use issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">SR Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment that the Stanislaus River RPA Actions violate Article X, Section 2 of the California Constitution is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE; Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are PREMATURE.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">VII. <em>RECLAMATION\u2019S LIABILITY UNDER THE ESA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">All Plaintiffs move for summary judgment that Reclamation violated the ESA by adopting and implementing the BiOp. Following the issuance of a biological opinion, the ESA regulations require the action agency, here, Reclamation, to \u201cdetermine whether and in what manner to proceed with the action in light of its section 7 obligations and the Service\u2019s biological opinion.\u201d 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.15(a). In making that determination, a federal action agency \u201cmay not rely solely on a[ ] biological opinion to establish conclusively its compliance with its substantive obligations under section 7(a)(2).\u201d <em>Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe of Indians v. U.S. Dept. of Navy, </em>898 F.2d 1410, 1415 (9th Cir. 1990). In <em>City of Tacoma v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n, </em>460 F.3d 53, 76 (D.C.Cir.2006), the D.C. Circuit summarized the caselaw culminating in Pyramid Lake:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-7\">[The] interagency consultation process reflects Congress\u2019s awareness that expert agencies (such as the [NMFS] and [FWS]) are far more knowledgeable than other federal agencies about the precise conditions that pose a threat to listed species, and that those expert agencies are in the best position to make discretionary factual determinations about whether a proposed agency action will create a problem for a listed species and what measures might be appropriate to protect the species. Congress\u2019s recognition of this expertise suggests that Congress intended the action agency to defer, at least to some extent, to the determinations of the consultant agency, a point the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 169-170, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997). In <em>Bennett, </em>the Court stated that an action agency disregards a jeopardy finding in a BiOp \u201cat its own peril\u201d and bears the burden of articulating the reasons for reaching its contrary conclusion. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-9\">Accordingly, when we are reviewing the decision of an action agency to rely on a BiOp, the focus of our review is quite different than when we are reviewing a BiOp directly. In the former case, the critical question is whether the action agency\u2019s reliance was arbitrary and capricious, not whether the BiOp itself is somehow flawed. <em>Aluminum Co. of Am. v. Adm\u2019r, Bonneville Power Admin., </em>175 F.3d 1156, 1160 (9th Cir.1999); <em>Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>898 F.2d 1410, 1415 (9th Cir.1990); <em>Stop H-S Ass\u2019n v. Dole, </em>740 F.2d 1442, 1460 (9th Cir.1984); cf. <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. Nat\u2019l Marine Fisheries Serv., </em>422 F.3d 782, 790 (9th Cir.2005) (direct review of a BiOp). <em>Of course, the two inquiries overlap to some extent, because reliance on a facially flawed BiOp would likely be arbitrary and capricious, but the action agency \u201cneed not undertake a separate, independent analysis\u201d of the issues addressed in the BiOp. Aluminum Co., </em>175 F.3d at 1161. In fact, if the law required the action agency to undertake an independent analysis, then the expertise of the consultant agency would be seriously undermined. Yet the action agency must not blindly adopt the conclusions of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>sultant agency, citing that agency\u2019s expertise. <em>Id. </em>Rather, the ultimate responsibility for compliance with the ESA falls on the action agency. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536(a)(1)-(2). In Pyramid Lake, the Ninth Circuit balanced these two somewhat inconsistent principles and articulated the following rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-5\">[E]ven when the [consultant agency\u2019s] opinion is based on \u201cadmittedly weak\u201d information, another agency\u2019s reliance on that opinion will satisfy its obligations under the Act if a challenging party can point to no \u201cnew\u201d information \u2014 i.e., information the [consultant agency] did not take into account\u2014 which challenges the opinion\u2019s conclusions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-6\">898 F.2d at 1415; see also <em>Defenders of Wildlife v. U.S. EPA </em>420 F.3d 946, 959, 976 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Stop H-S Ass\u2019n, </em>740 F.2d at 1459-60.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b995-7\"><em>City of Tacoma, </em>460 F.3d at 75-76. The D.C. Circuit rejected the City of Tacoma\u2019s claim that the consultant agency in that case, FERC, was liable under the ESA because the City had not \u201cpresented FERC with new information that was unavailable to [NMFS] or [FWS] and that would give FERC a basis for doubting the expert conclusions in the BiOps those agencies prepared.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">Reclamation clearly disagreed with NMFS\u2019s approach to many important elements of the BiOp\u2019s analysis. See Doc. 431 at 119 (Plaintiffs\u2019 opening brief citing pages in the record containing Reclamation\u2019s critiques of the BiOp). This is not alone the litmus test for Reclamation\u2019s liability. In the context of ESA consultation, Reclamation is the regulated party and will not necessarily agree with every aspect of NMFS\u2019s opinion on the impacts of Reclamation\u2019s project on Listed Species. Under City of Tacoma, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that, at the time it adopted the BiOp\u2019s RPA, Reclamation was in possession of any \u201cnew information\u201d not considered by NMFS that provided Reclamation a basis for questioning the BiOp\u2019s expert conclusions. They have not. Absent such a showing, even though the BiOp is flawed in many ways, Reclamation could rely upon it without incurring ESA liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">All Plaintiffs motions for summary judgment that Reclamation violated the ESA and/or the APA are DENIED; Federal Defendant and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">VIII. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aci\">For all the reasons set forth above:</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">(A) Plaintiffs\u2019 and DWR\u2019s motions for summary judgment that the BiOp violates the ESA and the APA are GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; and Federal Defendants\u2019 and DefendanNIntervenors\u2019 cross motions are GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART based on the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-13\">(1) It was clear error and inconsistent with standard practice in the field of fisheries biology for Federal Defendants to rely upon the raw salvage analyses set forth in Figures 6-65 and 6-66 to reach conclusions about the effect of specific levels of negative OMR flows on the Listed Species. None of the alternative record citations or analyses cited by Defendants, including the PTM Modeling Results, or Figures 6-71, 6-72, or 6-73, provide sufficient alternative bases for NMFS\u2019s conclusions regarding the negative OMR flows below which loss of juvenile salmonids \u201cincreases sharply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-14\">(2) Federal Defendants\u2019 reliance on Figure 6-71 also suffers from the same unjustified use of raw salvage data. Federal Defendants must clarify on remand whether it is possible to scale the CV steelhead data used in Figures 6-72 and 6-73 to population size and, if not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>why unsealed analyses are nevertheless useful. Federal Defendants must also further explain and/or refine the statistical methodologies used to develop these figures. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-4\">(3) Federal Defendants\u2019 did not act unlawfully in failing to apply either of the two suggested life-cycle models (IOS and/or OBAN) or other mathematical models, such as the Ricker or BevertonHolt models, to evaluate project impacts on the Listed Species. However, NMFS\u2019s chronic and unsatisfactorily explained failure to avoid studying, analyzing, and applying a life cycle model approaches bad faith in light of all experts\u2019 opinions it can be done in far less than the five years the agency has been pleading lack of ability and resources, and in view of the undeniable importance of the information to resolve the perennial dispute over population dynamics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-5\">(4) NMFS did not act unlawfully by failing to segregate discretionary from non-discretionary actions in evaluating the environmental baseline. Although such a delineation could better document the relationship between the requirements of the species and the action agency\u2019s statutory authority to implement the RPA, NMFS disclaims the capacity to undertake appropriate modeling and related analysis and Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that NMFS\u2019s claim is unreasonable or false.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-6\">(5) Although it is inexplicable that these species are being managed in a piecemeal fashion, without considering all aspects of their life cycles, including impacts to abundance from ocean conditions and ocean harvest, the ESA does not require a quantitative, causative analysis of the relative importance of these non-Project impacts vis-a-vis Project effects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-7\">(6) NMFS did not act unlawfully by employing a 100-year timeframe for its analysis of extinction risk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-8\">(7) Certain aspects of NMFS\u2019s winter-run viability analysis are clearly erroneous as identified above and must be corrected on remand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-9\">(8) In view of the inconsistency, the 2009 Salmonid BiOp must explain on remand how its conclusions are consistent with the Orea Salmon Harvest BiOp.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-10\">(9) Although the BiOp contains some (uncontested) support for a connection between Project operations and the presence of exotic species, the BiOp is remanded for further explanation of how this relates to indirect mortality of the Listed Species.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-11\">(10) The record does not support the BiOp\u2019s conclusions about the connection between Project operations on the one hand and pollution and/or food limitations on the other. This is not the best available science.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-12\">(11) NMFS is not required to set a numeric threshold for adverse modification of critical habitat. The record supports the BiOp\u2019s conclusion that Project operations will have appreciable negative effects on the Listed Species\u2019 critical habitat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-13\">(12) NMFS\u2019s use of surrogates was not unlawful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-14\">(13) The record provides some, albeit equivocal, evidence to support the imposition of some form of flow:export ratio as part of Action IV.2.1. In a world of sound science, a questionable judgment that has significant adverse consequences for the water supply would not drive the formulation of an RPA. However, this is a scientific dispute between the State and water users\u2019 scientists on the one side and federal scientists on the other. Administrative law permits the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>agency to make mistakes, and the ESA requires such disputes be resolved in the species\u2019 favor. This is Congress\u2019 choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-5\">(14) However, the BiOp does not clearly explain the rationale for imposing a 4:1 ratio in above normal and wet years. Particularly in light of the potential adverse consequences of imposing such a ratio, this is unlawful. Full explanation on remand is required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-6\">(15) Likewise, although there is marginal record support for the imposition of some form of OMR flow restriction, Action IV.2.3 must be remanded for further explanation of the necessity for the specific flow prescriptions imposed, which are derived primarily from PTM simulations, a method that is undisputedly an imperfect, if not incompetent, predictor of salmon behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-7\">(16) Action IV.3 suffers from a similar defect. Although there is record support for some form of action designed to prevent large numbers of fish from being killed or harmed at the export facilities, lawful explanation is required to justify the specific triggers imposed by Action IV.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-8\">(17) As to Export Plaintiffs\u2019 and DWR\u2019s argument that the RPA fails to satisfy the four requirements of 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-9\">(a) Federal Defendants failed to sufficiently explain whether the RPA can be implemented consistent with the co-equal, non-environmental statutory purposes of the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-10\">(b) Although the CVPIA does not grant NMFS unlimited power to take whatever Project water it deems essential for the species, under D-1641, lawful RPA\u2019s can (and must) be implemented in a manner consistent with the legal authority and jurisdiction of Reclamation and DWR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-11\">(c) The BiOp reasonably concluded that the RPA is economically feasible for the action agency to implement. Only the .costs to the action agency are relevant; economic burdens upon third parties cannot be considered under <em>TVA v. Hill.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-13\">(d)The fourth \u00a7 402.02 requirement demands that an RPA avoid jeopardy and/or adverse modification. Consistent with and incorporating the rulings on the merits of the challenges to RPA Actions IV.2.1, IV.2.3 and IV.3, while there is anecdotal evidence for some of the general approaches used in these RPA Actions, the specific prescriptions imposed are not sufficiently justified or explained. NMFS acted arbitrarily and capriciously in concluding that Actions IV.2.1, IV.2.3 and IV.3 are essential to avoid jeopardy and/or adverse modification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-14\">(18)Regarding DWR\u2019s related challenges to Action IV.4.2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-15\">(a) Action IV.4.2 is not inconsistent with Action IV.4, and is not unlawful in that respect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-16\">(b) The record lacks affirmative support for findings that either Action IV.4.2(1) or Action IV.4.2(2) are feasible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-17\">(c) The record fails to explain why the measures imposed by Action IV.4.2 are essential to avoid jeopardy and/or adverse modification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-18\">(B) Stanislaus River Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that the BiOp violates the ESA and the APA is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; and Federal Defendants\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART based on the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-19\">(1) It was not unlawful for NMFS to include the New Melones unit in the action under consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>(2) NMFS did not act unlawfully by failing to distinguish between baseline effects and effects of the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-4\">(3) As to SR Plaintiffs\u2019 challenges to the adverse modification findings related to New Melones:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-5\">(a) The BiOp\u2019s use of a \u201cmaximization\u201d benchmark in connection with its analysis of spawnable area is without support in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-6\">(b) The BiOp\u2019s finding that New Melones operations affect gravel recruitment is without support in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-7\">(c) The record adequately supports the BiOp\u2019s findings regarding New Melones\u2019 effects on temperature conditions in spawning habitat and on downstream migration corridors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-8\">(4) As to SR Plaintiffs\u2019 challenges to the New Melones RPA Actions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-9\">(a) The BiOp does not reasonably or sufficiently explain its decision to set a \u201cmaximum habitat goal,\u201d which underlies its decision to use certain assumptions to model RPA actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-10\">(b) The Stanislaus River RPA Actions do not improperly require Reclamation to infringe on OID and SSJID\u2019s prior rights to Stanislaus River water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-11\">(c) Federal Defendants did not act unlawfully by failing to utilize the San Joaquin River Water Temperature Model.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-12\">(d) The limitations of the exceptions built into Action III.1.2 must be defined on remand to explain how often the exception can be triggered without rendering the Action ineffectual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-13\">(e) The record and best available science do not support Action II.1.3\u2019s 5,000 cfs spring pulse flow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-14\">(f) In calculating the flows CV Steelhead need for outmigration, NMFS relied on a CDFG model used to determine flows needed to double salmon in the San Joaquin River. While it was not inappropriate for NMFS to use a model employing salmon as a surrogate for CV Steel-head, nothing in the record explains why it is appropriate to use a model designed to double the existing salmon population to set numeric flow targets to avoid jeopardy to the CV steelhead. This is arbitrary and capricious and must be fully explained on remand. In addition, NMFS must address the fact that the BiOp unreasonably relied upon runs from an outdated version of the model.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-16\">(g) SR Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Stanislaus River RPAs were unlawful because they constituted \u201cimpermissible major changes\u201d to the New Mel-ones Project is without merit, as this requirement applies to \u201creasonable and prudent measures,\u201d none of which were applied to the Stanislaus River.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-17\">(h) As to SR Plaintiffs\u2019 challenges to the BiOp\u2019s feasibility analyses of the Stanislaus River RPA Actions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-18\">(1) The feasibility modeling did not employ erroneous assumptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-19\">(2) Action III.1.2\u2019s exception procedure is so broad that it renders any feasibility analysis wholly unreliable and arbitrary. It is unlawful as formulated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-20\">(3) The feasibility of Action III.2.2 cannot be evaluated because the RPA has yet to be defined. This is not a valid RPA. Federal Defendants must ensure that any Action defined in the future complies with the requirements of law. SR Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to this feasibility analysis is correct to the extent there is not a validly formulated RPA Action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>(i) SR Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to Action III.2.2 as inconsistent with the flood control purposes of the New Melones Project is valid, as that Action has yet to be defined and is not yet a valid RPA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-5\">(j) SR Plaintiffs\u2019 have not demonstrated that the pulse flows called for in Action III.1.3, designed to be of short duration to limit seepage impacts to nearby landowners, conflict with the flood control purpose of the New Melones Project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-6\">(k) SR Plaintiffs\u2019 have failed to meet their burden to demonstrate that the Stanislaus River RPAs violate Article X, Section 2 of the California Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">(C) All Plaintiffs\u2019 motions for summary judgment that Reclamation violated the ESA and/or the APA are DENIED; Federal Defendant and Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 cross motions are GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">It is undisputed that the law entitles the winter-run and spring-run Chinook, CV steelhead, Southern DPS of green sturgeon, and Southern Resident killer whales to ESA protection.

The BiOp discusses and prescribes RPAs to address many other sources of harm, including adverse temperature conditions and blockages caused by dams on the Sacramento River. The BiOp\u2019s jeopardy conclusion is lawful. Project operations negatively impact the Listed Species and adversely modify their critical habitat in various ways that remain incompletely described and quantified.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">Some of NMFS\u2019s analyses rely upon equivocal or bad science to impose RPA Actions without clearly explaining or otherwise demonstrating why the specific measures imposed are essential to avoid jeopardy and/or adverse modification.

Unlike in the Sacramento River basin, no noticeable increase in SJR salmon escapement occurred when substantial changes in ocean sport and commercial fish regulations restricted ocean harvest in recent years. Additionally, regressing the Central Valley Harvest Index against annual SJR escapement produces a weak, but statistically significant, regression correlation (Figure 26). The relationships depicted in Figure 25 and 26 suggest that factors other than ocean harvest, such as in-Delta or in-river conditions, are controlling the long-term SJR salmon escapement trend.
