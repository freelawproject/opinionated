The evidence discloses that appellant was found in possession of the mules alleged to have been stolen in company with Andrew McMillan and Welch. The evidence further shows that W. M. Hopper and G. W. Hutchison made a written contract with Andrew- McMillan to act as a detective in order to catch appellant, whom they believed had been stealing their stock. By the terms of the contract with McMillan, the latter ivas to go with John AVelch and defendant and steal a bunch of stock, and blow them into the officers\u2019 hands, with the understanding that McMillan should not be prosecuted, and should receive a fee of $150, for his service as such detective. Seventeen mules and one horse were taken by the parties. However, appellant\u2019s insistence is that, under the evidence, the stock were taken with the consent of the owner Hutchison, he having induced McMillan to go with appellant and Welch to commit the theft. Hutchison testified that it was not his understanding that the parties were to steal his stock. In addition to appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence fails to show a want of consent, he also submitted several special charges on this state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>of facts. These charges were given in the main charge of the court. The court charged the jury to the effect that if the said McMillan induced appellant to commit the theft, and that the intent and purpose to steal originated with and was suggested by said McMillan, it would be a taking with the consent of the owner, Hutchison, and they should in that event acquit appellant. If an owner of property in order to detect a thief directs another person to apparently encourage the thief\u2019s design, and lead him on, and the act is consummated, it would be theft, provided the owner or his agent did not induce the original intent on the part of the thief.

There being no error in the mode and manner in which appellant was tried, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
