This criticism is correct. The charge is erroneous in the particular pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Furthermore, appellant complains, that the court should have told the jury that if he provoked the difficulty with such apparent intention to kill, then he would not-be guilty of any higher grade of offense if the assaulted party had died, than manslaughter. The converse of the first proposition as stated, should have been given. Airhart v. State, 51 S. W. Rep., 214; McCandless v. State, <em>57 </em>S. W. Rep., 672; Shannon v. State, 35 Teas Crim. App., 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">For the errors pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded. <em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
