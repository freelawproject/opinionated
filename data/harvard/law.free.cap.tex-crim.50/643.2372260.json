Some of the testimony was that ground which has been tramped and manured like that which defendant plowed, dries up much faster than if it had not been treated that way, but other testimony showed that ground upon which cattle had been fed like this would not dry out any quicker than any other ground, and would hold moisture as well.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b666-5\"><em>H.

The facts show conclusively, and it is practically conceded by appellant that he did engage in farm work on Sunday. It was not a work of necessity which would exempt appellant from the terms of the statute, or at least the evidence amply supports the converse conclusion. Being a question of fact, the evidence supporting the State\u2019s insistence, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
