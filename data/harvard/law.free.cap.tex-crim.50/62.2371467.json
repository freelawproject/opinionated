The requested instruction, was to the effect: \u201cIf the jury find that a witness has sworn falsely then such witness is not a credible witness, and you would not be authorized to convict upon the testimony of such witness alone.\u201d In our opinion the response of the court was a proper one, and left the consideration of the credit they would give to the witness exclusively to the jury, where the law left it. The requested charge, it occurs to us, would have been on the weight of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>evidence, because as a matter of law,- it is not correct to inform the jury that if a witness has sworn falsely as to one matter, such witness is not a credible witness,. The credit of the witness being exclusively the province of the jury they could believe or disbelieve a part of the testimony of such witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Appellant strenuously insists that the verdict of the jury cannot be sustained on the testimony. We have examined the record carefully in this respect, and without reviewing the evidence here, in our opinion it is sufficient to authorize the verdict. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
