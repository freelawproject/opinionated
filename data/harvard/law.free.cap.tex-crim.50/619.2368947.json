At the time he left home he had a pistol under the buggy seat where, appellant insists, it remained all the while. The State\u2019s evidence shows that he stopped on the way to the church, got out of the buggy, secured the pistol, and at the point of the pistol forced another party to desist who was engaged in a difficulty with his, the other party\u2019s wife. In the case of Garrett v. State, 25 S. W. Rep., 285, Judge Hurt, delivering the opinion of the court, held that these facts constitute the carrying of a pistol on or about his person as inhibited by the statute. Many of the questions raised by appellant suggested to the court to charge the jury that these facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number><em>do </em>not constitute a violation of the law. It follows, therefore, that the court did not err in refusing said charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\">Appellant- also complains- that the court permitted the prosecuting attorney to discuss the above cited ease to the jury. This is a matter left to the sound discretion of the, court. We see, in this instance, no abuse of that discretion. Finding no error in this record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
