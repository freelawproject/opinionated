The contention that the evidence produced at the petitioner\u2019s trial did not prove that he had committed the crime with which he was charged cannot be considered in a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding. <em>Laslo v. Warden of Maryland House of Correction, </em>204 Md. 663, 103 A. 2d 342; <em>Friedel v. Warden of Maryland Penitentiary, </em>205 Md. 657, 109 A. 2d 50; <em>Cummings v. Warden of Maryland House of Correction, </em>206 Md. 637, 111 A. 2d 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Petitioner also stated that he unfortunately had a prior criminal record, and that the Court in the charge to the jury was so prejudiced against him that he was convicted \u201cbefore the jury revealed its decision.\u201d This allegation, in the absence of any specific facts, is too general to warrant the issuance of a writ of <em>habeas corpus. Hickman v. Warden of Maryland House of Correction, </em>203 Md. 668, 99 A. 2d 730; <em>Williams v. Warden of the Maryland Penitentiary, </em>205 Md. 633, 109 A. 2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
