The petitioner was convicted in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County of assault with intent to kill and sentenced to three'years in the House of Correction from July 9, 1954. Aside from a contention that the evidence was insufficient to convict, which obviously cannot be raised in this proceeding, the petitioner contends that the indictment was defective, in that he was named as \u201cEdward\u201d, whereas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>the proof showed his name is \u201cEverett\u201d. Defects in an indictment, in the nature of a variance, cannot be reviewed in a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding. <em>Ahern v. Warden, </em>203 Md. 679, 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
