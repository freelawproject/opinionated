He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment with all but four years suspended for the assault conviction, and to three concurrent four-year terms for the convictions on three counts of reckless endangerment. The court merged the remaining reckless endangerment conviction into the assault conviction. Appellant presents the following questions for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>I. Did the trial court err in refusing to strike the testimony of a witness who had violated the sequestration rule?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">II. Did the trial court err in refusing to instruct the jury that self defense applies to reckless endangerment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">We answer both questions in the negative and, accordingly, we affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">On July 6, 1997, Carmen Reavis met several of her friends for an afternoon of fun at Adventure World, a water amusement park located in Prince George\u2019s County. Among them were Tracy Barber, Gerald Goode, Walter Stokes, Reginald Davis, and William Brown. The group collected inside the park at around 1:30 p.m. and spent the next several hours together. Appellant and Rashad Friday, his friend, arrived at Adventure World at around 5:30 p.m. the same day. About ten minutes later, Friday spotted Reavis, whom he did not know, and, thinking she was attractive, approached her.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Appellant testified in his own defense. He explained that Friday \u201creached over to touch [Reavis\u2019s] arm to get her attention so she could hear him....\u201d When Reavis did not respond, Friday \u201ctouched\u201d her arm again. This time, \u201c[s]he responded immediately with cursing and fussing.\u201d Friday then \u201cput his hands up and like okay, no problem.\u201d Appellant turned away momentarily to speak with some friends who were standing nearby; when he looked back he saw that \u201capproximately seven to nine guys [had] surrounded [Friday] in a confrontation.\u201d Among them were Goode, Stokes, Brown, and Davis. Appellant approached the men and said to Friday, \u201c[l]et\u2019s walk.\u201d He and Friday then walked together toward the front gate, \u201cwhere we had seen some safety, the only place I [had] seen security.\u201d The group followed. At that point, appellant became scared.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Appellant further testified that as he and Friday crossed over a narrow bridge, he looked to his right and saw three of the pursuers attack Friday. He watched Friday \u201cgo down\u201d as his attackers \u201cstomp[ed] on him\u201d and kicked him in the head <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>and chest. Immediately thereafter, someone grabbed appellant from behind, threw him into a railing and repeatedly hit his head against it. Appellant remembered being accosted by three assailants: one who stood behind him and restrained his arms and two others who alternated striking him in the head and chest. Appellant explained that, \u201cfw]hen I got one of my arms released I reached in my right pocket, pulled out a knife, opened it up\u201d and \u201ccut each of them until they let me go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The State\u2019s witnesses offered a very different version of events. Reavis testified that as she and her friends were walking toward the \u201cMind Eraser\u201d roller coaster, Friday grabbed her arm. She did not want to speak with him, so she continued walking. Friday approached her again a few minutes later and this time reached over and touched her breast. When Goode learned what had happened, he confronted Friday and warned him to keep his hands to himself. According to Reavis, \u201cit wasn\u2019t like a crowd of people, you know, around or nothing. It was just like basically us three, and it was a couple people around, but they was like a little distance back.\u201d Friday made disparaging remarks to Reavis and she found him to be belligerent, not apologetic. Reavis heard appellant ask Goode if he wanted to \u201ctake it outside,\u201d but Goode refused. About five minutes later, appellant and Friday suddenly attacked Goode on the bridge. Brown, Williams, and Davis got involved in the brawl to help Goode. Reavis saw appellant \u201cswinging his arms wildly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Stokes testified that appellant had a knife and that during the brawl, appellant stabbed him in the leg. Brown testified that during the commotion, appellant was \u201cswinging\u201d and then spun around and stabbed him. When the dust cleared, Stokes, Brown, Goode, and Davis had been wounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Additional facts will be recited as necessary to our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Before trial, the court directed that all potential witnesses be excused from the courtroom and that they not discuss their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>testimony with anyone during the trial. Reavis was the first witness to testify. Goode took the stand after Reavis. Shortly after Goode finished testifying and left the courtroom, appellant\u2019s attorney informed the trial court \u201cthat both Miss Reavis and Mr. Goode have come out of the courtroom and related their testimony to other people in the hallway who are potential witnesses in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The court allowed the attorneys to conduct a <em>voir dire </em>examination of Reavis and Goode later that day. Goode denied having discussed the case with anyone. Reavis, on the other hand, acknowledged that she had spoken to her friends in the hallway about some of the questions that she had been asked in court, but claimed that she had not been aware of the sequestration order at the time. She further explained that she did not discuss the case again after she was advised of the sequestration order and what it meant. In her defense, the prosecutor explained, \u201cYour Honor, I have \u2014 spoken with the gentlemen in the case. I can not (sic) specifically recall whether I told Miss Reavis [about the order].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The trial judge instructed the attorneys \u201cto both take the time this evening to re-emphasize to your prospective witnesses that there is a rule on witnesses and what that means,\u201d and advised that it was their responsibility to make sure the sequestration order was followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The next day, appellant moved to strike Reavis\u2019s testimony as a sanction for her having violated the sequestration order. The trial court found that \u201cMiss Reavis did' talk with certain parties concerning her testimony,\u201d but denied appellant\u2019s motion, explaining that \u201c[w]hat I\u2019m concerned about is, as [the prosecutor] admitted yesterday, she may not have advised Miss Reavis of [the sequestration]-rule.\u201d Appellant now argues that that ruling was in error. Specifically, he maintains that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to strike Reavis\u2019s testimony when it was \u201cclearly established\u201d that she had violated the sequestration order.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Maryland Rule 5-615 governs the exclusion of witnesses. Section (a) of the rule provides, in part, that \u201cupon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the request of a party made before testimony begins, the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses.\u201d \u201c \u2018The purpose of the sequestration of witnesses has been said to be to prevent them from being taught or prompted by each other\u2019s testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Redditt v. State, </em>837 Md. 621, 628, 655 A.2d 390 (1995) (applying former Md.Rule 4-321 and quoting <em>Bulluck v. State, </em>219 Md. 67, 70-71, 148 A.2d 433, <em>cert. denied, </em>361 U.S. 847, 80 S.Ct. 102, 4 L.Ed.2d 85 (1959)). <em>See also Hurley v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 348, 352, 251 A.2d 241 (1969). Section (e) of Md.Rule 5-615 further provides that \u201c[t]he court may exclude all or part of the testimony of the witness who receives information in violation of this Rule.\u201d \u201cWhen there has been a violation of a sequestration order, whether there is to be a sanction and, if so, what sanction to impose, are decisions left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Redditt, </em>337 Md. at 629, 655 A.2d 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Consistent with the sequestration rule\u2019s objectives of \u201cavoid[ing] an artificial harmony of testimony that prevents the trier of fact from truly weighing all the testimony\u201d and \u201cavoiding] the outright manufacture of testimony,\u201d <em>Hurley, </em>6 Md.App. at 352, 251 A.2d 241, section (e) of Md.Rule 5-615 permits exclusion by the court of the testimony of a witness who has <em>received </em>information in violation of the rule. In this case, Reavis did not <em>receive </em>information in violation of the sequestration order. Rather, she <em>imparted </em>information to other potential witnesses after she already had testified. Thus, to the extent that Reavis violated the sequestration rule, her conduct did not taint her own testimony. Exclusion of her testimony was not a permitted sanction under Md.Rule 5-615(e) and would not have served the purposes of the sequestration rule in any event. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike Reavis\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The second claim of error relates to the trial court\u2019s failure to grant a requested jury instruction. Appellant was charged, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>inter alia, </em>with attempted second degree murder, attempted voluntary manslaughter, first degree assault, and second degree assault. In addition, he was charged with four counts of reckless endangerment, under Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1998 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 12A-2(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Appellant submitted the following proposed jury instruction on reckless endangerment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">If an individual is acting in defense of a crime of violence, he cannot be guilty of reckless endangerment. <em>It is the State\u2019s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not acting in defense of a crime of violence. </em>If you are not so convinced, you must find the defendant not guilty of all counts charging Reckless Endangerment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">(Emphasis added). In a footnote to the proposed instruction, appellant cited \u201cArt. 27 \u00a7 12A-2(b)(4).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The trial court instructed the jury on self-defense and imperfect self defense. It did not give appellant\u2019s proposed instruction on reckless endangerment. Appellant\u2019s counsel excepted, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">THE COURT: Anything else, [Defense Counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes. On the reckless endangerment, I\u2019ve requested\u2014 <em>... I asked the Court with respect to reckless endangerment to instruct the jury that if an individual is acting in defense of a crime of violence he cannot be guilty of reckless endangerment. That is a statutory provision of Article 27, Section 12-A-2BJ,.. I think the jury should know that, that it\u2019s akin to a self-defense.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-11\">Reckless endangerment, my client was being attacked and he was the victim of a crime of violence. He can not (sic) be held guilty of reckless endangerment, according to the statute. We\u2019re requesting that the jury be so instructed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-12\">THE COURT: Your exceptions are noted. I would point out again that reckless endangerment does not require specific intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But the statute does say what I just asked, that it is an accurate statement of the law and I think it\u2019s applicable to this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Appellant contends that the requested instruction properly stated the law and that the evidence generated the instruction. Citing Md.Rule 4-325(c), appellant argues that the court was duty bound to give the instruction and erred in not doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The State first counters that appellant failed to preserve this issue for review. Specifically, the State points to a colloquy between appellant and the trial judge in which appellant excepted to the omission of the word \u201cinitial\u201d before \u201caggressor\u201d in the court\u2019s instruction on self-defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANV\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I thought it was \u2014 I took [the instruction on common law self-defense] right from the pattern instruction, but I\u2019m asking for the Court to say that [appellant] was not the initial aggressor. I\u2019m asking the Court also, as I said, to instruct the jury that self-defense applies to all of the counts, <em>with the exception of reckless endangerment; </em>that imperfect self-defense applies to first degree assault as well ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">(Emphasis added). Seizing upon counsel\u2019s statement that \u201cself-defense applies to all of the counts, with the exception of reckless endangerment,\u201d the State contends that appellant \u201cexpressly acknowledged that self-defense did not apply to reckless endangerment,\u201d and thus cannot now assert that the trial court erred in \u201cfailing] to instruct [the jury to] the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">The context of the statement by appellant\u2019s counsel makes plain that he was drawing a distinction for the court between the offenses for which he had requested an instruction on self-defense and the offense of reckless endangerment, for which he had requested an instruction under Art. 27, \u00a7 12A-2(b)(4). Moreover, it is clear from the record that appellant adequately apprised the trial court of his position concerning the requested instruction. The issue was preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>With respect to the merits of the argument, the State contends that the trial court properly refused to grant the requested instruction because the language of Article 27, \u00a7 12A-2(b)(4) on which appellant was relying had been repealed and the language of the statute as amended does not entitle appellant to the instruction he submitted to the court. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">As we have indicated, the alleged offenses in this case occurred on July 6, 1997. Effective April 8, 1997, Art. 27, \u00a7 12A-2 was amended to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">(a) <em>Creation of substantial risk of death or serious physical injury; penalties. </em>\u2014 (1) Any person who recklessly engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical \u2022 injury to another person is guilty of the misdemeanor of reckless endangerment____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, any person who recklessly discharges a firearm from a motor vehicle in such a manner that it creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person is guilty of the misdemeanor of reckless endangerment. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">(b) <em>Applicable </em>Conduct.\u2014 ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-10\">... (2) <em>Subsection (a)(2) of this section does not apply to any conduct involving: ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-11\">(ii) <em>An individual acting in defense of a </em>... <em>crime of </em>violence....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">1997 Md.Laws, Ch. 82, \u00a7 1. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">As the language of \u00a7 12A-2(b)(2)(ii) makes plain, an individual who is acting in defense of a crime of violence and who engages in the conduct specified in \u00a7 12A-2(a)(2), <em>i.e., </em>\u201crecklessly discharging] a firearm from a motor vehicle ...\u201d is <em>not </em>committing the crime of reckless endangerment. That exception is narrowly written, however, and does <em>not </em>apply to the more general conduct set forth in \u00a7 12A-2(a)(2), <em>i.e., </em>\u201creck<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>lessly engaging] in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In this case, appellant was charged with reckless endangerment under \u00a7 12A-2(a)(l). The jury instruction that he requested would have been a correct statement of the law if he had been charged with recklessly discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle under \u00a7 12A-2(a)(2). It was not a correct statement of the law under the circumstances of this case, however, and the trial court properly refused to grant it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\">. Art. 27, \u00a7 12A-2(b)(4), cited by appellant\u2019s counsel in support of the requested instruction, was repealed by the amendment to that statute that became effective on April 8, 1997. Prior to the amendment, the statute read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">(a) <em>Creation of substantial risk of death or serious physical injury; penalties. </em>\u2014 (1) Any person who recklessly engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person is guilty of the misdemeanor of reckless endangerment and on conviction is subject to a fine of not more than $5,000 or imprisonment for not more than 5 years or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, any person who recklessly discharges a firearm from a motor vehicle in such a manner that it creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person is guilty of the misdemeanor of reckless endangerment and on conviction is subject to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">(b) <em>Applicable conduct. </em>\u2014 This section does not apply to any conduct involving:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">(4) An individual acting in defense of a crime of violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 12A-2(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">Appellant's counsel interpreted former \u00a7 12A-2(b)(4) as applying to both former \u00a7 12A-2(a)(l) and former \u00a7 12A-2(a)(2), and requested the instruction on that basis. Given the prefatory language of former \u00a7 12A-2(a)(2), it is not clear that the exception provided in former \u00a7 12A-2(b)(4) would apply to the charges of reckless endangerment in this case in any event. We need not detain ourselves with that inquiry, however, because the amended statute in effect at the relevant time resolved any ambiguity that may have existed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
