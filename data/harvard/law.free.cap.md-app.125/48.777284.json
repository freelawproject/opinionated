The attack briefly spawned chaos, confusion, and commotion in the courtroom, and culminated in a closure order barring appellant\u2019s mother, sister, and girlfriend (collectively, the \u201cfamily\u201d) from attending the suppression hearing and the trial. Because the courtroom was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>equipped with video cameras, in lieu of a court reporter, the incident was captured on videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">On February 28,1998, a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County convicted appellant of robbery with a deadly weapon, two counts of first degree assault, and three counts of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court subsequently sentenced appellant to a total of twenty-five years in prison.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, only matters arising from the courtroom fracas are at issue. Appellant presents the following questions for our review, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">I. Did the trial court abuse its discretion and violate appellant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial when it issued a closure order barring appellant\u2019s family from the trial, because of the family\u2019s behavior in response \u25a0 to an assault upon appellant committed by a State\u2019s witness during a pre-trial motion hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">II. Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it denied appellant\u2019s request for a continuance of the trial after a courtroom disturbance that occurred while the jury was sequestered in the jury room?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding appellant\u2019s family from the trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, we hold that the closure order violated appellant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial. Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>shall reverse the convictions and remand for further proceedings. In view of our disposition of the first issue, we need not reach appellant\u2019s second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">I. The Videotape: A Picture Is Worth A Thousand Words</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">This case presents a situation created by \u201cemerging technologies that are fast becoming a part of the trial process.\u201d <em>Ringe v. State, </em>94 Md.App. 614, 625, 618 A.2d 266 (1993). In this era marked by the importance of the \u201cvisual image\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and \u201cdizzying television technology\u201d,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it happened that video cameras, rather than a court reporter, were utilized to make a record of the trial proceedings. Although a transcript of most of the videotaped court proceedings has been submitted for our review, no transcription of the melee was prepared; clearly, it would have been almost impossible to prepare such a transcript. Accordingly, the videotape of the court proceedings, including the fracas, has been included as part of the record on appeal, pursuant to this Court\u2019s order of October 14, 1998. <em>See generally </em>Md. Rules 8-415, 16-405, 16-406. While the transcript contains the trial judge\u2019s post-event summary of what occurred, the videotape provides the only contemporaneous account of the courtroom disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The trial judge was one of several eyewitnesses to the underlying occurrence, but she was the only witness who recounted what happened. Moreover, the family members were not provided with an opportunity to explain their conduct, which was provoked by the attack upon appellant and prompted the closure order. In a sense, the judge relied on her own credibility and reliability as a witness in determining to issue a closure order. Thus, this case pits the videotape of the courtroom disturbance against the transcript, which contains the trial judge\u2019s observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The parties have not raised any concerns about our review of the videotape, nor have they suggested any factors that should guide our consideration of it. To be sure, we are concerned about the potential misuse of a videotape of the proceedings as a vehicle for \u201cinstant replay,\u201d opening the door to the proverbial \u201cMonday morning quarterbacking\u201d regarding the trial judges fact-finding. Indeed, we are mindful that even when an umpire or a referee makes a \u201cbad call\u201d that is plainly evident on replay, the call is not overruled. Yet this is not a game, and we cannot disregard a vital part of the record. Instead, we are required to determine from our review of the <em>entire </em>record whether the judge\u2019s findings of fact, undergird-ing the closure order, were clearly erroneous. <em>See Jones v. State, </em>348 Md. 448, 457-58, 682 A.2d 248 (1996); Md. Rule 8-131(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">When the factual findings of the trial court are supported by substantial evidence, they are not clearly erroneous. <em>Ryan v. Thurston, </em>276 Md. 390, 392, 347 A.2d 834 (1975); <em>Sea Watch Stores Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Council of Unit Owners of Sea Watch Condominium, </em>115 Md.App. 5, 31, 691 A.2d 750, <em>cert. granted, </em>347 Md. 253, 700 A.2d 1214, <em>and cert. dismissed, </em>347 Md. 622, 702 A.2d 260 (1997). Our review is limited to determining \u201conly whether there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings. In making this decision, we must assume the truth of all evidence, and of all the favorable inferences fairly deducible therefrom, tending to support the factual conclusions of the lower court.\u201d <em>Mercedes-Benz v. Garten, </em>94 Md.App. 547, 556, 618 A.2d 233 (1993) (citation omitted); <em>see also State v. Johnson, </em>108 Md.App. 54, 71, 670 A.2d 1012 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Our research reveals that numerous courts, in Maryland and elsewhere, have readily considered videotapes without offending the well-established principles that govern appellate review. In <em>Suggs v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 250, 589 A.2d 551 (1991), for example, we considered the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s conduct in analyzing whether the defendant received a fair trial. To determine what actually occurred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>front of the jury, we specifically reviewed the videotape of the court proceedings, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">Appellant\u2019s counsel, at oral argument, stated that the videotape of the proceedings showed that the jury was still in the</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">courtroom. <em>We have reviewed the tape, and he is correct. Id. </em>at 257 n. 2, 589 A.2d 551 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Similarly, in <em>Ringe, </em>94 Md.App. 614, 618 A.2d 266, we considered a videotaped confession offered in evidence at a suppression hearing. Writing for this Court, Judge Cathell said that \u201creview of the video tape [sic] may be even more necessary when appellate judges are required to make independent appraisals of constitutional issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623, 618 A.2d 266. <em>See also, e.g., In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>109 Md.App. 475, 516, 675 A.2d 170 (1996) (finding no support for trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s home was \u201cless than desirable,\u201d based on appellate review of videotape introduced in evidence), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>347 Md. 295, 701 A.2d 110 (1997); <em>J.F.E. v. J.A.S., </em>930 P.2d 409, 412 (Alaska 1997) (discussing appellate court\u2019s review of videotape and photographs introduced as exhibits in connection with visitation dispute and concluding they did not \u201cfurnish a sufficient basis for the court\u2019s decision to restrict [father\u2019s] visitation privileges\u201d); <em>Noland v. Noland, </em>330 Ark. 660, 956 S.W.2d 173, 178-79 (1997) (reviewing, <em>inter alia, </em>videotaped interview of decedent and his execution of trust and concluding that \u201ctrial court clearly erred in finding that the appellants failed to establish [decedent\u2019s] soundness of mind,\u201d because videotape \u201cmanifestly depicts a man who essentially knew what he was doing in signing the documents.\u201d); <em>State v. Moncrief, </em>234 Ga.App. 871, 508 S.E.2d 216 (1998) (reviewing audio/videotape of car stop and reversing trial court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s motion in limine on the basis of alleged deficiency of warnings); <em>Montoya v. State, </em>232 Ga.App. 24, 499 S.E.2d 680, 683 (1998) (reviewing the videotape of a car stop and ruling that trial court correctly denied suppression motion); <em>State v. Aubin, </em>100 N.C.App. 628, 397 S.E.2d 653 (1990) (reviewing videotape and upholding trial court\u2019s findings of fact); <em>Commonwealth v. Lease, </em>703 A.2d 506 (Pa.Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>per.Ct.1997) (reviewing videotape from burglar alarm protection system and concluding evidence was sufficient to support burglary conviction); <em>Cooper v. State, </em>961 S.W.2d 222, 226-27 (Tex.Ct.App.1997) (reviewing videotape in connection with motion to suppress videotape made at police station and concluding that trial court erred in admitting audio portion of videotape because defendant invoked his right to terminate interview); <em>Perkins v. State, </em>940 S.W.2d 365 (Tex.Ct.App.1997) (concluding that videotape made shortly after defendant\u2019s arrest \u201cdemonstrated that Appellant was not intoxicated\u201d and reversing conviction following bench trial on ground that \u201cfinding of intoxication is so against the great weight [of evidence] as to be unjust and manifestly wrong.\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. Benjamin, </em>28 Va.App. 548, 507 S.E.2d 113 (1998) (upholding trial judge\u2019s determination that defendant did not waive constitutional rights, based on independent appellate review of videotape of custodial interrogation); <em>State v. Peterson, </em>588 N.W.2d 84 (Wis.Ct.App.1998) (reviewing videotape and concluding that trial court erroneously excluded it from evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We have uncovered only one appellate court that expressly declined to review a videotape of trial proceedings. In <em>Moustakas v. Dashevsky, </em>25 Cal.App.4th 752, 754, 30 Cal.Rptr.2d 753, 754 (1994), the court did not want to engage in its \u201cown evaluation of the sights and sounds of the trial courtroom.\u201d In that court\u2019s view, consideration of the videotape represented a \u201cdrastic change\u201d in \u201c[m]any aspects of the time-honored rules limiting the scope of appellate review____\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the court believed that it contravened the trial judge\u2019s function \u201cto see and hear witnesses, attorneys, and jurors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we see it, the California appellate court overlooked the equally important responsibility of an appellate court to apply the clearly erroneous standard to the trial judge\u2019s fact-finding. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(c).</p>\n<p id=\"AZJ\">Accordingly, our factual summary of the courtroom disturbance derives from both the transcript and the videotape. Were it not for the video cameras, our understanding of the events that unfolded in the courtroom would necessarily have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>been limited to the oral account provided by the judge. Because the record includes the videotape, however, we need not rely solely on the judge\u2019s rendition of events. Through the lens of the video cameras, it is as if we, too, were eyewitnesses to the disturbance; the videotape enables us to see for ourselves what happened in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Although we recognize that video cameras are not without limitations, the video cameras that were used in the courtroom, were not \u201cstatic.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, they did not merely capture a \u201cthin slice\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of what occurred. Rather, the video cameras captured the details of the incident in a way that an ordinary eyewitness understandably could not. Further, quite unlike an actual eyewitness caught in the frenzy of the moment, we have been able to scrutinize, analyze, and repeatedly review the videotape, and we have done so in the calm, dispassionate milieu afforded to an appellate court. Our review has also benefitted from technological aids, such as slow motion and the use of freeze frames. We remain mindful, however, that even when two or more people witness the same incident, they \u201cmay see or hear it differently.\u201d Aaronson, <em>Maryland Criminal Jury Instructions and Commentary, </em>\u00a7 2.06, at 77 (2d ed.1988) (citing, <em>inter alia, </em>DeVitt and Blackmar, <em>Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, </em>\u00a7 17.01 (3d ed.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">After scrutinizing the videotape and the transcript, it is evident to us that the trial judge\u2019s summary of facts \u2014 the only first hand account provided to us \u2014 did not correspond in all material respects with what the video cameras recorded. In reaching our conclusion, we are satisfied that our review has not encroached upon the trial judge\u2019s exercise of her fact-finding duties. Instead, we have endeavored to fulfill our responsibility to determine whether the trial judge\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>II. Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"Ao\">A. Facts Pertinent to the Charges<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">At around 3:00 a.m. on January 30, 1997, while Earl Watkins and his girlfriend, Sherre Burton, were watching television in the living room of Ms. Burton\u2019s Capitol Heights apartment, appellant and a few other men made an uninvited entry into the apartment. Brandishing handguns, which the men pointed at the faces of the two victims, the assailants robbed Watkins of over $100.00.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellant also kicked Watkins in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">In the meantime, Officers Piazza and Butcher responded to a 911 call that Watkins had made when he first heard the sound of breaking glass. As the officers approached the apartment building, a man yelled \u201cpolice,\u201d and the robbers fled the scene. According to Detective Gregory McDonald, the police recovered $340.00 that the robbers left scattered at the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">After the robbery, Watkins told Detective McDonald that he knew one of the assailants from the area, and identified him as \u201cDaryl.\u201d In a photographic array subsequently shown to Watkins by Sergeant Mark Ciccone, Watkins positively identified appellant as one of the robbers. According to Sergeant Ciccone, Ms. Burton selected two photographs of the person she knew as \u201cDaryl.\u201d One of the photographs was that of appellant. At the time, Ms. Burton indicated that the people in the photographs looked \u201cfamiliar\u201d and \u201c[i]t could be him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">At trial, Watkins explained that he recognized appellant because he had seen him at the building \u201call the time.\u201d Moreover, on the night in question, Watkins said that he stood \u201cvery close\u201d to appellant. According to Watkins, Walker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>stood \u201cright in front\u201d of Watkins, with only Walker\u2019s gun obstructing the victim\u2019s vision. Ms. Burton stated that she had only \u201cglanced\u201d at the robbers, and the robbers instructed her not to look at their faces. Indeed, one of the assailants wrapped a towel around Ms. Burton\u2019s head and put her in a closet. Therefore, Ms. Burton was not asked if she could identify appellant as one of the robbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">B. Facts Pertinent to Issue I</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The incident occurred shortly after the conclusion of <em>voir dire. </em>At the time, the jurors, who were not yet sworn, were sequestered in a jury room adjacent to the courtroom, because the court was to begin the suppression hearing concerning the pretrial photographic identification of appellant. The videotape reveals that appellant was seated at the trial table next to his counsel, and four people were seated on two benches in the public seating area of the courtroom. Three of the spectators have been identified as appellant\u2019s mother, sister, and girlfriend, although we do not know who is who. The fourth person, seated behind them, has not been identified for us. Several court personnel were also present in the courtroom, including two uniformed sheriffs deputies. Nevertheless, the precise number of court personnel and their specific duties is not made clear in the record. The videotape also shows a rail separating the well of the court from the public seating area, in what seems like a rather small courtroom. An aisle divided the public seating area into two sections, and the spectators were all seated on the same side as appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The State began by calling Watkins as its first witness. The videotape indicates that, moments later, at approximately 11:38:52 a.m., Watkins walked past appellant and suddenly slugged him. Until that time, however, there is no indication that anyone had engaged in any disorderly or unruly conduct while in the courtroom.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As a result of Watkins\u2019s attack, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>fracas of sorts ensued, which is described in one sentence in the transcript. It says: \u201c(An altercation erupted in the courtroom between the witness and the defendant.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The videotape reflects that many of the responses of those in the courtroom occurred simultaneously. A sheriffs deputy and another man, presumably a bailiff, immediately responded by grabbing Watkins and pulling him away from appellant. They quickly took Watkins to the side of the courtroom, next to the rail. As they did so, the prosecutor managed to scoot out of the way. Unfortunately, Watkins seemed to land on top of another member of the court\u2019s staff. When appellant was struck, he stood up and seemed to turn in the direction of the public seating area, towards his family. As he did so, his attorney put his arms on appellant, as if to restrain him or calm him. In the meantime, another sheriff, who had been in the public seating area of the courtroom, quickly came past the rail and seemed to tackle appellant, although Watkins had already been separated from Walker and removed to the side. As the sheriff grabbed appellant, his family got up from their seats, gesturing, with one of them screaming repeatedly, \u201cOh my God.\u201d Additionally, one of the women approached the nearby rail, while another paced up and down the courtroom. None of the spectators ever entered the well of the court, however. As the family was yelling, the court repeatedly said, \u201cget out.\u201d But the judge never expressly indicated that she was speaking to the family. By 11:39:22 a.m., the family vacated the courtroom. Thereafter, noise continued to emanate from the hallway.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">We cannot ascertain from the record who approached the rail or repeatedly screamed \u201cOh my God.\u201d Because no testimony was ever taken to establish which family member did what, or why they behaved as they did, there is no evidence as to precisely when the family first heard the judge\u2019s directive to leave the courtroom or when they first understood that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>instruction was directed to them. Instead, we know only that the judge believed, based on \u201ceye contact\u201d with the family during the frenzy, that the family members knew that they had been ordered to leave but did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In any event, as a result of the incident, the court barred appellant\u2019s family from the courtroom for the duration of all court proceedings. For his part, Watkins was charged with two counts of criminal contempt; one count related to striking appellant and the other related to fighting with court personnel. Moreover, the court ordered Watkins\u2019s immediate incarceration, and he remained jailed during the trial. Following appellant\u2019s trial, the court sentenced Watkins to two consecutive terms of 179 days for each contempt offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Immediately after the fracas, the court took a recess. When court resumed about two hours later, appellant\u2019s counsel moved to continue both the suppression hearing and the trial. The following colloquy in the transcript is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: My client\u2019s mother, and girlfriend and sister were here earlier and they were requested to leave the courtroom. I don\u2019t know what happened behind me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">THE COURT: They were coming over the rail to get involved in the fracas that occurred, that\u2019s why they were asked to leave the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I believe the jury was in the next room when the incident occurred and I would suspect that they heard some commotion. And I suspect that it could have tainted this jury panel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">They might be assuming that somehow my client was involved in the fight or if they were advised that the alleged victim struck my client that might effect [sic] their view of this case as well, possibly to the detriment of my client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">I think that emotionally \u2014 whether the State choose [sic] to see it this way or not, [appellant] is a victim in reference to what happened here today and I think it would be unfair to even have to complete this trial \u2014 nor do any motions at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>this point with the person that just struck him merely two hours ago----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\">THE COURT: All right. For the record, at approximately 11:38 this morning, after a jury had been selected and sequestered, the first witness was called on a Motion to Suppress an eyewitness identification. The witness came into the courtroom, walked past the defendant. When he became immediately beside the defendant he commenced to pummel the defendant with his fist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">The deputies interceded and got him away from the defendant, who also stood up and decided to get into the affray, and was also subdued and put down. In that accounting, my deputy was injured and had to be taken to the hospital. One of the deputies was also injured. The defendant does not appear to me to have any injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">I\u2019m going to go ahead and do the Motion and I\u2019m going to inquire of the jurors if they heard anything. And that\u2019s how were going to handle it. I\u2019m not going to continue anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, there is a case <em>Ronald G. Watters v. State of Maryland </em>that I believe does make sure [sic] to a public trial, which would include the right of family members to be present during a trial. I know that the Court has indicated that I didn\u2019t see what was happening behind me, frankly, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">THE COURT: I did. I saw everything that happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: \u2014 that people came up. I don\u2019t know if all three, my client\u2019s mother, and the girlfriend and the younger sister all got up. I think it\u2019s a natural reaction that if their love one is being pummeled, that they would get up and see what\u2019s happening, possibly even defend him. But I think given that the assailant of this morning, will not be in the courtroom of everyone else, that they should certainly be allowed during the testimony. And I think that\u2019s the defendant\u2019s right under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>THE COURT: For this record, [appellant\u2019s family] left their seats. They approached this rail. They were all yelling. I told them to leave the courtroom and they made eye contact with me and refused to do that, while the deputies were trying to put this affray down and I\u2019m not going to let them in here. If people can\u2019t be rulely [sic] in the courtroom and I have to do something like that, this Court is not required to put them in here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">I\u2019m not going to invite another incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The court then proceeded with the motion hearing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> After the suppression hearing, and before proceeding with the trial, the judge questioned each juror individually in regard to what he or she may have heard concerning the altercation. Jurors 1, 4, 5, 19, and 37 reported that they heard nothing while they were sequestered. Those jurors who heard noise generally indicated that they would be able to serve impartially and fairly. Juror 8 \u201cheard yelling and shouting and banging coming from this courtroom.\u201d Juror 9 heard noise that was described as \u201cextraordinary [sic] loud,\u201d but the juror was unable to \u201cdistinguish\u201d the words and reached no conclusions. Juror 15 heard \u201csome noise, some loud noise,\u201d which the juror \u201ccouldn\u2019t really make ... out.\u201d Juror 17 heard \u201csome female voices screaming\u201d and \u201csounds similar to a ... chair falling.\u201d Juror 22 heard a \u201crumpus\u201d that \u201csounded like bodies and furniture falling, and somebody yelling.\u201d Further, the juror \u201cspeculated] that somebody involved with the trial was upset about something.\u201d The juror added: \u201cFamily members, whatever.\u201d Nonetheless, the juror acknowledged that he/she had no idea what had happened. Juror 30 heard \u201csome commotion,\u201d but did not reach any conclusions. Similarly, Juror 38 heard \u201ca commotion,\u201d which the juror described as \u201cthumping and a lady yelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Juror 14 reported hearing a \u201ccommotion\u201d that sounded like \u201ca lady screaming or some type of outburst.\u201d The juror added: \u201c[W]e were trying to decide if we wanted to go out the other door or not.\u201d Juror 14 also acknowledged concern about the incident, stating: \u201cI would have to say it unnerved me a little bit.\u201d Neither side asked the court to strike Juror 14, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Thereafter, the defense attorney renewed his motion to continue the case, and again asked the court to allow appellant\u2019s family into the courtroom. Appellant\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">It is clear that several of the [jurors] heard a commotion---- There seems to be some consistency that they heard a female voice. My client\u2019s mother, my client\u2019s girl friend, my client\u2019s younger sister are not present in Court at this time. I think this could prejudice my client\u2019s case were we to proceed at this time with this jury. Maybe in some of their minds they can be fair and impartial still, but at some point it could have a greater significance when they don\u2019t see those people here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">My client should not be punished for being attacked by the complainant in this case, and some of them might infer from that noise that this is a particularly dangerous case, and it might effect [sic] their judgment when it comes down to reaching a verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">The other matter was my client does have a right to a public trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">I do believe I cited a case earlier. I do believe that my client is entitled to have family members present at critical stages____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">Again, the court denied the motion for continuance and refused to permit appellant\u2019s family in the courtroom. The following exchange in the transcript is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-12\">THE COURT: [I]t is obvious that [the jury] heard women yelling. That is what they were doing. They were very loud, and they were approaching the rail. They were going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>to get into it. I am not going to let them in here. I saw them do that. Your back was to them, mine wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: My concern is that it still could effect [sic] the jury even if the Court were to so find they shouldn\u2019t be here, I maintain they should be here. I understand what you\u2019re saying. The situation has changed. There is no reason for them to come up during this trial. They can sit in the back, for example, and view the trial itself and the safety of the courtroom could be preserved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">THE COURT: I put them out because they couldn\u2019t control themselves. I have no guarantee that if [Mr. Watkins] comes to testify they won\u2019t try something, and I am not\u2014 I am not going to let them in. Anyone else who wants to come in, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s an open courtroom. Those [sic] are not coming in. They couldn\u2019t conduct themselves in an appropriate way. I don\u2019t have to let them in the courtroom. I am not going to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Thereafter, the judge informed the jury that \u201c[t]his defendant did absolutely nothing to cause whatever it was you heal'd.\u201d .The judge also said: \u201cIt was not the defendant\u2019s fault. He did absolutely nothing.\u201d The jury was then sworn and the case proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The next day, after Watkins and Ms. Burton had completed their testimony, appellant\u2019s counsel renewed his request that the court permit appellant\u2019s family to return to the courtroom. Counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">I would make an inquiry of the Court that [the family] be permitted to see the rest of the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">My ... reasoning is that ... Earl Watkins and ... Sherre Burton have already testified, and these are people who would be interested in the case. They were here yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">[ W]ould the Court reconsider its decision not to permit the family to view the trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">The court again denied the request, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-11\">It wasn\u2019t the fact of what Mr. Watkins did. It was what they did ... that caused me to remove them from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>courtroom. They can\u2019t control themselves. That\u2019s my finding, and I\u2019m not going to have them in here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">We had enough of a problem yesterday. Two people got hurt in here, and I\u2019m not going to risk that again. Don\u2019t ask me again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">We agree with appellant that the videotape does not support all of the judges factual findings, set forth above, which were based solely on the judges own recollection as an eyewitness to the disturbance.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For example, it does not appear to us that either the family or appellant \u201cdecided to get into the affray.\u201d If anything, appellant was caught off guard and seemed quite subdued; there is no indication that he attempted to strike back at Watkins. Although appellant did rise from his chair, a law enforcement official immediately ran over to him and grabbed him, in the presence of appellants family. At about the same time, appellant\u2019s family, visibly upset, began to scream and move about the courtroom. Because the public seating area of the courtroom was quite small, it is not surprising that, in moving about, the women were in the vicinity of the rail. Yet not one of the women stepped past the rail separating the public seating area of the courtroom from the well of the court. Although one of the women approached the rail, she never took any affirmative action to embroil herself in the fracas.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Considering that the episode lasted less than a minute, we are not clear as to the basis for the judge\u2019s determination that the family \u201crefused\u201d to comply with her directive to leave the courtroom. To be sure, the family members never verbally indicated that they were unwilling to exit the courtroom. Although the trial judge repeatedly said \u201cget out\u201d during the disturbance, and she claimed to have made \u201ceye contact\u201d with the family, we perceive no factual basis to determine that the family members immediately heard the judge over their own screams, or that they immediately realized, in the midst of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>such chaos, that the judge was actually speaking to them. Moreover, as we said, the family vacated the courtroom in less than a minute.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Appellant complains that the trial court violated his constitutional right to a public trial when it excluded his family due to their conduct in response to Watkins\u2019s unprovoked attack upon appellant in the courtroom. Although the State conceded at oral argument that appellant\u2019s family did not act contemptuously, it maintains in its brief that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in closing the courtroom to \u201cthree people who had exhibited an inability to conform their behavior to the decorum of the courtroom.... \u201d The State also posits that the judge acted within the bounds of her discretion in imposing a partial closure order, because the order was \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to the exigencies presented. In this regard, the State points out that the court only barred three individuals from attending the trial, but did not close the courtroom to the entire public.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We disagree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">In our view, the courtroom fracas, when considered in light of all the circumstances and the fundamental importance of the right to a public trial, did not justify the broad closure order imposed by the court. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when, in violation of appellant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial, it excluded appellant\u2019s family from the entire trial. In reaching this determination, it is particularly salient that a more narrowly tailored order could have been crafted to meet the court\u2019s concerns. Yet the court did not appear to give any consideration to less restrictive options. It is also significant to us that the closure order was directed solely at appellant\u2019s family, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>who were personally important to appellant. Additionally, it is noteworthy that the State never sought a closure order to protect any of its interests. We explain further.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u201cThis nation\u2019s accepted practice of guaranteeing a public trial to an accused has its roots in our English common law heritage.\u201d <em>In re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. 257, 266, 68 S.Ct. 499, 92 L.Ed. 682 (1948). The right to a public trial evolved from the \u201cdistrust for secret trials,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 268, 68 S.Ct. 499, which \u201csymbolized a menace to liberty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269, 68 S.Ct. 499. The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution embodies the common law principle of the right to a public trial. It provides, in pertinent part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy, the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed....\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The Court of Appeals has acknowledged that \u201cThe Supreme Court has ardently protected a criminal defendants right to a public trial____\u201d <em>Watters v. State, </em>328 Md. 38, 44-45, 612 A.2d 1288 (1992)(citing <em>Waller v. Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984), and <em>Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., </em>464 U.S. 501, 104 S.Ct. 819, 78 L.Ed.2d 629 (1984)(footnote omitted)). This is because the constitutional right to a public trial \u201chas always been recognized as a safeguard against any attempt to employ our courts as instruments of persecution.\u201d <em>In re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. at 270, 68 S.Ct. 499. The right involved here furnishes the public with the opportunity to observe the judicial process, and thus ensures that the \u201cjudge and prosecutor carry out their duties responsibly, ... encourages witnesses to come forward and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>discourages perjury.\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 46, 104 S.Ct. 2210 (citations omitted); <em>see Watters, </em>328 Md. at 47, 612 A.2d 1288. As the Supreme Court has observed: \u201cThe knowledge that every criminal trial is subject to contemporaneous review in the forum of public opinion is an effective restraint on possible abuse of judicial power.\u201d <em>In re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. at 270, 68 S.Ct. 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">On the other hand, the accused\u2019s right to a public trial is not absolute. The Sixth Amendment does not require a court to forfeit its legitimate and substantial interest in maintaining security and order in the courtroom. To the contrary, prophylactic measures, including closure, may be warranted under some circumstances, in order to maintain order, to preserve the dignity of the court, and to meet the State\u2019s interests in safeguarding witnesses and protecting confidentiality. <em>See Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 45, 104 S.Ct. 2210; <em>Watters, </em>328 Md. at 44, 612 A.2d 1288; <em>Walker v. State, </em>121 Md.App. 364, 371, 709 A.2d 177, <em>cert. denied, </em>351 Md. 5, 715 A.2d 964 (1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 119 S.Ct. 803, 142 L.Ed.2d 664 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Although \u201cthe right to an open trial may give way in certain cases to other rights or interests,\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 45, 104 S.Ct. 2210, a trial court must exercise its discretionary power to close the courtroom \u201csparingly and only after [carefully] balancing the competing interests----\u201d <em>People v. Nieves, </em>90 N.Y.2d 426, 660 N.Y.S.2d 858, 683 N.E.2d 764, 766 (1997). The Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">The presumption of openness may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The interest is to be articulated along with findings specific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIP\"><em>Press-Enterprise Co., </em>464 U.S. at 510, 104 S.Ct. 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">Several factors have been identified by the Supreme Court with respect to evaluating the proper closure of a court proceeding. These are: (1) a party seeking closure \u201cmust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced\u201d; (2) \u201cthe closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest\u201d; (3) \u201cthe trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding\u201d; and (4) the trial court \u201cmust make findings adequate to support the closure.\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 48, 104 S.Ct. 2210.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In analyzing the legality of the court\u2019s closure order here, the recent case of <em>Walker v. State, supra, </em>121 Md.App. 364, 709 A.2d 177, is instructive. In that case, we considered the propriety of a limited closure of a criminal proceeding in a sexual child abuse case involving two minor victims. The prosecution asked the court to exclude members of the defendant\u2019s family from the courtroom during the testimony of the two juvenile victims, because they had expressed fear about testifying against their mother\u2019s former boyfriend in the presence of his family. <em>Id. </em>at 368-69, 709 A.2d 177. The defendant objected to the prosecution\u2019s request, arguing that his family did not pose a threat and it \u201cshould be an open proceedings [sic]----\u201d Additionally, the defense noted that the court could have made arrangements for the victims to testify via closed circuit television. <em>Id. </em>at 369, 709 A.2d 177. The trial court granted the prosecution\u2019s request without asking either witness about the alleged intimidation. <em>Id. </em>at 370, 709 A.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">On appeal, Walker argued that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a public trial. Writing for this Court, Judge Davis specifically acknowledged that the case did not \u201cinvolve removal of all of the spectators from the courtroom.\u201d Nevertheless, after reviewing the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial, we concluded that the lower court abused its discretion in ordering the limited closure. We explained that because court \u201cclear[ed] the courtroom of all of the defendant\u2019s <em>family </em>members without conducting an examination to ascertain the accuracy or validity of the State\u2019s proffer,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 373, 709 A.2d 177 (emphasis added), we could not determine whether the court\u2019s order was \u201cnarrowly tailored to the exigencies of the case----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374, 709 A.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>Watters, </em>328 Md. 38, 612 A.2d 1288, which involved a complete closure, but only for a limited time, also provides guidance to us. There, a deputy sheriff barred all spectators, including the accused\u2019s family, from the courtroom during <em>voir dire </em>in a murder trial. Only prospective jurors, witnesses, and courtroom personnel were allowed in the courtroom during that phase of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 42, 612 A.2d 1288. After the jury was selected, the defendant learned of the closure and moved for a mistrial. <em>Id. </em>at 42, 612 A.2d 1288. At a hearing on that motion, the sheriffs deputy testified that he closed the courtroom because he was concerned that it was too small for the number of people who were interested in the case. <em>Id. </em>The deputy admitted, however, that \u201c \u2018some seats\u2019 were available, but he could not estimate how many.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finding that the court was closed as a matter of security \u201c \u2018because of the crowded conditions of the courtroom,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 43, 612 A.2d 1288, and the closure did not infringe the accused\u2019s right to a public trial, the lower court denied the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The Court of Appeals concluded that there was no compelling need to exclude members of appellant\u2019s family, members of the press, and the public from <em>voir dire </em>because, by the deputy\u2019s own admission, seats were available. <em>Id. </em>at 45, 612 A.2d 1288. Moreover, even if there were a \u201clegitimate interest in preventing overcrowding,\u201d <em>id., </em>the Court indicated that the exclusion was too broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">That appellant\u2019s <em>family </em>was barred from the trial adds an important dimension here. The <em>Watters </em>Court specifically acknowledged in <em>dicta </em>the harm attendant to excluding a defendant\u2019s family from a court proceeding. In that circumstance, the Court recognized \u201cthe inability of the defendant\u2019s family to contribute their knowledge or insight to the jury selection and the inability of the venirepersons to see the interested individuals.\u201d <em>Watters, </em>328 Md. at 48, 612 A.2d 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Similarly, <em>Nieves, supra, </em>90 N.Y.2d 426, 660 N.Y.S.2d 858, 683 N.E.2d 764, is noteworthy. There, the New York Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Appeals recognized the particular importance of access to trial for a criminal defendant\u2019s family. It ordered a new trial after it determined that a limited closure, which barred the defendant\u2019s family from trial during the testimony of an undercover police officer, was broader than necessary to protect the interests of the state. Of particular significance here, Chief Judge Kaye, writing for a unanimous court, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">Where ... the trial court is aware that the defendant\u2019s relatives have been attending the proceedings or that the defendant would like to have certain family members present, exclusion of those individuals must be necessary to protect the interest advanced by the People in support of closure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-6\"><em>Id., </em>660 N.Y.S.2d 858, 683 N.E.2d at 766 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">In this case, as in <em>Nieves, </em>the judge clearly was aware, from her own observations, that appellant\u2019s family had attended the proceedings until the issuance of the closure order. Moreover, based on defense counsel\u2019s repeated requests, the court certainly realized that appellant wanted his family to attend his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">The case of <em>Vidal v. Williams, </em>31 F.3d 67 (2d Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1102, 115 S.Ct. 778, 130 L.Ed.2d 672 (1995), is also instructive with respect to a family\u2019s right to attend a criminal trial. In its review of a habeas corpus action, the Second Circuit ruled that the trial court erred in barring the defendant\u2019s parents from the trial during the testimony of an undercover police officer. In reaching that conclusion, the court recognized the \u201cspecial concern for assuring the attendance of family members of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69 (citation omitted). Moreover, in <em>In re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. at 272, 68 S.Ct. 499, the Supreme Court observed in dicta \u201cthat an accused is at the very least entitled to have his friends, relatives and counsel present, no matter with what offense he may be charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">In assessing a partial closure order, many federal courts have applied the \u201csubstantial reasons\u201d standard. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Osborne, </em>68 F.3d 94, 98-99 (5th Cir.1995); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>United States, v. Farmer, </em>32 F.3d 369, 371 (8th Cir.1994); <em>Woods v. Kuhlmann, </em>977 F.2d 74, 76 (2d Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Sherlock, </em>962 F.2d 1349, 1356-57 (9th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 958, 113 S.Ct. 419, 121 L.Ed.2d 342 (1992); <em>Nieto v. Sullivan, </em>879 F.2d 743, 753 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 957, 110 S.Ct. 373, 107 L.Ed.2d 359 (1989); <em>Douglas v. Wainwright, </em>739 F.2d 531, 533 (11th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1208, 105 S.Ct. 1170, 84 L.Ed.2d 321 (1985). These courts have generally reasoned that, in considering the legality of a partial closure, a \u201cless stringent standard [is] justified because a partial closure does not implicate the same secrecy and fairness concerns that a total closure does.\u201d <em>Woods, </em>977 F.2d at 76 (citations omitted); <em>see also People v. Chan, </em>230 A.D.2d 165, 656 N.Y.S.2d 22, 27-28 (1997), <em>aff'd, </em>91 N.Y.2d 913, 669 N.Y.S.2d 527, 692 N.E.2d 558 (N.Y.1998) (upholding limited closure of courtroom because of concerns about witness). Even under a less stringent standard, however, we cannot uphold the trial court\u2019s broad order.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">As the transcript reflects, the trial judge here repeatedly indicated that she evicted the family members because of their unruly conduct following Watkins\u2019s attack on appellant. She said, in part: <em>\u201c1 </em>put them out because they couldn\u2019t control themselves. I have no guarantee that if [Watkins] comes to testify that they wont try something, and I am not \u2014 no, I am not going to let them in,\u201d In considering the closure order, we must consider the factors identified earlier in light of what occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">As we noted, the State never requested the closure to advance its particular interests. Instead, the judge acted <em>sua sponte </em>in barring appellant\u2019s family. To be sure, the family did not act with composure, but the behavior was hardly beyond normalcy, given the circumstances. Indeed, there was no script for what occurred; the family simply responded like human beings, not automatons, when their loved one was attacked. Although the family was not responsible for the underlying assault, the judge seemed to fault them for the way in which they reflexively and instinctively responded to a frightening situation that was unforeseen and not of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>doing. To the extent the family behaved inappropriately, the videotape indisputably established that the entire incident lasted less than a minute, so that the family\u2019s improper conduct was hardly prolonged. In addition, the court treated all three family members as if they were one and the same with regard to the outburst. The court articulated several specific findings criticizing the family collectively, including, <em>inter alia: \u201c[T]hey </em>left their seats. <em>They </em>approached this rail. <em>They </em>were all yelling. I told <em>them </em>to leave ... <em>they </em>made eye contact with me and refused to do that____\u201d (Emphasis added). The court further found that all three women \u201cwere going to get into [the fight].\u201d We also observe that there was no indication that the family had been disorderly in the courtroom prior to the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">We acknowledge that the incident was disturbing, if not frightening, and the trial judge, to her credit, was remarkably composed. Nonetheless, the breadth of the closure order exceeded what was needed to maintain order and dignity. Indeed, the court\u2019s closure order was far broader than the closures at issue in <em>Watters </em>and <em>Walker, </em>which required reversals in each case. <em>Watters </em>was reversed, even though it concerned a total closure only during <em>voir dire. See Watters, </em>328 Md. at 48, 612 A.2d 1288 (observing that the Supreme Court \u201chas not retreated from the view that the deprivation of the constitutional right to a public trial cannot be harmless error\u201d). <em>Walker </em>required a reversal, even though the members of the defendant\u2019s family were excluded only during the testimony of two witnesses. In contrast, this case involved a closure for the entire trial as to three people who surely were among the ones most interested in attending.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">In our view, the closure order was tantamount to a punishment that contravened the Sixth Amendment. Our view is founded on the following considerations: the incident was precipitated by a third party (i.e., not appellant or his family); the family\u2019s conduct was induced by an unexpected and frightening assault on the son/brother/boyfriend; the family\u2019s breach of courtroom etiquette spanned about 30 seconds; there was not a shred of evidence that the family had previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ously been unruly in the courtroom; the defendant indisputably wanted his family to attend the trial; and the State did not identify even a single interest that it sought to protect by closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Further, notwithstanding the defense attorney\u2019s persistent and well-stated requests to allow the family to attend the trial, there is no indication that the court gave any thought to less restrictive options. Several less restrictive options, narrowly tailored to meet the exigencies perceived, were available to meet the court\u2019s concerns for security and order. For example, because Watkins was immediately handcuffed and jailed, any concern for security involving him had been largely abated. Thus, the court could have permitted the family to remain in the courtroom, except when Watkins was called to testify. <em>See, e.g., Woods v. Kuhlmann, </em>977 F.2d 74, 76 (2d Cir.1992) (upholding trial court\u2019s order to exclude defendant\u2019s family while the witnesses testified because members of the defendant\u2019s family had allegedly threatened the witness); <em>United States v. Sherlock, </em>962 F.2d 1349, 1357-58 (9th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 958, 113 S.Ct. 419, 121 L.Ed.2d 342 (1992)(up-holding temporary exclusion of the defendant\u2019s family members during the rape victim\u2019s testimony, because the judge observed said persons making faces and mocking the witness). Alternatively, on the basis of the conduct of the one woman who actually came closest to the rail, there was no reason to exclude all three women for the entire trial. Instead, the court could have limited the closure order to the woman who had approached the rail. <em>See e.g. United States v. Osborne, </em>68 F.3d 94, 99 (5th Cir.1995)(upholding the trial court\u2019s order excluding only the accused\u2019s sister while the twelve year old victim testified, to protect the minor from emotional harm). The court also could have chosen to reprimand the women and to warn them that, regardless of what happens in the courtroom, no further outbursts would be tolerated. The court might also have considered allowing the women to rotate in the courtroom, one at a time. It also could have required the family to sit apart from each other, on different benches.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>We conclude that, in barring the family from the trial, the court abused its discretion. Because the court\u2019s closure order violated appellant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial, we shall vacate appellant\u2019s convictions and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">JUDGMENT VACATED.
