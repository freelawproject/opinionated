The comparative review process applies to \u201ctwo or more applications for similar projects serving the same or overlapping service areas.\u201d <em>Maryland Gen. Hosp., </em>103 Md.App. at 529, 653 A.2d 1029. It is intended to determine \u201cnot simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>whether a particular applicant satisfied the basic criteria for a CON, but which of the applicants best satisfied the criteria.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">H.G. \u00a7 19-118 is titled \u201cAction on applications.\u201d Under the version of the Act in effect at the outset of this matter, Md.Code (1990 Repl.Vol.), H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 19-101 et seq., the Commission was authorized to delegate to a committee \u201cthe responsibility for review of [a CON] application, including the holding of an evidentiary hearing.\u201d H.G. \u00a7 19-118(d)(2). The Committee would then make a recommendation to the full Commission. H.G. \u00a7 19-118(d)(3). Thereafter, under H.G. \u00a7 19 \u2014 118(d)(4), the Commission was required to \u201cvote to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the [CON] application on the basis of the committee\u2019s recommendation and the whole record before the committee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Effective June 1, 1995, H.G. \u00a7 19-118(d) was substantially revised. H.G. \u00a7 19-118(d)(3) now permits the Commission to delegate to a \u201creviewer\u201d the responsibility to evaluate a CON application. The reviewer may hold evidentiary hearings and prepare a \u201crecommended decision for consideration by the full Commission.\u201d H.G. \u00a7 19-118(d)(3)(ii); <em>see </em>H.G. \u00a7 19-118(d)(8). Further, the Commission is authorized to designate a \u201csingle Commissioner to act as a reviewer\u201d for competing CON applications. H.G. \u00a7 19-118(d)(4). In addition, under H.G. \u00a7 19 \u2014 118(d)(7)(i), the staff of the Commission is specifically deemed an interested party. Pursuant to H.G. \u00a7 19-118(d)(ll), the Commission is required to \u201cvote to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the [CON] application on the basis of the recommended decision, the record before the staff or the reviewer, and exceptions and arguments, if any, before the Commission.\u201d <em>See Adventist, </em>350 Md. at 107, 711 A.2d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In considering CON applications, the Commission is obligated to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>eight criteria set forth in COMAR 10.24.01.07H(2)(a)-(h). The criteria include, in summary, the following: (a) compatibility with the SHP, including the Long Term Care Services provisions of COMAR 10.24.08.05F and 10.24.08.06A (1992); (b) the \u201cneed of the population\u201d served or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>to be served; (c) the \u201cless costly or more effective alternatives\u201d; (d) the \u201cfinancial viability of the proposal\u201d; (e) the extent of a \u201cpositive impact on the health care system of the area\u201d; (f) the \u201cavailability of non-financial resources\u201d; (g) research needs; and (h) \u201cCompliance with relevant State and federal legal requirements.\u201d COMAR \u00a7 10.24.01.07H(1) places the burden of proof on the applicant to establish satisfaction of the review criteria. \u201c[W]hen all of the applicants otherwise would qualify for the CON because they meet all of the other standards and policies,\u201d <em>Maryland Gen.

Factual and Procedural Summary<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">In April 1991, CHCJ, Marriott, and InterCare filed competing CON applications, which were docketed in June 1991, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>seeking the Commission\u2019s approval to develop up to 84 new nursing home beds authorized by the SHP for the County in 1994. Specifically, appellant sought to develop a new facility in Potomac that would include 84 CCP beds, 56 assisted living apartments, and 6 domiciliary care beds, at a projected cost of $9,069,396.00.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Marriott filed two CON applications. In the first, it sought approval to add 16 CCF beds to an existing 43-bed comprehensive care unit, which was part of a continuing care retirement community called Bedford Court. Located in Silver Spring, Bedford Court also had 76 domiciliary care beds and 215 independent living units. Marriott planned to increase the size of the comprehensive care unit by converting 16 rooms from single to double occupancy, at a projected cost of $108,680. In the other CON application, Marriott sought approval to develop a new facility in North Bethesda called Brighton Gardens, which would include 41 comprehensive care beds and 101 domiciliary care beds, at a projected cost of $13,515,344.00. InterCare sought approval to develop James Creek Nursing Center in Olney, which would include 84 CCF beds and 15 domiciliary care beds, at an estimated cost of $7,603,328.00. Because the combined number of proposed CCF beds requested by the three applicants exceeded the SHP\u2019s projected need of 84 CCF beds for the County in 1994, the Commission undertook a comparative review of the competing applications. <em>See </em>COMAR 10.24.01.07B(2); the Long Term Care Services Chapter of the SHP, COMAR 10.24.08.05E and .06A; and the review criteria in COMAR 10.24.01.07H(2)(a)-(h). At one time or another in this protracted process, each applicant was recommended for approval by at least one of the reviewing authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">On June 26, 1991, pursuant to H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 19-111 through 19-113 and COMAR 10.24.01.071, the applications were submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>for review and comment to the Montgomery County Health Department (the \u201cDepartment\u201d), the local health planning agency. Concluding that the \u201cCarriage Hill \u2014 Cabin John proposal offers a project that is \u2018ready to go\u2019 and will help to meet [the] outstanding need for [nursing home] beds,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Department issued a written recommendation to the Commission in August 1991, supporting Carriage Hill\u2019s application. The Department took into account the success of two other Carriage Hill facilities in the County, the location of the proposed project, and that CHCJ owned the land and had already obtained zoning approval for the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">On January 21,1992, in its first written report, the Commission Staff recommended disapproval of all the projects, based on COMAR 10.24.08.05F(2), which required every nursing home in the County to have at least a 95% occupancy level before approval of additional comprehensive care beds.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thereafter, the parties agreed to limit the first phase of evidentiary hearings, held in April 1992, to the threshold issue of the occupancy rate. On December 16, 1992, Commissioner Mary Etta Mills, acting as the hearing officer, agreed with the Staff and recommended denial of all four applications, based on the occupancy requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The Commission rejected that recommendation in February 1993. It decided, instead, to waive the 95% occupancy requirement, pursuant to COMAR 10.24.08.05F(2)(b). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Commission was concerned that many area facilities had low occupancy levels because they did not participate in Medicaid. Because those facilities served only a limited portion of the market for long term care services, it concluded that the occupancy rate was not coextensive with the County\u2019s need for CCF beds. Accordingly, the comparative review process proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The Staff issued a second report in April 1993, again recommending against approval of any of the proposals. As to Carriage Hill, the Staff determined that it had not documented a memorandum of understanding reflecting its commitment to serve the Medicaid population. With respect to InterCare, the Staff found that its project was inconsistent with the \u201cless costly or more effective alternative\u201d criterion, and InterCare failed to explain the reasons for its higher costs. Regarding Marriott\u2019s applications, the Staff indicated that it had not explained how the design features of its facilities satisfied the needs of its patients, nor did it provide documentation showing professional and community support for its proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Thereafter, in late 1993, Commissioner Gregory Hunter held an evidentiary hearing that consumed eight days. Subsequently, in a third report issued by the Staff on March 4,1994, the Staff endorsed Marriott\u2019s projects. The Staff was satisfied that Marriott\u2019s design features would meet the needs of its patient population, and that it demonstrated community and professional support for its projects. Moreover, the Staff found that Marriott\u2019s proposed projects best satisfied the review criteria concerning the \u201cless costly or more effective alternatives.\u201d The Staff also recommended against approval of the projects of CHCJ and InterCare. Although the Staff concluded that appellant showed a commitment to serving the needs of Medicaid patients, the Staff found that Carriage Hill\u2019s proposal was inconsistent with the less costly or more effective alternative criterion. It also suggested that appellant could endeavor to relocate unused CCF beds from its existing facilities to avoid adding new beds. Concluding that, in certain respects, Intercare\u2019s project was not financially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>viable and its design was not consistent with the review criteria, the Staff recommended against InterCare.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Evidentiary hearings resumed in March 1994 with regard to the Staffs,March 1994 report. At the hearing, the parties questioned Barbara Johnson, the Assistant Director of the CON program and principal author of the Staff report, regarding the Staffs recommendation of Marriott. Ms. Johnson explained: \u201c[I]n this case this is a comparative review, not all applicants can be approved, so you have to choose.\u201d With this in mind, Ms. Johnson observed that appellant might encounter zoning problems, while the Marriott projects did not face any concerns regarding zoning. She also observed that the Marriott projects did \u201cnot have any community opposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In March 1994, InterCare filed a motion entitled \u201cMotion of Montgomery InterCare Associates to Dedocket Applications of Marriott Retirement Communities for Transfer of Projects.\u201d It claimed that the applicant for the two Marriott projects was not the same entity that would actually operate them, in violation of COMAR 10.24.01.06D(1). In addition, InterCare alleged that Marriott\u2019s sale of Bedford Court to an unrelated third party constituted an improper sale of the CON.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Subsequently, in June 1994, pursuant to a motion filed by Marriott, Commissioner Hunter recused himself, for reasons unrelated to this appeal. Consequently, Commissioner Joan Harris was appointed as the hearing officer. In connection with her responsibilities, she made several site visits to the proposed project locations and to the applicants\u2019 existing facilities in the County.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">On November 2,1994, Marriott filed a \u201cMotion to Dedocket and Cancel the Certificate of Need Applications of Carriage Hill-Cabin John, Inc.,\u201d claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that CHCJ made material misrepresentations to the Commission and that its zoning status was uncertain due to its modifications to the proposed project. In December 1994, Commissioner Harris <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>conducted an evidentiary hearing focusing largely on the rival motions to dedocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">In April 1995, following a total of twelve days of hearings that began in 1993 and involved three hearing officers, Commissioner Harris issued her recommendation. She urged approval of the InterCare project, as modified, and denial of the proposals submitted by Marriott and Carriage Hill. After comparing the applications in terms of the review standards, rules, and criteria, she concluded that each applicant satisfied COMAR 10.24.07H(2)(a)-(h) and the Long Term Care provisions of the SHP.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Commissioner Harris considered as the dispositive issue the need to provide more comprehensive care beds to the Medicaid population and other underserved groups. The Commissioner acknowledged: \u201cIn determining which of the applicants would best serve the low income, underserved population one must wrestle with minuscule differences.\u201d Although each applicant had signed a Memorandum of Understanding committing itself to serve Medicaid patients, Commissioner Harris found that InterCare had the \u201clongest and best track record in accessibility to low-income persons.\u201d Because Marriott was seeking the fewest beds, she reasoned that it would serve fewer Medicaid patients than the other two applicants. As to Carriage Hill, the Commissioner was concerned because its existing facilities did not participate in the Medicaid Assistance Program. Moreover, she believed those facilities contributed to the problem with the occupancy level that nearly prevented any project from receiving a CON. Commissioner Harris reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">To award an applicant a CON to fill a perceived need, when that need was in part brought about by the facilities in the jurisdiction that did not participate in the Medicaid Program, of which this applicant operated two such facilities, would defy all logic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Commissioner Harris also urged the denial of InterCare\u2019s motion to dedocket Marriott\u2019s applications and Marriott\u2019s motion to dedocket the application of CHCJ. Nevertheless, as to the motions to dedocket filed by both Marriott and InterCare, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>she noted that \u201csome of the information contained in the motions [did] ... cause one to doubt the forthrightness of both Marriott and Carriage Hill.\u201d Commissioner Harris stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">Specifically, as regards the Marriott reorganization, the split of the corporation into two separate corporations, and selling most of the nursing unit facilities to an unrelated entity leaves considerable doubt as to the future involvement of the Marriott organization in the nursing care field despite the 40-year lease agreement. The disclosure of this reorganization came only at the eleventh hour of the review, and quite by accident, when an article appeared in the <em>Washington Post. </em>Because of the article and the concerns it raised, Marriott agreed to make available the Sale Agreement to all the parties in this review. Perusal of the agreement showed no areas that were questionable from a legal perspective, but it raised considerable concern about Marriott\u2019s commitment in the area of nursing care facilities. Further, the agreement included a statement regarding the Bedford Court facility that would result in a $1,000,000 increase to be paid to Marriott if the CON is granted within two years of the closing of the sale agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">In addition, as regards CHCJ, the fact that this applicant is providing contradictory statements to two separate governmental agencies regarding the actual building that is to be constructed on its site causes considerable loss of credibility regarding the other statements that it has made during this review. The Hearing Officer is greatly concerned about the statements made by Ms. Luckett regarding the Commission\u2019s practice of routinely allowing an applicant to change its design after the award of a CON. The Commission may have allowed design changes to a previously approved project, but that is done only when it is absolutely necessary and due to no fault of the applicant. Clearly, such is not the case in the CHCJ project as it is currently constituted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Appellant and Marriott subsequently filed exceptions challenging Commissioner Harris\u2019s proposed decision, arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>that she ignored evidence in the record indicating that the InterCare proposal was inconsistent with various SHP standards and review criteria, including InterCare\u2019s financial feasibility. In its exceptions, CHCJ did not assail Commissioner Harris\u2019s conclusion that Marriott Corporation\u2019s reorganization or financial transactions did not preclude the award of the CONs to Marriott. Marriott excepted to the proposed denial of its motion to dedocket appellant\u2019s CON application. Similarly, InterCare excepted to Commissioner Harris\u2019s proposed denial of its motion to dedocket Marriott\u2019s applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">In response to the proposed decision, the Staff filed a document entitled \u201cStaffs Reply to the Exceptions of the Applicants.\u201d It agreed with Commissioner Harris\u2019s \u201ccentral reasoning in choosing an applicant other than [appellant] for the limited number of beds available in this review.\u201d Observing that the primary reason the Commission waived the 95% occupancy rule was to increase access for Medicaid patients, the Staff noted that Medicaid patients were not accepted at other Carriage Hill facilities. The Staff thus suggested that \u201cit would be illogical, in the absence of strong reasons, to approve a third Montgomery County facility for Carriage Hill over another qualified applicant to try to solve the Medicaid access problem in Montgomery County.\u201d The Staff also \u201cfocus[ed] on those areas where Staff disagreed with the proposed decision.\u201d Because Marriott demonstrated that its proposals were financially viable and because the \u201cStaff ... [did] not believe that InterCare\u2019s psyehogeriatric program should be preferred over Marriott\u2019s,\u201d the Staff supported Marriott.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">On June 11, 1995, the Commission held an exceptions hearing at which arguments were presented by Commissioner Harris, the Staff, and attorneys for appellant, Marriott, and InterCare. After consideration of the March 1994 Staff Report, Commissioner Harris\u2019s proposed decision in favor of InterCare, and the parties\u2019 arguments, the Commission voted on two motions. The first motion, to adopt Commissioner Harris\u2019s proposed decision, failed by a vote of three to six. The second motion, to adopt the Staff Report recommending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Marriott\u2019s applications, carried by a vote of six to three. For both votes, two commissioners recused themselves and one abstained.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Thereafter, on November 13,1995, the Commission issued a lengthy, written Final Decision approving Marriott\u2019s two projects. Although the Commission\u2019s Final Decision acknowledged the filing of Marriott\u2019s motion to dedocket CJCH\u2019s application, the decision did not resolve the exception concerning the proposed denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Appellant and InterCare subsequently sought review of the Commission\u2019s decision in the circuit court. In January 1996, shortly after those challenges were lodged, Marriott sought a limited remand to the Commission for determination of its unresolved motion to dedocket Carriage Hill\u2019s application. Marriott asserted that a limited remand was necessary, because the circuit court could not otherwise consider Marriott\u2019s argument attacking Carriage Hill\u2019s challenge to the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">On April 3, 1996, pursuant to an agreement of the parties, the circuit court entered an order for a stipulated limited remand, in order to obtain a ruling from the Commission with regard to Marriott\u2019s motion to dedocket Carriage Hill\u2019s application. The stipulation stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">The parties agree that in the event that the [Commission] ... issues a Revised ... Decision that addresses the Marriott Motion, such a Revised ... Decision shall be deemed to be the [Commission\u2019s] ... Final Decision for purposes of this Appeal____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Thereafter, on April 8, 1997, the Commission issued its Revised Decision, consisting of some 94, single-spaced pages of text. Apart from several paragraphs updating the procedural history of the matter and addressing Marriott\u2019s motion to dedocket the Carriage Hill application, the Revised Decision was identical to the Final Decision issued in November 1995. Like the Final Decision, the Revised Decision reviewed the procedural history and the various recommendations, and it included detailed findings of fact pertaining to the review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>criteria, along with conclusions of law. It also included the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\">It is, this 13th day of November, 1995, ORDERED by the Maryland Health Resources Planning Commission that[:]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC7\">The Application of Bedford Court is hereby APPROVED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3m\">The Application of Brighton Gardens is hereby APPROVED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">The Application of Carriage Hill Cabin John is hereby DENIED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">The Application of James Creek is hereby DENIED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">A majority of Commissioners voting and present plus at least two consumer members concurring in the result</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGc\">In the lengthy \u201cFindings of Fact\u201d section of the Revised Decision, the Commission expressly considered each application in light of the plethora of rules, criteria, and standards governing competing CON applications.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Commission determined that none of the applicants was entitled to prefer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>ence under any SHP standard. Moreover, it concluded that the applicants generally faired equally well with regard to the various standards, rules, and review criteria.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> With regard to the \u201cmore effective alternatives\u201d analysis under COMAR 10.24.01.07H(2)(c), the Commission analyzed seven factors that are not specifically identified in COMAR or the Act, and gave \u201ca preference\u201d to Marriott\u2019s proposals. In its view, Marriott \u201coffer[ed] the more effective projects in this review.\u201d Further, in analyzing \u201cimpact\u201d under COMAR 10.24.01.07H(2)(e), the Commission considered three other factors not specifically identified in COMAR or the Act and concluded that Marriott\u2019s projects \u201cwill have the more positive effect on the health care system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The determinations favoring Marriott over CHCJ with respect to the \u201cmore effective alternatives\u201d and \u201cimpact\u201d criteria <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>rested on several findings made by the Commission, as follows: (1) the zoning status of appellant\u2019s project was uncertain, because it had obtained a zoning exception in 1986 for a project that differed materially from the one presented to the Commission; (2) appellant\u2019s project was facing some community opposition; (3) even if the community opposition to CHCJ\u2019s application lacked merit, such opposition would inevitably delay implementation of the CHCJ project; (4) Marriott\u2019s projects had a more efficient facility design, because each had the physical therapy room located on the same floor as the nursing unit; (5) and appellant ineffectively used scarce resources, because it voluntarily kept out of service 46 CCF beds in two other facilities in the County at the same time that it sought additional CCF beds in this review.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Although the Commission acknowledged that Marriott raised serious concerns about appellant\u2019s ability to secure the necessary zoning approval, it rejected Marriott\u2019s motion to dedocket appellant\u2019s application. Additionally, in a lengthy footnote, the Commission rejected the contention that Marriott was not entitled to the CONs based on violations of COMAR resulting from Marriott Corporation\u2019s reorganization and financial transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">After the Commission issued its Revised Decision, the circuit court heard oral argument regarding the challenges to that decision.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On November 26, 1997, the circuit court filed its five and a half page \u201cMemorandum and Opinion,\u201d affirming the Commission. Noting that it did \u201cnot go into great detail as to the factual background\u201d because that was \u201cnot in dispute,\u201d the court concluded that the Commission adhered to the governing statute and regulations, Marriott was the real party in interest, and substantial evidence supported the Commission\u2019s conclusions. The court said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">While it was acknowledged that not every issue was documented and established by specific reference to testimony, the [Revised Decision] as a whole touched on all sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>issues which would have a bearing on the ultimate decision reached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">Therefore, the Court feels that the procedures of the Commission were in fact followed and that their decision was reached after a through [sic] and careful view of the evidence and facts presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">The question that the Court must decide is whether or not the testimony presented including Staff recommendations, was sufficient to establish the findings of fact by the Commission. Then the Court must decide if the final recommendation was legally correct based on the entire procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">The Court has carefully reviewed the Memoranda of the parties, considered the arguments of counsel and the applicable law in this area and feels that the Commission did in fact reach findings of fact which were substantiated by the evidence presented and ultimately correctly applied the law to the issues presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">We will include additional facts in our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">III. A Summary of Appellant\u2019s Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">The prolonged and rather tortured history of this case involves, as appellant notes, \u201cmore than eight years of various administrative and judicial procedures____\u201d In its legal memorandum submitted to the circuit court, appellant characterized the case as a \u201cprocedural nightmare.\u201d Nevertheless, on appeal, appellant \u201cdoes not argue that it has not been afforded due process....\u201d Nor does appellant \u201cdispute any of the Commission\u2019s finding of fact as such____\u201d Indeed, appellant acknowledges \u201cthat all of the applicants proposed excellent facilities\u201d and \u201cthere is adequate evidence in the huge administrative record from which the Commission could have approved any of the applications before it.\u201d It thus concedes that \u201cthe \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 test for challenging agency fact finding is not implicated in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Both here and below, appellant claims it has focused on \u201cpurely legal questions \u2014 matters of procedure and the interpretation and application of various Commission regulations.\u201d Appellant contests \u201cthe process by which the Commission evaluated [the] evidence.\u201d It complains that, in its Revised Decision, the Commission made <em>\u201cno </em>findings, and offered <em>no </em>reasons\u201d for its decision to approve Marriott\u2019s applications and reject Carriage Hill\u2019s application. Rather, after \u201cyears of administrative proceedings,\u201d appellant contends that the agency\u2019s final decision contains \u201cnew findings of fact,\u201d not set forth anywhere in the record, and \u201cleaves unclear why and how it chose to approve the Marriott applications.\u201d Indeed, in its legal memorandum submitted below, CHCJ characterized the agency\u2019s decision as \u201ca work of fiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">In the \u201cSummary of Argument\u201d section of its appellate brief, CHCJ argues that the Commission \u201cviolated its own regulations and the Administrative Procedures [sic] Act by taking a vote that rejected, without discussion or explanation, the findings of fact of its own Hearing Officer, and then by issuing a ... Revised Decision ... that contained diametrically opposite findings that the Commission itself never adopted.\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, the agency\u2019s failure to provide a clear rationale for rejecting the recommendations of its own hearing officer and the Department constitutes \u201cprocedural sloppiness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Appellant also challenges the validity of the Commission\u2019s Revised Decision, issued months after the Commission\u2019s vote, claiming it is the work product of the Commission\u2019s Staff, which \u201cprovided the <em>entire </em>rationale for the Commission\u2019s final action <em>and </em>the Commission never even purported to adopt that rationale.\u201d Further, CHCJ posits that the decision is defective because the Commission never took the \u201csimple step\u201d of voting to adopt the Staffs draft of the Revised Decision. Appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">The flaw in the Commission\u2019s procedure is highlighted by the fact that Staffs draft of the \u201cFinal Decision\u201d not only memorialized the Commission\u2019s vote, but also purported to rehabilitate Staffs recommendation nearly two years earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>in favor of Marriott against the Hearing Officer\u2019s contrary findings and conclusions. Staff, in effect, drafted as the Commission\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d what amounted to a rebuttal of the cross-examination its witness had suffered, and a defense of not only the result it had recommended, but also its own rationale that the Hearing Officer had rejected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Further, appellant asserts that the Revised Decision \u201cpurported to deny the CHCJ application \u2014 and to approve the Marriott applications \u2014 on the basis of plainly erroneous interpretation and application of the Commission\u2019s regulations.\u201d Appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">[ T]he Commission\u2019s denial of CHCJ\u2019s application was based only upon an interpretation and application of the \u201cmost effective alternative\u201d review criterion that was beyond the Commission\u2019s authority ...; the Commission failed to follow its regulations which require appropriate consideration of the recommendation of the designated local health planning agency which had recommended approval of the CHCJ application ...; the Commission purported to make findings regarding the status of CHCJ\u2019s zoning that were beyond the evidence or the Commission\u2019s expertise and authority ...; and the Commission improperly interpreted and applied its regulations to allow Marriott to sell a CON in connection with the refinancing of one of the applicant facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Finally, appellant\u2019s brief is replete with criticisms concerning the circuit court\u2019s allegedly deficient review of the Commission\u2019s decision. CHCJ repeatedly complains that the \u201cCircuit Court simply failed to address [CHCJ\u2019s] legal and procedural critiques of the Commission\u2019s ultimate decision-making [sic] process.\u201d In the end, according to appellant, the lower court improperly \u201cblessed\u201d a \u201csloppy decision by the Commission.\u201d Because the circuit court failed to address and resolve all of the issues that appellant raised, CHCJ urges that \u201cthe appropriate remedy is to remand the matter to the trial court to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>IV. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">The principles that govern judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision are well established. We reiterate them here because, in large measure, they undergird our resolution of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Appellant urges us to remand to the circuit court so it may consider the many issues that it failed to resolve. That request overlooks our role, which requires us to review the <em>agency\u2019s </em>decision. <em>Ahalt v. Montgomery County, </em>113 Md.App. 14, 20, 686 A.2d 683 (1996).

Engelman, </em>345 Md. 402, 692 A.2d 474 (1997), the Court of Appeals explained that judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">both narrow and expansive. It is narrow to the extent that reviewing courts, out of deference to agency expertise, are required to affirm an agency\u2019s findings of fact, as well as its application of law to those facts, if reasonably supported by the administrative record, viewed as a whole. The standard is equally broad to the extent that reviewing courts are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>under no constraint to affirm an agency decision premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 411, 692 A.2d 474 (internal citations omitted); see <em>Adventist, supra, </em>350 Md. at 120, 711 A.2d 158; <em>United Parcel Serv. v.

Discussion \u2014 The Revised Decision</p>\n<p id=\"Af7\">A. The Circuit Court\u2019s Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Appellant\u2019s first argument is captioned: \u201cThe Circuit Court Failed To Address And Resolve All of the Potentially Disposi-tive Issues [Appellant] Raised Below.\u201d CHCJ argues that the circuit court erred because it failed to address the many legal issues that appellant raised, including issues concerning flaws in the Revised Decision due to its \u201ceonclusory determinations\u201d and lack of \u201cspecific findings of fact----\u201d In particular, appellant complains that the circuit court did not resolve its contentions that the Commission erred by failing to provide adequate reasons in its opinion for its rejection of the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation, by failing to explain its rejection of the local Department\u2019s recommendation, and by failing to explain adequately the reasons for its approval of the Staffs position. Further, CHCJ claims that the circuit court never addressed the allegedly defective process by which the Commission arrived at its decision. Rather, Carriage Hill characterizes the circuit court order as a \u201cblanket rejection\u201d of its arguments, and maintains that such \u201cgeneral findings and conclusions do not permit adequate appellate review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>By failing to resolve all of the issues raised by Carriage Hill, appellant urges that the court did not comply with Md.Code (1984, 1995 RepLVol.), \u00a7 10-222(h) of the State Government Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Consequently, appellant seeks a remand to the circuit court for resolution of the issues it raised in its attack upon the agency\u2019s decision. We are unpersuaded by these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Our resolution of this matter is tied directly to the standard of review that we previously outlined. Appellant\u2019s underlying contention is flawed because it is premised largely on the mistaken perception that our task involves review of the decision of the circuit court. \u201c[T]he Court of Appeals repeatedly has proceeded directly to the review of the administrative decision itself.\u201d <em>Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. at 303, 641 A.2d 899 (citing <em>Maryland State Police v. Lindsey, </em>318 Md. 325, 334-36, 568 A.2d 29 (1990) and <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Lindsay, </em>309 Md. 557, 563-64, 525 A.2d 1051 (1987)). Consistent with the principles of judicial review of an agency\u2019s decision, H.G. \u00a7 19-120(b)(l) expressly provides: \u201cA decision of the Commission shall be the final decision for purposes of judicial review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The authorities on which appellant relies to support its request for remand are inapposite. For example, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, <em>Lampton v. LaHood, </em>94 Md.App. 461, 617 A.2d 1142 (1993), is not \u201cvirtually on all fours with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>present ease.\u201d <em>La/mpton </em>did not involve an administrative agency review, <em>id. </em>at 466-67, 617 A.2d 1142, and we did not order a remand because of the Orphan\u2019s Court\u2019s failure to reach all the legal issues before it. Rather, we remanded because the record was unclear as to certain critical facts that pertained to the creditor\u2019s claim, and because we could not determine from review of the record what impact a conflict of interest had on the lower court proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 484-85, 617 A.2d 1142. Similarly, <em>Forman v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>332 Md. 201, 630 A.2d 753 (1993), is readily distinguishable from this case. There, an administrative law judge suspended the appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license because the appellant failed to take a breathlyzer test. <em>Id. </em>at 205-06, 630 A.2d 753. The Court remanded to the agency because the <em>agency, </em>not the circuit court, failed to address an important legal issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">B. The Commission\u2019s Vote, the Role of Staff, and the Hearing Officer\u2019s Recommendation</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Appellant argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Revised Decision is defective because the Commission rejected, \u201cwithout discussion or explanation,\u201d the recommendation of the hearing officer, never provided the rationale for its vote, and never \u201cpurported to adopt the staffs draft Final Decision.\u201d These claims lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">As we noted earlier, the Commission may delegate to a single Commissioner the responsibility for reviewing an application, conducting evidentiary hearings, and preparing a proposed decision. H.G. \u00a7 19 \u2014 118(d)(3). The Staffs role in a CON review proceeding is outlined in COMAR 10.24.01.07o(l), which provides, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201cThe Staff shall issue its report ... in the form of Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Recommendations.... \u201d Here, the Staff reviewed the applicable rules, standards, and criteria and issued an 85 page report. Nevertheless, under H.G. \u00a7 19-118(d), the Commission alone has the \u201cfinal nondelegable authority to act upon\u201d a CON application. Moreover, COMAR 10.24.01.07K(2) requires a written decision that includes findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>At the hearing held by the Commission on June 13, 1995,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> representatives of the parties and Staff presented oral argument and were questioned by the commissioners concerning a variety of issues. The commissioners also had before them the proposed decision of Commissioner Harris favoring Inter-Care, the parties\u2019 exceptions to that recommendation, the March 1994 Staff report approving Marriott, and a detailed chronology of the procedural history prepared by the Staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">At the end of the hearing, the Commission specifically considered two motions. The first, articulately and rather passionately presented by Commissioner Harris, urged the award of the CON to InterCare, to ensure \u201ca willing and compassionate provider of nursing home services\u201d and to relieve \u201ca serious access problem\u201d for the \u201clow income under-served population....\u201d That motion was defeated. Thereafter, a motion was made to \u201csupport the staffs recommendations\u201d in favor of Marriott. After that motion was seconded, the Chair said: \u201cThe motion to accept the recommendation of the staff that is favoring Marriott is now on the floor.\u201d When the question was called, the Chair said: \u201cAll those in favor, please raise your hand.\u201d By a vote of six to three, the Chair declared: \u201cThe motion is carried.\u201d After verifying that the requisite number of consumer members of the Commission supported the motion, the Chair said: \u201c[A]t this time ... Marriott has been awarded the application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The foregoing establishes that the Commission specifically voted to approve Marriott\u2019s projects, <em>based on the Staff\u2019s recommendation. </em>COMAR 10.24.01.07K(4) states: \u201cA decision of the Commission shall be by a majority of the quorum present and voting, except that no project may be approved without the affirmative vote of at least two consumer members of the Commission.\u201d Appellant does not claim that the Commission acted without a quorum or that the vote lacked the approval of two consumer members. We are satisfied that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Commission complied with COMAR when it issued the Revised Decision, incorporating the findings and conclusions of the March 1994 Staff report, in accordance with the Commission\u2019s vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Appellant has not referred us to any authority that mandates a second vote by the Commission to approve the actual text of either the Final Decision or the Revised Decision, and we can find none. Nor do we perceive any merit to the assertion that \u201cthe Commission never even purported to adopt\u201d the Staffs rationale. That the Commission\u2019s Revised Decision was issued after its vote does not mean that it was not the Commission\u2019s ruling or that the process was flawed. Certainly, the Staff had no authority to issue a final opinion in the name of the Commission. To the contrary, the Final Decision and the Revised Decision carried with them the imprimatur of the Commission; they were both issued <em>by order of the Commission.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">We are also unable to assign error even if the Revised Decision was drafted by the Staff. CHCJ\u2019s contention in this regard is undercut by its concession below, recognizing \u201cthat agencies cannot be expected to draft every word in their orders; that is what Staff is for.\u201d Although appellant speculates that some of the commissioners may have had concerns about the Staffs final product, there is no evidence to support such a suggestion. A \u201cCommission member who does not agree with the decision or any part of it reached by the majority of the Commission may file a written dissenting opinion....\u201d COMAR 10.24.01.07K(8). None was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In its quarrel, appellant also seems to suggest that, because the Commission disagreed with the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation endorsing InterCare, more was required of the Commission by way of explanation than if the Commission had adopted that recommendation. CHCJ points out that the Revised Decision omits specific reference to the hearing officer\u2019s objections to appellant\u2019s application. Absent those objections, appellant asserts that its application should have been approved. CHCJ also contends that the Revised Decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>failed to address the hearing officer\u2019s objections to Marriott\u2019s applications or the reasons favoring InterCare. Again, these contentions do not carry the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Merely because the Commission delegated to a hearing officer the responsibility to hold hearings and prepare a proposed decision, it does not follow that the Commission was obligated to adopt the hearing officer\u2019s proposal or satisfy a higher standard in order for a disagreement with a hearing officer to withstand appellate scrutiny. Moreover, we are unaware of any requirement imposing on the Commission the burden of addressing, line by line, the content of a hearing officer\u2019s recommendation. <em>See </em>H.G. \u00a7 19-118(d)(ll). In this regard, <em>Shrieves, </em>supra, 100 Md.App. 283, 641 A.2d 899, is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The <em>Shrieves </em>Court explained the relationship between an agency and a hearing officer and the deference, if any, that the agency owes to the hearing officer. To be sure, an agency is required to <em>consider </em>the findings of a hearing officer, and the hearing officer\u2019s credibility determinations are entitled to special deference. <em>Id. </em>at 298-99, 641 A.2d 899. But, \u201cit is the <em>final </em>order of the administrative agency that is subjected to deferential judicial review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296, 641 A.2d 899 (citing <em>Anderson, </em>330 Md. at 215, 623 A.2d 198).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">When we compare the Commission\u2019s decision to Commissioner Harris\u2019s recommendation, it is evident to us that the Commission considered Commissioner Harris\u2019s proposed findings and recommendation. Moreover, the Commission adequately addressed, directly and indirectly, those matters with which it disagreed. For example, in its consideration of the \u201cneed\u201d criterion under COMAR 10.24.01.07H(2)(b), the Commission pointed out that the hearing officer \u201cerroneously interpreted the Commission\u2019s previous decision to waive the 95% [occupancy] rule.\u201d It said: \u201cOne of the concerns guiding the Commission ... was that the 95% rule not be used to block new competitors in favor of existing nursing homes that do not accept Medicaid recipients____ It does not follow from this that the applicant proposing the largest number of Medic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>aid beds <em>lie., </em>InterCare, which was recommended by the hearing officer] should be approved.... \u201d The Commission also specifically \u201cdisagreed] with the Proposed Decision\u2019s conclusion that Marriott has contributed to a Medicaid access problem in Montgomery County.\u201d Further, it adequately provided its reasons for favoring Marriott\u2019s projects over the proposal of CHCJ. Therefore, we perceive no legal error with regard to the process that culminated in the Revised Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">C. The Review Criteria: The Most Effective Alternatives, Need, and Impact</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">CHCJ contends that the Commission\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious, because it improperly considered matters that exceeded the scope of its authority with respect to the more effective alternatives review criteria under COMAR 10.24.01.07H(2)(c). CHCJ avoids casting its complaint as a challenge to the factual findings of the Commission. It argues, instead, that the Commission erred as a matter of law by considering issues such as use of currently available resources and zoning. In this regard, CHCJ contends that the Commission improperly \u201ccreated <em>new </em>\u2018effectiveness\u2019 standards dealing with the use of \u2018existing resources\u2019 ... and \u2018questions about zoning\u2019 ... to determine that [appellant] was not as \u2018effective\u2019 an alternative as Marriott.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Appellant avers that the Commission found CHCJ\u2019s application \u201cconsistent with <em>every </em>review criterion except one,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the \u201cmost effective alternatives\u201d criterion. In particular, CHCJ focuses on the Commission\u2019s allegedly improper interpretation of the \u201cmost effective alternatives\u201d review criterion, which included a \u201cscarce resources\u201d analysis. Appellant suggests that this analysis was the \u201csole basis\u201d for the denial of its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Preliminarily, we reject appellant\u2019s assertion that the Commission found CHCJ\u2019s application consistent with all review criteria except the \u201cmore effective alternatives\u201d criterion. As we see it, the Commission made several other key findings that culminated in the decision to favor Marriott over CHCJ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>For example, in its analysis of the \u201cimpact\u201d criterion under COMAR 10.24.01.07H(2)(e), which appellant does not address, the Commission specifically concluded that Marriott would have a more positive effect on the health care system. Interestingly, although Marriott notes the Commission\u2019s favorable finding as to \u201cimpact,\u201d appellees have not challenged appellant\u2019s erroneous assertion that the Commission favored Marriott solely because of the more effective alternatives criterion. It would seem to us, however, that because appellant has not challenged the Commission\u2019s conclusion with respect to the impact criterion, it has waived any complaints as to that conclusion. <em>See Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Downey Communications, Inc., </em>110 Md.App. 493, 519, 678 A.2d 55 (1996); <em>Harrison v. Harrison, </em>109 Md.App. 652, 673-74, 675 A.2d 1003, <em>cert. denied, </em>343 Md. 564, 683 A.2d 177 (1996). Consequently, its complaints as to the more effective alternative analysis are really of no moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In any event, in reaching its decision as to \u201cimpact,\u201d the Commission considered some of the same factors that it considered regarding the \u201cmore effective alternatives\u201d criterion. Therefore, we shall discuss both the impact and more effective alternatives criteria together.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">As to the criterion of \u201cless costly or more effective alternatives,\u201d COMAR 10.24.01.07H(2)(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">The availability of less costly or more effective alternatives for addressing the unmet needs identified by the applicant---- [Tjhe Commission shall take into account the cost effectiveness of construction plans and may consider the cost effectiveness of providing that proposed service at the applicant facility versus alternative facilities which are existing and providing the proposed service or alternative facilities which have submitted a competitive application as part of a comparative review. When costs fall within a reasonable range, cost comparisons are not relevant to this criterion, and projects may be found consistent even if one applicant\u2019s costs exceeds that of another\u2019s in a comparative review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>This criterion is composed of two prongs: the \u201cless costly\u201d component and the \u201cmore effective\u201d component. Because the Commission could not award more than 84 CCF beds, and all of the applicants were generally qualified, the more effective alternatives criterion became a critical consideration. Appellant has acknowledged that the more effective alternatives element is somewhat subjective, particularly when, as here, more than one contestant meets the minimal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">In analyzing the \u201cmore effective\u201d prong, the Commission articulated seven additional factors that it deemed relevant to its analysis: community-based services for which the SHP finds need; service to underserved populations; community and professional support/opposition; site control; zoning; facility design as it relates to patient privacy and efficient operation; and use of currently available resources. At the outset, we reject appellant\u2019s claim that these factors were not properly part of the \u201cmore effective alternatives\u201d analysis. Appellant\u2019s view of this standard is too restrictive. Neither the Commission\u2019s interpretation nor its application of the more effective alternatives criterion conflicted with the plain language of the regulation. Moreover, it is the agency that \u201cis best able to discern its intent in promulgating a regulation.\u201d <em>Changing Point, </em>87 Md.App. at 160, 589 A.2d 502 (citing <em>Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>295 Md. 586, 593, 457 A.2d 1146 (1983)). \u201cThus, an agency\u2019s interpretation of the meaning and intent of its own regulation is entitled to deference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Maryland Comm\u2019n, </em>295 Md. at 593, 457 A.2d 1146).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The Commission\u2019s conclusion in favor of Marriott as the applicant with the most effective alternative rested on four of the seven factors. The Commission determined that: (1) appellant ineffectively used currently available resources, because it intentionally took 46 CCF beds out of service in its two other facilities in the County, notwithstanding its effort to obtain additional beds for the pending project; (2) Carriage Hill\u2019s zoning was uncertain; (3) appellant faced community opposition to its project; (4) the community opposition would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>inevitably result in the delay of implementation of the project; and (5) Marriott\u2019s facility designs were more efficient, because its physical therapy rooms were planned for the same floors as the nursing units.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The Commission also considered the impact criterion, pursuant to COMAR 10.24.01.07H(2)(e). It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">Having a positive impact on the existing health care system of the area. For purposes of determining consistency, the Commission may judge the effects of the proposal on existing facilities, beds, services, or equipment and any excesses or deficits identified in the State Health Plan, as applicable, and whether proposals to expand existing capacity shift services, beds, and dollars to areas of unmet need from areas of identified excess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In its consideration of the impact criterion, the Commission considered three other factors:<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> need; service to the under-served; and respite and domiciliary care. As to the need factor, it stated that it was \u201cnot convinced\u201d that the award of the maximum of 84 CCF beds \u201cwill have the most positive effect on the system.\u201d This is noteworthy, because only Marriott sought less than 84 CCF beds. It reiterated that appellant faces \u201ccommunity opposition and may be opposed in future zoning actions, if such are required.\u201d Moreover, \u201cregardless of the merits of the opposition,\u201d the Commission was concerned that \u201cimplementation of the [CHCJ] project may be delayed.\u201d Were that to occur, the Commission recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>that CHCJ\u2019s \u201cservices may not be brought on line in a timely manner.\u201d Further, because of CHCJ\u2019s \u201cunused beds at its other facilities,\u201d the Commission expressly said that it had \u201cno reason to believe that ... [CHCJ] would not also voluntarily restrict beds\u201d again. Thus, the Commission concluded that Marriott\u2019s projects would have the more positive impact on the health care system.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">In the \u201cSummary\u201d section of its analysis of the \u201cLess Costly or More Effective Alternatives\u201d criterion, the Commission emphasized the more effective prong. In concluding that Marriott\u2019s proposals were more effective, the Commission reiterated that \u201c[zjoning is not an issue\u201d for Marriott, its projects have \u201cappropriate zoning\u201d and thus they could quickly \u201cbe implemented without further zoning action.\u201d On the other hand, it said that CHCJ\u2019s zoning was \u201cunclear,\u201d and it faced community opposition to future zoning approvals. Further, the Commission concluded that Marriott\u2019s proposed facilities had a better design than CHCJ\u2019s proposed project, based on the location of the physical therapy rooms. Thus, the Commission indicated that CHCJ\u2019s design was \u201cless efficient\u201d than Marriott\u2019s, \u201cdue to the necessity to transport the patients off the comprehensive care unit for therapy.\u201d Further, the Commission reiterated that it did not consider CHCJ\u2019s voluntary restriction of beds at its two existing facilities \u201can effective use of scarce resources.\u201d After consideration of the discernable differences that the Commission believed would have an impact upon the effective deployment of health care resources, it selected Marriott\u2019s project. As we explain below, we perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">(1) &lt;Jse of Currently Available Resources</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Appellant complains that the Commission improperly penalized CHCJ because, at two other Carriage Hill facilities in the County, Carriage Hill voluntarily removed many CCF beds from service. It urges that it was improper for the Commission to consider unused beds at related facilities.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Flora Luckett, CHCJ\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, admitted under cross-examination that Carriage Hill operates two other comprehensive care facilities in the County, and they both had CCF beds that were \u201cnot in service.\u201d Luckett offered reasons for that situation, which are not relevant to the issue here. She also acknowledged that, as of the date of her testimony (i.e., November 19, 1993), the Carriage Hill facility in Silver Spring was licensed for 113 CCF beds, with a voluntary restriction to 100 beds, and only 98 of those beds were operating. At the Carriage Hill facility in Bethesda, which was licensed for 89 CCF beds, only 75 were operating.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">After reviewing files for the other Carriage Hill facilities, the Staff noted that Carriage Hill\u2019s Silver Spring facility had recently increased its licensed capacity from 113 to 122 CCF beds, and the Bethesda facility had requested an increase of nine beds. Yet the Silver Spring facility\u2019s voluntary restriction to 100 beds remained in effect, and the Bethesda facility had a voluntary restriction of 74 beds. Accordingly, the Commission determined that the two other Carriage Hill facilities had a total of 37 unused CCF beds, which would increase to 46 when the Bethesda facility was licensed for the additional nine CCF beds. Thus, the Commission said: \u201cIn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>short, up to 46 beds which could be available for patient use in Montgomery County are controlled by Carriage Hill and kept out of service. This is not an effective use of scarce resources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Appellant insists that the Commission had no authority to deny Carriage Hill\u2019s CON application solely because the other Carriage Hill facilities had 46 licensed but unused CCF beds. Further, CHCJ argues that the Commission erred as a matter of law in concluding that appellant did not \u201cappropriately\u201d or \u201ceffectively\u201d use its \u201cresources\u201d, and by finding that such conduct was \u201cnot an effective use of scare resources.\u201d In addition, CHCJ contends that the Commission erred as a matter of law in stating that appellant \u201ccould accomplish much of its goal to construct a facility at the Carriage Hill Cabin John site through relocation of unused comprehensive care beds from its existing facilities.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In this regard, appellant posits that the Commission lacks the authority to relocate existing beds or to require a facility to do so. To the contrary, it notes that Carnage Hill could not relocate existing CCF beds without CON approval. Therefore, it urges that the Commission erred because it denied a meritorious application based on \u201csome impressionistic determination that the applicant has a possible opportunity to obtain its beds in another way.\u201d Under the circumstances attendant here, we believe it was reasonable for the Commission to consider that CHCJ\u2019s related facilities had licensed CCF beds that were voluntarily removed from service.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><em>Maryland Gen.

Maryland General further complained that, instead of balancing effectiveness and costs, the Commission \u201cplaced an unjustifiably narrow and highly subjective emphasis on \u2018program effectiveness\u2019 and largely disregarded objective and quantifiable considerations of \u2018cost\u2019____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545, 653 A.2d 1029. We disagreed with Maryland General\u2019s contention, explaining that the Commission found that \u201call applicants satisfied the \u2018cost\u2019 prong but that Union Memorial was entitled to the preference because it offered a more effective program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We observed: \u201cThe actual balancing of these considerations is judgmental, invoking expertise of the agency; it is not a matter for second-guessing by a court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Appellant\u2019s arguments here are akin to those advanced by Maryland General.

Zoning, Community Opposition, and Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Appellant suggests that Commission \u201cnever made clear whether the issue [of zoning] actually was material to its decision to deny the CHCJ application----\u201d It contends, however, that the Commission erred if it rejected Carriage Hill\u2019s proposal because the \u201cstatus\u201d of its zoning was \u201cuncertain.\u201d According to appellant, the \u201cuncertainty over the need for additional zoning approvals\u201d was not \u201ca good reason for preferring an applicant other than Carriage Hill.... \u201d Carriage Hill also claims that the Commission erred to the extent that it ruled against CHCJ based on its finding that Carriage Hill faced delay and community opposition to its project.</p>\n<p id=\"APE\">CHCJ notes that, in the Revised Decision, the Commission conceded that issuance of a CON does not require final zoning approval, and that it \u201croutinely evaluates, and sometimes approves, CON applications that contemplate construction of a new facility on a site that may require further zoning approvals ____\u201d Therefore, appellant insists that it was improper for the Commission to deny appellant\u2019s application based on the purported uncertainty of its zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Substantively, appellant denies that its zoning status was uncertain. It contends that it had already obtained a special exception and would have pursued a zoning modification, if necessary. In this regard, appellant seems to raise a factual dispute as to the certainty of its zoning status, notwithstanding its repeated assertions that it does not contest any factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">As we see it, the Commission was quite clear with regard to its concerns about appellant\u2019s zoning. The question for us, then, is whether the Commission acted beyond its authority in basing its ultimate decision on the uncertainty of appellant\u2019s zoning and the related matters of community opposition and delay. We conclude that the Commission was entitled to consider zoning and the ramifications of CHCJ\u2019s unsettled zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">It is undisputed that Carriage Hill obtained a special exception in 1986 that had been extended until May 1995. Zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>approval was obtained for a 64 room, \u201cL shaped\u201d assisted living facility containing 60,000 square feet, with an approved building footprint of 19,129 square feet. The zoning exception also contained several conditions, including that the \u201cproposed development be in strict accordance with the specifications and requirements of the petitioner\u2019s site plan\u201d as it was submitted when the special exception was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Notably, the shape and floor plan of the facility for which appellant sought the CON differed markedly from that for which the special exception had been procured. The contemplated project was for an \u201cX\u201d shaped structure containing 89,000 square feet, 125 CCF rooms, and a building footprint of 29,256 square feet. Thus, as the Commission found, \u201cthe size, the configuration and the occupancy of the [CHCJ] facility have all increased since the special exception was obtained [by CHCJ].\u201d According to the Commission, even CHCJ recognized that the \u201cproject before the zoning board is not the same project that is the subject of the CON proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">From appellant\u2019s perspective, the changes were not of significance. CHCJ suggested that, if awarded the CON, it would seek the necessary modification from the zoning board. Nonetheless, it is not seriously disputed that appellant had to secure a modification to the special exception in order to construct the facility described in the Carriage Hill application.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The Commission was also concerned about anticipated community opposition to the CHCJ project, based on the zoning issue. That concern was well founded; it derived from the testimony of Maureen O\u2019Connor, president of the Birnam Wood Homeowners Association. She stated that the association intended \u201cto oppose the [CHCJ] project in the zoning process if additional zoning action is needed.\u201d That opposition centered on the proximity of the proposed CHCJ facility to houses in the community, the perceived visual intrusion of the building, and the increased traffic that the new facility would generate. The Commission also expressed concern that, regardless of the merits of the community opposition, the antici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>pated opposition would delay the implementation of the CHCJ project.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Thus, in considering this issue, the Commission said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">In sum, while Marriott has not demonstrated that dedock-eting is required [due to CHCJ\u2019s zoning status], its arguments relating to the discrepancies between Carriage Hill\u2019s zoning approvals and its CON application has pointed up a deficiency in Carriage Hill\u2019s application, i.e., the necessity of securing further zoning approvals for the Carriage Hill project and the uncertainty attendant upon the zoning process. This is not a sufficient reason for decoketing Carriage Hill\u2019s application. Nevertheless', the uncertainty over the need for additional zoning approvals is a good reason for preferring an applicant other than Carriage Hill in this review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">Zoning is not an issue for Bedford Court, which is an existing facility. Brighton Gardens states that it has approved zoning for its project.... The zoning status for the Carriage Hill project is unclear. Carriage Hill currently holds a special exception for a previously proposed project on the same site which was due to expire at the end of May 1995. The project has been redesigned and the total number of residents has been increased since the time the special exception was granted. It appears that, at the least, Carriage Hill will require an extension of its special exception. The Community association which opposes the project has indicated its intent to oppose any future zoning approvals for this Applicant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">There is an unresolved issue with respect to the zoning for the Carriage Hill facility. This project is also the subject of community opposition which at the least may delay implementation of the project, if future zoning action is required. Carriage Hill\u2019s design is less efficient in terms of physical therapy location than Bedford Court and Brigh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>ton Gardens. Carriage Hill currently controls a large number of beds which it has voluntarily chosen not to use. Thus, the Commision [sic] cannot find this the more effective project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\">Bedford Court and Brighton Gardens offer proposals which have demonstrated community and professional support. There is no community opposition to these projects. Both projects have appropriate zoning and can be implemented without further zoning action. Both offer designs which will enhance patient privacy. The physical therapy rooms in these facilities are located on the comprehensive care units which will allow the patients to go to therapy without leaving the comprehensive care unit. Thus, the Commission finds Bedford Court and Brighton Gardens offer the more effective projects in this review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">To some extent, we are puzzled by appellant\u2019s complaints regarding the Commission\u2019s consideration of zoning. After all, the parties <em>stipulated </em>to a limited remand to the Commission for the very purpose of deciding Marriott\u2019s motion to dedocket the Carriage Hill application; that motion was premised on issues regarding appellant\u2019s zoning status. In its motion to dedocket, Marriott contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the changes to appellant\u2019s project constituted an impermissible modification of the project, while CHCJ countered that the differences were \u201clegally inconsequential\u201d and it would seek further zoning approval once it obtained the CON.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">In its reply brief, CHCJ suggests that zoning and the other factors the Commission applied under the \u201cless costly or more effective alternatives\u201d analysis were improperly considered for the first time in the November 1995 Decision. The record does not support this claim. Both the March 1994 Staff Report and the hearing officer\u2019s proposed decision considered zoning and other factors in their respective evaluations of the more effective alternative. Indeed, appellant addressed some of these criteria in its exceptions to the proposed decision and in its argument before the Commission on June 13, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>We are also constrained to point out that, throughout the protracted history of this case, various reviewers have considered the zoning status of the applicants\u2019 respective proposals and, when favorable to appellant, it has not objected. For example, appellant has argued, in another context, that the Department\u2019s recommendation, which favored CHCJ, should have received more consideration from the Commission. In urging that position, we note that zoning was one of the specific reasons offered by the Department to support its endorsement of appellant\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">To be sure, the Commission acknowledged that it <em>\u201csometimes </em>approves, CON applications\u201d that may require further zoning approval. (Emphasis added). But, that concession does not compel the Commission to disregard the matter of zoning in evaluating the criteria of more effective alternatives and impact. The Commission selected Marriott, in part, because Brighton Gardens had zoning approval for the proposed site, and Bedford Court was merely adding beds to an existing facility. Thus, if Marriott were awarded the CONs, zoning would not create an impediment to Marriott\u2019s implementation of its proposals. We are satisfied that the Commission made a \u201cjudgmental ... [evaluation] invoking the expertise of the agency....\u201d <em>Maryland Gen. Hosp., </em>103 Md.App. at 545, 653 A.2d 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">3. Facility Design</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In its decision regarding the more effective alternatives prong, the Commission clearly favored the designs of Marriott\u2019s facilities. The parties have largely ignored the Commission\u2019s ruling in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The Commission found that, at the proposed Marriott facilities, the physical therapy rooms were conveniently located on the same floor as the nursing unit. In contrast, according to the Commission, the physical therapy room for CHCJ would \u201crequire facility staff to accompany patients off the nursing unit, down an elevator to the therapy room and back to the patient floors.\u201d The Commission was concerned \u201cabout the location of the physical therapy rooms in the Carriage Hill ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>facilities, as it relates to efficiency of operation.\u201d It also said: \u201cThe Commission considers it more efficient to have the physical therapy room located on the nursing unit, as proposed by Bedford Court and Brighton Gardens.\u201d All things being equal, the Commission may well have had a valid \u201ctiebreaker\u201d based on this uncontested finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">4. Need</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">As we noted, the Commission considered \u201cneed\u201d as a separate criterion, pursuant to COMAR 10.24.01.07H(2)(b), and also as a factor in its analysis of the \u201cimpact\u201d criterion. The parties have not addressed the Commission\u2019s consideration of the \u201cneed\u201d factor with regard to the maximum of 84 CCF beds.- In connection with its analysis of the impact criterion, the Commission clearly considered Marriott\u2019s proposals as preferable.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The Commission noted in its review of both the need and impact criteria that it had the right to approve up to 84 CCF beds for the County because, as of the time of the first pre-hearing conference during the CON review process, the SHP projected a need of 84 CCF beds in the County by 1994. <em>See </em>COMAR \u00a7 10.24.08.05C(l)(c). Nevertheless, the Commission observed that it was not legally obligated to approve as many as 84 CCF beds. Moreover, by the time the matter was ripe for the Commission\u2019s decision, the SHP had updated the projection of bed needs for 1994; the projected need was reduced substantially to thirteen beds needed for 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In considering the factor of need when it analyzed the criterion of impact, the Commission pointed out that the Staff had considered \u201cbed need and the occupancy rate of existing facilities\u201d in the County. It agreed with the Staffs conclusion \u201cthat approval of a larger number of additional beds may, in fact, have a negative effect on existing facilities by further lowering their occupancy rates.\u201d It reasoned: \u201c[Wjhile the maximum of 84 beds can be approved in this review, the Commission is not convinced that doing so will have the most positive impact on the system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Only Marriott proposed less than the maximum of 84 CCF beds. Accordingly, it is clear that the Commission weighted this matter in Marriott\u2019s favor in reaching its ultimate decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">D. The Local Health Department\u2019s Recommendation</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Carriage Hill argues that, contrary to COMAR 10.24.01.071(3),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the Commission erred because the Revised Decision did not contain a \u201cdetailed explanation\u201d as to why the Commission rejected the Department\u2019s recommendation in favor of appellant. It also suggests that the Commission \u201cessentially agrees with the four grounds for the local health planning agency\u2019s endorsement of [Carriage Hill].\u201d Moreover, appellant asserts that in a comparative review as difficult as this one, the Commission erred because it should have given more weight to the Department\u2019s recommendation. Appellant\u2019s contentions are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The local Department\u2019s participation in CON reviews is mandated by H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 19-111 through 19-113 and COMAR 10.24.01.07H(2) and 10.24.01.071(3). On August 27, 1991, following a public hearing, the Department recommended approval of appellant\u2019s application for several reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">First, Carriage Hill\u2019s track record of providing quality services in Montgomery County for more than twenty-five years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">Second, CHCJ\u2019s firm financing commitment, experience and solid plan for the facility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">Third, CHCJ\u2019s location in an area of the County where large numbers of elderly persons reside, CHCJ\u2019s control of its site and approved zoning, and the ready availability of utilities; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Fourth, the cost-effectiveness of locating all 84 beds needed under the State Health Plan at one location, and CHCJ\u2019s ability to complete the project immediately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">In our view, the Revised Decision reflects that the Commission adequately considered the Department\u2019s position. Indeed, the opinion expressly refers to the recommendation of the Department, stating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">The [Montgomery County] Health Department has recommended the proposal of [appellant], for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">1. Track Record \u2014 This organization has two existing facilities in Montgomery County providing quality services; one with 15 years and the other with 25 years of experience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">2. Financial Plan \u2014 The corporation has a firm commitment to finance the project as well as having the experience and planning process in place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">3. Location \u2014 This project has approved zoning, public water, sewer and accessible public transportation. The corporation owns the land and is working to gain community support. The project is also in an area of the county where large numbers of elderly population reside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">4. Number of beds \u2014 The project requests the total 84 beds allocated for the County by [the Commission] which will maximize the cost-effectiveness of the construction. In addition, since two other approved projects are delayed in their development and construction, the need for all 84 beds is critical.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">We are satisfied that the Revised Decision provides ample reason for the Commission\u2019s rejection of the Department\u2019s recommendation. For example, in finding appellant\u2019s zoning status \u201cuncertain,\u201d the Commission made clear that it disagreed with the Department\u2019s conclusion that Carriage Hill had \u201capproved zoning.\u201d As to the Department\u2019s conclusion regarding the \u201cnumber of beds,\u201d the Commission noted that, \u201cas a matter of law, there is no requirement that the applicant which proposed the largest number of ... beds must be approved.\u201d Further, the Commission obviously disputed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Department\u2019s finding that CHCJ had the best \u201ctrack record\u201d, because it expressed concern with the number of CCF beds that appellant voluntarily took out of service at its two other facilities. Accordingly, we conclude that the Revised Decision, taken as a whole, satisfies COMAR 10.24.01.071(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Appellant has not referred us to any authority to support its contention that the Department\u2019s recommendation should have been treated as a decisive factor because this was such a close case. As the Department\u2019s recommendation is merely advisory, and the Department is not required to take into account the same standards, rules, and criteria that the Commission must consider, we attach no merit to such an assertion. To the contrary, by statute, \u201cThe Commission <em>alone </em>shall have the <em>final nondelegable </em>authority to act upon an application for a [CON]....\u201d H.G. \u00a7 19-118(d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Moreover, if we were to adopt the logic of appellant\u2019s argument, we could just as easily say that the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation should have been the decisive factor. If that were so, appellant\u2019s cause would not be advanced; the hearing officer recommended InterCare.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">V. Discussion \u2014 Marriott Corporation\u2019s Reorganization and Financial Transactions</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Appellant complains that the Commission violated COMAR 10.24.01.06D(1) because, as a result of Marriott Corporation\u2019s reorganization, the \u201capplicant\u201d and ultimate \u201clicensee\u201d of the proposed facilities were not the same entity. Appellant also contends that the Commission erred because, in effect, Marriott sold the CON for Bedford Court for $1,000,000, in violation of COMAR 10.24.01.09D.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">In its brief, the Commission suggests that these issues were \u201cthoroughly and accurately addressed [by the Commission] in its final decision.\u201d We see it differently. In unraveling the complicated and sophisticated business transactions that were at issue here, the Commission\u2019s analysis was rather abbreviated; it was consigned to a lengthy footnote in the Revised Decision. Moreover, the Commission seemed simply to adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Marriott\u2019s explanation. This does not necessarily equate to error, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Before we consider CHCJ\u2019s contentions, we shall briefly address Marriott\u2019s threshold argument of waiver. It shall not detain us long, for we are satisfied that CHC J has not waived these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">A. Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Marriott argues that appellant has waived its right to challenge the Commission\u2019s decision concerning the corporate reorganization and the Bedford Court financing transaction. Its position is based on CHCJ\u2019s failure to raise either matter in its exceptions to Commissioner Harris\u2019s proposed decision, in which she concluded that Marriott Corporation\u2019s reorganization and the sale-leaseback transaction did not violate the applicable criteria, rules, and standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">In support of its position, Marriott relies on <em>Cicala v. Disability Review Bd. for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>288 Md. 254, 418 A.2d 205 (1980). There, the Disability Review Board denied service-connected disability retirement benefits to a police officer. On appeal, the police officer argued that he was denied due process because the Board considered a recommendation by the Medical Review Committee that the Board did not receive until after the hearing. Id. at 261, 418 A.2d 205. Because the \u201cattorney knew or should have known that the Board was required to obtain and consider the Committee\u2019s report,\u201d the Court rejected the officer\u2019s arguments. Id. at 262, 418 A.2d 205. His counsel \u201cneither objected to [the report\u2019s] ... absence nor requested that it be made available.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the Court concluded: \u201cBecause the issue of the alleged error was not raised during the administrative proceeding, it was not properly raised in the judicial proceeding....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263, 418 A.2d 205. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">A party who knows or should have known that an administrative agency has committed an error and who, despite an opportunity to do so, fails to object in any way or at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>time during the administrative proceeding, may not raise an objection for the first time in a judicial review proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axq\"><em>Id. </em>at 261-62,418 A.2d 205 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A4j\"><em>Cicala </em>is not on point. In <em>Meadowridge Industrial Center Ltd. Partnership v. Howard County, </em>109 Md.App. 410, 421, 675 A.2d 138 (1996), we discussed <em>Cicala </em>and observed that in that case, \u201cthe issue raised by the appellant [in court] had never been raised before, or decided by, the administrative agency.\u201d In contrast, the precise issues for which Marriott asserts waiver were raised before the Commission by a co-party. We made clear in <em>Meadowridge </em>that, on judicial review, a party is not barred from raising an issue if a co-party previously raised the issue before the agency. Id. That is exactly what transpired here. In its motion to dedocket Marriott\u2019s CON applications, InterCare asserted improprieties based on the corporate restructuring and sale-leaseback transaction. It then excepted to Commissioner Harris\u2019s proposed decision to deny its motion. Thus, these contentions were squarely presented to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Appellant also addressed these same issues in its post-hearing brief, submitted to the Commission on April 29, 1994. In light of the Commission\u2019s rulings, appellant then raised the issues with the circuit court. There, it specifically argued that the applicant and the licensee were not the same entity, as required by COMAR 10.24.01.06D(1), and that Marriott engaged in a prohibited sale of a CON with respect to Bedford Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Clearly, appellant\u2019s failure to lodge exceptions to the hearing officer\u2019s proposed decision does not offend Md. Rule 8-131(a). It provides that, \u201cordinarily,\u201d we will not decide any issue that does not \u201cplainly appear[ ] by the record to have been raised in or <em>decided by </em>the trial court.\u201d (Emphasis added). The rule guards against a party\u2019s assertion of an issue on appeal that was not raised or <em>considered </em>below. Its \u201cprimary purpose [is] ... \u2018 \u201cto ensure fairness for all parties in a case and to promote the orderly administration of law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 189, 638 A.2d 107 (1994) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number><em>Banks v. State, </em>203 Md. 488, 495, 102 A.2d 267 (1954)); <em>see Davis v. DiPino, </em>337 Md. 642, 647-48, 655 A.2d 401 (1995); <em>In Re Levon A., </em>124 Md.App. 103, 124, 720 A.2d 1232 (1998). Both the circuit court and the Commission considered the issues arising from the corporate reorganization and financial transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">In addition, <em>Cicala </em>is distinguishable from this case because <em>Cicala </em>involved the failure to object at the agency level. Here, appellant\u2019s conduct was one step removed, in that it concerned the failure to except to the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation to the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">B. Factual Background<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">On October 8, 1993, as part of a corporate restructuring, Marriott Corporation was divided into two corporations. Marriott Corporation became Host Marriott Corporation (\u201cHost\u201d) and its subsidiary, Marriott International, Inc. (\u201cInternation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>al\u201d), became an independent, publicly held corporation. According to appellant, the purpose of the reorganization was to \u201cclean up\u201d Marriott Corporation\u2019s balance sheet by \u201cunloading\u201d debt to Host, the successor to Marriott Corporation, in order to boost stock values. In this process, the assets of Marriott Corporation were split between Host and International. Appellant has alleged that Host inherited Marriott Corporation\u2019s \u201ctroubled\u201d real estate holdings, while International \u201cretained the very profitable hotel, restaurant, and retirement community management operations.\u201d On the date of the reorganization, every shareholder of Marriott Corporation received an equal number of shares in Host and International.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">As part of the reorganization, Marriott Retirement Communities, Inc., which originally submitted the Marriott CON applications, became HMC Retirement Properties, Inc. (\u201cHMC\u201d). MRCI was previously a wholly owned subsidiary of Marriott Corporation, and HMC became a subsidiary of Host.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In connection with the reorganization, all of the senior living services business activities and responsibilities of Marriott Corporation\u2019s Senior Living Services Division were consolidated into a new entity known as Marriott Senior Living Services, Inc. (\u201cMSLS\u201d). That entity was created as a subsidiary of International. MSLS and International provide financial and personnel resources necessary for the development of the Bedford Court and Brighton Gardens projects. According to appellant, MRCI/HMC was identified as the applicant or owner of both Bedford Court and Brighton Gardens, and MSLS was \u201cthe prospective lessee and licensee of both facilities.\u201d Marriott advised the Commission that the officers and staff of MRCI became the officers and staff of MSLS.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">HMC and MSLS entered into two agreements concerning Bedford Court that are pertinent here. The first is a \u201cFacilities Lease Agreement\u201d, dated October 8, 1993, between HMC, as Landlord, and MSLS, as Tenant, for the Marriott Senior Living Services Facility at Bedford Court (the \u201cLease\u201d). In accordance with the Lease, which is some 63 pages in length, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>exclusive of exhibits and attachments, MSLS leased Bedford Court from HMC and acquired the right to operate the facility. Although the Lease has a twenty year term, MSLS has four options to renew, each for a five-year term. Therefore, HMC retained ownership of Bedford Court but, pursuant to the Lease, operating responsibility was transferred to MSLS. The Lease was amended on January 19, 1994 with respect to the calculation of the \u201cPercentage Rental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The second agreement, a \u201cSublease and Management Agreement\u201d dated October 8,1993 (the \u201cSublease\u201d), was drafted to prevent the Lease from abrogating HMC\u2019s right to pursue the 16-bed CON for Bedford Court. The Sublease provided that, in the event HMC obtained the CON, MSLS would \u201csublease to HMC sufficient space in the Bedford Court Health Center to operate sixteen (16) nursing beds,\u201d and HMC would seek a nursing home license (the \u201cOperating License\u201d) from the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cHealth/Hygiene\u201d) to operate the 16 CCF beds. Under the \u201cRecitals\u201d in the Sublease, if HMC obtained the Operating License, \u201cthe parties ... intend for MSLS to operate the 16 beds [at Bedford Court] as HMC\u2019s agent and intend for MSLS to become the licensed operator of such beds as soon as legally permissible.\u201d Further, in paragraph 5, the Sublease said: \u201cUpon issuance of the Operating license to HMC, MSLS shall manage the operation of the sixteen beds, as agent for HMC, and with full profit and loss financial responsibility. MSLS\u2019 management of the beds shall continue until the Sublease is terminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">On March 7, 1994, HMC and HMH Properties, Inc., as sellers, and Health and Rehabilitation Properties Trust (\u201cHRPT\u201d), as purchaser, entered into an agreement whereby HRPT, an independent real estate investment trust unrelated to any of the Marriott companies, acquired fourteen senior living communities for $320 million dollars (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d). It is undisputed that the Brighton Gardens project was not involved in this transaction between HMC and HRPT.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, HRPT acquired ownership of Bedford Court from HMC, subject to the Lease and Sublease agreements. Under the Purchase Agreement, HRPT acquired ownership of the land, building, and equipment associated with Bedford Court, but it did not acquire any rights as to the operation of the facility. Because HRPT\u2019s ownership interest is subject to the Lease and Sublease, Marriott claims that HMC\u2019s status as the applicant for the CON for Bedford Court did not change, and MSLS operates Bedford Court pursuant to a 40-year operating lease. Marriott states: \u201cMRCI/HMC became the licensed operator of the nursing home beds approved by the Commission, during which time MSLS operated the beds as MRCI/HMC\u2019s agent. As soon as was legally permissible, MSLS would become the licensed operator of these projects.\u201d Thus, Marriott asserted that, if awarded a CON, HMC would obtain the license and MSLS, as HMC\u2019s agent, would manage Bedford Court, while HRPT would own the physical plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Marriott asserts that, in the so called sale-leaseback transaction, the parties recognized that the assets being sold and leased back would have more value if Bedford Court obtained the CON for 16 additional nursing home beds. Therefore, the Purchase Agreement included adjustments to the financial terms \u2014 both the purchase price and the rent to be paid under the Lease \u2014 in the event that Bedford Court obtained the CON. Paragraph 8.03(e) of the Purchase Agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge that (x) Sellers have applied for and there is pending with respect to the Facility located in Silver Spring, Maryland a ... [CON] for sixteen (16) skilled nursing beds and (y) the Purchase Price has been determined and agreed upon in recognition of the fact that such ... [CON] will not be granted prior to the Closing. If, for any reason, such ... [CON] is irrevocably approved and issued prior to Closing, the Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to $1,000,000.00. Furthermore, if such ... [CON] shall be irrevocably approved and issued on or before the date two (2) years after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers, within ten (10) days thereafter, $1,000,000.00 in immediately available federal funds to such account or accounts as Sellers may designate. The provision of this section shall survive the closing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">All of the documents that we have just summarized were furnished by Marriott to the Commission in April 1994, as part of its opposition to InterCare\u2019s Motion to dedocket. At the hearing before Commissioner Harris on December 19, 1994, InterCare\u2019s counsel contended that, under Marriott\u2019s plan, \u201cthe applicant ... will act as a straw man and supposedly will hold the license for the 16 beds that the CON is granting momentarily before passing it on to an unrelated corporation----\u201d InterCare\u2019s counsel added: \u201cThe problem with this arrangement is it will not work. You cannot carve out a few beds within a licensed facility and license them in a different name.\u201d Marriott\u2019s counsel responded that the reorganization plan and the relationship between HMC and MSLS would have no \u201cmaterial impact\u201d on Marriott\u2019s CON application for Bedford Court. She reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">HMC which is the renamed MCRI continues as the applicant for these projects and what its function has really been since the time of the reorganization is a company that holds the real estate that is associated with many of Marriott\u2019s Senior Living Communities. However, MCRI\u2019s previous function, that is developing senior living communities, implementing them, overseeing their operations, that function was essentially transferred to a new subsidiary ... [MSLS,] a subsidiary of ... International. And accordingly, the board of directors of the former MRCI became the board of directors of MSLS, the officers and professional staff became the officers and professional staff of MSLS. Mr. Downey ... used to be a vice-president of MRCI, he is now a vice-president of MSLS. All of the people, all of the company programs, all of the policies, the missions and goals are exactly the same. There has just been technical corporate changes as a result of the reorganization. There is nothing that has caused any sort of substantive change to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>either the Bedford Court or the Brighton Gardens projects \u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Alternatively, Marriott\u2019s attorney suggested to Commissioner Harris that if she were concerned about HMC\u2019s plan to obtain the licenses after the CON process and, when legally permissible, for MSLS to obtain the licenses to operate the facilities, she could \u201ccompletely rectify\u201d the situation by exercising her discretion and permitting MSLS to replace HMC as the applicant for the projects. COMAE 10.24.01.07A(5)(d) allows modification of a CON application \u201c[a]t the request of the hearing officer,\u201d if the modification does not constitute an impermissible \u201cmajor modification,\u201d as defined in COMAR 10.24.01.07A(5)(c)(i)-(iv), which generally concerns a change in the proposed services. Commissioner Harris did not adopt this suggestion, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The Staff representative agreed with Marriott and stated that neither the larger corporate restructuring nor the sale-leaseback transaction with HRPT warranted the dedocketing of Marriott\u2019s applications. The Staff also acknowledged that HRPT was a \u201ctotally unrelated party,\u201d and explained that if it had \u201cthought HRPT was going to be running the show after [the CON review process] was over ... it would have supported a motion to dedocket....\u201d Under the Marriott agreements, however, it felt that was not the case. As a result, the Staff believed the real issue was \u201cwhich ... subsidiary of the former Marriott Corporation [was] going to be running the show.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">These issues were raised again at the hearing held on June 13, 1995, before the Commission. InterCare\u2019s counsel argued that Marriott Corporation\u2019s reorganization resulted in \u201ca gap between the applicant on the left and the intended licensee on the right, the one that is actually going to operate these facilities.\u201d He contended that, as a result of the reorganization, the applicant was not the person who would be the licensee and therefore Marriott\u2019s applications should be de-docketed. Marriott\u2019s counsel retorted: \u201c[T]o criticize the Marriott reorganization, suggesting that the same people, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>were in this project from day one, who are now working as ... [MSLS], the same people who implemented this project somehow, because of corporate reorganization, that this project should be thrown out the window, that is the ultimate ... in picky.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">In her remarks to the Commission, Commissioner Harris explained her reasoning, stating: \u201cI felt it was imprudent to dedocket ... on what may be a technicality in terms of the Marriott application.\u201d Thereafter, Commissioner Hall asked the Staff representative to \u201caddress the question of the fact that Marriott Retirement Communities, HMC Retirement Properties, Inc. is the applicant for the two CONs, but Marriott Senior Living Services, Inc. is the intended licensee.\u201d He added: \u201cAre we dealing in technicalities here, ... should [we] have recognized that, in fact, we had two entities instead of the licensing entity being the same as the applicant?\u201d The Staff representative responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">Staffs position was that this was a technicality. Marriott is obviously a very large corporation which underwent a spinoff slightly at approximately the time of the evidentiary hearing in this case. After the spinoff was said and done, ... there were actually two sides, two different organizations which developed at that time with identical ownership. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">The designated entity was actually on one side of the big structure, and the one who would actually be operating was on the other side of the structure. They organized this so that the license would be essentially transferred once the applicant is licensed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">I think it is really a technicality because everybody that was in this proceeding testifying on behalf of Marriott is going to be working in the entity that is actually running the project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">That is really what staffs position was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">As we noted, the Commission\u2019s ruling as to these matters is contained in a lengthy footnote in the Revised Decision. The Commission stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>HMC will become the licensed operator of the beds at both facilities. InterCare argued that the sale of the Bed-ford Court project means that the HMC applications should be dedocketed because they violate COMAR 10.24.01.06D(1). This regulation requires that an applicant for a Certificate of Need be the entity that will become the licensee of the proposed facility. As noted, HMC will be the licensee upon project certification. While HMC acknowledges that the license will ultimately be transferred to MSLS, the Commission finds that this does not violate Commission regulations. COMAR 10.24.01.06D(1) does not prohibit subsequent transfers of licenses. Moreover, the policy underlying the regulation is not violated by the planned transfer because, after the Marriott reorganization, all individuals responsible for the Bedford Court and Brighton Gardens projects became MSLS employees. In addition, all the officers and professional staff of MRCI, HMC\u2019s predecessor, became officers and staff of MSLS. Accordingly, there is sufficient identity between the applicant and the persons who will ultimately develop and operate the proposed projects to enable the Commission to adequately assess the party who will ultimately operate the facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0S\">The Commission also concluded that the financial transaction with HRPT</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-4\">... had no practical effect on Bedford Court, which continues to be operated by MSLS pursuant to a 40-year operating lease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Therefore, the Commission denied InterCare\u2019s motion to de-docket Marriott\u2019s applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Following the approval of its applications, Marriott began implementation of its proposals. Sixteen additional CCF beds were licensed at Bedford Court in December 1996 and have been operational since that time. The Brighton Gardens facility has been constructed; 41 CCF beds and 100 assisted living beds have been licensed and operational for several months, although the record does not indicate the licensee. The record does show that, on December 12, 1996, HMC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>obtained a license to operate Bedford Court from \u201cHealth/Hygiene\u201d, pursuant to H.G. \u00a7 19-818(a). The license indicates that it expired on December 13, 1996, the day after it was issued. Also included in the record is a license to operate Bedford Court, dated December 13, 1996, in the name of MSLS; it expired on December 12, 1998. Both the license issued to HMC and the one issued to MSLS read \u201cLicense No. 15-050.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">C. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">1. Marriott Corporation\u2019s Reorganization</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Appellant contends that the Commission\u2019s decision to award the CONs to Marriott violated COMAR 10.24.01.06D(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">If proposed facilities would require licensure after certification, the applicant shall be the person or persons who will be the licensee as set out at Health-General Article, \u00a7 19-318,etseq.<footnotemark>[24]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Appellant claims that HMC, the applicant in the CON review, and MSLS, the entity intended to be the licensee upon approval, were separate corporate entities, contrary to the mandate of COMAR 10.24.01.06D(1). Moreover, Carriage Hill argues that it is irrelevant to the regulatory scheme that the \u201csame individuals\u201d remained responsible for developing the Marriott projects after the corporate restructuring.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">In essence, appellant posits that the Commission misconstrued COMAR 10.24.01.06D(1). \u201cA challenge to a regulatory interpretation is, of course, a legal issue.\u201d <em>Riverview Nursing Ctr., </em>104 Md.App. at 602, 657 A.2d 372. The same canons and rules of construction used to interpret a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>statute apply when we are called upon to construe an agency\u2019s regulation. <em>See Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, supra, 295 </em>Md. at 592-93, 457 A.2d 1146. Accordingly, our primary consideration is the language of the regulation. When the terms of the regulation are unambiguous, there is no need to look elsewhere to determine the agency\u2019s intent. <em>See Prince George\u2019s County v. Vieira, </em>340 Md. 651, 658, 667 A.2d 898 (1995). Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">[u]pon appellate review, courts bestow special favor on an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation. Recognizing an agency\u2019s superior ability to understand its own rules and regulations, a \u201ccourt should not substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency from which an appeal is taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><em>Reeders Memorial Home, Inc., </em>86 Md.App. at 453, 586 A.2d 1295 (citation omitted); <em>see Riverview Nursing Ctr., </em>104 Md. App. at 602, 657 A.2d 372 (noting that \u201ccourts give special weight to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations\u201d). We perceive no error with regard to the Commission\u2019s interpretation and application of COMAR 10.24.01.06D(1).</p>\n<p id=\"A9Fr\">It is undisputed that Marriott\u2019s proposed facilities required licensure upon certification. In <em>Loveman v. Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc., </em>114 Md.App. 603, 691 A.2d 693 (1996), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">[ The Commission] is not a licensing agency; the CON required under the health planning law is not a license to operate a facility. Nursing homes, as \u201crelated institutions,\u201d require a license from the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene____ That is a separate requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 606 n. 2, 691 A.2d 693 (internal citations omitted); <em>see </em>H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 19-318, 19-319, 19-301(1). Therefore, COMAR 10.24.01.06D(1) applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Here, the Commission concluded that the Bedford Court and Brighton Gardens applications complied with the regulation because HMC, the applicant for both projects, would be the licensee. Although the Commission acknowledged that the license would \u201cultimately be transferred to MSLS\u201d, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>concluded that such an action did not offend COMAR 10.24.01.06D(1), \u201cbecause the regulation does not prohibit <em>subsequent </em>transfers of licenses.\u201d (Emphasis added). - Equally important, the Commission found that, notwithstanding the transfer, all of the individuals responsible at the outset for the Marriott projects became MSLS employees and were still involved in the projects. Thus, it concluded that \u201cthere is a sufficient identity between the applicant and the persons who would eventually develop and operate the proposed projects to enable the Commission to adequately assess the party who will ultimately operate the facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The Commission correctly observed that the terms of the COMAR regulation do not address a subsequent transfer of a license by an applicant that is awarded a CON. Nor does appellant refer us to any authority that bars a subsequent transfer under the circumstances attendant here. Because HMC, the applicant, became the initial licensee of the projects, however briefly, it complied with the literal dictates of CO-MAR 10.24.01.06D(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">To be sure, we would not countenance an end run around COMAR. Nonetheless, in the context of this case, it is apparent that the Commission reasoned that it would be exalting form over substance if it were to conclude that the corporate reorganization mandated the denial of Marriott\u2019s applications. It found (and appellant does not contest the factual findings) that many of Marriott\u2019s employees who were involved with the projects before the restructuring remained involved with the projects following the reorganization. This finding clearly undergirded the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In its brief, the Commission asserts that \u201c[hjealth care corporate reorganization and acquisition activities are a frequent and significant element in the modern business of health care.\u201d It also contends that \u201cCommission regulations, as referenced ... give it the authority to examine [a CON request] ... when those transactions detrimentally alter the circumstances of the terms of the application____\u201d In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Commission claims that it examined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>transactions and determined that the change was not prohibited or otherwise detrimental. As we see it, that conclusion is consistent with the purpose of COMAR 10.24.01.06D(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The parties agree that the provision is intended to insure that the Commission evaluates the persons or entities who will actually be developing and operating a facility. In reviewing the corporate reorganization, the Commission determined that the individuals and entities that would ultimately be involved in the operation of the facilities were involved from the outset. Based on the finding that there was a sufficient identity between the applicant and those who will operate the facility, the regulation requiring that the applicant also be the licensee was effectively met.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In reaching our decision, we consider it noteworthy that Marriott advised the Hearing Officer and the Commission about its reorganization, although news reports may have been a catalyst for some disclosures. In his pre-filed testimony of November 5, 1993, Philip Downey, the vice president for the newly formed MSLS, outlined the reorganization and its impact on the CON process. Notably, he specifically disclosed MSLS\u2019s intent to become the ultimate licensee of the Bedford Court and Brighton Gardens facilities upon CON approval. He said: \u201cAlthough it is anticipated that as soon as legally possible, MSLS will become the licensed operator of these projects, if approved, HMC will be responsible for all obligations under the CON and comprehensive care license until such time as MSLS does become the license holder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Moreover, in correspondence of August 1993 between Health/Hygiene and Michael J. Stein, an attorney for Marriott, informed that agency of Marriott Corporation\u2019s impending reorganization. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">It is our understanding that the transactions described above will require a change of license holder at Bedford Court from HMC to MSLS. It is important to point out, however, that the same individuals will be responsible for the day to day operation of the Community and that the corporate management and administrative support staff of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>MSLS will also consist of the same individuals who presently perform those functions at Marriott.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Furthermore, as we noted, in its written opposition to InterCare\u2019s motion to dedocket Marriott\u2019s applications, Marriott supplied the Commission with all of the relevant documents, so that the agency could undertake the necessary evaluation of the transactions. Then, at the hearing before Commissioner Harris, Marriott requested that, if the Commissioner found its applications inconsistent with COMAR 10.24.01.06D(1), she should use her discretion and allow Marriott to rename MSLS as the applicant. The Commissioner declined that request, essentially because she did not consider it necessary. She recommended the denial of the Motion to dedocket, which was founded on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">We are also mindful that this particular issue might not have surfaced if the process had proceeded more expeditiously. All of the applications were filed in 1991, and the restructuring occurred in 1993, well after the proceedings should have been completed. <em>See </em>COMAR 10.24.01.07K(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Accordingly, under all the circumstances, we conclude that the Commission properly determined that Marriott did not offend COMAR 10.24.01.06D(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">2. The Sale-Leaseback Transaction</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Appellant contends that Marriott illegally sold the CON authorizing the additional 16 CCF beds for Bedford Court, and therefore the Commission\u2019s award of the CON to Marriott contravened COMAR 10.24.01.09D. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">Tranferability. Except as provided in these regulations, a Certificate of Need is not transferable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">Appellant also complains that the Revised Decision failed to address the underlying question of whether the sale of Bed-ford Court included a prohibited sale of a CON. Rather, without explaining its rationale, CHCJ argues that the Commission \u201csimply repeats Marriott\u2019s assertions\u201d that the reorganization and sale-leaseback were of no legal consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Appellant\u2019s claim is premised on the Purchase Agreement between HMC and HRPT, which included a provision by which HRPT would pay Marriott an additional $1,000,000.00 if the Commission approved the CON for Bedford Court. Carriage Hill posits: \u201cViewing the deal from a practical perspective, if no CON is awarded, Marriott does not receive the $1 million.\u201d Therefore, it insists that Marriott was, in effect, selling its CON for $1,000,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">In its Opposition to InterCare\u2019s motion to dedocket Marriott\u2019s applications, Marriott reiterated that the Purchase Agreement simply provided for the purchase by HRPT of the land and building for the Bedford Court facility, while operational responsibility remained vested in MSLS, as agent of HMC, pursuant to the Sublease. Further, it contended that the \u201cpotential payment of an additional $1 million to HMC simply reflects the increased value of the property HRPT acquired if 16 CCF beds are added to the 43 CON-exempt CCF beds already operational at Bedford Court.\u201d Marriott explained that, under the Lease, MSLS\u2019s rental payments for the facility are based on a percentage of its operating revenues. Consequently, \u201c[i]f the number of licensed beds at the facility increases, MSLS\u2019s rental payments to its new landlord, HRPT, will also increase.\u201d Marriott concluded: \u201cConsistent with the sale-leaseback nature of the HMC-HRPT transaction, if the anticipated rental payments to HRPT increase, then the purchase price paid to HMC should also increase.... [HRPT] has not bought and will not operate nursing home beds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In the footnote addressing this issue, the Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">Following the reorganization ... Host and HMC sold fourteen senior living services properties to Health and Retirement Properties Trust (HRPT), an independent real estate investment trust unrelated to any of the Marriott companies. That sale did not involve the Brighton Gardens project. It had no practical effect on Bedford Court, which continues to be operated by MSLS pursuant to a 40 year operating lease. The HRPT purchase of Bedford Court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>no effect on the operating lease or MSLS\u2019s right to operate Bedford Court. In addition, even though HMC transferred its property interest in Bedford Court to HRPT, it retained a leasehold interest in the facility with respect to the 16 beds sought for Bedford Court in this review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">InterCare, ... brought a motion to dedocket the Marriott applications in light of the sales to HRPT described above. The Commission denies this motion. Those sales have no effect on the HMC proposals. Brighton Gardens was not a subject of this sale. Although Bedford Court was sold to HRPT, its application is unaffected. HMC will become the licensed operator of the beds at both facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In its brief submitted to this Court, the Commission points out that because no CON existed at the time of the sale-leaseback transfer, Marriott\u2019s business transaction could not have violated COMAR 10.24.01.09D. It asserts: \u201cThe clear language of the regulation only applies to a transfer of a CON, not of a potential CON.\u201d The Commission reasons that because the challenged transaction occurred before Marriott received the CON, no CON was transferred. Our problem with this argument is that this was not the basis for the Commission\u2019s decision. As we pointed out earlier, we may only uphold an agency\u2019s decision if \u201cit is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and <em>for the reasons stated by the agency. </em>\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of Am., </em>298 Md. at 679, 472 A.2d 62 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Alternatively, the Commission argues that no matter what financial transactions took place concerning the Bedford Court facility, the dispositive factor was \u201cthe identity, both before and after the sale transaction, of the personnel operating the facility.\u201d To support its argument, the Commission relies on <em>Loveman, supra, </em>349 Md. 560, 709 A.2d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">There, Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc. (\u201cCNH\u201d) and the Commission challenged a circuit court ruling that certain \u201cbed rights\u201d belonged to the landlord, Mr. Loveman, who was the original operator and licensee of the nursing home. He had not operated the facility since 1981, however, when he had to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>surrender his nursing home administrator\u2019s license due to a medicaid fraud conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 564, 709 A.2d 749. Ultimately, CNH became the operator and licensee, and Mr. Loveman was merely the owner of the building \u201chousing the nursing home operation and CNH\u2019s landlord.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564, 709 A.2d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The Commission had determined that the right to seek Commission approval regarding the CCF beds at the nursing home belonged to CNH as the lessee and operator of the facility, rather than to Mr. Loveman as the \u201cowner of the bricks and mortar.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566, 709 A.2d 749. Mr. Loveman disagreed. He argued that \u201cthe bed rights in question, which [were] derived from the right to operate a health care project as provided in a CON or exemption, run with the land because the physical facility itself was exempted from obtaining a CON when the new statutory scheme was enacted____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566, 709 A.2d 749. The exemption provided that facilities that were \u201c \u2018completed and in operation on or before June 1, 1978,\u2019 \u201d were not required to obtain a CON. <em>Id. </em>at 575, 709 A.2d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The Court rejected the landlord\u2019s position. It concluded that the statutory exemption does not create a real property right. <em>Id. </em>at 580, 709 A.2d 749. Writing for the Court, Judge Cathell explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">The exemption is personal to the person or health care operator that operated the health care project prior to 1978 and, if not waived or abandoned, may continue to apply to the specific health care project so long as it remains in operation. That exemption remains with the project and its operator and does not run with the specific land upon which the project may have operated prior to 1978 or with the \u201cbricks and mortar\u201d of the building itself. Furthermore, the exemption may be waived when the person or operator of the health care project becomes otherwise unqualified to hold a license by reason of criminal convictions for medicaid fraud or other applicable convictions, when he acquiesces in the obtainment of a CON by subsequent operators for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>operation of the project, or when, he ceases to operate the health care project for a significant period of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 586, 709 A.2d 749 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Of significance here, the Court also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">\u201cIf ... the exemption right attaches to the physical building, this would defeat not only the Commission\u2019s function, but the Act\u2019s purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">For us to find for ... [Mr. Loveman] would divest the Commission of its power to implement the SHP, thwart the intention of the legislature, and effectively grant appellee a monopoly as to ninety-eight beds of needed capacity forever, regardless of whether appellee used them and regardless of the need of the community. This cannot be what the General Assembly intended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 585, 709 A.2d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">If the exemption from the CON requirement is personalty, it follows that the CON itself is also personalty, not realty. Moreover, as in <em>Loveman, </em>the Commission essentially determined that HRPT was merely the landlord, not the operator of Bedford Court. After scrutinizing the transaction, it determined that, notwithstanding the sale of the building to HRPT, the personnel responsible for the operation of the facility remained unchanged. That was the key to its decision. The Commission considered it dispositive that HRPT had no rights in relation to the operation of the 16 CCF beds. Consequently, it found that there was no sale of a CON and thus no violation of COMAR 10.24.01.09D.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">In reaching our conclusion, we are mindful that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">The General Assembly gave the Commission the power to regulate the placement of health care projects, the types of services offered, and the number of persons to be served in an attempt to reduce the number of unused or unuseful projects throughout the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-12\"><em>Loveman, </em>349 Md. at 580, 709 A.2d 749. Like the Commission, we do not \u201cview the transfer regulations as prohibiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>corporate affiliation or acquisition transactions <em>per se\u201d </em>because that \u201cwould render the \u2018CON process [too] inflexible in the current health care business climate.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">We defer to the Commission\u2019s expertise and affirm the approval of Marriott\u2019s CON applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-5\">.

In view of appellant\u2019s many complaints regarding the deficiencies in the Commission\u2019s opinion, we shall list here, as briefly as possible, the many standards, rules, and criteria that the Commission considered and addressed in its Revised Decision. The Commission considered the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">In Section III(A), the Commission considered the various proposals in \u201cRelationship to Existing Plans.\u201d This included analysis under COMAR 10.24.01.07H(2)(a) \u2014 The State Health Plan. The SHP, in turn, included analysis of the provisions for Long Term Care Services under COMAR 10.24.08.05F, entitled \"Certificate of Need Approval Rules: Nursing Homes,\u201d and COMAR 10.24.08.06A, pertaining to Nursing Home Standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">COMAR 10.24.08.05F had six subparts that the Commission considered. These were:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">10.24.08.05F(1) \u2014 Maximum Need;</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">10.24.08.05F(2) \u2014 Occupancy;</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">10.24.08.05F(3) \u2014 Medical Assistance;</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">10.24.08.05F(4) \u2014 Expansion;</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">10.24.08.05F(5) \u2014 Multiple Bed Rooms;</p>\n<p id=\"b229-16\">10.24.08.05F(6) \u2014 Domiciliary Care.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-17\">Additionally, COMAR 10.24.08.06A had thirteen subparts, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-18\">10.24.08.06A(1) \u2014 Care For Mentally Impaired Persons;</p>\n<p id=\"b229-19\">10.24.08,06A(2) \u2014 Community Based Services</p>\n<p id=\"b229-20\">10.24.08.06A(3) \u2014 Non-elderly Residents;</p>\n<p id=\"b229-21\">10.24.08.06A(4) \u2014 Medicaid Access;</p>\n<p id=\"b229-22\">10.24.08.06A(5) \u2014 Public Water;</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>10.24.08.06A(6) \u2014 Geographic Proximity;</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">10.24.08.06A(7) \u2014 Facility and Unit Design;</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">10.24.08.06A(8) \u2014 Accreditation and Certification;</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">10.24.08 06A(9) \u2014 Appropriate Living Environment;</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">10.24.08.06A(10) \u2014 Transfer and Referral;</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">10.24.08.06A(11) \u2014 Public Information and Protection;</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">10.24.08.06A(12) \u2014 Research;</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">10.24.08.06A(13) \u2014 Disclosure</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">Further, the Commission considered COMAR 10.24.08.05E, entitled \"Certificate of Need Preference Rule \u2014 Nursing Homes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">In Section III(B), the Commission addressed the review criteria set forth in 10.24.01.07H(2)(b)-(h), which we previously listed on page 195, <em>supra. </em>Two of these criteria included several more factors. Specifically, for the \"more effective alternative\u201d analysis under COMAR 10.24.01.07H(2)(c), the Commission considered seven additional factors: Community \u2014 based services for which the SHP finds need; service to underserved populations; community and professional support/opposition; site control; zoning; facility design with respect to privacy and efficiency; use of currently available resources. With regard to the analysis of \"Impact\u201d under COMAR 10.24.01.07H(2)(e), the Commission considered three more factors: need; service to the underserved; and respite and domiciliary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-15\">The Commission also considered the local Department's recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b230-16\">. We note that the Commission determined that InterCare\u2019s proposal was only partially consistent with the community-based services standard, COMAR 10.24.08.06A(2), because of the questionable financial feasibility of its proposed services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\">. The record does not include a transcript of the arguments before the circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\">. We should not. be understood to approve of a circuit court\u2019s failure to consider the issues raised by a party on judicial review of an agency\u2019s decision. Nor do we suggest that we are without authority to remand to the circuit court to undertake such a review. In this case, however, we are satisfied that the circuit court\u2019s review was not so deficient or inadequate as to compel us to remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b240-6\">. S.G. \u00a7 10-222(h) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">In a proceeding under this section, the court may:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if a substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">(i) is unconstitutional;</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker;</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</p>\n<p id=\"b240-16\">(vi) is arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\">. We note that appellant included in the Record Extract only three pages of the transcript from this hearing. In the Appendix to the Commission's brief, it included the entire 145-page transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b248-7\">. We note that COMAR 10.24.01.07H(2)(b) specifically pertains to \"need\u201d and arguably overlaps with the need factor as considered by the Commission in the context of the impact criterion. COMAR 10.24.01,07H(2)(b) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The need of the population served or to be served. For purposes of determining consistency, the Commission consideration will include the need analysis (if any) included in the State Health Plan, and the special needs of low income persons, racial and ethnic minorities, women, handicapped persons, residents in a county in which a proposed medical service does not exist, and other groups which may be underserved and the extent to which groups which traditionally have experienced difficulties in obtaining equal access to health services will have access to or be impacted on by the proposed project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\">. Throughout the proceedings, it appears that little distinction was made between the Carriage Hill entities, which are separate corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>tions. The two other Carriage Hill corporations are referred to as Carriage Hill \u2014 Silver Spring and Carriage Hill \u2014 Bethesda. CHCJ itself did not operate those facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In its legal memorandum submitted below, CHCJ\u2019s counsel explained that CHCJ is a corporation whose stock is owned by the same family that owns the stock of Medical Facilities, Inc.; that corporation apparently is the owner of the two other Carriage Hill nursing home facilities in the County. CHCJ\u2019s own witness seemed to blend CHCJ and the two other Carriage Hill facilities. Flora Luckett, the Chief Executive Officer for CHCJ and director of operations for the \"Carriage Hill facilities,\u201d testified as follows on November 18, 1993:</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">[Counsel for InterCare]: <em>Carriage Hill operates two other nursing homes in Montgomery County; is that correct?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">[Ms. Luckett]: <em>Yes, they do.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">[Counsel for InterCare]: And those are, this may not be the official name but I think it\u2019s fair to refer to them as Carriage Hill \u2014 Silver Spring and Carriage Hill \u2014 Bethesda; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">[Ms. Luckett]: That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b251-6\"><em>. </em>Appellant also argues that the record did not contain evidence that 46 of its CCF beds were unused or that it was feasible to relocate them. Because appellant has repeatedly represented that it is not contesting factual findings, and concedes that the substantial evidence standard is not implicated here, we decline to consider this assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b259-10\">. COMAR 10.24.01.071(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">If a local health planning agency makes a recommendation on a specific project, and the Commission makes a different decision than that recommended by the local health planning agency, the Commission shall make a written, detailed explanation as to the basis for the difference to the local health planning agency.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b264-7\">.
