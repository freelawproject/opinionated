(\u201cBlum\u201d or the \u201cBroker\u201d), appellee and cross-appellant, against Allen Bruce Holzman and his wife, Terry Lee Holzman (the \u201cHolz-mans\u201d or the \u201cSellers\u201d), appellants and cross-appellees. Blum sought to recover a real estate broker\u2019s commission allegedly owed pursuant to a Listing Agreement executed by the parties for the sale of appellants\u2019 residence. Following a bench trial, the court found appellants liable to the Broker for a commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>sion of $37,600. In addition, the court awarded the Broker the sum of $12,408 as a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. Thereafter, pursuant to appellants\u2019 motion to alter or amend the judgment, the court reduced the judgment of $50,008.00 by the amount of $21,500, which was equal to the commission paid to the Broker in connection with the subsequent sale of the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">On appeal, appellants present the following questions for our review, which we have reformulated:</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">I. Did the circuit court err in determining that, pursuant to the Agreement, Blum was entitled to a commission even though a contract of sale for the Property did not proceed to settlement?</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">II. Did the circuit court err in concluding that the contract of sale for the Property, which provided that the buyers were to pay the Broker\u2019s commission, did not relieve the Sellers of their obligation to Blum under the Agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">III. Did the circuit court err in concluding that the Broker was entitled to a commission when Blum breached its fiduciary duty and the Broker\u2019s conduct constituted estoppel?</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">IY. Did the circuit court err in its award of attorney\u2019s fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Pertinent to its cross-appeal, Blum asks the following question, which we have also rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-11\">Did the trial court err in reducing the judgment by the amount of the commission earned by the Broker in connection with a subsequent contract of sale for the Property?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">For the reasons that follow, we perceive error only with respect to the amount of the attorney\u2019s fees awarded to Blum. Therefore, we shall affirm the portion of the judgment concerning the commission, vacate the portion of the judgment regarding the attorney\u2019s fees, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Appellants were the owners of 12500 Fellowship Court (the \u201cProperty\u201d), an exclusive, three-story brick house containing eight bedrooms, nine full baths, three half baths, and a pool, located on several acres of land in an area of Baltimore County known as Worthington Club Estates. Appellants were interested in selling the Property and, on January 28, 1996, they met with Hope Berman, a real estate agent associated with Blum, and Harry Blum, the president of appellee, at the Property. During that visit, appellee, by Mr. Blum, and appellants executed a Listing Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) for the residence, which was effective for a six month term.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The Agreement, a standard form \u201cExclusive Right to Sell Listing Contract,\u201d provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">Owner agrees to pay Broker a fee for services rendered in the amount set forth below (the \u201cfee\u201d) (a) if during the term of this Contract, or any extension, thereof: (i) Broker produces a customer to purchase the Property at the listing price and on the terms herein or at such other price or on such other terms as shall be accepted by Owner or agreed upon in writing between Owner and Broker (the \u201cauthorized price\u201d); or (ii) Owner shall enter into a written agreement to sell, exchange, convey or transfer the Property to any person or entity whether such person or entity shall have been procured by the Broker, by Owner, or by any other person or entity, in which event Owner shall within seventy-two (72) hours thereof furnish Broker a copy of such written agreement procured by anyone other than Broker; or (b) if, during the period of <em>six (6) </em>months following the expiration or termination of this Contract, Owner shall enter into a written agreement to sell, exchange, convey, or transfer the Property to any person or entity which, with the knowledge of Owner or any agent of Owner, inspected or made inquiry about the Property or negotiated to purchase or exchange the Property during the term of this Contract or extension thereof ... except that Owner shall have no obligation to pay the fee to Broker if the Property is sold or exchanged by any other licensed real estate broker following the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>expiration of this Contract or any extension thereof or following the termination of this Contract as herein provided, unless such termination by Owner shall have been made for the purpose of avoiding the obligation of the Owner to pay the fee to Broker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">If Broker prevails in any court action brought to obtain payment of the fee, Broker shall also be entitled to recover in such action his/her reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and court costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The Property was initially listed for sale on January 23, 1996 at a price of $1.95 million. Later, the price was reduced to $1,650,000. Under the Agreement, the Broker\u2019s commission was to be calculated in the following way: six percent of the first $300,000 of the selling price, five percent of the second $300,000, and four percent of the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">On July 19, 1996, the Agreement was extended until September 30, 1996; the Holzmans, Mr. Blum, and Ms. Berman signed the extension. On August 9, 1996, appellants received a letter of intent from Gil Stern and his wife, Ellen (the \u201cSterns\u201d), offering $600,000 for the Property. On August 12, 1996, Heros Noravian and his wife, Dr. Emma Zargarian (the \u201cNoravians\u201d or the \u201cBuyers\u201d), submitted a letter of intent, offering a purchase price of $715,000 and a deposit of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Appellants negotiated with the Noravians, and appellee then prepared the residential contract of sale (\u201cthe Noravian contract\u201d). On August 20, 1996, while appellants \u201cwere still in negotiation with the Noravians\u201d, the Broker presented appellants with a revised offer from the Sterns in the amount of $850,000. Nevertheless, appellants and the Buyers executed the Noravian contract on August 25, 1996. The record does not reflect why the Holzmans proceeded with the Noravian contract after they learned of the increased offer from the Sterns.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">On the advice of their attorney, appellants included a default provision in the Noravian contract which provided that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>in the event of a breach by the Sellers, the Buyers\u2019 sole remedy would be limited to a refund of their deposit. The Noravian contract also contained a handwritten addendum (the \u201cAddendum\u201d) that provided, in part: \u201c2. It is understood and agreed that buyers are to pay [the Broker\u2019s] real estate commission fee and also pay all settlement fees____\u201d Because there was no cooperating agent for the Noravian contract, any commission due under the Agreement was payable solely to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">After appellants executed the Noravian contract, they decided to pursue the Sterns\u2019 offer, relying on the advice of counsel. Accordingly, on August 26,1996, just one day after signing the Noravian contract, appellants canceled it. On the same day, appellants notified appellee and Ms. Berman of their decision, via a signed facsimile letter, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">We have decided not to make full settlement of our contract with Emma Zargarian and Hero[s] Noravian (the Buyers) accepted on August 25, 1996, based on the Default paragraph (paragraph number 17).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">Please inform the Buyers of this action immediately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">Please return any and all deposit money which the Buyers have forwarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">The Holzmans also sent a second letter to appellee, by facsimile, on August 26,1996, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">Base[d] on our letter of August 26,1996, faxed to you today, please inform all Brokers and Agents that 12500 Fellowship Court is available for sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">Ms. Berman continued to list the Property for sale after receiving the facsimile letters from appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">Thereafter, on October 16, 1996, appellants executed a contract of sale with the Stems (the \u201cStern contract\u201d). It contained a provision to pay the real estate commissions to appellee and Long &amp; Foster, the Stems\u2019 real estate agent, calculated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Consequently, the commission due under the Stern contract was to be divided evenly between appellee and Long <em>&amp; </em>Foster.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>On November 7, 1996, appellee filed a complaint in the circuit court, claiming that appellants defaulted on the Noravi-an contract and owed the Broker the real estate commission. Appellee alleged that appellants had \u201cfailed to perform their obligation to pay the ... fee,\u201d and breached \u201cthe Exclusive Right to Sell listing contract and/or the Residential Contract of Sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">The matter proceeded to trial on February 10,1998. At the proceeding, appellee presented testimony from Ms. Berman and Mr. Blum.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Ms. Berman testified that, based on the sales price of $715,000 for the Noravian contract, the Broker\u2019s commission was $37,600. She conceded that she \u201cnever told\u201d the Holz-mans that they were liable for payment of the commission under the Noravian contract. Furthermore, she testified that, in her seven years as a real estate agent, she had never received a commission for a sale that did not proceed to settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In his testimony, Mr. Blum acknowledged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\"><em>I had a fiduciary relationship to the </em>Holzmans, my listing contract until that time ran out, I was working for them. We would bring all the offers regardless of whether there was a contract in force or not, we would bring all letters of intent regardless of whether there is a contract or not. That\u2019s our job. <em>And my relationship was to do the best that we could for Mr. and Mrs. Holzman.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">(Emphasis added). Nevertheless, Mr. Blum acknowledged that, when the Holzmans decided to pursue the Sterns\u2019 offer, he did not advise them about their obligation to pay the commission under the Noravian contract. Indeed, Mr. Blum testified that he was \u201cadvised by ... [counsel] not to say anything to the Holzmans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">With respect to the terms of the Agreement, Mr. Blum explained that the Agreement was read aloud to appellants before it was signed. Although Mr. Blum could not recall whether the Holzmans asked any questions concerning the Agreement, he maintained that the Agreement \u201cwasn\u2019t unfa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>miliar to Mr. Holzman. He had signed one previously.... With another agency.\u201d When appellants\u2019 counsel inquired what form was used by the other agent, Mr. Blum said: \u201cI take for granted they used the same form we did. I don\u2019t know, I have never seen one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In the defense case, Mr. Holzman stated that, in connection with the Agreement, Mr. Blum \u201ctold [him] that commissions were paid upon settlement.\u201d Moreover, Mr. Holzman disputed Mr. Blum\u2019s contention that the Agreement had been read aloud. Mr. Holzman averred: \u201cHe [Mr. Blum] handed it [the Agreement] to me, explained the commissions again were paid upon settlement. And asked me to read it over and sign it.\u201d With regard to the initial offers from the Noravians and the Sterns, Mr. Holzman claimed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">They [Ms. Berman and Mr. Blum] basically told us that they were the best offers available. They indicated that they could not provide us with better offers, that that\u2019s the value of the property, that they also discussed prior dealings that they had with the Sterns. And told us that we had to sign that within, right then and there and without much choice at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Concerning the Stern contract, Mr. Holzman indicated that the parties were planning to settle \u201cwithin a week\u201d of trial; he explained that the parties had not yet settled because they were waiting for Mr. Blum to provide the release from the Buyers or the canceled check, showing that they had received the refund for their deposit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">At the conclusion of the trial, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">The court finds the following facts have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. [Appellants] entered into an exclusive right to sell listing contract on January 23,1996 with [appellee]. This contract was extended in July 1996 and was in effect up till sometime in September of 1996. The contract provides that the Holzmans will have to pay a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>commission to ... [appellee] in the amount listed in the contract, 6% of the first $300,000, 5% of the next $300,000, and then 4% of above and beyond that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-4\">The contract provides that the Holzman\u2019s [sic] shall have to pay this commission if they enter into a written agreement to sell the property to any person during the term of this exclusive agreement listing agreement. A contract was entered into ... during the time that the exclusive right to sell contract was in effect. The contract selling price was $715,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">Apparently, [appellants] took the time to consult with a lawyer prior to signing this contract [of sale]. And unfortunately they didn\u2019t take the time, or there has been no testimony that they took the time to consult with a lawyer prior to signing the exclusive right to sell listing contract, which they signed. Had they consulted with a lawyer the lawyer would have told them that it\u2019s unambiguous, that this exclusive right to sell listing contract ... which by the way this court recognizes, quite frankly, as the standard listing contract if you deal with a multiple listing agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">The lawyer would have told [appellants] that if you enter into a contract during the term of this listing agreement you are obligated to pay a commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">Now, the contract [of sale] that ... [appellants] signed, because they chose to sign it, provided a provision in it that if they defaulted on the contract between themselves and ... [the] Noravian[s] the only remedy the ... Noravians would have would be the return of the $10,000 deposit, which they made. This is not a contract between [appellants] and [appellee] .... [the Broker] isn\u2019t a part of that contract. They are not parties to that contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">Nowhere in this does it say anything about doing away with the agreement, the contract that they made to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>commission. Nowhere, no mention of it, and as a practical matter this contract ... is not a contract in which they could have written in there about doing away with their obligation to pay the commission unless ... [appellee] was a party to the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">They are not listed anywhere here. They didn\u2019t sign this. They didn\u2019t have to agree to anything. They don\u2019t have to keep reminding [appellants], oh, by the way, you know, you signed a contract with us and ... you owe us money. It\u2019s plain. He owes the money. Whether or not this property will ever settle in regard to the ... Sterns, is a matter of mere speculation....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">Apparently, it hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s now February 10, 1998 and it hadn\u2019t settled as of this minute. It will be an interesting question when and if it settles what [appellee] would be entitled to based on the decision that the court will make today. That\u2019s an interesting legal question. But this is easy. I mean, quite frankly, this isn\u2019t hard legally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">The court orders that judgment be entered in favor of [appellee] against [appellant] in the amount of $37,600. Plus attorney\u2019s fees. The testimony that was given is that it is a one-third contingency. Now, the contract that was entered into calls for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Is that a reasonable fee? One-third of $37,600. That clearly is the price that ... [the Broker] is going to have to pay the attorney. Is that amount $12,408 unreasonable? I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">I think it\u2019s a reasonable arrangement to make with an attorney. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s out of the ordinary.... So, the bottom line is, the Clerk is instructed to enter judgment in favor of [appellee] against [appellants] for $50,008____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">On February 12, 1998, two days after trial, appellants and the Sterns settled on the Property. As a result, appellee received a commission of $21,500.00. Accordingly, appellants filed a revisory motion, asking the court to reduce the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>ment by the amount of the commission that appellee actually recovered. In its opposition, the Broker contended that it was entitled to two commissions. The following colloquy at the motion hearing is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: We don\u2019t believe they\u2019re entitled to the credit. The listing contract doesn\u2019t require a fee when the property is sold. It requires a fee when a contract is entered into. The second contract was covered by the listing agreement and we\u2019re entitled to a fee for both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">THE COURT: Under what theory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">Let\u2019s say there was a contract for $100,000 and that contract didn\u2019t go through, and the property was then sold for $100,000 to somebody else. The property is worth $100,000. He gets commissions on both hundred thousand dollars?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, the way that the listing agreement read, it\u2019s a listing producing a buyer. Not on consummation of the settlement, but making the contract itself. It says that settlement is not a condition precedent to compensation due to the broker.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Thereafter, the court determined that appellants were entitled to a credit of $21,500, representing the amount paid to appellee as a commission for the Stem contract. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">THE COURT: Okay. The Court rales that ... [appellant] is to be given credit against the judgment that I ordered in the amount of $50,008....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-12\">I am not reducing the judgment. I think the judgment I imposed \u2014 I\u2019ve not been convinced that I made a mistake in ordering the judgment that I ordered. I think it was correct. I do think that ... [appellant] gets credit towards that judgment of $21,500 that has been paid as commission to [appellee] for the sale of this property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>We shall include additional facts in our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">I. The Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Appellants contend that settlement on the Noravian contract was a condition precedent to appellee\u2019s entitlement to a commission. Appellants focus on the following language of the Agreement concerning commissions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">Owner agrees to pay Broker a fee ... if during the term of this Contract, or any extension thereof ... Broker produces a customer to purchase the Property at the listing price and on the terms herein or at such other price or on such other terms as shall be accepted by Owner or agreed upon in writing between Owner and Broker____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Appellants posit that the Noravian offer was for a purchase price substantially below the listed sales price, and the Noravi-an contract was not finalized. Therefore, they claim it was not a contract \u201cat such other price or on such other terms as shall be accepted by the owner.\u201d Moreover, appellants point out that, if we were to construe the Agreement in accordance with appellee\u2019s position, the Broker would theoretically be entitled to an unlimited number of commissions, so long as the sale was not consummated; the mere signing of a contract of sale would generate the right to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Appellants also contend that it is unfair to base liability upon the mere execution of the Noravian contract, because a number of contingencies might have led to cancellation of the Noravian contract, including the Buyers\u2019 inability to obtain financing or their dissatisfaction with the inspection of the Property. Although the Noravian contract included certain contingencies, none of them are implicated here. For example,. the Buyers\u2019 performance was conditioned upon their satisfaction with the level of radon gas, the quality of the sewage disposal system, and the well water yield. But the Buyers never terminated the contract. Therefore, we need not decide here whether appellants would have been liable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>the Broker for the fee if the Buyers had canceled the contract pursuant to a contractual contingency.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Appellee maintains that the Agreement is clear and unambiguous and, therefore, its provisions control. Under the terms of the Agreement, appellee asserts that appellants\u2019 obligation to pay the commission was triggered when the Holzmans signed the Noravian contract; the right to the commission was not dependent upon consummation of the sale. Moreover, the Broker argues that the Holzmans may not elect to default on the Noravian contract and \u201cthen use their breach offensively as a weapon against [appellee\u2019s] contractual right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Preliminarily, we observe that because the Agreement addressed how commissions are earned, the provisions of Md.Code (1974,1996 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 14-105 of the Real Property Article (\u201cR.P.\u201d), do not apply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>DeFranceaux Realty Group, Inc. v.

Rather, to determine whether the Broker was entitled to a commission in connection with the Noravian contract, we must focus on the terms of the Agreement. <em>DeFranceaux, </em>283 Md. at 614, 391 A.2d 1209 (looking to the contract between the parties to determine \u201cthe right of the broker to receive commissions\u201d); <em>W.C.

Guild, Inc., </em>105 Md.App. 332, 355, 659 A.2d 398 (1995). To ascertain the parties\u2019 intention, we look to the language of the contract. <em>General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Daniels, </em>303 Md. 254, 261, 492 A.2d 1306 (1985); <em>Nicholson Air, </em>120 Md.App. at 63, 706 A.2d 124; <em>Scarlett Harbor, </em>109 Md.App. at 291, 674 A.2d 106; <em>Faw, Casson &amp; Co. v.

If the terms of the contract are clear, we presume \u201cthe parties intended what they expressed, even if the expression differs from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>parties\u2019 intentions at the time they created the contract.\u201d <em>Nicholson Air, </em>120 Md.App. at 63, 706 A.2d 124; <em>see Roged, Inc. v. Paglee, </em>280 Md. 248, 254, 372 A.2d 1059 (1977); <em>Scarlett Harbor, </em>109 Md.App. at 291, 674 A.2d 106; <em>McIntyre, </em>105 Md.App. at 355, 659 A.2d 398; <em>Bernstein v.

Of particular significance here, we may not \u201crewrite the terms of the contract or draw a new one ... merely to avoid hardship or because one party has become dissatisfied with its provisions.\u201d <em>Fultz v. Shaffer, </em>111 Md.App. 278, 298, 681 A.2d 568 (1996) (citations omitted); <em>see Scarlett Harbor, </em>109 Md.App. at 253, 674 A.2d 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The trial court determined that the Agreement was unambiguous, and that it obligated the Holzmans to pay the fee because they entered into a written agreement to sell the Property during the term of the Agreement. The \u201cdetermination of ambiguity is one of law, not fact, and that determination is subject to <em>de novo </em>review by an appellate court.\u201d <em>Calomiris, </em>353 Md. at 434, 727 A.2d 358. In our view, the trial court was legally correct. The terms of the Agreement and the provisions of the Noravian contract refute appellants\u2019 argument that settlement was a condition precedent to the Broker\u2019s contractual right to a commission. <em>See generally Chirichella v. Erwin, 270 </em>Md. 178, 182, 310 A.2d 555 (1973) (recognizing that the determination of what constitutes a condition precedent if a question of \u201cconstruction dependent on the intent of the parties to be gathered from the words they have employed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Of significance to us, the Noravian contract expressly provided that appellee\u2019s commission was not contingent upon settlement. Indeed, paragraph 25 stated: \u201cAll parties irrevocably instruct the settlement agent to collect a fee or compensation and disburse same according to the terms and conditions provided in the listing agreement---- <em>Settlement </em>shall not be a condition precedent to payment of compensation.\u201d (Emphasis added). To be sure, appellants could have negotiated for a provision in the Agreement that conditioned pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>ment of the commission upon settlement. But, it is not our function to rewrite the Agreement between parties who had ample ability to bargain for contract terms that would have been more favorable to their respective interests. <em>Leeth, </em>283 Md. at 617, 391 A.2d 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Moreover, the authorities upon which appellants rely to support their position are inapposite. For example, in <em>De-Franceaux Realty Group, Inc., supra, </em>283 Md. 611, 391 A.2d 1209, the contract of sale provided that the brokers would receive their commission \u201cfrom the proceeds of the sale.\u201d <em>Leeth, </em>283 Md. at 613, 391 A.2d 1209. Because the sale never occurred, the sellers sued for specific performance. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, the seller and buyer settled the suit for specific performance. <em>Id. </em>Subsequently, the brokers brought an action against the sellers, claiming that they were entitled to their commission because the sellers\u2019 suit wrongfully interfered with the brokers\u2019 right to a commission. <em>Id. </em>The Court noted that, because there was an agreement concerning the brokers\u2019 entitlement to a commission, the agreement controlled. <em>Id. </em>at 614, 391 A.2d 1209. Under the terms of the agreement, settlement was a condition precedent to the brokers\u2019s right to a commission. <em>Id. </em>at 617-18, 391 A.2d 1209. As the condition precedent was not satisfied, the Court concluded that \u201cthe brokers ... had no contractual right to a commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 391 A.2d 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Appellants ground their entire argument on one sentence in <em>Leeth, </em>which provides: \u201cWe have consistently held that when the term \u2018sale\u2019 is used in a contract of this type, it refers to a completed settlement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617, 391 A.2d 1209 (citations omitted). This pronouncement was derived, in part, from <em>Wyand v. Patterson Agency, Inc., </em>271 Md. 617, 620, 319 A.2d 308 (1974), in which the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">Long ago this Court decided that where one employed a real estate broker under an agreement that the broker would be entitled to a commission if there were a \u201csale\u201d of the property, or if the property were \u201csold,\u201d or if the broker \u201cprocured a purchaser,\u201d or similar language, <em>and the agreement did not more specifically set forth when or at what </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>stage in the sale process the right to a commission accrued, </em>a fully consummated sale had to take place before the broker was entitled to a commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In this case, the Agreement did not state that the commission was to be paid from the \u201cproceeds of the sale.\u201d Rather, it required payment of the fee if the Sellers executed \u201ca written agreement to sell\u201d the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\"><em>Berman v. Hall, supra, </em>275 Md. 434, 340 A.2d 251 (1975), is also readily distinguishable from the present case, because the contract of sale at issue there expressly conditioned the broker\u2019s right to a commission on settlement. Specifically, the contract provided that the commission was <em>\u201cdue and payable upon the settlement of </em>... <em>[the] </em>Contract.\u201d <em>Berman, </em>275 Md. at 435, 340 A.2d 251. Settlement never occurred because, after executing the contract of sale, the sellers and buyers released each other from any obligations arising out of the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 435-36, 340 A.2d 251. The broker, who was not a party to the release, then sought to recover his full commission. <em>Id. </em>at 436, 340 A.2d 251. Relying on R.P. \u00a7 14-105, he claimed that his commission was due upon the execution of the contract of sale. <em>Id. </em>at 436-37, 340 A.2d 251. The Court rejected the broker\u2019s argument, noting that because the parties\u2019 contract addressed the entitlement to a commission, the agreement controlled. <em>Id. </em>at 437, 340 A.2d 251. Moreover, the operative language of the contract provided that the broker\u2019s right to the commission was contingent upon settlement. <em>Id. </em>at 440, 340 A.2d 251. As that condition was not met, the Court concluded that no commission was due. <em>Id. </em>at 441, 340 A.2d 251. <em>See also Chasanow v. Willcox, </em>220 Md. 171, 176, 151 A.2d 748 (1959)(stating that when the parties\u2019 agreement addresses \u201cthe time of payment, source and amount of compensation ... [due the broker], the statute has no bearing on the decision of ... [the] ease.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\"><em>County Investment Corp. v. Hollander, </em>265 Md. 448, 290 A.2d 517 (1972), also is of no help to appellants. In that case, two real estate brokers filed suit to recover their commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>when they located a tenant who entered into a binding lease agreement for a twenty year term. <em>Id. </em>at 448-49, 290 A.2d 517. Pursuant to the commission agreement, the brokers were given the option to receive an immediate commission of <em>3% </em>of the total amount of the lease payments, or <em>5% </em>of the total amount of the lease, payable in monthly installments. <em>Id. </em>at 449, 290 A.2d 517. The brokers opted for the monthly commission payments and regularly received their commission for a period of eleven years. <em>Id. </em>at 450-51, 290 A.2d 517. Then, the lessee defaulted and the lessor failed to make the remaining commission payments. As a result, the brokers filed suit. The Court held that they were entitled to recover their commission because all the conditions precedent were satisfied, notwithstanding the lessee\u2019s subsequent default. Looking to the language of the commission agreement, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">Once ... [the brokers] procured a tenant for ... [the lessor] and a lease was entered into, the total commission was then earned by the brokers. The documents which discuss the commission in no way alter this fact; instead they simply set out the time for effectuating payment. We hold that appellees are entitled to the commission for the remainder of the twenty year lease term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 453, 290 A.2d 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">In this case, on August 20, 1996, the Broker presented the Holzmans with the Stems\u2019 revised offer, for a purchase price higher than the Noravians\u2019 offer. Nevertheless, on August 25, 1996, the Holzmans executed the Noravian contract. In contrast to <em>Leeth and Berman, </em>the liability for the commission was not contingent upon settlement. Thus, when the Holz-mans and the Noravians signed the contract of sale on August 25, 1996, appellants became obligated under the Agreement to pay the Broker\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">What the Court said in <em>Borowski v. Meyers, </em>195 Md. 226, 72 A.2d 701 (1950), resonates here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">[ W]e hold that where a broker is employed ... the broker is entitled to his commission on performing the service [in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>accordance with the parties\u2019 agreement] even though there is a voluntary failure of the owner to complete the transaction. ... [W]here the broker has fully performed his part of the contract ... he cannot be deprived of his commission by the fact that the sale has failed ... on account of the inability or unwarranted refusal of the principal to consummate the sale according to the prescribed terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 231, 72 A.2d 701 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">II. The Addendum</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Appellants contend that, based on the Addendum to the Noravian contract, the Buyers are responsible for the unpaid commission. Therefore, appellants argue that the action against them should have been dismissed, as appellee failed to sue the offending party.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Appellants\u2019 argument is premised on their contention that the Addendum constituted a modification to the Agreement. They insist that appellee\u2019s knowledge of the Addendum, together with the fact that the provision was intended to benefit the Broker, was sufficient to bind appellee as a third party beneficiary. Moreover, the Holzmans posit that if appellee\u2019s claim of entitlement to the commission is based upon the Noravian contract, then appellee must acknowledge the entire contract, including the Addendum. Consequently, they maintain that the Noravians, not appellants, are responsible for the Broker\u2019s fee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Ordinarily,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-10\">a third party beneficiary contract arises when two parties enter into an agreement with the intent to confer a direct benefit on a third party, allowing the third party to sue on the contract despite the lack of privity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-11\"><em>Flaherty v. Weinberg, </em>303 Md. 116, 125, 492 A.2d 618 (1985). Appellee may well have been a third party beneficiary of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Addendum, because the performance by the Noravians of the promise to pay the commission would have satisfied appellants\u2019 obligation to the Broker. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 302(1) (1979). Nevertheless, under the facts attendant here, appellee was not required to pursue the Buyers for the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Although the Noravian contract provided that the Noravians would pay appellee\u2019s fee, the Holzmans promised to pay the Broker\u2019s commission under the terms of the Agreement. <em>See Homa v. Friendly Mobile Manor, Inc., </em>93 Md.App. 337, 353, 612 A.2d 322, <em>cert. granted, </em>329 Md. 168, 617 A.2d 1085 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>330 Md. 318, 624 A.2d 490 (1993)(observ-ing that an assignment alone does not relieve the assignor of \u201chis obligations or liabilities under the original contract\u201d); <em>see also </em>E. Allan Farnsworth, <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 11.10 at 824 (2d ed.l990)(noting that a delegation \u201cdoes not relieve the delegating party ... of its duty.\u201d). Appellants have not provided us with any authority that would relieve them of their contractual duties to the Broker under the Agreement, on the basis of a separate contract with a third party, to which appellee is not a party. Moreover, the clause in the Noravian contract on which appellants rely could not obligate the Buyers to pay the fee when the Sellers defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">For appellants to be discharged from their obligation under the Agreement, the Broker would have had to agree to a modification of the Agreement or enter into a new agreement. In essence, the Addendum and the contract must amount to a novation or modification of the Agreement. <em>See Contracts </em>\u00a7 11.11 at 834 (noting that for the delegating or assigning party to be relieved of its obligation under the original contract, the creditor or obligee must assent to the delegation/assignment <em>and </em>agree to release the delegator/assignor).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">In Maryland, it is well settled that a novation \u201cis a new contractual relation that extinguishes the contract that was previously in existence between the parties.\u201d <em>Mercantile Club, Inc. v. Scherr, </em>102 Md.App. 757, 772, 651 A.2d 456 (1995); see also <em>Dahl v. Brunswick Corp., </em>277 Md. 471, 481, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>356 A.2d 221 (1976); <em>I.W. Berman Properties v. Porter Bros., Inc., </em>276 Md. 1, 7, 344 A.2d 65 (1975); <em>Kiley, </em>102 Md.App. at 327-28, 649 A.2d 1145; <em>Homo, </em>93 Md.App. at 354, 612 A.2d 322. To establish a novation, the party asserting it must prove four necessary requirements: \u201c(1) A previous valid obligation; (2) the agreement of all the parties to the new contract; (3) the validity of such new contract, and (4) the extinguishment of the old contract, by the substitution of a new one.\u201d <em>I.W. Berman Properties, </em>276 Md. at 7, 344 A.2d 65(citations omitted); <em>see also Dahl, </em>277 Md. at 481, 356 A.2d 221; <em>Scherr, </em>102 Md.App. at 772, 651 A.2d 456; <em>Kiley, </em>102 Md.App. at 327-28, 649 A.2d 1145; <em>Homa, </em>93 Md.App. at 354, 612 A.2d 322. The Court has recognized that a novation may be established by the facts and circumstances of the situation. It has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">The intention to substitute a new agreement for a previous contract need not be expressed!,] however, since facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction, as well as the subsequent conduct by the parties, may show such an acceptance as clearly as an express agreement; but such facts and circumstances, when shown, must be such to establish that the intention to work a novation was clearly implied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\"><em>I.W. Berman Properties, </em>276 Md. at 8, 344 A.2d 65 (citations omitted); <em>see also Dahl, 277 </em>Md. at 482, 356 A.2d 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Here, the trial court clearly found that the Noravian contract and the Addendum did not constitute a novation, because there was no evidence that appellee agreed to anything. That finding was not clearly erroneous. Appellee was not a party to the Noravian contract, and no evidence was adduced to show that appellee agreed to release appellants from their contractual obligation to pay the commission upon entering into a written contract of sale. Moreover, we observe nothing in the Noravian contract indicating that it was intended by appellants and appellee to replace or modify their previous Agreement. That the Broker may have known about the Noravians\u2019 agreement to pay the commission is not enough. Therefore, we conclude that the Addendum did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>alter appellants\u2019 contractual duties to appellee under the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">III. Fiduciary Duty of the Broker and Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Appellants claim that appellee breached its fiduciary duty to them because, when the Sellers sought to cancel the Noravian contract of sale, the Broker failed to advise them that the Agreement obligated them to pay the commission, even if the sale was not consummated, or that they would expose themselves to liability for more than one commission if they sold the Property to another party. Appellants also contend that, at the time they signed the Agreement, appellee advised them that the commission would be due only upon settlement. Appellants thus assert appellee\u2019s conduct constituted an estop-pel, precluding the Broker\u2019s recovery. We turn first to consider appellants\u2019 claim that the Broker had a duty to inform them of their obligations under the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">A broker \u201cis bound to act in good faith and to make disclosures of matters that are material and might affect the action of his employer in the premises.\u201d <em>Coppage v. Howard, </em>127 Md. 512, 523, 96 A. 642 (1916); <em>see also Sellner v. Moore, </em>251 Md. 391, 398, 247 A.2d 523 (1968); <em>Hardy v. Davis, </em>223 Md. 229, 232, 164 A.2d 281 (1960); <em>Proctor v. Holden, </em>75 Md.App. 1, 18, 540 A.2d 133, <em>cert. denied, </em>313 Md. 506, 545 A.2d 1343 (1988). Moreover, if a broker breaches his or her fiduciary duty, acts in bad faith, or in another opprobrious manner, he or she may forfeit the right to compensation. <em>Sellner, </em>251 Md. at 399, 247 A.2d 523 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">It is certainly unfortunate that the Broker did not opt to remind the Holzmans of the terms of the Agreement, with which the Broker undoubtedly had far more familiarity. Nevertheless, under the circumstances of this case, we perceive no breach by appellee of its fiduciary duty to appellants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>The Agreement clearly addressed the terms and conditions under which appellants would owe the Broker a fee, and appellee had no legal duty to remind appellants of the terms of the Agreement that appellants had signed. To the contrary, the Holzmans had a duty to ascertain their obligations under the Agreement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">One is under a duty to learn the contents of a contract before signing it; if, in the absence of fraud, duress, undue influence, and the like he fails to do so, he is presumed to know the contents, signs at his peril, suffers the consequences of his negligence, and is estopped to deny his obligation under the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">17 C.J.S. Contracts \u00a7 137(b) (1963). <em>See Binder v. Benson, 225 </em>Md. 456, 461, 171 A.2d 248 (1961) (noting that \u201cif there\u2019s no fraud, duress, or mutual mistake, one who has the capacity to understand a written document who reads and signs it, or without reading it or having it read to him, signs it, is bound by his signature as to all of its terms\u201d); <em>see also Chandler v. Aero Mayflower Transit Co., Inc., </em>374 F.2d 129, 136 (4th Cir.1967) (recognizing that one generally may not avoid a contract on the \u201cground that he did not read it or that he took someone else\u2019s word as to what it contained\u201d); <em>Hart v. Vermont Inv. Ltd. Partnership, </em>667 A.2d 578, 582 (D.C.1995) (acknowledging that, as a general rule, one who signs a contract has a duty to read it).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Moreover, this is not a case in which the Sellers lacked any experience as to real estate transactions. Rather, the testimony clearly indicated that the Holzmans had experience with listing contracts, as they had previously listed the subject property with another agent. Indeed, Mr. Holzman testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>that the parties decided to use the \u201csame pattern\u201d for calculating the commission here as appellants had employed previously with another agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">It is also noteworthy that there is no contention that appellee induced appellants to default on the Noravian contract. To the contrary, the evidence suggests that the Holz-mans never endeavored to discuss with the Broker their intention to cancel the Noravian contract. Nonetheless, they knew enough to seek the advice of their counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">In our search to find a case on point, we have found the case of <em>Pfeffer v. General Cas. Co. of America, </em>73 S.E.2d 234, 87 Ga.App. 173 (Ga.Ct.App.1952), in which the Court of Appeals of Georgia concluded that a broker had no duty \u201cto point out to ... [the seller] the specific provisions of the contract for his commissions.\u201d <em>Pfeffer, </em>73 S.E.2d at 236. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">\u201cThe ... [seller] could read and write, there was no trick, artifice, or fraud practiced upon him which prevented him from reading the contract. The relation between the parties was that of landowner and real estate agent employed for the purpose of negotiating a sale of the land. In respect to the services to be rendered by the real estate agent, a relation of confidence existed between the owner and the agent. In respect to the compensation to be paid to the agent by the owner, the parties dealt at arm\u2019s length.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aan-dedup-1\"><em>Id. </em>at 236 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">We are amply satisfied that the evidence shows neither fraud in the procurement of the Agreement, nor deception preventing appellants from reading its provisions. As a consequence, we find no merit to appellants\u2019 claims that appellee breached its fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">We next consider appellants\u2019 estoppel argument. Appellants deny that Mr. Blum read the Agreement aloud to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>them. They also claim that Mr. Blum represented that \u201cthe commissions ... were paid upon settlement,\u201d and they maintain that they relied on that representation in signing the Agreement. Additionally, they aver that the Agreement is misleading, because it is a one page, single-spaced, fine print standard form document, with no subheadings or bold type to alert the client to particular aspects of the Agreement. Further, the Sellers posit that the terms of the Agreement do not conform to what they understood the Agreement to mean. These contentions are equally unavailing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">\u201cEquitable estoppel is the effect of the voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is absolutely precluded both at law and in equity, from asserting rights which might perhaps have otherwise existed, either of property, of contract, or of remedy, as against another person, who has in good faith relied upon such conduct, and had been led thereby to change his position for the worse and who on his part acquires some corresponding right, either of property, of contract, or of remedy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-6\"><em>Knill v. Knill, </em>306 Md. 527, 534, 510 A.2d 546 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">To establish estoppel, three elements must be established: (1) voluntary conduct or a representation by the party to be estopped, even if there is no intent to mislead; (2) reliance by the estopping party; and (3) detriment to the estopping party. <em>Grimberg v. Marth, </em>338 Md. 546, 555-56, 659 A.2d 1287 (1995); <em>Knill, </em>306 Md. at 535, 510 A.2d 546; <em>Lampton v. LaHood, </em>94 Md.App. 461, 475-76, 617 A.2d 1142 (1993). We are satisfied that appellee is not estopped from recovering its commission even if it never read the Agreement aloud to the Holzmans, and even though it presented the revised offer by the Sterns, and continued to list the Property pursuant to appellants\u2019 direction after appellants defaulted on the Nor avian contract, and failed to remind the Holzmans of the clear terms of the Agreement. Additionally, Mr. Holzman\u2019s testimony concerning statements allegedly made by Mr. Blum as to payment of the commission are of no significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Mr. Blum\u2019s representations were allegedly made before appellants signed the Agreement. As we already noted, appellants had an obligation to read the terms of the Agreement. Indeed, Mr. Holzman testified that appellee instructed him to read the Agreement and that he did, in fact, \u201cbriefly read through it.\u201d <em>See Plitt v. McMillan, </em>285 Md. 349, 354, 201 A.2d 787 (1964) (concluding that because purchaser examined contract before signing it, she had capacity to understand it, and there was no fraud in its inducement, she was bound by its terms.); <em>see also Binder, 225 </em>Md. at 461, 171 A.2d 248; <em>Rossi v. Douglas, </em>203 Md. 190, 199, 100 A.2d 3 (1953). Because the Agreement made it clear that a fee was owed to appellee under the circumstances of this case, the Holzmans may not be heard to complain that they relied on alleged verbal representations of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Moreover, \u201cas a matter of substantive law, parole [sic] evidence ordinarily is inadmissible to vary, alter or contradict a contract ... that is complete and unambiguous, in the absence of \u2018fraud, accident, or <em>mutual </em>mistake.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bernstein v. Kapneck, </em>290 Md. 452, 460, 430 A.2d 602 (1981)(quoting <em>McLain v. Pernell, </em>255 Md. 569, 572, 258 A.2d 416 (1969)); <em>see also Canatella v. Davis, </em>264 Md. 190, 200, 286 A.2d 122 (1972); <em>Donovan v. Kirchner, </em>100 Md.App. 409, 419, 641 A.2d 961, <em>cert. denied, </em>336 Md. 299, 648 A.2d 202 (1994). As appellants are not challenging the Agreement on grounds of fraud, accident, or mutual mistake, Mr. Holzman\u2019s testimony that appellee represented that the commission was due only upon settlement contravened the parol evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">IV. The $21,500 Credit</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The trial court determined that, under the terms of the Agreement, appellee earned a commission when appellants executed the Noravian contract. Later, the court reduced the commission by $21,500. The amount of the reduction was equal to the fee recovered by appellee as the commission for the Stern contract. In its cross-appeal, the Broker challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to reduce the judgment by the amount of the commission it subsequently earned. Appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>argues that the Stern contract was a separate contract of sale executed in October 1996, well within six months of the expiration of the Agreement in September 1996. Therefore, it contends that, under the Agreement, it was entitled to commissions for both the Noravian contract and the Stern contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Appellants counter that if one adopts appellee\u2019s construction of the Agreement, then the Broker could earn an unlimited number of commissions on a single piece of property, so long as none of those contracts proceed to settlement. Appellants argue that such a construction \u201cstretches the bounds of reasonableness and requires judicial intervention.\u201d In essence, appellants assert that the court was correct to grant the credit, because the Agreement is otherwise unconscionable, and enforcing it would lead to an inequitable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In its brief, the Broker suggests that appellants were \u201cgreedy\u201d when they defaulted on the Noravian contract in order to proceed with the more lucrative offer from the Stems. Appellee argues that appellants may not avoid the consequences of their conduct by contending that they are not responsible for both commissions. Appellants respond by condemning the Broker\u2019s greediness. To be sure, the Broker is attempting to \u201cdouble dip.\u201d As we see it, the adage of the \u201cpot calling the kettle black\u201d is appropriate here. We also ask, rhetorically, whether appellee would have complained had appellants proceeded with the Stems\u2019 offer if there had been no cooperating broker; absent the participation of another broker, appellee would have recovered a greater commission based on the purchase price for the Stern contract than from the Noravian contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Neither party has provided us with any legal authority that directly supports their respective positions. In our research, we have found the case of <em>Stover &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Harry Norman, Inc., </em>370 S.E.2d 776, 187 Ga.App. 514 (Ga.Ct.App.1988), which is instructive. There, a real estate broker sought to recover his commission from a purchaser who failed to buy the property after executing a contract of sale. The contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>of sale provided that if the purchaser defaulted it would pay the broker his full commission. <em>Stover, </em>370 S.E.2d at 777. The purchaser urged that, in order to avoid a double recovery by the broker, the amount he owed the broker should be reduced by the amount of the commission the broker received from the subsequent sale of the property to a different purchaser. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals of Georgia rejected the purchaser\u2019s argument. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">[The broker\u2019s] recovery is for the services it performed in connection with negotiating the contract. These services and the resulting contract are separate and apart from whatever services were rendered by [the broker] ... in connection with the subsequent sale of the real property. The subsequent sale of the real property to a different buyer was a separate transaction. Under these facts and circumstances there is no double recovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-6\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). We are not persuaded that <em>Stover &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Preliminarily, we observe that there was no evidence offered by the Broker as to any meaningful additional services it rendered in regard to the Stern contract. Indeed, at trial, Mr. Blum testified that the Stern contract was not processed through his office. Moreover, no evidence was adduced that the Sellers sought to bypass the Broker or wait until the Agreement expired before selling the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Significantly, the Agreement does not address the circumstances presented here; it does not specifically provide that the Broker may recover more than one commission for the sale of the Property in the event of a default by the Sellers. Applying the principles of contract construction that we reviewed earlier, if the parties intended the Broker to procure a double recovery under the circumstances of this case, the contract should have so specified. Instead, the language of the commission clause suggests to us that the parties contemplated one fee from the Sellers with respect to the sale of the Property. <em>See Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 596, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990)(noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>that, when construing a contract, the court must consider the character and purpose of the contract and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time the agreement is executed).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">In the commission clause of the Agreement, the enumerated events that trigger the Broker\u2019s entitlement to a fee are listed in the alternative; the Broker is entitled to a commission based on one of three circumstances. As we noted, the Agreement specifically provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Holzmans would pay the Broker a commission if: (1) during the term of the Agreement, the Broker produced a buyer \u201cto purchase the Property at the listing price ... or at such other price or on such other terms as accepted by\u201d appellants; or (2) during the term of the Agreement, appellants entered \u201cinto a written agreement to sell, exchange, convey or transfer the Property to any person or entity;\u201d or (8) within six months after the expiration of the Agreement, appellants entered into a \u201cwritten agreement to sell, exchange, convey or transfer the Property to any person who ... inspected or made inquiry about the Property or negotiated to purchase ... the Property\u201d while the Agreement was in effect. (Emphasis added). <em>See Enterprise Leasing Co. v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>341 Md. 541, 548, 671 A.2d 509 (1996)(recognizing that the use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d in the statute indicates that the permission of either the owner or the lessee is sufficient to bring the operator of a leased vehicle under the coverage of the required security); <em>Hosain v. Malik, </em>108 Md.App. 284, 333, 671 A.2d 988 (1996)(noting that the \u201cor\u201d in Md. Rule 8-131(a) is disjunctive, directing that an issue is preserved for appellate review \u201cif it was either raised by a party or decided by the court\u201d); <em>see also Parrish v. District of Columbia, </em>718 A.2d 133, 135 (D.C.1998)(stating: \u201cThe word \u2018or\u2019 ... is normally disjunctive and establishes a relationship of contrast\u201d); <em>Charles E. Smith, Inc. v. District of Columbia Rental Housing Com\u2019n, </em>492 A.2d 875, 878 (D.C.1985)(reasoning that \u201cThe use of the disjunctive \u2018or\u2019 to join alternatives, indicates that they are mutually exclusive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>We are satisfied that, based on the facts of this case, the court was entitled to conclude that the commission clause did not contemplate a double recovery by the Broker. <em>Syme v. Marks Rentals, Inc., </em>70 Md.App. 235, 243-44, 520 A.2d 1110 (1987), is instructive. There, we noted that, in ascertaining the unconscionability of a contractual provision, a court should consider several factors, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">(1) the standardized agreement executed by the parties of unequal bargaining strength; (2) lack of opportunity to read or become familiar with [the] document before signing it; (3) evidence that the contractual provision was commercially unreasonable or its interpretation would not be anticipated by the ordinary customer; (4) substantive unfairness of the terms of the contract; (5) impact of the relationship of the parties of assent, unfair surprise and notice; and (6) all the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract including its commercial setting, purpose, and effect. <em>See Davis v. M.L.G. Corporation, </em>712 P.2d 985, 991 (Colo.1986); RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS \u00a7 208 (1979); 17 AM.JUR.2D <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 193 (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Because appellee based its claim for a commission on the basis of appellants\u2019 execution of the Noravian contract, pursuant to subparagraph (1) of the commission clause, the Agreement did not entitle the Broker also to recover based on the Stern contract, for which the Broker relied on subparagraph (3) of the commission clause. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial court properly reduced the judgment by the amount of the commission appellee received from the subsequent sale of the Property to the Sterns.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">V. Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Appellants challenge the court\u2019s decision to award appellee attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $12,408. That sum represented the amount of appellee\u2019s liability to its attorney, pursuant to appellee\u2019s agreement with its attorney for a one-third contingency fee. Appellants observe that, notwithstanding appellee\u2019s fee agreement with its attorney, the Agreement between the Holzmans and Blum merely provides for payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the Broker; it does not set forth a specific percentage. The Holzmans also argue that the court erred because appellee did not present evidence concerning the reasonableness of the one-third contingency fee, the extent of the attorney\u2019s work, the experience of counsel, or the customary fee for such representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In essence, the issue here is whether the one-third contingency fee agreement between the Broker and its attorney is binding upon appellants. Although the Holzmans agreed to pay appellee a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee if appellee successfully brought an action to recover its commission, they did not agree to pay whatever legal fee appellee might agree to pay its attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Ordinarily, a prevailing party is not entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Hess Constr. Co. v. Board of Educ., </em>341 Md. 155, 159, 669 A.2d 1352 (1996); <em>Empire Realty Co. v. Fleisher, </em>269 Md. 278, 285, 305 A.2d 144 (1973); <em>Bresnahan v.

A trial court generally may award attorney\u2019s fees only when statutorily authorized or when, as here, a contract between the parties specifically authorizes such fees. <em>Maxima Corp. v. 6933 Arlington Dev. Ltd. Partnership, </em>100 Md.App. 441, 452, 641 A.2d 977 (1994); <em>see Hess, </em>341 Md. at 160, 669 A.2d 1352; <em>Bresnahan, </em>115 Md.App. at 244, 693 A.2d 1; <em>Reisterstown Plaza Associates v. General Nutrition Ctr., Inc., </em>89 Md.App. 232, 241-42, 597 A.2d 1049 (1991). When attorney\u2019s fees are permitted, the award is \u201c <em>\u2018a </em>factual matter which lies within the \u201csound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.\u2019\u201d\u201d <em>Reisterstown Plaza, </em>89 Md.App. at 248, 597 A.2d 1049 (quoting <em>Dent v.

Porter Hayden Co., </em>116 Md.App. 605, 703, 698 A.2d 1167, <em>cert. denied, </em>348 Md. 205, 703 A.2d 147 (1997): \u201c[W]hen claims for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses are ... claimed as damages for breach of contract, the plaintiff must satisfy the standards spelled out\u201d in <em>Bankers </em>and <em>Maxima </em>Corp. The Court in <em>Bankers </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">It is equally clear from the record, however, that the informal hearing conducted by the trial court neither required any real proof of the amount of the fees and expenses claimed nor provided Bankers with a realistic opportunity to challenge those fees and expenses. This was a case involving claims for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses as damages for a breach of contract, and not one of the relatively unusual types of cases where the trial court is authorized to award the prevailing party in litigation before the court his reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. Consequently, Bankers was entitled to have the amount of fees and expenses proven with certainty and under the standards ordinarily applicable for proof of contractual damages. Instead, the parties merely submitted, prior to the hearing, informal fee and expense petitions and made short, oral representations at the hearing of the amounts claimed. On remand there should be a proper trial regarding the damages incurred....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-6\"><em>Bankers, </em>287 Md. at 661-62, 415 A.2d 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Similarly, in <em>Maxima Corp., </em>100 Md.App. at 452, 641 A.2d 977, we made clear that the moving party must prove its claim for attorney\u2019s fees with competent evidence. We said that</p>\n<p id=\"afu-dedup-0\">(a) the party seeking the fees, whether for him/herself or on behalf of a client, always bears the burden of presenting evidence sufficient for a trial court to render a judgment as to their reasonableness; (b) an appropriate fee is always reasonable charges for the services rendered; (c) a fee is not justified by a mere compilation of hours multiplied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>fixed hourly rates or bills issued to the client; (d) <em>a request for fees must specify the services performed, by whom they were performed, the time expended thereon, and the hourly rates charged; </em>(e) it is incumbent upon the party seeking recovery to present detailed records that contain the relevant facts and computations undergirding the computation of charges; (f) without such records, the reasonableness, <em>vel non, </em>of the fees can be determined only by conjecture or opinion of the attorney seeking the fees and would therefore not be supported by competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\"><em>Maxima Corp., </em>100 Md.App. at 453-43, 641 A.2d 977 (emphasis in original) (citing <em>Kaiser v.

R.P. \u00a7 14-105 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">In the absence of special agreement to the contrary, if a real estate broker employed to sell, buy, lease, or otherwise negotiate an estate, or a mortgage or loan secured by the property, procures in good faith a purchaser, ... as the case may be, and the person procured is accepted by the employer and enters into a valid, binding, and enforceable written contract, in terms acceptable to the employer, of a sale, purchase, ... and the contract is accepted by the employer and signed by him, the broker is deemed to have earned the customary and agreed commission. He has earned the commission regardless of whether or not the contract entered into is performed, unless performance of the contract is prevented, hindered or delayed by any act of the broker.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b649-12\">. We need not speculate on the reason for such a provision. It is apparent, however, that if appellants had to pay the Commission, they may have insisted on a higher selling price, which undoubtedly would have increased other costs associated with the sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b652-8\">. Mr. Blum\u2019s description at trial of his \u201cfiduciary relationship\u201d with the Holzmans does not create a fiduciary duty under the law. Nevertheless, given Mr. Blum\u2019s testimony as to his \"fiduciary relationship\u201d and his desire \"to do the best\u201d for the clients, it is somewhat surprising that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>the Broker, in effect, opposed its client's desire to obtain the highest possible purchase price for the Property. Similarly, in pursuing its contract claim against the Sellers, we assume the Broker fully considered the impact such a suit might have on its reputation as an advocate for its customers. Moreover, but for the involvement of a cooperating broker on behalf of the Sterns, who was to share the commission for the Stem contract, we presume that appellee, like appellants, would have preferred the Stern contract, because the purchase price was substantially higher.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b654-10\">.
