(\u201cAndy\u2019s\u201d), bid unsuccessfully for a contract to sell food in an area within the City Park adjacent to the Salisbury Zoo. Andy\u2019s asserts that the Salisbury Zoo Commission, Inc. (the \u201cZoo Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>sion\u201d), which made the contract decision, is both a public body and a unit or instrumentality of the City of Salisbury (the \u201cCity\u201d), which, in turn, is a political subdivision of the state government. Based upon this assertion, Andy\u2019s contends that the Zoo Commission, during its review of the contract bids, should have complied with both the Public Information Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Md.Code (1984, 1997 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-611 to 628 of the State Government Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d), and the Open Meetings Act, Md.Code (1984, 1997 Cum.Supp.), S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 10-501 to 512, which, respectively, detail procedural requirements for public access to government documents and to the meetings of public bodies. Andy\u2019s also argues that the City improperly delegated to the Zoo Commission the authority to award the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Andy\u2019s sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction against the Zoo Commission\u2019s decision to award the contract to Flannery\u2019s, Inc., the successful bidder. All parties sought attorneys\u2019 fees. After a hearing on cross motions for summary judgment, the Circuit Court for Wicomico County ruled for Andy\u2019s on the Public Information Act issue, and for the City, the Zoo Commission, and Flannery\u2019s on the issues of delegation and the Open Meetings Act. No party was awarded attorneys\u2019 fees. Andy\u2019s appeals from the delegation, Open Meetings Act, and attorneys\u2019 fees decisions; the City and Zoo Commission appeal from the Public Information Act and attorneys\u2019 fees decisions. Flannery\u2019s, an appellee to Andy\u2019s appeal, has not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In 1983 Walter Anderson, the City\u2019s Solicitor at the time, filed Articles of Incorporation creating a non-profit, non-stock corporation to be called the \u201cSalisbury Zoo Commission, Inc.\u201d The Articles named Patrick Fennell, the City\u2019s Executive Secretary, as Resident Agent, and listed the City\u2019s \u201cGovern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>ment Office Building\u201d as the Resident Agent\u2019s address.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The Zoo Commission\u2019s Articles provide that \u201c[t]he members of the Corporation shall be appointed by the Mayor and City Council and shall ... include a member of the City Council.\u201d The Zoo Commission\u2019s By-Laws and Articles both identify its purpose as: \u201c[t]o' assist the City of Salisbury in the <em>operation, management and promotion </em>of the Salisbury Zoological Park as a wildlife conservation facility for the enjoyment and education of the citizens of the City of Salisbury and the regional area....\u201d (Emphasis added.) The By-Laws specify a nonexclusive list of the Zoo Commission\u2019s functions, including: retaining persons or organizations to provide consultation or assist in the Zoo\u2019s operation; planning, recommending, and funding new Zoo exhibits and improvements, in collaboration with the City\u2019s Department of Public Works; soliciting, training, and managing volunteers for the Zoo\u2019s educational programs; raising funds and encouraging monetary contributions to the Zoo; developing, funding, and managing publicity programs; maintaining an accurate inventory of the animal collection; managing Zoo Commission funds for the purchase and sale of animals as personal property of the Zoo Commission; collaborating with professional Zoo staff in the acquisition, care, breeding, and disposition of the animals; and recommending to the Mayor and City Council long-term plans and improvements to the Zoo.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>The By-Laws and Articles provide that the Mayor and City Council appoint the members of the Zoo Commission for three-year terms, and can remove them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For new appointments and vacancies, the Zoo Commission \u201cshall submit a list of names to the Mayor and City Council <em>for consideration for appointment </em>and in order to fill any vacancy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The members of the Zoo Commission, during the events that gave rise to this case, were appointed by the Mayor and City Council in December 1996, pursuant to Resolution No. 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The By-Laws state that the Zoo Commission shall have a Board of Directors composed of at least five voting members, who shall elect a Chairman. The City\u2019s Director of Public Works and the Zoo Director are ex-officio members. The Zoo Commission Chairman and the board member who is also on the City Council are to act as liaisons between the Zoo Commission and the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Andy\u2019s avows that the Zoo Commission is funded principally by hotel room taxes assessed by the City; in turn, the Zoo Commission states in its brief that \u201c[t]he record does not show that it [the Zoo Commission] receives any funding from the City.\u201d The record extract does not resolve this possible factual dispute, but the Zoo Commission\u2019s By-Laws, written on City of Salisbury letterhead, dictate that the Zoo Commission shall present an annual budget to the City Council \u201cconsistent with the City of Salisbury procedures on budgets,\u201d from which \u201c[a]ny major departures ... shall be approved by the Mayor and [City] Council\u201d; shall be audited by an auditor selected by and at the expense of the City; and shall submit meeting minutes to the City \u201cto be summarized in the Quarterly Report.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Any changes that Zoo Commission members suggest in the By-Laws or Articles must be submitted to the Mayor and City Council for approval. The Mayor and City Council, however, have the independent power to \u201cmake, alter, and repeal\u201d the By-Laws. The Zoo Commission may be dissolved by the Mayor and City Council, or by its own members. Upon dissolution, all funds and property would pass to the City. Although the Zoo Commission asserts that \u201cthe activities and decision-making authority of the corporation [the Zoo Commission] are not subject to the control of the Mayor and Council,\u201d the By-Laws state that \u201c[t]he Mayor and City Council shall have veto power over proposals presented for approval by the Corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">In July 1996, the City awarded a license to Andy\u2019s, the sole bidder, to sell ice cream and food in the City Park adjacent to the Zoo. The ordinance granting that license apparently expired on October 31, 1996. In March 1997, the City\u2019s Purchasing Agent,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> using a City Purchasing Department form, issued a \u201cRequest for Proposals\u201d for concession services \u201cin the City Park at the Zoo,\u201d to be received \u201cby the City\u201d in the Government Office Building. The request was entitled \u201cAdvertisement \u2014 City of Salisbury.\u201d In the Request for Proposals documents, the Zoo Commission was rarely mentioned separately from the City; rather, they generally appeared together either as \u201cthe City and the Zoo Commission\u201d or as \u201cthe City/Zoo Commission.\u201d The Zoo Commission is mentioned separately, however, as the party that will evaluate all proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>The bid request included a discussion of a bidder\u2019s compliance with the City\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity policy and stated that \u201cthe relationship of Vendor [the successful bidder] to City of Salisbury/Salisbury Zoo Commission shall be that of an \u2018independent contractor.\u2019 \u201d The instructions also stated that the Zoo Commission, in its evaluation of the bids, would consider the bidders\u2019 performance records in contracts with the City and \u201c[previous and existing compliance with laws and ordinances relating to contracts with the City----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">In a March 20, 1997 memo to the Mayor and City Council, John Pick, the City\u2019s Executive Officer, addressed the concession issue in his \u201cManagement Report\u201d about various City concerns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\"><em>Request for Proposals </em>\u2014 Zoo <em>Concession Stand</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aa9-dedup-0\">The Purchasing Department has released the Request for Proposals (RFP) for the Concession Stand at the Zoo <em>based on the guidance given by the Council </em>at your March 12 work session. Responses are due on Monday, April 14 at 10:30 a.m. The Purchasing Department is making an effort to make sure that notification is made to a wide range of individuals and companies ... so that we receive competitive proposals. If any member of the Council knows of anyone who may be interested in submitting a proposal, please contact the Purchasing Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\"><em>Pursuant to the direction\\ given by the Council, </em>a number of changes and clarifications were made in the RFP before it was issued. Some of the most significant are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">a) the RFP has been changed to clarify that the Zoo Commission is the party that will be awarding the contract. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">c) a sentence has been added clarifying that, <em>in the event the City has to suspend or terminate the contract, </em>the vendor will not be paid for the loss of anticipated revenues.... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">In April 1997, two food-service corporations, Andy\u2019s and Flannery\u2019s, Inc., submitted proposals. On April 16, the Zoo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Commission held a closed meeting, during which it decided to award the concession to Flannery\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">On April 28, 1997, the Mayor and City Council approved a resolution leasing a 4,795.31 square foot area in the City Park near the Zoo to the Zoo Commission for $1.00 a year, to be used for concession sales. The City Council minutes indicate that revenue from the Zoo Commission\u2019s vending arrangement would go to the Zoo\u2019s Education Department. At the same meeting, the Zoo Commission\u2019s Chairman, Ronald Alessi, informed the City Council that the Zoo Commission had reviewed two bids for the food service contract and had chosen Flannery\u2019s. Apparently, the Zoo Commission reviewed the bids and chose the winning bid before obtaining the lease from the City. The lease between the City and the Zoo Commission was executed on May 5,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">After the Zoo Commission chose Flannery\u2019s bid, Andy\u2019s apparently requested information about the grounds for the bid decision. Unsuccessful in this endeavor, Andy\u2019s filed suit against the Zoo Commission, the City, and Flannery\u2019s on June 27,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">We have re-ordered, re-phrased, and consolidated the questions raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Andy\u2019s presents these questions:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">1. Is the Salisbury Zoo Commission a public.body whose meetings must be open to the public under the Open Meetings Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">2. Can the Salisbury Zoo Commission make a final decision awarding a concession franchise on municipal land?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">The Zoo Commission and the City of Salisbury raise the following additional questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>1. Did the circuit court err in ruling that the Zoo Commission was an instrumentality of State Government or of a political subdivision required to produce records under the Public Information Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\">2. Was the circuit court correct in denying all parties\u2019 requests for attorney\u2019s fees?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">We will address these in a different order, considering first the Public Information Act issue, and then the issues concerning the Open Meetings Act, delegation, and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Maryland Rule 8-131(e) provides that, for actions tried without a jury, an appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence, and will not set aside the trial court\u2019s judgment on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, giving due regard to the trial court\u2019s opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses. When a trial court makes conclusions of law based on findings of fact, however, the clearly erroneous standard does not apply; instead, the standard of review is whether the trial court was legally correct. <em>Himelstein v. Arrow </em>Cab, 113 Md.App. 530, 536, 688 A.2d 491 (1997), aff'd, 348 Md. 558, 705 A.2d 294 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">I. The Public Information Act</p>\n<p id=\"AU-\">A. The disposition of the Public Information Act claim</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The Public Information Act, S.G. \u00a7 10-611 to 628, addresses access to public records. Section 10-613(a) provides that \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by law, a custodian shall permit a person or governmental unit to inspect any public record at any reasonable time.\u201d Section 10-611(g)(l) states:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYv\">\u2018Public record\u2019 means the original or any copy of any documentary material that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-9\">(i) is made by a unit or instrumentality of the State government or of a political subdivision or received by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>unit or instrumentality in connection with the transaction of public business; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">(ii) is in any form, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">1. a card;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">2. a computerized record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">3. correspondence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">4. a drawing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\">5. film or microfilm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-12\">6. a form;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-13\">7. a map;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-14\">8. a photograph or photostat;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-15\">9. a recording; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-16\">10. a tape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-17\">In the circuit court, the Zoo Commission and the City argued that the Zoo Commission is neither a \u201cpublic body\u201d under the Open Meetings Act nor a \u201cunit or instrumentality of ... a political subdivision\u201d under \u00a7 10-611(g)(l)(i) of the Public Information Act. After discussing the Open Meetings Act\u2019s definition of \u201cpublic body,\u201d the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-18\">The Public Information Act does not use the same definition. I think under the Public Information Act we are dealing with a different definition and a different set of rules and regulations, and the issue is whether or not the Zoo Commission is an instrumentality of the state government within the meaning of the Public Information Act____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-19\">Here, you have an agency that is established true by as [sic] a private corporation under the General Corporation Act, however, its governing body is appointed by the Mayor and City Council.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-20\">It certainly does serve a public purpose in this Court\u2019s mind. Its existence depends upon the City of Salisbury government, and I believe that it is an instrumentality of the state government for the purposes of the Public Information Act, and I would order that the Zoo Commission is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>responsible for turning over the minutes and tape as requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">After the trial judge ordered the Zoo Commission to provide tapes and minutes of the April 16 closed bid evaluation meeting, counsel for the Zoo Commission stated that such tapes or minutes did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">B. Applying the Public Information Act to the Zoo Commission</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In order to resolve any future issues, despite the apparent nonexistence of any minutes or tapes of the April 16 executive session, we shall examine whether the Public Information Act applies to the Zoo Commission. The dispositive issue is whether the Zoo Commission is a \u201cunit or instrumentality ... of a political subdivision\u201d of the State under S.G. \u00a7 10-611(g)(l)(i). In <em>A.S. Abell Publishing Co. v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 35, 464 A.2d 1068 (1983), the Court of Appeals discussed the standard for determining which statutorily established entities are subject to the Public Information Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ate-dedup-0\">This Court has repeatedly recognized that there is no single test for determining whether a statutorily-established entity is an agency or instrumentality of the State for a particular purpose. All aspects of the interrelationship between the State and the statutorily-established entity must be examined in order to determine its status. <em>Katz v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>284 Md. 503, 510, 397 A.2d 1027, 1031 (1979) (sovereign immunity); <em>O &amp; B, Inc. v. Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>279 Md. 459, 462, 369 A.2d 553, 555 (1977) (sovereign immunity).... In each of these cited cases, this Court held that a statutorily-established entity was an agency or instrumentality of the State, notwithstanding the fact that the State did not exercise control over all aspects of the entity\u2019s operation. These cases demonstrate that complete control \u2014 control over all aspects of an entity\u2019s operation \u2014 is not a determinative factor in characterizing a statutorily-established entity as an agency or instrumentality of the State. Rather, a number of factors, including the degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>control by the State over the entity, must be taken into account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">Moreover, this Court has previously rejected the conten-\u2019 tion that the sole test to be applied in characterizing a statutorily-established entity as an agency or instrumentality of a government is whether the entity is subject to its complete control. [Citations omitted],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Certainly the Zoo Commission is not a statutorily established entity, but the analysis is instructive. In its brief, the Zoo Commission argues that it is not a unit or instrumentality of a political subdivision, as considered by S.G. \u00a7 10-611(g)(l)(i), because it is a charitable non-stock corporation that \u201ccertainly does not provide any governmental service to the public.\u201d We discern no error, however, in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Zoo Commission is subject to the Public Information Act. The Zoo Commission\u2019s many ties to the City, as set forth above, and which will be discussed at greater length in our analysis of the Open Meetings Act issue, indicate that the Zoo Commission is an instrumentality of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">In <em>A.S. Abell, </em>the Court of Appeals considered whether the Maryland Insurance Guaranty Association (MIGA) was an agency or instrumentality of the State of Maryland under the version of the Public Information Act then in effect. The statute was, in pertinent part, identical to the current Public Information Act, except that the current \u201cunit or instrumentality\u201d replaced \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d in the section detailing the entities subject to the Act. MIGA was a nonprofit unincorporated entity created to \u201cprovide a mechanism for the prompt payment of covered claims\u201d when insurers were insolvent, to detect and prevent insolvencies, and to assess the cost of such payments and protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The Court of Appeals determined that \u201cMIGA was established by the General Assembly so that its existence is subject to legislative control. It was established for a public purpose and has the obligation to protect ... [among others] the public\u2014 MIGA can be effectively controlled by the State because its Board is not self-perpetuating.\u201d <em>A.S. Abell, </em>297 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Md. at 37-38, 464 A.2d 1068. Although MIGA\u2019s Board of Directors elected its Chairman, the State Insurance Commissioner (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d) appointed the Directors and filled vacancies on the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">MIGA\u2019s \u201cplan of operation, consisting of various rules and regulations establishing all of its procedures,\u201d was subject to the Commissioner\u2019s approval and amendment. <em>Id., </em>297 Md. at 38, 464 A.2d 1068. The Board could not delegate certain regulatory powers without the Commissioner\u2019s approval. The Commissioner could entertain appeals from final actions of MIGA\u2019s Board and could change the Board\u2019s decisions. Although all insurers were required to be members of MIGA, it was the Commissioner, not MIGA, who had the authority to revoke an insurer\u2019s license to operate if the insurer did not pay an assessment or comply with MIGA regulations. In addition, the General Assembly exempted MIGA from state and local taxes, other than property taxes, and excused MIGA from liability for actions stemming from its performance of its duties. The Court of Appeals held that \u201cMIGA\u2019s existence depends upon the General Assembly\u201d and that, although \u201cthe State does not exercise control over all aspects of MIGA\u2019s operation,\u201d the State\u2019s control was sufficient for MIGA to be subject to the Public Information Act. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Although the Zoo Commission differs in some ways from MIGA, the two entities share similar attributes, and the interrelationship of the Zoo Commission with the City satisfies the standard that the <em>AS. Abell </em>Court set for the application of the Public Information Act. Like MIGA, the Zoo Commission \u201cis not authorized to manage its affairs independent of government control,\u201d <em>A.S. Abell, </em>297 Md. at 38, 464 A.2d 1068, in that the Mayor and City Council have veto power over the Zoo Commission\u2019s proposals. The Zoo Commission has to submit its budget to the Mayor and City Council, and the Mayor and City Council have to approve any major departures from that budget. The Zoo Commission, like MIGA, is composed of members appointed by a governmental body or executive. Just as MIGA\u2019s \u201cplan of operation\u201d is \u201csubject to approval and amendment by the Commissioner,\u201d the Zoo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Commission\u2019s By-Laws can be changed unilaterally by the Mayor and City Council, whereas any change the Zoo Commission\u2019s members propose for the By-Laws requires the approval of the Mayor and City Council. The Mayor and City Council may dissolve the Zoo Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">In <em>AS. Abell, </em>the Court of Appeals distinguished MIGA from the Board of Governors of the Memorial Hospital of Cumberland, which the Court had held was an agency of the City of Cumberland, and subject to the version of the Public Information Act then in effect. <em>Moberly v. Herboldsheimer, </em>276 Md. 211, 345 A.2d 855 (1975). The Board of Governors was created by the General Assembly, but apparently had the ability to select its own new members, as well as the authority to select the land for the Hospital, direct its construction, and make all rules and regulations necessary for its management and operation. <em>Id., </em>276 Md. at 214-216, 345 A.2d 855. The Board of Governors was authorized to do these tasks \u201cas fully as if incorporated for such purposes____\u201d <em>Id., </em>276 Md. at 216, 345 A.2d 855. Despite this authority, the Board of Governors was still subject to the Public Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Unlike the Board of Governors in <em>Moberly, </em>the Zoo Commission is not self-perpetuating. The Mayor and City Council of Salisbury appoint the Zoo Commission\u2019s members, and can dissolve the Zoo Commission at will. The Zoo Commission must receive the City\u2019s approval before altering its own ByLaws or making \u201cmajor departures\u201d from its budget. If anything, the <em>Moberly </em>Board of Governors had greater autonomy than the Zoo Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">In this case, although it appears that no audio tapes or paper minutes for the closed meeting will actually be delivered, we shall affirm the circuit court\u2019s ruling on the Public Information Act issue. If tapes or minutes are found to exist, the Zoo Commission would have to turn them over to Andy\u2019s. Prospectively, the Zoo Commission is obligated to adhere to the Public Information Act. <em>See S.G. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10-611 to 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>II. The Open Meetings Act</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Andy\u2019s argues that the Zoo Commission also violated the Open Meetings Act, S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 10-501 to 512, by holding its April 16, 1997 meeting in closed \u201cexecutive session.\u201d The Zoo Commission contends, however, that under the provisions of S.G. \u00a7 10 \u2014 502(h), it is not a \u201cpublic bod/\u2019 subject to the Act. It supports this argument primarily on the basis of its corporate status and the autonomy that it exercises over its own affairs and appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">A. The Act in General</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The Open Meetings Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d) states that \u201c[ejxeept as otherwise expressly provided in this subtitle, a public body shall meet in open session.\u201d S.G. \u00a7 10-505. State Government \u00a7 10-502(h) defines \u201cPublic bod/\u2019 as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">(1) ... an entity that: (i) consists of at least 2 individuals; and (ii) is created by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">1. the Maryland Constitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">2. a State statute;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">3. a county charter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">4. an ordinance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-12\">5. a rule, resolution, or bylaw;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-13\">6. an executive order of the Governor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-14\">or 7. an executive order of the chief executive authority of a political subdivision of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-15\">(2) \u201cPublic body\u201d includes any multimember board, commission, or committee appointed by the Governor or the chief executive authority of a political subdivision of the State, if the entity includes in its membership at least 2 individuals not employed by the State or a political subdivision of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-16\">The Act reflects the policy that a democratic government should be accessible and visible to the public. Specifically, S.G. \u00a7 10-501 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 It is essential to the maintenance of a democratic society that, except in special and appropriate circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">(1) public business be performed in an open and public manner; \u25a0 and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">(2) citizens be allowed to observe:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">(i) the performance of public officials; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">(ii) the deliberations and decisions that the making of '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">public policy involves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">(b) <em>Accountability; faith; </em>effectiveness.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">(1) The ability of the public, its representatives, and the media to attend, report on, and broadcast meetings of public bodies and to witness the phases of the deliberation, policy formation, and decision making of public bodies ensures the accountability of government to the citizens of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-12\">(2) The conduct of public business in open meetings increases the faith of the public in government and enhances the effectiveness of the public in fulfilling its role in a democratic society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">To achieve these goals, the Act details: the composition, function, powers, and duties of the State Open Meetings Law Compliance Board (the \u201cCompliance Board\u201d), S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 10-502.1-6; the process by which people may file complaints with the Compliance Board about public bodies that have failed to comply with the Act, S.G. \u00a7 10-502.5; prospective violations of the Act, S.G. \u00a7 10-502.6; the scope of the Act, S.G. \u00a7 10-503; resolution of conflicts with other laws, S.G. \u00a7 10-504; the notice public bodies must provide regarding meetings, S.G. \u00a7 10-506; attendance at public meetings, S.G. \u00a7 10-507; when closed sessions of public bodies are permitted, S.G. \u00a7 10-508; minutes of meetings, S.G. \u00a7 10-509; enforcement procedures for the Act, S.G. \u00a7 10-510; and the applicable penalty for noncompliance, S.G. \u00a7 10-511.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-16\">B. The Zoo Commission\u2019s Contentions Regarding the Act</p>\n<p id=\"b168-17\">The Zoo Commission contends that, even if.it is held to be a \u201cunit or instrumentality\u201d of a subdivision of the State govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ment as considered by the Public Information Act, S.G. \u00a7 10-611(g)(l)(i), it still does not fall within the Open Meetings Act\u2019s definition of \u201cpublic body,\u201d which arguably covers a more narrow range of entities. The Zoo Commission argues that S.G. \u00a7 10 \u2014 502(h)(1), the first Open Meetings Act subsection to define \u201cpublic body,\u201d is inapplicable to it because the Zoo Commission was not created by any of the methods enumerated in that subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">To be sure, nothing in the record indicates what caused the City Solicitor to file the Zoo Commission\u2019s Articles of Incorporation in 1983. If a City Council resolution or an executive order from the Mayor had been the impetus, it would seem that the Zoo Commission would be a public body as defined by S.G. \u00a7 10-502(h)(l). As noted, the Articles of Incorporation grant the Mayor and City Council authority over the Zoo Commission. They also provide that, if the City government or the Zoo Commission\u2019s own members dissolve the Zoo Commission, its assets become City property. It is highly unlikely that the City Solicitor, <em>sua sponte, </em>would file such Articles without the knowledge and approval of the Mayor and City Council, just as it is unlikely that the Solicitor would list the Mayor\u2019s Executive Secretary as Resident Agent and the City\u2019s Government Office Building as the Resident Agent\u2019s address without direction from and the knowledge or consent of the Mayor and City Council. We need not, however, speculate as to the Solicitor\u2019s motivations. Instead, we will move on to consider S.G. \u00a7 10 \u2014 502(h)(2), the subsection that contains the second definition of \u201cpublic body\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The Zoo Commission argues that S.G. \u00a7 10-502(h)(2) is also inapplicable because the Zoo Commission is not a \u201cboard, commission, or committee appointed by the Governor or the chief executive authority of a political subdivision of the State.... \u201d The Zoo Commission\u2019s argument under this subsection is twofold: first, it contends that it is not a \u201cboard, commission, or committee\u201d as contemplated by the statute; second, it contends that it is not \u201cappointed\u201d by the Mayor of Salisbury, who is the chief executive officer of the City. We will address the arguments in the reverse order, first consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>ering the Zoo Commission\u2019s membership appointment process and then the \u201cboard, commission, or committee\u201d aspect of the \u201cPublic body\u201d definition in S.G. \u00a7 10-502(h)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">C. The City\u2019s Appointment Authority over the Zoo Commission</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The Zoo Commission\u2019s argument regarding the \u201cappointed by\u201d language of S.G. \u00a7 10 \u2014 502(h)(2) misses the mark. The Zoo Commission contends that, because it submits a list of candidates to the Mayor and City Council for appointment to its board, it has sufficient autonomy to avoid being classified as a public body. The Mayor is the chief executive authority for Salisbury. Salisbury Charter \u00a7 SC3-4.A (1996). Although the Zoo Commission\u2019s By-Laws provide that it may submit a list of candidates to the Mayor and City Council \u201cfor consideration for appointment,\u201d the appointing authority is not bound by the list. The Zoo Commission\u2019s Articles clearly state that \u201c[t]he members of the Corporation [the Zoo Commission] shall be appointed by the Mayor and City Council,\u201d and its By-Laws state that \u201cThe members of the Corporation shall serve at the discretion of the Mayor and City Council.... The members of the Corporation shall be appointed by the Mayor and City Council....\u201d This process is similar to the Mayor\u2019s shared appointment powers for department heads where the council provides \u201cadvice and consent.\u201d Salisbury Charter \u00a7 SC3-4.C. The Mayor, in conjunction with the City Council, has the ability to appoint new members and remove current members, and therefore we conclude that the Zoo Commission satisfies the appointment aspect of S.G. \u00a7 10-502(h)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Our conclusion is supported by prior judicial treatment of the issue in other jurisdictions. Open Meetings Laws have been enacted, in some form, in each of the fifty states. <em>Board of County Commissioners of Carroll County v. Landmark Community Newspapers, </em>293 Md. 595, 601, 446 A.2d 63 (1982). North Carolina\u2019s Open Meetings Law is somewhat similar to Maryland\u2019s, stating in pertinent part that \u201c \u2018public body' means any elected or appointed authority, board, commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>committee, council ... of the State, or of ... other political subdivisions or public corporations----\u201d N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 143-318.10. In <em>DTH Publishing Corporation v. University of North Carolina, </em>128 N.C.App. 534, 496 S.E.2d 8, <em>review denied, </em>348 N.C. 496, 510 S.E.2d 381, 382 (1998), employees of the plaintiff newspaper sought to attend closed sessions of the Undergraduate Court, a student court that adjudicated allegations of student conduct violations. The Undergraduate Court was appointed by the Student Body President and confirmed by the Student Congress \u201cin accordance with policies adopted by the ... [University Chancellor] pursuant to the authority delegated\u201d by the University\u2019s Board of Governors. <em>DTH Publishing Corporation, </em>496 S.E.2d at 10-11. The defendants, the University and the Undergraduate Court itself, argued that they should not be subject to the Open Meetings Law because the selection of Undergraduate Court members was too attenuated to be deemed direct appointments by the University\u2019s Board of Governors. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11. The Court of Appeals of North Carolina disagreed with this \u201cnarrow construction\u201d of the statutory phrase \u201cpublic body ... elected or appointed,\u201d holding that the process of appointment was sufficiently direct for the Undergraduate Court to be a \u201cpublic body.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\"><em>DTH Publishing Corporation, </em>while certainly not directly on point with the present case, is instructive in the interpretation of Open Meeting Acts. By looking to the general method in which the Undergraduate Court was created, and determining that the final effect of the \u201ctrickle-down\u201d appointment was sufficiently equivalent to a direct appointment, the court included within the ambit of North Carolina\u2019s law an entity that, under a narrow reading of the \u201cappointed\u201d criteria, could have been classified as a non-public body. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Zoo Commission\u2019s members are appointed directly by the Mayor and City Council without intermediary actors.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">We must not overlook the purposes of the legislation before us. The legislative policy section of Maryland\u2019s Open Meetings Act outlines the goals that the Act seeks to achieve, stating that it is \u201cessential to the maintenance of a democratic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>society\u201d to allow public access to the deliberative processes of government. Such access enhances both governmental accountability and the \u201cfaith of the public in government.\u201d S.G. \u00a7 10-501. To these ends, Maryland\u2019s Open Meetings Act sets forth the \u201cminimum requirements\u201d for holding open meetings. These minimum requirements can be enhanced by statutory provisions specifying even greater access to public meetings in certain circumstances. <em>City of College Park v. Cotter, </em>309 Md. 573, 586, 525 A.2d 1059 (1987) (citing S.G. \u00a7 10-504). In the present case, there is no legislative enactment to enlarge upon the Open Meetings Act, but such an enactment is not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 421, 348 A.2d 275 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 942, 96 S.Ct. 1680, 48 L.Ed.2d 185 (1976), stated that \u201ca statute should be construed according to the ordinary and natural import of its language, since it is the language of the statute that constitutes the primary source for determining the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). For that reason,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">[ w]here there is no ambiguity or obscurity in the language of a statute, there is usually no need to look elsewhere to ascertain the intention of the Legislature. Thus, where statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity and expresses a definite and sensible meaning, courts are not at liberty to disregard the natural import of words with a view towards making the statute express an intention which is different from its plain meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 421-422, 348 A.2d 275 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Using the natural import of the words of the statute, we apply the Zoo Commission\u2019s circumstances to the Act. The Act covers \u201cany multimember board, commission, or committee appointed by ... the chief executive authority of a political subdivision of the State____\u201d S.G. \u00a7 10-502(h)(2). The Zoo Commission\u2019s members, as required by its Articles and ByLaws, are appointed by the Mayor and City Council; all that remains is to determine whether it is a \u201cboard, commission, or committee\u201d under S.G. \u00a7 10-502(h)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>D. The Zoo Commission as a \u201cboard, commission, or committee\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In its brief, the Zoo Commission argues that it considers S.G. \u00a7 10-502(h)(2)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">to cover boards, commissions, or committees which are established, created, or convened by a chief executive to conduct public business, and that said entities are included as a \u2018catch all\u2019 akin to \u2018public body\u2019 entities created by executive order as provided in \u00a7 10-502(h)(l)(ii)7, That term does not cover a <em>corporation </em>such as the Zoo Commission which has been established under the general incorporation laws of Maryland [and] which has not been created by any governmental action. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The Zoo Commission cites as support Opinion No. 96-14 of the Open Meetings Act Compliance Board, the board established by S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 10-502.1-6 to receive, review, and comment on complaints from persons alleging violations of the Act by public bodies. The Compliance Board consists of three members, at least one an attorney, appointed by the Governor. S.G. \u00a7 10-502.2. After reviewing the complaints of persons alleging violations of the Act, the Compliance Board issues a written opinion discussing whether a violation has occurred. S.G. \u00a7 10-502.4. Opinions of the Compliance Board are advisory only, and may not be introduced as evidence in an enforcement proceeding conducted under S.G. \u00a7 10-510. S.G. \u00a7 10-502.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Although it is not precedential or in any way binding upon our decision, we will review the Compliance Board Opinion cited by the Zoo Commission for the limited purpose of its legislative analysis. In Opinion No. 96-14, dated December 19, 1996, the Compliance Board considered the applicability of the Open Meetings Act to the Baltimore Area Convention and Visitors Association, Inc. (\u201cBACVA\u201d). BACVA\u2019s Board of Directors had denied a newspaper reporter access to one of its meetings. BACVA originally was created as a private corporation, with management and a Board of Directors that initially were not controlled or appointed by the local or State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>government. BACVA subsequently chose to amend its corporate charter to give the Mayor of Baltimore City authority to appoint its board members, but that was the extent of the Mayor\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The Compliance Board considered whether BACVA was a \u201cpublic body\u201d under S.G. \u00a7 10-502(h)(2). In pertinent part, the Compliance Board\u2019s opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">As we read it, the phrase \u2018multimember board, commission, or committee\u2019 refers to entities that are part of government. When the Legislature used the term \u2018board,\u2019 it apparently intended to refer to the kind of governmental entity that is called a \u2018board,\u2019 not the board of directors of a private corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">In part, our conclusion is based on the common usage of the statutory terminology. The primary meaning of the term \u2018board\u2019 ... is \u2018[a]n official or representative body organized to perform a trust or to execute official or representative functions or having the management of a public office or department exercising administrative or governmental functions.\u2019 <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>173 (6th ed. 1990). Moreover, because the terms \u2018commission\u2019 and \u2018committee\u2019 refer to governmental entities, the term \u2018board\u2019 probably refers to another in the same class of entities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">In part, our conclusion is based on the legislative history of \u00a7 10-502(h)(2). When the 1991 reform bill was introduced, it contained the following as the proposed addition to the definition of \u2018public body\u2019:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">\u2018 \u201cPublic body\u201d includes the multimember governing body of any corporation directly supported entirely by public funds.\u2019 This language was deleted by amendment and the language that now appears in \u00a7 10-502(h)(2) was inserted in its stead. Because the deleted language referred to a corporate board of directors as the \u2018governing body of [a] corporation,\u2019 it is unlikely that the Legislature intended to include a private corporation\u2019s board of directors within the scope of \u00a7 10-502(h)(2) as enacted---- This change of language indicates to us a change in the legislative objective \u2014 instead of apply<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>ing the Act to publicly funded private corporations, the General Assembly continued to limit the reach of the law to those entities that are themselves governmental or quasi-govemmental \u2018boardfs], eommission[s], or eommittee[s].\u2019 The purpose of the enacted amendment to \u00a7 10 \u2014 502(h)(2), we believe, was to ensure that the Act would apply to all boards, commissions, and committees that are part of government, even if the Governor or the local executive chose to create a particular board, commission, or committee by informal means, instead of an executive order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-4\">In our opinion, BACVA has not assumed the status of a government board, despite the Mayor\u2019s ability to control the membership of the board. Although control is surely an important factor in determining the governmental status of an entity, it is not alone determinative. <em>See A.S. Abell Publishing Corp. [Co.] v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 35, 464 A.2d 1068 (1983). The decision to grant the Mayor appointment power was not the Mayor\u2019s. Because BACVA had been in existence long before the change to mayoral appointments of its board members, the decision to make the change was that of BACVA\u2019s prior board. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">After concluding that BACVA was not a public body and that, therefore, the Open Meetings Act did not apply to BACVA, the Compliance Board stated, \u201cThis conclusion reflects our interpretation of the law, not our view of wise policy. To the contrary: Because BACVA, <em>despite its retaining the form and function of a private corporation, </em>is in reality an instrumentality of City policy____\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Compliance Board encouraged BACVA to reconsider its policy of holding closed meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">In the present case, the trial court heard the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the Zoo Commission\u2019s closed session and the Open Meetings Act, including the applicability of the Compliance Board\u2019s Opinion, and then ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">I am satisfied ... that the Zoo Commission is not a public body subject to the Open Meetings law. They do not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>to comply with the Open Meetings law, and the contract will not be voided because of the Open Meetings law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">Now, the reason ... came out pretty well in my questions to counsel for the plaintiff [Andy\u2019s], I believe the prior Opinion by the authorities [apparently the Compliance Board\u2019s BACVA Opinion] on this issue, although not binding upon the Court, I think their review of the legislative history was persuasive, and this independent body cooperate [sic] is not a ... \u2018public body within the meaning of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The Compliance Board\u2019s analysis, if we were to adopt it in full, may produce a different result in the present case. The Zoo Commission, like BACVA, is \u201cin reality an instrumentality of City policy.\u201d The Zoo Commission, however, does not retain the same \u201cform and function\u201d of a private corporation as BACVA. Notwithstanding its corporate form, the Zoo Commission is much less \u201cprivate\u201d and more functionally dependent upon the City than BACVA.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">First, BACVA was not created by an agent of the City as was the Zoo Commission. Second, BACVA voluntarily, after thirteen years of existence, granted the Mayor of Baltimore appointment power over its board. The Zoo Commission was created with Articles of Incorporation that, from its inception, gave the Mayor and City Council of Salisbury the power to appoint its members, and that power has never been relinquished. Third, it appears that the only power the Mayor of Baltimore has over BACVA is that of making appointments; he or she has no veto or agenda-setting power. In contrast, the Zoo Commission\u2019s By-Laws grant the Mayor and City Council of Salisbury veto power over proposals submitted for approval by the Zoo Commission.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Fourth, whereas the May- or of Baltimore has no involvement with BACVA\u2019s budget, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Zoo Commission must submit a budget to the Mayor and City Council of Salisbury, \u201cconsistent with the City of Salisbury procedures on budgets,\u201d and any major departures from the budget must be approved by the Mayor and City Council. These four factors alone sufficiently differentiate the Zoo Commission from BACVA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Zoo Commission has the functional status of a government board.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The Compliance Board also considered the significance of a version of S.G. \u00a7 10-502(h)(2) that the General Assembly considered but never adopted. The Compliance Board hypothesized that, because the legislature did not insert into the statutory definition of \u201cpublic body\u201d the clause \u201c \u2018Public body\u2019 includes the multimember governing body of any corporation directly supported entirely by public funds,\u201d it is unlikely that the legislators intended to include a private corporation\u2019s board of directors. This conjecture is not the only reasonable explanation for the General Assembly\u2019s actions. For example, the legislators may have chosen not to focus on funding as the standard for inclusion within the statute, believing that, under a funding standard, certain unintended entities would be caught in the statute\u2019s net.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In 1997, a Senate Bill was proposed, and ultimately not adopted, that would have added to the definition of \u201cPublic Body\u201d in S.G. \u00a7 10-502(h)(l) the phrase \u201cA private entity that, during the fiscal year in which a meeting is held: 1. will receive the proceeds of a state bond; or 2. receives funding in the state budget.\u201d Failed Senate Bill 487 (1997). Similarly, in 1998 another Senate Bill was proposed, but not adopted, that would have added to S.G. \u00a7 10-502(h) the phrase \u201c \u2018Public body\u2019 includes any Maryland corporation that is governed by a governing body at least 50% of whose members are required by the corporation\u2019s articles of incorporation or bylaws to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>appointees of a public officer or employee.\u201d Failed Senate Bill 340 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Although it may be appropriate and useful to review a failed legislative effort in determining legislative intent, whether as part of the original legislative effort or subsequent amendments, legislative rejection is not an infallible indicator of legislative intent. In fact, it has been characterized by the Court of Appeals as \u201ca rather weak reed upon which to lean in ascertaining legislative intent.\u201d <em>Automobile Trade Association v. Insurance Commissioner, </em>292 Md. 15, 24, 437 A.2d 199 (1981); <em>see also State v. Bell, </em>351 Md. 709, 721, 720 A.2d 311 (1998). The fact that the Zoo Commission may have met more closely some or all of these proposed definitions of \u201cpublic body\u201d does not require its exclusion from the version that was adopted. The three rejected definitions and the adopted version, none of which is mutually exclusive of the others, focus on different aspects of an entity\u2019s inception, structure, management, and funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">We believe that S.G. \u00a7 10-502(h)(2) was intended to encompass, in the Compliance Board\u2019s words, \u201cthose entities that are themselves governmental or quasi-governmental \u2018board[s], commission^], or committee[s],\u2019 ... [i.e.] all boards, commissions, and committees that are part of government, even if the Governor or the local executive chose to create a particular board, commission, or committee by informal means, instead of an executive order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">This analysis neither excludes nor includes <em>all </em>\u201cpublicly funded private corporations.\u201d To permit the government to operate outside of the view of the public through private corporations, however, is an invitation to great mischief, which the Open Meetings Act seeks to curtail. Therefore, the focus of review is transactional in the sense that the analysis requires a determination of the extent to which the controlled entity actually carries on public business. A private corporate form alone does not insure that the entity functions as a private corporation. When a private corporation is organized under government control and operated to carry on public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>business, it is acting, at least, in a quasi-govemmental way. When it does, in light of the stated purposes of the statute, it is unreasonable to conclude that such an entity can use the private corporation form as a parasol to avoid the statutorily-imposed sunshine of the Open Meetings Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The Zoo Commission\u2019s corporate cloak, especially in the letting of the concessionaire\u2019s contract and the subletting of public parkland, is illusory. Like the emperor, it has no clothes. Its Articles of Incorporation, which create an ostensible private corporation but effectively place organizational control in the governmental authority of the City, do not create actual autonomy. The Zoo Commission, although incorporated, is structured to assist the City informally in the \u201coperation, management, and promotion\u201d of the Zoo, as clearly stated in the Zoo Commission\u2019s By-Laws and Articles of Incorporation. It is essentially a part of government, much like a more traditional parks and recreation board appointed by the council or the mayor of a municipality. In fact, it is listed among the City\u2019s boards and commissions as the \u201cZoo Commission.\u201d In at least one appointing resolution, it is referred to as the \u201cZoo Commission\u201d without a private corporation designation, and one council member did not vote on the appointments because she believed the public should have more opportunity to participate in \u201ccommission\u201d appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">E. Private, public, and quasi-public corporations</p>\n<p id=\"al-dedup-0\">The Zoo Commission argues that, as a private corporation in form, it should not be classified as a public body. Its functional structure, however, is more in character with a public or quasi-public corporation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">The essential difference between a public and a private corporation has long been recognized at common law. A public corporation is an instrumentality of the state, founded and owned by the state in the public interest, supported by public funds, and governed by managers deriving their authority from the state. Public institutions, such as state, county and city hospitals and asylums, are owned by the public and are devoted chiefly to public purposes. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>other hand, a corporation organized by permission of the Legislature, supported largely by voluntary contributions, and managed by officers and directors who are not representatives- of the state or any political subdivision, is a private corporation, although engaged in charitable work or performing duties similar to those of public corporations. <em>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 </em>Wheat. 518, 4 L.Ed. 629, 667; <em>Regents of University of Maryland v. Williams, </em>9 Gill &amp; J. 365, 388, 31 Am. Dec. 72; <em>Hughes v. Good Samaritan Hospital, </em>289 Ky. 123, 158 S.W.2d 159. So, a hospital, although operated solely for the benefit of the public and not for profit, is nevertheless a private institution if founded and maintained by a private corporation <em>with authority to elect its own officers and directors. Washingtonian Home of Chicago v. City of Chicago, </em>157 Ill. 414, 41 N.E. 893.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><em>Levin v. Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, </em>186 Md. 174, 178, 46 A.2d 298 (1946) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Quasi-public corporations occupy the middle ground between public and private corporations, generally having the functions of the former and the structure of the latter. The Court of Appeals, in <em>Potter v. Bethesda Fire Department, Inc., </em>309 Md. 347, 354, 524 A.2d 61 (1987), explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">a \u2018quasi-public corporation\u2019 is not <em>per </em>se public or governmental. On its face, the term connotes that it is not a public corporation but a private one. But \u2018quasi\u2019 indicates that the private corporation has \u2018some resemblance (as in function, effect or status)\u2019 to a public corporation____ \u2018[Q]uasi\u2019 bespeaks \u2018that one subject resembles another ... in certain characteristics, but that there are intrinsic and material differences between them.\u2019 [Omitting citations to dictionaries].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The Zoo Commission does not have some of the characteristics that are often present in quasi-public corporations, but the latter, as suggested by their hybrid identities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>are varied in nature, form, and function.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For instance, quasi-public corporations are usually wholly private companies acting for public benefit. \u201cA quasi-public corporation is, by its very words, not a public corporation, and thus is a private corporation. But the word \u2018quasi\u2019 ... denotes that it has the characteristic of a public corporation in function, effect or status.\u201d <em>Potter, </em>309 Md. at 357, 524 A.2d 61 (citing 1 W. Fletcher <em>&amp; </em>C. Swearingen, <em>Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations </em>\u00a7 63 at 600 (1983 Rev.Vol.)). If anything, the Zoo Commission is more public than private, its only significant private attribute being its incorporation under the general corporate laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">We need not determine that the Zoo Commission precisely matches the definition of a quasi-public or a public corporation. Certainly its actions, ownership, appointments, and managing structure are sufficiently governmental for it to fail to qualify as a strictly private corporation. Only the Zoo Commission\u2019s incorporation under the general corporation laws weighs against its designation as a traditional public entity. All of its other attributes suggest that it is, indeed, a public body under the Open Meetings Act. Its very purpose and the degree of control that the Mayor and City Council have over the Zoo Commission indicate that the latter was organized and has functioned as an extension or sub-agency of the City government.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">We consider again the public attributes of the Zoo Commission. Its purpose, stated in its By-Laws and Articles of Incorporation, is to \u201cassist the City ... in the operation, management and promotion\u201d of the Zoo. Its non-private attributes, as granted in its By-Laws and discussed above, include the following: the Mayor and City Council of Salisbury have veto power over the Zoo Commission; the Zoo Commission must present its annual budgets to the Mayor and City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Council, and any \u201cmajor departures from that budget\u201d must be approved by the Mayor and City Council; the Zoo Commission undergoes an annual audit by an auditor selected and paid by the City; the Mayor and City Council can change the By-Laws on their own initiative and can reject any changes suggested by the Zoo Commission members; the members of the Zoo Commission are appointed by and serve at the discretion of the Mayor and City Council; the Mayor and City Council can dissolve the Zoo Commission, and if they do the Zoo Commission\u2019s assets revert to the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">F. The Remedy for a Violation of the Open Meetings Act</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">On June 27, 1997, Andy\u2019s filed the present suit alleging that the Zoo Commission had violated the Open Meetings Act by choosing Flannery\u2019s bid in a closed meeting. At the Zoo Commission\u2019s meeting on August 20, 1997, the Zoo Commission board members mentioned Andy\u2019s suit and, in public session, voted to \u201creaffirm, ratify and, again, award the bid to Flannery\u2019s,\u201d according to the Zoo Commission\u2019s meeting minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">While the Open Meetings Act does not provide the public with the right to participate in all open meetings of public bodies, it does guarantee the right \u201cto observe the deliberative process and the making of decisions by the public body\u201d at those open meetings. <em>City of New Carrollton v. Rogers, </em>287 Md. 56, 72, 410 A.2d 1070 (1980). This right applies to all deliberations preceding the actual act that ratifies or effectuates the public body\u2019s intent. <em>Id. </em>at 72, 410 A.2d 1070. \u201cIt is, therefore, the deliberative and decision-making process in its entirety which must be conducted in meetings open to the public since every step of the process, including the final decision itself, constitutes the consideration or transaction of public business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 410 A.2d 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">In <em>City of New Carrollton, </em>287 Md. at 72-73, 410 A.2d 1070, the Court of Appeals cited <em>Town of Palm Beach v. Gradison, </em>296 So.2d 473 (Fla.1974), in which the Supreme Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Florida reviewed that state\u2019s open meeting (\u201csunshine\u201d) law and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">One purpose of the government in the sunshine law was to prevent at nonpublic meetings the crystallization of secret decisions to a point just short of ceremonial acceptance. Rarely could there be any purpose to a nonpublic premeet-ing conference except to conduct some part of the decisional process behind closed doors. The statute should be construed so as to frustrate all evasive devices. This can be accomplished only by embracing the collective inquiry and discussion stages within the terms of the statute, as long as such inquiry and discussion is conducted by any committee or other authority appointed and established by a governmental agency, and relates to any matter on which foreseeable action will be taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">If the Zoo Commission acted improperly by meeting in closed session, it cannot simply re-vote to legalize the illegal decision. This would, as the Court of Appeals noted in <em>City of New Carrollton, </em>eviscerate the goals of the Open Meetings Act. In the future, the Zoo Commission must generate the meeting minutes required by S.G. \u00a7 10-509(b). In certain circumstances, it may meet in closed session, S.G. \u00a7 10-508, but in those instances it must comply with the requirements of S.G. \u00a7 10-509(c) regarding minutes and recordings of closed meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The circuit court, because it found that the Open Meetings Act did not apply to the Zoo Commission, did not reach the issue of appropriate relief. In light of our determination that the Open Meetings Act applies to the Zoo Commission, we shall remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings in accordance with this decision. Such proceedings will require consideration of the provisions of S.G. \u00a7 10-510(d), but in light of our decision on the issue of delegation, discussed later in this opinion, there will be no need to declare the final action of the commission void pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 10-510(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>III. The City\u2019s Delegation to the Zoo Commission</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Andy\u2019s contends that the City\u2019s Mayor and City Council could not delegate to the Zoo Commission the authority to evaluate bids and select a concessionaire for the City Park. Andy\u2019s also argues that the Zoo Commission\u2019s lease from the City, and subsequent contract with Flannery\u2019s, was an improper franchise under the City\u2019s Charter and Code.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Zoo Commission, according to Andy\u2019s, lacks the legal authority to bind the City to a contract concerning the City Park. The City, in turn, argues that it has not surrendered its police power by permitting the Zoo Commission to choose a concessionaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">We believe, however, that focusing solely on police powers is not appropriate. <em>See Pressman v. Barnes, </em>209 Md. 544, 552, 121 A.2d 816 (1956). The more relevant consideration is whether the City has improperly delegated to the Zoo Commission a discretionary power and responsibility of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u201cMunicipal corporations have only the powers conferred upon them by the Legislature, and these are to be strictly construed. \u2018To doubt such power in a given case is to deny its existence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Duvall v. Lacy, </em>195 Md. 138, 143, 73</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>A.2d 26 (1950) (quoting <em>Hanlon v. Levin, </em>168 Md. 674, 677, 179 A. 286 (1935)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-4\">The City has no right under the law to delegate its governing power to any agency. The power of the City is prescribed in its charter, and the City Charter constitutes the measure of power that is possessed by any of its officials. To delegate such power to an independent agency would be a serious violation of the law. To recognize such delegation of power in any City department might lead to the delegation of such power in all departments, and would result in the City government being administered regardless of its charter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-5\"><em>Mugford v. City of Baltimore, </em>185 Md. 266, 271, 44 A.2d 745 (1945). As stated by the Court of Appeals, \u201cThe rule is plain and well established that legislative or discretionary powers or trust devolved by law or charter in a council or governing body cannot be delegated to others, but ministerial or administrative function may be delegated to subordinate officials.\u201d <em>City of Baltimore v. Wollman, </em>123 Md. 310, 315, 91 A. 339 (1914). In the absence of express authorization to delegate a discretionary power, all such powers must be exercised by the council even though a ministerial or administrative function related to implementing a discretionary decision may be delegated to an agent. <em>Wollman, </em>123 Md. at 316, 91 A. 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">When the delegated activities have exceeded mere ministerial tasks, however, the delegation is unlawful. <em>Hughes v. Schaefer, </em>294 Md. 653, 660-662, 452 A.2d 428 (1982) (City could not delegate to administrative \u201cTrustees\u201d the authority to select primary candidates for City loan proposals, from which City\u2019s Board of Estimates chose successful candidates; this illegal \u201cprior veto\u201d prevented the \u201ccontinuing exercise by the Board of its ultimate judgment and discretion\u201d); <em>Renshaw v. Grace, </em>155 Md. 294, 142 A. 99 (1928) (commission established by General Assembly to assist Mayor and City Council of Easton usurped the discretionary functions of Easton government when it acted without the approval of the Mayor and City Council).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Any municipal delegation of ministerial authority must contain sufficient guidelines to ensure that the officers carrying out the delegations will act in accordance with the legislative will, and not employ their own unbounded discretion. <em>Hitchcock v. Galveston, </em>96 U.S. 341, 6 Otto 341, 24 L.Ed. 659 (1877) (city council could delegate authority to chairman of \u201ccommittee on streets and alleys\u201d to contract for the construction of sidewalks, where the council specified materials to be used and preparatory work to be done); <em>Northern Central Railway Co. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>21 Md. 93 (1864) (\u201ceminently proper\u201d for Mayor and City Council to delegate, by detailed and restrictive ordinances, administration of railroad construction in city).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">As noted in 2A McQuillin, <em>The Law of Municipal Corporations </em>(3rd Ed.), \u00a7 10.38:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abe\">When a city acting within its charter powers grants franchises for the use of its ... parks and other places for public purposes, the right of control and regulation on the part of the municipal authorities must be reserved so that it may be exercised at any time for the public good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">A judicial examination of a specific grant of power necessarily considers the powers reserved to the municipality and the limits of the authority delegated. For example, in <em>Warren v. Topeka, </em>125 Kan. 524, 265 P. 78 (1928), a park vending agreement was held to be legal because the vending company had a concession, not a lease:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">[T ]he city reserv[ed] to itself and the commissioner of parks and public property full and complete control and supervision over the entire park and the property therein and the right to impose from time to time rules and regulations as to the operation of the concessions____ \u2018The concessions granted do not amount to the leasing of any part of the park ... nor do they involve the loss of control over it by the public officers.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-10\"><em>Id., </em>265 P. at 80 (citation omitted). <em>See Charlton v. Champaign Park District, </em>110 Ill.App.3d 554, 557-560, 442 N.E.2d 915, 66 Ill.Dec. 354 (1982) (no illegal delegation when park <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>district\u2019s contract with waterslide operator left park district sufficient control to protect public use of the waterslide and rest of park; reservation of power made contract a license rather than a lease); <em>Boseley v. Park District of Oak Park, </em>275 Ill. 92, 96, 113 N.E. 984 (1916) (contract to build library in park, with park district and library authority each occupying and managing portion of the building, invalid because library authority would have had \u201cexclusive right to use, occupy and control [most] of the building,\u201d in conflict with park district\u2019s grant of power over property).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">In <em>Hanlon, </em>168 Md. at 681, 179 A. 286, the Court of Appeals held invalid a rental agreement between Baltimore City\u2019s park board and a radio corporation, which would have allowed the latter to erect a broadcasting tower in Druid Hill Park. The park board, and the city itself, did not have authority to rent a portion of a public park to a private enterprise that would have prevented public use of that particular area. The Court held that \u201c[t]he power of management and control of the parks of Baltimore City conferred upon the members of the park board [by City Charter and state law] is far less comprehensive than the right of conveying such property by lease or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In the present case, the record indicates that the City Council, at its April 28, 1997 meeting, unanimously approved a Resolution that detailed a proposed lease between the City and the Zoo Commission, and authorized the Mayor to execute the lease on behalf of the City. The Council\u2019s minutes contain the salient details of the lease, but do not mention any debate or comments from Council members. The minutes indicate that, immediately after the Resolution was approved, the Zoo Commission\u2019s Chairman informed the Council that the Zoo Commission had already chosen Flannery\u2019s bid, and mentioned the specific factors that had led to that selection. The minutes contain no indication of any comment or express approval from the Council concerning Flannery\u2019s selection. On the other hand, there was no veto by the Council as provided for in the Zoo Commission\u2019s By-laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>One week later the Mayor executed a lease with the Zoo Commission. The lease agreement itself is relatively standard and reflects, in form, an arm\u2019s length transaction between two separate and independent entities. In pertinent part, the lease states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\">the leased premises shall not be used for any purpose other than a concession stand and uses related thereto. City consents to Tenant [Zoo Commission] subleasing the leased premises to a concession stand operator upon terms and conditions acceptable to City which shall include, but not be limited to, installation of a mobile concession stand ... [and trash removal provisions].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The lease specifies that it is not an exclusive lease and that the leased area may be used by the general public. It also states that the Zoo Commission will be in default under the lease if, among other events, it uses or permits the use of the premises for any purposes other than those specified in the lease, or if it \u201cshall assign this lease or any portion thereof without written consent of the City, <em>except sublease to a concession stand operator as provided for herein.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Although the Zoo Commission did not have authority to change the ultimate use of the leased property, it had authority under the lease to select the concessionaire and decide, to some degree, how the concession operation was configured. The City cites 10 McQuillin 3rd Ed., <em>The Law of Municipal Corporations, </em>\u00a7 28.53, for the proposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">\u201c[ t]he park authorities ordinarily are empowered to permit, by lease, license, or similar arrangement, the establishment within, the confines of a park of places for furnishing food and beverages, or other refreshments, and to grant privileges and concessions for conducting within the park those transactions which are customarily associated with public use and enjoyment of parks and park properties____\u201d [Citations omitted.].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">The City\u2019s ability to arrange for concessions in the City Park, however, is not in dispute. The City is the park <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>authority in this case. The Salisbury Charter grants to the City the power \u201c[t]o establish and maintain public parks and playgrounds\u201d and the power \u201c[t]o control and protect the public grounds and property of the city....\u201d Salisbury Charter \u00a7 SC5-1.A(26), (27). In addition, Maryland Code Ann., Art. 23A, \u00a7 2A(d)(2), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">Each municipal corporation shall have the authority to displace or limit competition by granting one or more franchises for any concession on, over or under property owned or leased by the municipality on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis, to control prices and rates for such franchises; to establish rules and regulations to govern the operation of the franchises ... and to lease or sublease publicly owned or leased land ... on terms to be determined by the municipality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">If the Mayor and City Council had reviewed bids and selected Flannery\u2019s, even if the Zoo Commission had reviewed the bids in an advisory capacity, we would have no disagreement with the process. Quite possibly, but we need not decide, the Zoo Commission could oversee the administration of the Flannery\u2019s agreement. The City, however, did not select Flannery\u2019s. The concession agreement is not between the City and Flannery\u2019s but is an agreement between the Zoo Commission and Flannery\u2019s. The authority that the City purports to delegate was not strictly ministerial or administrative authority but discretionary authority specifically vested in the City itself. The City delegated that authority and responsibility to a corporation, which it now insists is not an instrumentality of the City government. Although we have found that the Zoo Commission is a public instrumentality subject to the Public Information Act, and is a public body subject to the Open Meetings Act, it does not necessarily follow that it has the authority to make discretionary decisions for the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">We cannot help but observe that the City and the Zoo Commission want to have their cake and eat it too. They argue that the Zoo Commission is separate and independent from the City on issues of public access to government docu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>merits and meetings. On the other hand, on the issue of delegation they contend that the City never surrendered its discretionary, governmental functions in the sublease of City-owned property to a private vendor. The difficulty in maintaining both arguments illustrates the potential problems and ambiguities created when government seeks to carry on governmental functions, especially non-delegable functions, through ostensibly private entities. We acknowledge that there is no readily apparent bright-line rule to evaluate easily the status and appropriateness of the various permutations of public, private, and quasi-public entities that may be created through the ingenuity of public officials. Without question, such entities can provide useful and appropriate service to the public. We also acknowledge that this is a close call and that the sheerness of the veil between the City and Zoo Commission that hurts the City\u2019s position on the \u201cunit or instrumentality\u201d and \u201cpublic body\u201d issues may enhance its position on delegation. There is, however, a substantial difference between the advisory role of a parks or zoo commission in evaluating concession proposals and the needs of a particular facility, vis-a-vis the -public that it serves, and actually awarding concessions and subleasing public parkland. Under the facts of this case, we conclude that the latter is not a delegable function, and the role of the Zoo Commission was not merely ministerial or administrative.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">IV. Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Andy\u2019s, the Zoo Commission, and the City each contend that the trial court erred by not awarding them attorneys\u2019 fees. The Open Meetings Act provides that a court <em>may </em>\u201cassess against any party reasonable counsel fees and other litigation expenses that the party who prevails in the action incurred----\u201d S.G. \u00a7 10 \u2014 510(d)(5)(i). The Public Information Act states, \u201cIf the court determines that the complainant has substantially prevailed, the court <em>may </em>assess against a defendant governmental unit reasonable counsel fees and other litigation costs that the complainant reasonably incurred.\u201d S.G. \u00a7 10 \u2014 623(f) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by not awarding attorneys\u2019 fees. In the trial court, each party prevailed on a portion of the litigation. Obviously, the arguments presented were meritorious and not easily resolved. In light of our decision regarding the Open Meetings Act, however, when the circuit court receives this case on remand, it would be appropriate to re-consider the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees as to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Assessments of attorneys\u2019 fees under the Open Meetings Act do not depend on a finding that the violation of the Act was willful. <em>Wesley Chapel Bluemount Ass\u2019n v. Baltimore County, </em>347 Md. 125, 149, 699 A.2d 434 (1997). Such assessments, however, are not automatic upon a finding that a violation occurred. <em>Id., </em>at 149-150, 699 A.2d 434.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">Courts considering [Open Meetings Act] fee assessments need to take into account, among other things, whether, how, and when the issue of a closed session or other prospective violation was presented to the public body, the basis, if any, the public body gave for concluding that its action was permissible under the Act, whether that basis was a reasonable one under the law and the circumstances, whether the amounts claimed are reasonable, and the extent to which all parties acted in good faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\"><em>Id., </em>347 Md. at 150, 699 A.2d 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Upon remand, the circuit court should consider these factors in deciding on an assessment of counsel fees and litigation costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">DECISION OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMI-CO COUNTY AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS DECISION.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY ZOO COMMISSION AND <em>l </em>BY THE CITY OF SALISBURY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\">.
