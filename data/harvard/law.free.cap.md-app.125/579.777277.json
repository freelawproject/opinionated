(\u201cSuburban\u201d), sued ap-pellee, the Maryland Health Resources Planning Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, seeking to void the Commission\u2019s adoption of the Open Heart Surgery Section of the State Health Plan (the \u201cproposed OHS Section\u201d). Suburban alleged that the Commission violated the Open Meetings Act, Md.Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol., 1998 Supp.), \u00a7 10-501 <em>et. seq. </em>of the State Government Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d), by deliberating about the proposed OHS Section in a meeting closed to the public. The Commission moved to dismiss Suburban\u2019s complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. After a hearing on January 6, 1998, the circuit court granted the motion for summary judgment by Order on January 14, 1998. Suburban appeals from the circuit court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The circuit court succinctly explained the factual background to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">The Maryland Health Resources Planning Commission not only establishes the State\u2019s health plan, but it also reviews requests by health facilities to provide specific health services. Md. Health General Code Ann. \u00a7 19-101, <em>et seq. </em>According to the statutory scheme, the State health plan must include (1) a description of the components that should comprise the health care system; (2) the goals and policies for Maryland\u2019s health care system; (3) identification of unmet needs, excess services, minimum access criteria, and services to be regionalized; (4) an assessment of the financial resources required and available for the health care system; and (5) the methodologies, standards, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>criteria for certificate of need review. Md. Health General Code Ann. \u00a7 19-114(a)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">On April 1, 1996, Suburban and Holy Cross Hospital of Silver Spring, Inc. filed letters of intent in which they proposed establishing new open heart surgery programs in the Washington Metropolitan Region. On September 27, 1996, they filed the appropriate Certificate of Need applications. The Commission, relying upon the notion that there was not a need for additional open heart surgery programs in the area, denied both applications. On June 18, 1997, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City reversed the Commission\u2019s decision and ordered the Commission to review the merits of the Suburban and Holy Cross applications \u201cin a prompt and timely fashion.\u201d While an appeal of the Court\u2019s order is pending in the Court of Special Appeals, Suburban filed a modified application with the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">Subsequently, the Commission updated and revised the State Health Plan Chapter on Cardiac Surgery and Therapeutic Catheterization Services. After extensive public comment, several public hearings and finally publication in the Maryland Register, the Commission considered the proposed Open Heart Chapter regulation for promulgation as a final rule at its November 11,1997 meeting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">After discussion of the proposed Open Heart Surgery (\u201cOHS\u201d) Section at the meeting, Commissioner Joan Harris moved for the adoption of the OHS Section as proposed, a version that would have precluded approval of a new open heart surgery program in the Washington metropolitan region (the \u201cRegion\u201d). Before any action was taken on that motion, Commissioner Marvin Schneider, M.D., proposed an amendment (the \u201cSchneider Amendment\u201d) to alter the method of measuring open heart surgery program capacity in the proposed OHS Section, thereby permitting additional open heart programs in the Region if certain criteria were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">After more discussion, Chairman George S. Malouf, M.D., called for a vote on the Schneider Amendment. After six of the nine commissioners voted in favor of its adoption, James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Stanton, the Commission\u2019s Executive Director, interrupted the vote to urge Commissioners who voted for the Schneider Amendment to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Without finishing the vote, the Commissioners discussed the possible need to republish the entire proposed OHS Section in the Maryland Register as a proposed rule if the Schneider Amendment was adopted, and asked C. Frederic Ryland, an Assistant Attorney General and General Counsel to the Commission, if adding the Schneider Amendment would necessitate republishing the entire proposed OHS Section. Mr. Ryland stated that the promulgation process would have to be repeated. Several Commissioners and staff members who opposed the Schneider Amendment opined that adding the Amendment would require additional public hearings. Chairman Malouf eventually called for a second vote on the Schneider Amendment. Two Commissioners changed their position, resulting in a five to four vote against the Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Commissioner Schneider requested that the Commission stay the execution of its decision until Mr. Ryland could provide a \u201cmore considered thoughtful opinion\u201d about the procedural ramifications of altering the proposed OHS Section. Commissioner Ruth Spector then moved for reconsideration of the vote that rejected the Schneider Amendment. Before action was taken on that motion, the Commissioners unanimously voted to meet in a closed \u201cexecutive session\u201d to obtain advice from counsel. The Commission held a thirty-minute closed session. The meeting minutes do not detail any of the events of the closed session.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">After the Commission returned to public session, Chairman Malouf brought up the pending motion to reconsider, which Commissioner Spector immediately withdrew. Chairman Malouf stated that the Schneider Amendment was defeated and that the Commission would consider the original motion, i.e., the proposed OHS Section, without any amendment. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Commission then voted seven to two to approve the unamended proposed OHS Section.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Commissioner Walter Hall immediately stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">Mr. Chairman, I would like to request that we ask the staff to consider a petition to amend the section of the plan and examine a number of issues specifically focused on the hospitals and environmental suburbs of the District of Columbia[,] issues such as the relationship of the rates set by our own cost review commission for the Maryland hospitals, vis-vis [sic] the costs and charges within the District of Columbia hospitals. Also issues such as an analysis of what the region really is as far as the hospitals in the Maryland suburbs of the District of Columbia that are located in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s County and so forth and I think there will be a number of additional analysis [sic] that the staff may want to consider as they look at this issue and I think that I would like to put forward that request and ask the staff if they would consider that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">[Chairman Malouf]: Smokey [Mr. Stanton], did you get the petition in writing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">Mr. Stanton: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The request was unanimously approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Suburban sued the Commission, alleging that, instead of merely receiving legal advice in the closed meeting, the Commission violated Maryland\u2019s Open Meetings Act by discussing substantively the Schneider Amendment, the proposed OHS Section, and a petition process to assess the need for additional OHS programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">Suburban presents three questions for our review, which we have re-worded and consolidated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-12\">1. Must Suburban demonstrate that Commission members knew they were violating the Open Meetings Act ... to maintain an enforcement action under State Government Article \u00a7 10-510?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>2. Did Suburban satisfy its burden of demonstrating sufficient grounds to avoid summary judgment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">We answer the first question in the negative, and the second in the positive. Accordingly, we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">A trial court shall enter judgment in favor of or against a party moving for summary judgment if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Md. Rule 2 \u2014 501(e). When considering a summary judgment motion, a trial court makes no findings of fact. <em>Dobbins et ux. v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, </em>338 Md. 341, 345, 658 A.2d 675 (1995). The trial court decides whether a genuine issue of material fact exists to prevent the entry of summary judgment. <em>Fearnow v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co. of Maryland, et al., </em>104 Md.App. 1, 48, 655 A.2d 1 (1995), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part, </em>342 Md. 363, 676 A.2d 65 (1996). When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a summary judgment motion, we examine \u201csimply whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Products, Inc., et al., </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993) <em>(citing Heat &amp; Power v. Air Products, </em>320 Md. 584, 591, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990)). An appellate court ordinarily should review a grant of summary judgment only on the grounds relied upon by the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Maryland Rule 8-131(a); <em>Blades v. Woods, </em>338 Md. 475, 478, 659 A.2d 872 (1995); <em>Gross et ux. v. Sussex Inc., et al., </em>332 Md. 247, 254 n. 3, 630 A.2d 1156 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>A grant of a summary judgment motion is appropriate only when the moving party meets a two-part test. <em>Fearnow, </em>104 Md.App. at 48, 655 A.2d 1 <em>(citing Gross, </em>332 Md. at 255, 630 A.2d 1156).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">The movant for summary judgment must (i) clearly demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact, and (ii) demonstrate that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">To satisfy the first part of this test, the moving party must present the material facts necessary to obtain judgment and demonstrate that there is no dispute as to any of those facts. A material fact is one that will \u201csomehow affect the outcome of the case.\u201d It is the burden of the movant to \u201cidentify the portions of the record that \u2018demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">Once the movant makes this showing, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to identify \u201cwith particularity the material facts that are disputed.\u201d Md. Rule 2-501(b). Neither general allegations of facts in dispute nor a mere scintilla of evidence will suffice to support the non-movant\u2019s position; there must be evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find for the non-moving party. In other words, the opposing party \u201c \u2018must do more than simply show there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u2019 \u201d In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court must consider the motion and response submitted by the parties in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. Thus, summary judgment is inappropriate where the evidence is susceptible to more than one inference. Furthermore, the non-moving party \u201c \u2018is to be given the benefit of all reasonable doubts in determining whether a genuine issue exists.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\"><em>Fearnow, </em>104 Md.App. at 48-50, 655 A.2d 1 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">In an action pursuant to the Open Meetings Act, the public body is presumed to have complied with the Act, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>complainant has the burden of proving the violation. S.G. \u00a7 10 \u2014 510(c). Suburban argues that the Commission improperly conducted deliberations and debate in its closed \u201cexecutive session\u201d on November 11, 1997. Maryland\u2019s Open Meetings Act provides, in pertinent part, that a public body may meet in closed session to \u201cconsult with counsel to obtain legal advice,\u201d S.G. \u00a7 10-508(a)(7). State Government \u00a7 10-508(b) states that \u201c[a] public body that meets in closed session under this section may not discuss or act on any matter not permitted under subsection (a) of this section.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe exceptions in subsection (a) of this section [allowing closed meetings] shall be strictly construed in favor of open meetings of public bodies.\u201d S.G. \u00a7 10-508(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Before a public body meets in a closed session, \u201cthe presiding officer shall: (i) conduct a recorded vote on the closing of the session; and (ii) make a written statement of the reason for closing the meeting, including a citation of the authority under this section, and a listing of the topics to be discussed.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> S.G. \u00a7 10 \u2014 508(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The Commission contends that Suburban cannot maintain an action under S.G. \u00a7 10-510 because Suburban cannot prove that the Commission \u201cwillfully\u201d failed to comply with the Open Meetings Act. State Government \u00a7 10-510 provides that, if a public body fails to comply with \u00a7 10-508, a circuit court, upon petition of an adversely affected person, may consolidate proceedings, issue an injunction, or determine the applicability of the Open Meetings Act to a public body. In addition, the court may, \u201cif the court finds that a public body willfully failed to comply with \u00a7 10-505, \u00a7 10-506, \u00a7 10-507, or \u00a7 10~509(c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>of this subtitle and that no other remedy is adequate, declare void the final action of the public body.\u201d S.G. \u00a7 10-510(d)(4). The Commission suggests that \u201cwillfully\u201d is equivalent to \u201cknowingly\u201d and that only a conscious decision to violate the statute merits the voiding of a public body\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The Commission\u2019s arguments fail in several respects. First, the requirement that a public body must have acted \u201cwillfully\u201d only applies to attempts to <em>void </em>the public body\u2019s acts. The circuit court interpreted \u201cwillfully\u201d as \u201cknowingly,\u201d and then found that the Commission had therefore not willfully violated S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 10-505, 506, 507, or 509(c). Because of this conclusion, the trial court refused the discretionary option, offered to it by S.G. \u00a7 10-510(d)(4), of voiding the Commission\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">State Government \u00a7 10-510(d)(2), (3), (5), and (6), however, which provide for injunctive relief, declaratory relief, attorneys\u2019 fees, and \u201cany other appropriate relief,\u201d respectively, do not require the same finding that the public body \u201cwillfully failed\u201d to comply with the Open Meetings Act that \u00a7 10-510(d)(4) requires. <em>See Wesley Chapel Bluemount </em>Asso<em>ciation, et al. v. Baltimore County, </em>347 Md. 125, 149, 699 A.2d 434 (1997). In addition to being apparent on the face of \u00a7 10-510(d), this is evident from the public policy reality that enjoining a public body\u2019s action, or issuing a declaratory judgment action, will be less disruptive and more conducive to a balance between citizen complaints and governmental efficiency than would be voiding the public body\u2019s actions. Simply put, under the Open Meetings Act, injunctions and declaratory relief are available for a lower threshold of violation than that needed to void a public body\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The trial court quoted \u00a7 10-510(d)(4) and then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">The Court may not void the [Commission\u2019s] decision unless it finds that the violation of the Open Meetings Act was willful which has been defined as a voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty, such that the \u201cviolator knew that what he or she was doing was illegal.\u201d <em>Reisch v. State, </em>107 Md.App. 464, 477, 482 [668 A.2d 970] (1995). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>requires the Maryland Health Resources Planning Commission to have had knowledge of the legal requirement and a specific intent to disobey the law. <em>Reisch </em>at 476 [668 A.2d 970]. Therefore, <em>even if the Court accepts all of Suburban Hospital\u2019s allegations as fact, Plaintiff [Suburban] failed to demonstrate that a willful violation of the Act occurred. Consequently, the Court </em>in applying the Act to the present facts <em>can not void the decision </em>by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The trial court then discussed the administrative remedies potentially available to Suburban, and proceeded to grant the Commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The trial court, however, never discussed Suburban\u2019s requests for attorneys\u2019 fees, declaratory relief, or injunctive relief, nor did it acknowledge that, under the Open Meetings Act, those remedies do not require the \u201cwillful\u201d standard used for requests to <em>void </em>a public body\u2019s action. The trial court\u2019s finding that Suburban had not willfully violated the Open Meetings Act, even if correct, was not sufficient by itself to allow the court to grant summary judgment as to Suburban\u2019s requests for attorneys\u2019 fees and injunctive and declaratory relief. Without additional findings by the trial court that the Commission did not violate the Act at all, Suburban\u2019s requests for these modes of relief enable it to avoid summary judgment on those issues. In other words, the circuit court, in its Order, appears to have applied the more stringent \u201cwillful\u201d standard to <em>all </em>of Suburban\u2019s desired remedies, not just to the request to void the Commission\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">We note that summary judgment in a declaratory judgment action is \u201cthe exception rather than the rule.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Scherr, et al., </em>101 Md. App. 690, 695, 647 A.2d 1297 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>337 Md. 214, 652 A.2d 670 (1995) (quoting <em>Loewenthal v. Security Insurance Co. of Hartford, </em>50 Md.App. 112, 117, 436 A.2d 493 (1981)). For instance, in a declaratory judgment action concerning a contract dispute, summary judgment may be granted when there is no dispute as to the <em>terms </em>of the documents in issue, but only disagreement as to the <em>legal interpretation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>of those terms. <em>Nationwide, </em>101 Md.App. at 695, 647 A.2d 1297. In the present case, however, the parties dispute both the legal interpretation of the term \u201cwillfully\u201d in the Open Meetings Act and the factual events that may or may not have constituted a violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Second, \u201cwillfully,\u201d in this context, is more accurately defined as \u201cnon-accidentally.\u201d State Government \u00a7 10-510, as just discussed, provides for judicial enforcement of several remedies against a public body when the Open Meetings Act is violated. In contrast to S.G. \u00a7 10-510, S.G. \u00a7 10-511 provides that a court may impose a civil penalty of up to $100 on a public body member only if the member \u201cwillfully participates in a meeting of the body <em>with knowledge </em>that the meeting is being held in violation of [the Act].\u201d (Emphasis added). Members of a public body may only incur a civil penalty if they acted willfully <em>and </em>knew that they were violating the Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 10-511 imposes individual liability on members of the body, a more personally intrusive penalty than the general curative remedies established by \u00a7 10-510 for the public body as a whole. It is therefore consistent that \u00a7 10-511 requires a higher standard of violative conduct than \u00a7 10-510, which has no scienter requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>If we were to read \u00a7. 10-511 as prohibiting and punishing the same conduct that is violative of \u00a7 10-510, the \u201cwith knowledge\u201d phrase in \u00a7 10-511 becomes mere surplus-age. Viewing terms as surplusage is a disfavored method of statutory construction. <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore et al. v. Hackley, et al., </em>300 Md. 277, 283, 477 A.2d 1174 (1984). Statutes should be read \u201cso that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523-524, 636 A.2d 448 (1994) (citations omitted). Reading \u00a7 10-510 and \u00a7 10-511 with regard for each term, the different phrasing in the two sections implies that they present different standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">The legislative decision to impose personal penalties on members of public bodies only if those members knew they were violating the Act is consistent with the Act\u2019s policy goals. The Act observes that it is \u201cessential to the maintenance of a democratic society\u201d that public business is performed in public and that citizens are able to observe the deliberations and decision-making of public officials. S.G. \u00a7 10-501(a). Keeping government operations accessible and visible to the public ensures the accountability of the government to the citizens and increases the faith of the public in their representatives. S.G. \u00a7 10-501(b). To support these goals, the policy of the State is to provide the public with adequate notice and opportunity to observe meetings of public bodies. S.G. \u00a7 10-501 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The Act is not primarily a means to impose strictures on individual members of public bodies; it exists, rather, to guide the procedural practice of public bodies as complete entities responsible to and available to the public. When a public body violates the Act, the Act permits a court to enjoin or void the actions the public body took at the impermissible meeting. These remedies are not in response to the content of the actions taken at the meetings, but to the procedural steps from which the actions emanated. It is the public body as a whole that is being regulated. It is consistent, therefore, that only when the members of the public body display scienter or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>evil intent is it appropriate for a court to impose personal penalties on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The circuit court, as quoted above, stated that it could not void the Commission\u2019s decision unless it found that the violation of the Open Meetings Act was willful, and stated further that willful \u201chas been defined as a voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty, such that the \u2018violator knew that what he or she was doing was illegal.\u2019 This requires the ... Commission to have had knowledge of the legal requirement and a specific intent to disobey the law.\u201d (Citing <em>Reisch v. State, </em>107 Md.App. 464, 476-477, 668 A.2d 970 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 332, 675 A.2d 993 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In <em>Reisch, </em>we reversed a circuit court conviction because the State failed to prove a willful and knowing violation of a home improvement licensing law. We stated there that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">[notwithstanding appellant\u2019s admitted failure to obtain a home improvement license, we agree that the evidence was insufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction. We rest our conclusion on the State\u2019s failure to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Reisch acted <em>knowingly and wilfully. </em>Based on express statutory language, <em>we reject any claim that the terms \u201cknowingly and wilfully\u201d are mere surplus-age </em>or that the home improvement provisions in issue impose strict criminal liability. We explain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The Legislature specifically predicated a criminal penalty for violation of Maryland\u2019s home improvement laws on a <em>knowing and wilful </em>violation, referencing that language in several key places in the home improvement laws....</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 474, 668 A.2d 970 (emphasis added; citations omitted). In <em>Reisch </em>we did not specifically differentiate \u201cwillfully\u201d from \u201cknowingly;\u201d the terms were used conjunctively, and not separately, in the statute pertinent to that case. That licensing law was intended to punish violations by individual contractors and imposed criminal penalties.

Machiz, </em>183 F.Supp. 719, 725 (D.Md.1960), in which the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\"><em>The meaning of the word \u201cwillful\u201d depends upon the context in which it appears; and particularly the kind and nature of the statute. </em>Where the term is used in connection with the statute defining criminal conduct, the word \u201cwillful\u201d usually requires something more than deliberate and intentional as opposed to accidental and includes an intent of a wrongful or evil purpose. <em>But where the statute relates to a civil rather than a criminal penalty the meaning of the word connotes only voluntary and intentional action as contrasted with accidental. </em>Thus, in <em>United States v. Illinois Central R. Co., </em>303 U.S. 239, 58 S.Ct. 533, 535, 82 L.Ed. 773 (1938), where the statute imposed a penalty on a common carrier for failure to water livestock after thirty-six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>hours, it was held that the word \u201cwillful\u201d did not require proof of an evil intent but that it is sufficient if the failure to act was either intentional or plainly indifferent to the requirements of the statute. [Emphasis added; citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><em>See American Surety Co. of New York v. Sullivan, </em>7 F.2d 605, 606 (2nd Cir.1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In <em>Kansas v. Palmgren, </em>231 Kan. 524, 646 P.2d 1091, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>459 U.S. 1081, 103 S.Ct. 562, 74 L.Ed.2d 927 (1982), the Kansas Supreme Court interpreted the Kansas Open Meetings Law\u2019s provision that a civil penalty could be imposed only if a public body member \u201cknowingly violates\u201d the law. Observing that Kansas\u2019s Open Meetings Law \u201cis remedial in nature and therefore subject to broad construction in order to carry out the stated legislative intent,\u201d the Kansas Supreme Court held that a knowing violation was one caused by willful or purposeful conduct and did not require actual knowledge of wrongdoing. <em>Palmgren, </em>231 Kan. at 531, 646 P.2d 1091. The Kansas Supreme Court therefore imposed a construction even broader than the one we choose, because the court held that \u201cknowingly\u201d did not mean actual knowledge of wrongdoing, and in the present case we are assigning the same definition to the term \u201cwillfully.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Maryland\u2019s Open Meetings Act\u2019s civil penalty provision differs from the Kansas law by requiring \u201cknowledge that the meeting is being held in violation of [the Act]\u201d only before individual liability can be established. S.G. \u00a7 10-511. Unlike \u00a7 10-511, Maryland\u2019s provision for voiding a public body\u2019s act does not require egress knowledge of a violation. S.G. \u00a7 10-510(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">In light of the public policy expressed in the statute and the language of the statute, we conclude that \u201cwillfully\u201d as used in S.G. \u00a7 10-510 does not require knowledge that the meeting actually violates the Open Meetings Act, but instead refers to intentional conduct. We also note that the Commission\u2019s Executive Director, James Stanton, testified in his deposition that he was well aware of the Open Meetings Act\u2019s require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ments. Even without scienter, an argument could be made that he therefore made a \u201cknowing\u201d violation of the Act because he knew the Act\u2019s requirements and nevertheless allegedly persisted with the policy discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In order to survive the Commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Suburban, as the non-moving party, must demonstrate that, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Suburban, the Commission is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Suburban opposed the summary judgment motion by referring to the deposition testimony of Richard McAlee, an attorney representing Holy Cross Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Mr. McAlee testified that Commissioner Ruth Spector called him the day after the Commission\u2019s November 11,1997 meeting and told him that, during the closed session, the Commissioners discussed a proposal for a petition process for hospitals wishing to amend the State health plan. Adopting this petition process would allow the proposed OHS Section to be approved immediately, without change. Mr. McAlee said Commissioner Spector told him that the discussion was conducted mainly by three commissioners and Mr. Stanton, the Commission\u2019s Executive Director. Mr. McAlee described it as a \u201cdiscussion of the need for cardiac surgery in Montgomery County and how to deal with that issue as a policy matter.\u201d According to Mr. McAlee\u2019s account of Commissioner Spector\u2019s statements, the Commission\u2019s attorney was not an active participant in this conversation and the focus was deliberative, rather than consultative.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Mr. Stanton gave deposition testimony stating that such a policy discussion did not occur in the closed meeting and that commissioners\u2019 comments in the meeting were in the form of questions to counsel. He also stated, however, that Mr. Ryland, the Commission\u2019s attorney, only spoke for four or five minutes during the thirty-minute meeting. Commissioner Spector\u2019s affidavit did not discuss the events or the substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>of the closed meeting; it simply denied that she discussed with Mr. McAlee what had occurred in the closed meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The Commission contends that Mr. McAlee\u2019s testimony about Commissioner Specter\u2019s statements is inadmissible hearsay. Md. Rule 5-803 provides that statements by a party opponent, offered against that opponent, are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">Admissions are the \u2018words or acts of a party-opponent, or of his predecessor or representative, offered as evidence against him.\u2019 Admissions are considered to be substantive evidence of the facts admitted. A party may offer into evidence against his opponent anything said by him as long as it illustrates some inconsistency with the facts now asserted by the opponent in pleading or in testimony. Admissions do not have to be against the speaker\u2019s interest when made.... [T]he speaker need not be, and rarely is, unavailable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\"><em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Kuhl, </em>296 Md. 446, 455, 463 A.2d 822 (1983) (citations omitted); <em>Kirkland v. State, </em>75 Md.App. 49, 57, 540 A.2d 490, <em>cert. denied, </em>313 Md. 506, 545 A.2d 1344 (1988) (\u201c[A] party is free to introduce anything in the nature of an admission an opposing party has said or done which is relevant to the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Among the admissions admissible under Md. Rule 5-803(a) are (1) the party\u2019s own statement, in either an individual or representative capacity; (2) a statement of which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth; (3) a statement by a person authorized by the party to make a statement concerning the subject; (4) a statement by the party\u2019s agent or employee made during the agency or employment relationship concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or (5) a statement by a co-conspirator of the party in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>As a member of the Commission who was present at the meeting at issue, Commissioner Speetor\u2019s statements, as allegedly recounted to Mr. McAlee, are certainly relevant to the case. If believed, they could establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for a violation of the Open Meetings Act by the Commission as a whole and by the members individually. Under Md. Rule 5-803, they are admissible as party admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Because we must consider the motion and response in the light most beneficial to Suburban, for the purposes of this appeal we must consider Mr. McAlee\u2019s testimony to be true. Findings of fact and credibility determinations are not to be made. The crucial issue then becomes whether this testimony is sufficient to defeat the Commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment, i.e., whether the Commission\u2019s discussion exceeded the rationale allowed by S.G. \u00a7 10-508(a)(7) for a closed meeting: \u201cconsult[ing] with counsel to obtain legal advice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We conclude that, viewing Commissioner Spector\u2019s affidavit and the testimony of Mr. McAlee and Mr. Stanton in the light most favorable to Suburban, the discussions Mr. McAlee described exceed consultation to obtain legal advice. A fact-finder could choose to believe Mr. Stanton and Commissioner Specter, and disbelieve Mr. McAlee, but that is not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>issue we face. Suburban\u2019s pleadings and deposition testimony were sufficient to overcome the Commission\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment. As noted above, the circuit court did not resolve Suburban\u2019s requests for declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The circuit court concluded its Memorandum Opinion by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOD\">Furthermore, even if the Maryland Health Resources Commission violated the Open Meetings Act, an alternative and suitable remedy is available to Suburban Hospital. Private entities not satisfied with the public policy derived from legislative forums are permitted to petition the appropriate Commission to amend their actions. Here, the facts indicate that Suburban Hospital failed to petition the Commission to amend their plans resulting from the November 11, 1997 meeting. Consequently, even if the Court found a willful violation of the Open Meetings Act, it could not void the final actions of the Commission because an alternative remedy is available to Suburban Hospital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The Open Meetings Act does not require an aggrieved party to petition the public body in question to correct its allegedly illegal conduct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Act merely states that \u201c[t]his section does not <em>affect or prevent </em>the use of any other available remedies,\u201d \u00a7 10 \u2014 510(a)(3) (emphasis added); it does not <em>require </em>the use of other available remedies. Section 10-510(d)(4) states that \u201c[a court may,] <em>if the court finds </em>that a public body willfully failed to comply with \u00a7 10-505, \u00a7 10-506, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>\u00a7 10-507, or \u00a7 10-509(c) of this subtitle and <em>that no other remedy is adequate, </em>declare void the final action of the public body.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This section grants the court the ability to decide whether other remedies are adequate; it does not bar plaintiffs from bringing Open Meetings Act issues before the court. We note, as we did above, that \u00a7 10-510(d)(4) applies only to the <em>voiding of </em>public body actions, and not to injunctions, declaratory relief, or attorneys\u2019 fees. Even were a court to find that adequate alternative remedies existed, the court could still grant the three latter forms of relief, all of which Suburban has requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">It is insufficient, however, to assign parties aggrieved by illegal actions of public bodies the task of asking those public bodies to redress their own actions. The Open Meetings Act and other statutes that detail proper governmental procedures exist so that parties with legitimate grounds for complaint can ask the courts to enjoin illegal acts or declare those acts to be illegal and/or void. If the Commission violated the Open Meetings Act, its actions were illegal, and the issue was improperly characterized in the Memorandum Opinion as mere dissatisfaction \u201cwith the public policy derived\u201d from the Commission\u2019s actions. Petitioning a public body that has just committed an illegal act to rectify that act will not always, and perhaps rarely, be an adequate alternative remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.

The exception to this rule is that, when \"the alternative ground is one upon which the circuit court would have had no discretion to deny summary judgment, summary judgment may be granted for a reason not relied upon by the trial court.\u201d <em>Davis v.

The Commission apparently did not perform the second of these requirements. Administrative violations of this type subject a public body\u2019s actions to the possibility of injunctive or declaratory relief, but they do not render them susceptible to voiding. S.G. \u00a7 10-510(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b616-5\">. The Commission attempts to explain the different standards of \u00a7 10-510 and \u00a7 10-511 by arguing that the phrase \"participates in a meeting\u201d in the latter section does not refer to attendance at the meeting, but only to some greater level of participation in the meeting. The Commission does not endeavor to define this \"more than presence\u201d standard for \"participates\u201d. In <em>Board of County Commissioners of St. Mary\u2019s County v. Guyther, et al., </em>40 Md.App. 244, 246, 389 A.2d 1372 (1978), we held that, for both municipal and private corporations, \"a person present but incompetent to act because of disqualification [e.g. because of a conflict of interest] cannot serve as a constituent part of a quorum.\u201d In other words, the disqualified board member was disqualified not just for voting purposes but also for the purpose of being counted to establish a quorum. This reasoning suggests'That attendance <em>is </em>participation. The Commission argues that this conclusion \"would force individual members of a public body to give up their right to be <em>present </em>at closed sessions they believe are improper.\u201d (Emphasis in original). Under the Open Meetings Act, not only do members of a public body have no right to be present at improper closed sessions, but it would appear that they have a duty not to participate, and therefore, not to attend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b619-6\">. We have recognized that for the purposes of the Maryland Wiretap Act the \"term 'willfully' means 'more than intentional or voluntary. It denotes either an intentional violation <em>or a reckless disregard of a known legal duty.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Fearnow, supra, </em>104 Md.App. at 23-24, 655 A.2d 1 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Earley </em>v. <em>Smoot, </em>846 F.Supp. 451, 453 (D.Md. 1994), and <em>Benford v. ABC, </em>649 F.Supp. 9, 10 (D.Md. 1986)). We strictly limited that definition\u2019s application, however, to cases involving the Maryland Wiretap Act, and stated that the conclusion was driven by federal criminal caselaw. Indeed, \"[ojur holding should not be read as an abrogation, broadening, or modification of how Maryland courts have previously construed wilfulness in other legal contexts.\u201d <em>Fearnow, </em>at 23-24, n. 20, 655 A.2d 1. The Commission conceded that it has a legal duty to comply with the Open Meetings Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b619-7\">. As noted above, the Court in <em>Wesley Chapel </em>used a different standard to review requests for injunctive relief and requests to void the public body\u2019s actions, because \u00a7 10-510(d)(4) uses \"willfully.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b622-8\">.
