Md. Rule 5-613(a) and (b). In criminal cases, however, there is what has become known as the <em>Spence-Bradley </em>exception to this general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">[ A] defendant is denied a fair trial if the State with full knowledge that its questions will contribute nothing to its case, questions a witness concerning an independent area of inquiry in order to open the door for impeachment and introduce a prior inconsistent [oral] statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-11\"><em>Bradley v. State, </em>333 Md. 593, 604, 636 A.2d 999 (1994); <em>Spence v. State, </em>321 Md. 526, 530, 583 A.2d 715 (1991); See also <em>Stewart v. State, </em>342 Md. 230, 242-243, 674 A.2d 944 (1996). This appeal presents the question of whether there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>an \u201cexcited utterance\u201d exception to the <em>Spence-Bradley </em>exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, a jury (Hon. James J. Lombardi, presiding) convicted Crawley McCoy Foreman, appellant, of child abuse and second degree assault. Appellant concedes that the evidence was sufficient to establish that he committed those offenses against his 11 year old son. He contends, however, that he is entitled to a new trial because</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">I. THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN PERMITTING THE STATE TO IMPEACH ITS OWN WITNESS WITH PRIOR INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS THAT WERE OTHERWISE INADMISSIBLE AS HEARSAY.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">II. THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN ADMITTING HEARSAY STATEMENTS OF THE VICTIM AS TO THE IDENTITY OF HIS ABUSER UNDER THE EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE RELATING TO STATEMENTS MADE FOR MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">III. THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN REFUSING TO PERMIT THE DEFENSE TO INTRODUCE INTO EVIDENCE CERTAIN SCHOOL RECORDS OF THE VICTIM ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEY WERE HEARSAY.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">The State\u2019s first witness was Corporal Joseph Palmieri of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department. The following transpired during his direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-12\">Q. You may use your notes to refresh your memory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-13\">A. I was en route to work. I was working the midnight shift at that time. I heard a call go out over the air, over the radio for a domestic assault which was either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>occurring at that time or just occurred at [the residence of appellant, his wife, and the victim].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\">Q. What happened when you arrived?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">A. Yes, sir. When I arrived on the scene the victim, a juvenile, approached me along with his mother. The mother being [appellant\u2019s wife].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">Q. Can you describe what they looked like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">A. The female was very upset. It appeared that she had been crying, appeared very distraught. The juvenile ... had bruises and puffiness on his face.... I do recall a very large lump, very large, almost softball size on the baek of his head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">Q. And what was his emotional state?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">A. He was upset, very very upset.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">THE WITNESS: He said his father was upset at him and his father had kicked him several times in the face, head and rib area. I\u2019m getting all this information from him. He said ... his father continued this attack by slapping him several times in the face and banging his head, the juvenile\u2019s head into the closet wall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-11\">Q. And where was the mother as the [victim] was telling you all this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-12\">A. She was standing right along side of him. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">Corporal Palmieri was followed to the stand by Martha Mangino, a volunteer fire department emergency medical technician who had also responded to the call. According to EMT Mangino, when the victim entered the ambulance, he told the ambulance attendants \u201cthat his father had punched him in the face and kicked him in the chest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">The jurors then heard testimony from the victim and from his mother, appellant\u2019s wife. These witnesses had refused the prosecutor\u2019s request for an interview. On the stand, both were hostile to the State. According to them, on the occasion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>at issue the victim (1) sustained his injuries when he was \u201cbeaten up\u201d at school, and (2) was not injured by appellant, who merely \u201cslapped\u201d the victim after the victim\u2019s mother insisted that the victim be disciplined for continued misbehavior in school. After questioning these witnesses about what they said at the scene of the crime, the State then \u201crecalled\u201d Corporal Palmieri and EMT Mangino.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Corporal Palmieri testified that upon his arrival appellant\u2019s wife told him that the victim was \u201cslapped\u201d and \u201ckicked\u201d and \u201cpushed into the wall\u201d by appellant. EMT Mangino testified that appellant\u2019s wife told her that the victim had been \u201cpunched in the face\u201d and \u201ckicked ... in the chest\u201d by appellant. According to appellant, evidence of what the victim and the victim\u2019s mother said at the scene of the crime was inadmissible under <em>Spence, supra, </em>and <em>Bradley, supra. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In both <em>Spence </em>and <em>Bradley, </em>the prosecutor knew before the witness took the stand that the witness would repudiate a prior statement or a critical portion of a prior statement. In each of those cases, the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination about the alleged inconsistency was a mere subterfuge; the trial judge and all counsel knew in advance that the witness would deny having made the alleged prior oral statement. In each of those cases, cross-examination about the statement was motivated solely by the prosecutor\u2019s desire to lay the foundation required for the introduction of extrinsic impeachment evidence in the hope that the jurors would do more than disbelieve the witness\u2019s denial. The \u201cimpeachment\u201d evidence was presented in the hope that the jurors would convert it into substantive evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">In this case, the record shows that it was at the suggestion of appellant\u2019s trial counsel that the victim and the victim\u2019s mother refused the prosecutor\u2019s request for an interview. At no time prior to trial, however, did either of these witnesses \u201crecant\u201d their statements to Corporal Palmieri and EMT Mangino. In the absence of any recantation, the prosecutor was not foreclosed from attacking their credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>through questions directed at proving under Md. Rule 5-613 that they had made statements that are inconsistent with then-present testimony. Md. Rule 5 \u2014 616(a)(1); <em>Pickett v. State, </em>120 Md.App. 597, 604-605, 707 A.2d 941 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Under the unique circumstances of this case, Judge Lombardi neither erred nor abused his discretion when he permitted the State to recall Corporal Palmieri and EMT Mangino.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each of the statements about which they testified described the startling event to which they had responded, and was made at a time when the declarant was under noticeable stress of excitement caused by the event.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statements about which they testified were thus admissible as substantive evidence under Md. Rule 5-803(b)(2). The <em>Spence-Bradley </em>exception does not prohibit the State from impeaching a witness with his or her prior inconsistent <em>written </em>statement. <em>Stewart, supra, </em>342 Md. at 242-243, 674 A.2d 944. It does not prohibit the State from impeaching a witness with his or her prior inconsistent statement given under oath to a grand jury. <em>Nance v. State, </em>331 Md. 549, 571, 629 A.2d 633 (1993). It does not prohibit the State from impeaching a witness with a prior inconsistent statement of identification. <em>Thomas v. State, </em>113 Md.App. 1, 6, 686 A.2d 676 (1996). We hold that the <em>Spence-Bradley </em>exception does not prohibit the State from (1) questioning a witness about an inconsistent statement allegedly made at the scene of the crime while the witness was observed to be suffering from the stress produced by the crime under investigation, and (2) offering extrinsic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>impeachment evidence that the witness made such a statement on that occasion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">According to appellant, Judge Lombardi should have granted the \u201cmotion to strike\u201d interposed by appellant\u2019s trial counsel after EMT Mangino testified about what the victim said to the ambulance attendants. The record shows that the following transpired during the technician\u2019s direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">Q. Now, when you asked [the victim] those basic questions did he respond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">A. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">Q. What did he tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">A. He told us that he had \u2014 that his father had punched him in the face and kicked him in the chest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-11\">[Defense Counsel]: Objection and motion to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-12\">THE COURT: I\u2019m letting it in under the statement for purposes of any medical treatment that this woman might have been able to give. So I\u2019ll overrule your objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGF\">Appellant now argues that Judge Lombardi should have excluded that portion of the victim\u2019s declaration that identified appellant as the perpetrator. This argument is based on the proposition that the identity of the person who caused the injury is not admissible under Md. Rule 8-803(b)(4) because that particular information is not \u201cpathologically germane\u201d (i.e., \u201crelevant\u201d or \u201cof consequence\u201d) to the declarant\u2019s diagnosis and treatment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are persuaded, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>this argument was not presented to Judge Lombardi.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Although Judge Lombardi discussed the hearsay exception in Md. Rule 8 \u2014 303(b)(4), he admitted the victim\u2019s statement as relevant to what action the EMT would take after hearing it. The rule against hearsay does not exclude out of court declarations offered to show the effect that such declarations had on the person who heard them. <em>Shunk v. Walker, </em>87 Md.App. 389, 402, 589 A.2d 1303 (1991); <em>Sparks v. State, </em>91 Md.App. 35, 94, 603 A.2d 1258 (1992). Appellant\u2019s trial counsel argued that everything the victim said to the EMT should be excluded because the EMT did not make a diagnosis or administer any medical treatment. Judge Lombardi was never requested to deliver a limiting instruction under Md. Rule 5-106, or to \u201cstrike\u201d only that portion of the statement in which the victim identified his father as the person who had inflicted the injuries. Under these circumstances, the \u201cidentity of abuser\u201d issue has not been preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">During appellant\u2019s direct examination, he testified that his \"wife insisted that he discipline the victim when she \u201cwent off\u2019 after reading \u201ca stack of stuff\u2019 received from the victim\u2019s school in that day\u2019s mail. When appellant\u2019s trial counsel attempted to introduce the \u201cstack\u201d into evidence, Judge Lombardi sustained the State\u2019s hearsay objection and added that the records were \u201cunauthenticated ... at this point.\u201d Appellant now argues that the records were admissible \u201cbusiness records\u201d under Md. Rule 5-803(b)(6). We are persuaded that the exclusion of these documents was not erroneous. The documents were not eligible to be received into evidence until they had been authenticated either by a testifying \u201csponsor\u201d or in conformity with Md. Rule 5-902(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>It is true that a different \u201cauthentication\u201d analysis is applicable to documents offered to show the effect upon the person who read them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The documents at issue, however, were never offered for the limited purpose of showing their effect on appellant\u2019s wife \u2014 the person who allegedly read them, or on appellant \u2014 the person who allegedly imposed discipline as a result of what was contained in them. Under the circumstances, we agree with Judge Lombardi that the items offered into evidence were inadmissible for lack of required foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-6\">. During Corporal Palmieri\u2019s first appearance on the stand, appellant\u2019s trial counsel objected when the prosecutor asked, \"what if anything was [the victim\u2019s mother] saying?\u201d Judge Lombardi\u2019s decision to sustain the objection to this overbroad question was not inconsistent with his subsequent decision to receive Corporal Palmieri's answer to the following question: \"Corporal Palmieri, I just want to ask you one very specific question. When you were at the scene ... did [the victim\u2019s mother] tell you what had happened?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b58-7\">. Moreover, this is not a case in which the accused denied having taken any aggressive action against the victim. The question was whether the victim\u2019s injuries preceded or resulted from the discipline imposed by appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b59-13\">. According to a majority of the United States Supreme Court, testimony about co-conspirators\u2019 out-of-court statements \"provide evidence of the conspiracy\u2019s context that cannot be replicated, even if the declarant testifies to the same matters in court.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Inadi, </em>475 U.S. 387, 395, 106 S.Ct. 1121, 1126, 89 L.Ed.2d 390 (1986). Testimony about excited utterances made at the scene of the crime provide evidence that cannot otherwise be replicated when, as in this case, the declarant's testimony is inconsistent with his or her excited utterance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b59-14\">. When effective treatment may require antibiotics, a tetanus shot, or the removal of the victim from the home, the identity of the assailant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>relevant to the victim\u2019s diagnosis and treatment. <em>In re Rachel T., </em>77 Md.App. 20, 36, 549 A.2d 27 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b61-13\">. The person who read the document \u2014 and who was allegedly affected as a result of having done so \u2014 is competent to authenticate that document when it is offered for the limited purpose of showing its effect on the reader.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
