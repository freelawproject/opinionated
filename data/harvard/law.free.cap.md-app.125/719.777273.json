Dr. April D. Yancy, D.V.M., formerly an \u201cadditional employee\u201d of the Maryland State Racing Commission, was not eligible to pursue redress through the grievance procedures of the Maryland State Personnel Management System. We shall reverse that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">\n<em>Facts and Statement of the Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">April D. Yancy is a veterinarian who, until November 9, 1996, was employed by the Maryland Racing Commission (Commission), a division of the Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation (DLLR). Due to a change in state regulations that opened veterinary tasks to non-veterinarians, her continued employment was determined to be unnecessary and she was terminated. On November 19, 1996, she filed an appeal and grievance in accordance with the grievance procedures of the State Personnel Management System (SPMS). On March 4, 1997, she was informed by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) that, given' her former status as an \u201cadditional employee\u201d of the Commission, she was not included in the SPMS and thus not entitled to use of the SPMS grievance procedures. She was informed that the decision of the Commission would be the final administrative decision in her case under Md.Code (1994, 1997 RepLVol.), \u00a7 11-305, ll~113(d) of the State Personnel and Pensions Article (SPP).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Despite the Commission\u2019s decision, the DBM felt that it could not dismiss the appellant\u2019s appeal of her termination. Consequently, on March 5, 1997, it forwarded the ease to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) for a determination of the OAH\u2019s jurisdiction over the appellant\u2019s appeal and grievance under SSP \u00a7 11 \u2014 110(b)(l)(ii). On April 29, 1997, a hearing was held before an administrative law judge on DLLR\u2019s motion to dismiss the appellant\u2019s appeal and grievance. On July 14, 1997, the administrative law judge granted the motion to dismiss on the ground that the appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>employment status did not permit her use of the SPMS\u2019s grievance process.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The appellant sought judicial review of the decision of the administrative law judge by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. After hearing arguments on February 10, 1998, the court affirmed the decision of the administrative law judge on February 19. This appeal was filed on March 18, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">\n<em>Question Presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The appellant presents one question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">Is an \u201cadditional employee\u201d of the Maryland Racing Commission included in the State Personnel and Management System and thus permitted to file a grievance under the State\u2019s grievance procedures?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">To this question we answer yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">Our standard of review of administrative decisions was set out at length in our opinion in <em>White v. North, </em>121 Md.App. 196, 708 A.2d 1093, <em>cert. granted, </em>351 Md. 7, 715 A.2d 965 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-12\">Our role in reviewing an administrative decision \u201cis precisely the same as that of the circuit court.\u201d This means we must review the administrative decision itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-13\">In its judicial review of an agency\u2019s action, a court may not uphold an agency decision unless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s actual findings and for reasons advanced by the agency in support of its decision. In reviewing the decisions of administrative agencies, the court must accept the agency\u2019s findings of fact when such findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-14\">In assessing whether the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, we apply the rule that substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d In other words, the scope of review \u201cis limited \u2018to whether a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>ing mind could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">We must review the agency\u2019s decision in a light most favorable to the agency, since \u201cdecisions of administrative agencies are prima facie correct.\u201d In applying the substantial evidence test, we do not substitute our judgment for the expertise of the agency, for the test is a deferential one, requiring \u201c \u2018restrained and disciplined judicial judgment so as not to interfere with the agency\u2019s factual conclusions\u2019.\u201d This deference applies not only to agency fact-finding, but to the drawing of inferences from the facts as well. \u201cWhere inconsistent inferences from the same evidence can be drawn, it is for the agency to draw the inferences.\u201d When the agency\u2019s decision is predicated solely on an error of law, however, no deference is appropriate and the reviewing court may substitute its judgment for that of the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ais\"><em>Id. </em>at 219-21, 708 A.2d 1093 (citations omitted). With that standard in mind, we proceed to the review of the administrative law judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">\n<em>State Personnel and Pensions \u00a7 6-302</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Section 6-302 provides in relevant part that, \u201c[ejxcept as provided in this subsection or otherwise by law, all positions in the Executive Branch of State government are in the State Personnel Management System.\u201d SSP \u00a7 6-302(a). The Commission is a unit of the DLLR, and is thus a part of the executive branch. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1992,1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 11-201, l-101(f) of the Business Regulation (BR) Article. The Commission is empowered by law to \u201cemploy additional employees or agents\u201d in various relevant job categories. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 ll-207(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find nothing in the language of that section, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>in the Business Regulation Article as a whole, or elsewhere in our law that excepts the Commission\u2019s \u201cadditional employees\u201d from participation in the SPMS. <em>See Department of State Planning v. Mayor and Council of the City of Hagerstown, </em>288 Md. 9, 15, 415 A.2d 296 (1980) (citing <em>In re James S., </em>286 Md. 702, 705, 410 A.2d 586 (1980)) (\u201cWhere statutory language is plain and unambiguous, and expresses a definite meaning consonant with the statute\u2019s purpose, courts must not insert or delete words to make a statute express an intention different from its clear meaning.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">\n<em>No Exclusion from SPMS in Business Regulation \u00a7 11-207</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The administrative law judge based his opposite conclusion on several factors. First, he compared BR \u00a7\u00a7 11-206 and 11-207. He concluded that the \u201cstaff\u2019 authorized by \u00a7 11-206, who were expressly included in the SPMS, were to be contrasted with the \u201cadditional employees,\u201d who were not so included. We must reject this reasoning. SPP \u00a7 6-302 does not require that executive branch state employees be specifically included in the SPMS. The presumption is that they are so included. Rather, it requires that employees not to be included in the SPMS be explicitly excluded from the system. <em>Cf. State Admin. Bd. of Election Laws v. Billhimer, </em>72 Md.App. 578, 586-87, 531 A.2d 1298 (1987) (holding that, under the old State employment merit system, <em>\u201call </em>employees of the State are deemed \u2018classified\u2019 unless they have been specifically exempted form that category\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d, on other </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number><em>grounds, </em>314 Md. 46, 548 A.2d 819 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1007, 109 S.Ct. 1644, 104 L.Ed.2d 159 (1989); <em>Secretary, Maryland Dep\u2019t of Personnel v. Bender, </em>44 Md.App. 714, 715, 411 A.2d 107 (1980) (same), <em>aff'd, </em>290 Md. 345, 430 A.2d 66 (1981). There is no such explicit exclusion in BR \u00a7 11-207.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">We note that the administrative law judge based his conclusion in part on the then existing language of BR \u00a7 11-206, which suggested to him that the Commission \u201cstaff\u2019 were explicitly under the SPMS, leading to the inference that \u00a7 11-207 \u201cadditional employees\u201d were excluded. Originally, \u00a7 11-206 read as follows: \u201cWith the approval of the Commission and, except as otherwise provided by law, subject to the provisions of the State Personnel and Pension Article that govern classified service employees, the executive director shall appoint a staff of the Commission.\u201d BR \u00a7 ll-206(a) (1992, 1996 Supp. superceded). On October 1, 1997, after the administrative law judge had made his ruling, BR \u00a7 11-206 was amended. The subsection now reads: \u2018With the approval of the Commission and, except as otherwise provided by law, subject to the provisions of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, the executive director shall appoint a staff of the Commission.\u201d BR \u00a7 ll-206(a). We have based our conclusions on the amended statute. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>285 Md. 339, 343, 402 A.2d 876 (1979) (holding that \u201ca statute which affects a matter still in litigation when the statute becomes effective will be applied by a reviewing court even though the statute was not then law when the decision appealed from was handed down, unless the legislature expresses a contrary intent\u201d); <em>Gee v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>75 Md.App. 253, 260, 540 A.2d 1194 <em>(same), cert. denied, </em>313 Md. 8, 542 A.2d 845 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">\n<em>Property Right versus Right to File Grievance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The administrative law judge next cited <em>Paice v. Maryland Racing Commission, </em>539 F.Supp. 458 (D.Md.1982), for the conclusion that, under the predecessor statute to BR \u00a7 11-207, a veterinarian discharged by the Commission had \u201cno contractual property interest beyond the racing period then in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>effect.\u201d But, in the present case, no such property interest has been asserted. Instead, the appellant is merely asserting the right to file a grievance under the SPMS as provided in SPP \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 through 12-405. We find that <em>Paice </em>is not on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">\n<em>No Separate Provision of Benefits in Business Regulation \u00a7 11-207</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The administrative law judge also cited the \u201cfurther benefits\u201d and \u201cadditional compensation\u201d outlined in BR \u00a7 ll-207(b) as evidence that the Commission\u2019s \u201cadditional employees\u201d are not covered by the SPMS. BR \u00a7 ll-207(b) does not detail any benefits or compensation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">(b) The licensee who holds the race meeting for which an additional employee is used shall pay:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">(1) the employer contribution for the employee under the Employees\u2019 Pension System;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">(2) the employer contribution, as determined by the Department of Budget and Management, for the retiree under \u00a7 2-508 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-11\">(3) an amount required under \u00a7 23 \u2014 306.1(b) of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">SPP \u00a7 11 \u2014 207(b). Rather, it specifies who will pay the listed compensation and benefits. It says nothing about eligibility for, or payment of, the compensation. It is no doubt due to the unique status of the Commission within state government that this payment arrangement was legislated. It is certainly atypical. There is nothing in it, however, that excludes \u201cadditional employees\u201d from the SPMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">\n<em>Legislative Historg</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">The administrative law judge also cited recent legislative history of BR \u00a7 11-207 as evidence that the legislature considered, and rejected, the inclusion of the Commission\u2019s \u201cadditional employees\u201d in the SPMS. At one point in its drafting, Maryland House Bill 1121 of 1997 included a new subsection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>that would have explicitly placed BR \u00a7 ll-207(a) additional employees in \u201cthe Skilled Service of the State Personnel Management System.\u201d H.D. 1121 \u00a7 1 (Md.1997).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the addition of such a subsection would certainly have settled the question, its rejection does not lead to as clear an answer. Indeed, we think that to read such a rejected amendment as an exception of the Commission\u2019s \u201cadditional employees\u201d from the SPMS is to reach far beyond the canons of statutory construction as they have been applied in Maryland. <em>See Amalgamated Cas. Ins. Co. v. Helms, </em>239 Md. 529, 535-36, 212 A.2d 311 (1965) (holding that \u201cthe courts, in the absence of ambiguity, should, as a general rule, confine themselves to a construction of a statute as written, and not attempt, under the guise of construction, to supply omissions or remedy possible defects in the statute, or to insert exceptions not made by the Legislature\u201d); <em>see also State Ins. Comm\u2019r v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>241 Md. 108, 117, 215 A.2d 749 (1966). Consequently, we reject the conclusion that the failed amendment to BR \u00a7 11-207 is to be read as an exception under SPP \u00a7 6-302(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">\n<em>Analogy to Contractual Employees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Finally, the administrative law judge noted that the status of BR \u00a7 11-207 \u201cadditional employees\u201d is analogous to contractual employees. Whether or not that is the case, we do not find it to be determinative. There is nothing in SPP \u00a7 6-302(a), which refers to \u201call positions in the Executive Branch of State government,\u201d that excludes contractual employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>from the SPMS. Indeed, the predecessor statute to SPP \u00a7 6-302(a) explicitly, if redundantly, included \u201ccontractual employees\u201d among those included in the SPMS. SPP \u00a7 l-203(a) (1994, repealed 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">We reverse the decision of the circuit court and order the Commission to consider the appellant\u2019s grievance in accordance with SPP \u00a7 12-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-8\">.
