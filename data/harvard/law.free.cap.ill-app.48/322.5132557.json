The business and all the personal property connected therewith, were the property of Louis Schmitt. The building in which the business was carried on, was the property and homestead of Bertha Schmitt, his wife, the appellant. At the request of her husband, she became his surety for a number of his debts, the aggregate amount being several thousand dollars, for all of which she and Louis gave judgment notes. She was not security for the debt owing to either of the appellees. Judgments by confession were taken by the creditors, all of Avhom. held judgment notes signed by him, and some of which Avere also signed by his wife. On each of these judgments an execution was issued, placed in the hands of the sheriff and by him levied on all the property of Louis, and those that were also against appellant, were also levied on her property; and all the property of both appellant and her husband sold.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-5\" pgmap=\"319\">After the sale of the property, but before any of the proceeds were paid over by the sheriff, appellant filed her bill in chancery, in which she set up the foregoing facts, making the sheriff, and all judgment creditors of Louis and herself, parties defendant, and prayed for a decree, requiring, either, 1st, that the sheriff, out of the proceeds of the property of Louis Schmitt, pay the executions in the order in Avliich they came to his hands, until all such proceeds AA'ere exhausted, before resorting to the proceeds of the property of appellant; or, 2d, if for any reason that could not be done, then in case the proceeds of the property of appellant should be used to pay any judgment for which she Avas surety, on such payment being made, that she might be subrogated to all the rights of the judgment creditors in each of such executions, and in such case such judgments in the order of their priority should be paid out of the proceeds of the property of her husband.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\" pgmap=\"319\">To the bill Henneberry and Harlan Bros, interposed a demurrer which the court sustained and dismissed the bill.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-7\" pgmap=\"319\">Appellant\u2019s Brief.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-8\" pgmap=\"319\">A surety, upon paying the debt of his principal, has a clear right to be substituted in place of the creditor as to all securities held by the latter, and to have the same benefit he would have therein.

There was money enough from the sale of all the property to pay all the judgments obtained on the 29 th and 31st of'July and leave a surplus of $1,594.87, which lacked about as much of paying the brewing company\u2019s judgment as the two judgments of Henneberry and Harlan amounted to. If the prayer of the bill were granted, the personal property would all be exhausted in paying judgments to which the appellant desired to be subrogated, thus excluding Henneberry and Harlan from the only fund to which they had access, and leaving so much more for the benefit of the brewing company.</p> <p id=\"b322-5\" pgmap=\"322\">The relief thus sought was properly denied. The object was to displace the legal rights of Henneberry and Harlan and to .deprive them of the equitable right of insisting that those creditors who had. judgments against Louis and Bertha should first exhaust the funds which were beyond their reach before resorting to the only fund which they could reach.</p> <p id=\"b322-6\" pgmap=\"322\">While it is true that a surety may be subrogated to the rights of the creditor, in reference to any collateral security which the creditor may hold, and that he may be subrogated to the creditor in the judgment for the purpose of keeping it alive and enforcing it for his own benefit against his co-defendants, yet this doctrine, being one of mere equity and benevolence, will not be enforced at the expense of a legal right. Junker v. Rush, 136 Ill. 179.</p> <p id=\"b322-7\" pgmap=\"322\">The surety does not become subrogated ipso faoto by payment, and will be entitled to the relief only upon equitable terms and under equitable conditions.</p> <p id=\"b322-8\" pgmap=\"322\">When the legal or equitable rights of others would be unfavorably affected or wholly disregarded, subrogation would be denied. Powell v. Allen, 11 Brad. 134.</p> <p id=\"b322-9\" pgmap=\"322(53) 323(45)\">Here the complainant seeks to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor and yet to be exempt from one of the conditions to which the creditor was subject\u2014that is, to be required by a creditor of the principal debtor above to seek satisfaction from the fund which the latter creditor could not reach, and by this proceeding to secure precedence over such creditor, who had a valid lien at law by virtue of his judgment. The relief so desired is wholly inequitable. The demurrer was properly sustained and the decree dismissing the bill will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
