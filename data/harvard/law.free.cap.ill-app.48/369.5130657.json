In a limited sense it signifies any resource from which the wants of life may be supplied. Meidel v. Anthis, 71 Ill. 246.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-9\" pgmap=\"365\">There is a legal obligation on the part of the husband to support his wife; and this support is not limited to supplying the bare necessaries of life, but includes comforts and Avhatever is suitable to the Avife\u2019s situation and the husband\u2019s condition in life; and Avhatever lessens or destroys the husband\u2019s ability to supply her Avith suitable comforts, to that extent injures her means of support, even though she is not thereby depriAed of the necessaries of life. McMahon et al. v. Sankey, 133 Ill. 643.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-5\" pgmap=\"366\">Means of support relate to the future as well as to the present. It is enough that the wife shows that the sources of her future support have been cut off, or diminished below what is reasonable and competent for a person in her station in life, and below what they otherwise would have been.

McMahon v. Sankey, 133 Ill. 636.</p> <p id=\"b366-14\" pgmap=\"366(12) 367(32)\">In Meidel v. Anthis, 71 Ill. 246, the husband was a farmer\u2014 as he was in the present case\u2014and it was held that if his capacity to cultivate land was sensibly diminished by the habit of drinking, the wife had a cause of action.</p> <p id=\"b367-5\" pgmap=\"367\">Here the husband was a farmer living on rented land, and there could have been no doubt, as we read the evidence, that his income was sensibly diminished, to the detriment of those who were dependent upon him for support. It is, of course, difficult to say how far the plaintiffs were injured by the acts of the defendants; nor was it necessary that any witness should point out by his testimony any definite basis upon which to make the estimate. If there is enough, when all the evidence is considered, to make the inference reasonably clear, then the proof is sufficient. In view of the evidence, we can see no reason for refusing the third instruction asked by the plaintiff, which reads as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b367-6\" pgmap=\"367\">\u201c 3. The jury are instructed that in determining what facts are proven in this case, they should carefully consider all the evidence before them, with all the circumstances of the transaction in question as detailed by the witnesses, and they may find any fact to be proven which they think may be rightfully and reasonably inferred from the evidence given in the case, although there may not be any direct testimony as to such fact.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b367-7\" pgmap=\"367\">The instructions given for the defendants quite explicitly impressed upon the jury that the plaintiffs were bound to make out their case, as alleged, by the preponderance of the proof, and it was proper that the jury should have the benefit of this instruction in order properly to determine what ivas logically established by the proof. The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
