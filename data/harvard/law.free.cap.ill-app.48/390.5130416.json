The declaration was on the common counts. It appears that appellee was requested by appellant to advance this sum to Lamson Bros. &amp; Co. of Chicago, whose agent appellee was and is. Brand, the appellant, owed Lamson Bros. &amp; Go. this amount of money on two deals, namely, 5,000 bushels July wheat sold April 6th, and 5,000 bushels sold April 10th. In these transactions appellee acted as the agent of Lamson Bros. It was the intention of appellee -that appellant should deliver the actual commodity, and the only option that appellant had in the matter was as to the time of delivery, \u25a0he having the entire month of July in which to deliver. It appears that the appellant became alarmed and dosed out the deal of his own motion before the time for delivery. This he was given the privilege to do. On these two deals there was a loss of $212.75, to the appellant. lie told appellee to advance this amount for him and lie would repay him on the 15th, and then afterward told him that he could not repay him until after harvest. This the appellee did as a mere accommodation to appellant, who afterward concluded that he would not pay at all, he claiming that the contract was illegal.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-7\" pgmap=\"387\">Appellant\u2019s Brief.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-8\" pgmap=\"387\">If these sales and purchases were illegal, and appellee was a party thereto, or had knowledge of such fraud or illegality, then any money paid out by him in the furtherance or performance thereof, or any commissions earned, creates no valid obligations that can be enforced by him. An agent can never recover compensation for services performed in an illegal transaction, or in one against public policy.

The defense was, that the transactions were illegal, because there was a mutual understanding that no grain was to be delivered or received, and that in every instance, the deal was a mere speculation in the market fluctuations, without any intention on either side to receive or deliver the commodity, or any part thereof. On this point the evidence was conflicting. The jury might have found either way.</p> <p id=\"b388-13\" pgmap=\"388\">They chose to credit the evidence offered by the plaintiff, and we find no sufficient reason to say that the verdict should be set aside for want of proof to support it.</p> <p id=\"b388-14\" pgmap=\"388(21) 389(17)\">It was mainly a question of good faith, for all the deals purported to be actual contracts for the purchase and delivery of grain. It is certainly not impossible that these transactions were what they seemed to be.</p> <p id=\"b389-5\" pgmap=\"389\">2sTo complaint is made of the rulings of the court during the trial in reference to the admission of evidence or the giving of instructions. Let the judgment be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
