Applegate filed his bill in chancery in the Circuit Court of Hancock County, to foreclose a mortgage dated April 5,1883, given by the defendants, Stephen E. Roberts and Haney E. Roberts, his wife, in which they conveyed to Applegate certain real estate in Hancock County, Illinois. The mortgage was given to secure two promissory notes for the sum of 0750 each, one due on or before one year after date, and the other due on or before two years after date, with seven per cent interest after date. The annual interest was paid on both of said notes to April 5, 1889.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-7\" pgmap=\"173\">The bill of complaint alleges that the full amount of the principal of both of said notes and the interest thereon from April 5, 1889, remained unpaid. The defendants answered the hill saying that the two notes were given for the stipulated price of an English shire stallion, sold by Applegate to Roberts. That Applegate stated to said Roberts and contracted and agreed with him that the stallion was a pure bred, eligible to registration, registered full-blooded English shire stallion, and was an ordinary sure foal getter. That said stallion was recorded and registered in volume 4 of English Cart Horse Stud Book, under the name of \u201cYoung Wonder,\u201d and by virtue of his record in said stud book, entitled to the name of \u201c Young Wonder\u201d Ho. 2957.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-8\" pgmap=\"173(36) 174(23)\">That said stallion was not eligible to registration; was not a full-blooded, registered and recorded English shire stallion at the time defendant bought him, and was not rerecorded, registered, pedigreed and numbered in said English Cart Horse Stud Book, as claimed and represented by said Applegate; that he was not eligible to such registration, recording, pedigreeing and numbering.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-5\" pgmap=\"174\">That he was not an average sure foal getter; that by reason of the facts aforesaid the said stallion was not worth to exceed one hundred dollars.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-6\" pgmap=\"174\">And that by reason of the false statements of said Apple-gate, aforesaid, he is not entitled to the relief prayed for in his said bill.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-7\" pgmap=\"174\">The complainant then by an amendment to his original bill denied the warranty and breach thereof, and stated that if such warranty ivas made it w'as verbal and not in writing, and was entered into more than five years prior to the commencement of this suit; that such claim of warranty is barred by the statute of limitations.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-8\" pgmap=\"174\">The defendants then amended their answer and stated that such alleged contract was and is in writing.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-9\" pgmap=\"174\">To this answer of defendants, as amended, the complainant filed his general replication. On those issues the cause was tried by the Circu\u00ed t Court, a decree rendered for the full amount of said notes, and $100 solicitors\u2019 fees and costs of suit, and the land described in the mortgage ordered sold to satisfy said amounts.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-10\" pgmap=\"174\">Page 7 of Mr. Applegate\u2019s catalogue referring to the horse:</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-11\" pgmap=\"174\">\u201cYoung Wonder, Vol. 4, E.

Carroll C. Boggs, Judge.</author> <p id=\"b176-8\" pgmap=\"176\">This was a bill in chancery filed by the defendant in error to foreclose a mortgage given April 5,1883, by plaintiffs in error to secure two notes, each for $750, one due April 5, 1884, the other April 5, 1885, both bearing interest at seven per cent per annum. The defense interposed was that the notes were given for a stallion sold by Applegate to Stephen E. Boberts, with a warranty that the stallion was an ordinary foal-getter, and a pure bred English shire horse, under the name of Young Wonder, Ho. 2957, and entitled to that name and number, and that such warranty was broken.</p> <p id=\"b176-9\" pgmap=\"176\">The Circuit Court found the issues for the defendant in error and rendered a decree accordingly, to reverse which this writ of error was sued out.</p> <p id=\"b176-10\" pgmap=\"176(105) 177(170)\">The statements and representations relied upon to constitute the alleged warranty are mainly to be found in a printed catalogue issued by the defendant in error. Boberts testified that when he asked for the pedigree of .the stallion (then a colt of the age of three years), Applegate handed him a catalogue and told him that the pedigree of the horse was on page 7, and that when he asked \u201c about the horse being a sure foal-getter,\u201d Applegate replied, \u201c there was no doubt about that and the catalogue contained all that was necessary for him to say on that subject as well as to the pedigree of the horse.\u201d Roberts testified to some verbal statements of Applegate, which met a direct denial from Applegate, and were at most, even if deemed proven, but mere expressions of opinion as to the future of the animal. Applegate told Roberts that the pedigree and registration of the colt would appear in the 4th volume of English Cart Horse Stud Book, when that volume was issued as it appeared in the catalogue. This 4th volume was issued in 1883, and did contain the pedigree and number of the colt as did the catalogue, but the Stud Book gave the name as \u201c Wonder of the East\u201d while the name given in the catalogue is \u201cYoung Wonder.\u201d The breeder of the colt was given in the catalogue as \u201cR. Menshaln\u201d and in the Stud-Book, as \u201c R. Mendon.\u201d These discrepancies, together with testimony tending to show that this horse was not a sure foal-getter, were relied upon as constituting a breach of the warranty.</p> <p id=\"b177-4\" pgmap=\"177\">It was clearly proven that the colt sold to Roberts was the identical animal registered in the Stud Book, and had the pedigree, age and number there given. That he was bred by \u201c R. Mendon\u201d and that Applegate purchased him from Mendon in St. Edwards, Lincolnshire, England. That the name Menshaln in the cataloge was a mere error in spelling the name of the breeder, and that Applegate believed when he issued the catalogue that the true name of the colt was \u201cYoung Wonder\u201d as there given. This mistake as to the name of the colt, if important, was known to Roberts some years before the filing of. the bill. He paid the interest upon each of the notes annually from 1883 to 1889, during several years of which period he knew of the error in the name of the horse. He finally disposed of the horse in a trade for another stallion without having ever complained to Applegate of any failure of the warranty. We think there is no merit in this branch of the defense.</p> <p id=\"b177-5\" pgmap=\"177\">As to the quality of the horse as a foal-getter the statement in the circular is\u2014</p> <blockquote id=\"b177-6\" pgmap=\"177\">\u201c He will attract attention anywhere and make his mark as a foal-getter.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b178-5\" pgmap=\"178\">This is by no means a warranty that the \u201c colt would attract attention \u201d or prove a \u201c foal-getter \u201d but is and only purports to be an expression of the belief of the seller as to what might be expected of the horse in the future.</p> <p id=\"b178-6\" pgmap=\"178\">The decree is right and must be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
