Corporations\u2014Liability of Officers\u2014Statutes, Construction of, etc.\u2014In a suit brought upon a statute providing that \u201c If the indebtedness of any stock corporation shall exceed the amount of its capital stock, the directors and officers of such corporation assenting thereto shall be personally and individually liable for such excess to the creditors of such corporation,\u201d it appeared that the stock of the corporation was mainly held by one man and that its affairs were practically under Ms exclusive management. The other stockholders, while occupying the position of\u2018directors, gave but little, if any, attention to the business, and were not aware of the condition of the company until it was about to be placed in the hands of a receiver. It was contended that by using proper care they might have ascertained the condition of affairs; having failed to do so they were guilty of negligence, and must therefore be regarded as having assented to the indebtedness. It was held that the liability under the statute must be predicated upon assent, and this must involve knowledge; without knowing that a thing exists one can not be said to assent to it. It is not sufficient that he neglects to do that which would lead him to knowledge. Hie statute does not impose a liability for mere negligence in not properly discharging the duty of an officer or director.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b279-4\" pgmap=\"279\">2. Construction of Statutes\u2014Directors\u2019 Liability\u2014Assent Defined.\u2014 Under Sec. 16, Ch. 32, R. S., providing that if the indebtedness of any stock corporation shall exceed the amount of its capital stock, the directors and officers assenting thereto shall be personally hable, etc. It teas held that to constitute an assent there must be a mental act on the part of the director or officer based upon some information or perception of facts. A mere failure to know or to take the steps, which, if taken, would bring the facts to light, will not suffice.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b279-5\" pgmap=\"279\">3. Corporation\u2014Duty of Directors.\u2014The duty of a director of an incorporated company requires him to know what the corporation is doing and it is negligence in him not to know; but it does not follow as a legal sequence that he is conclusively presumed to have known of its doings, and having made no objections, is to be considered as assenting-to an excess of its indebtedness above its capital stock within the meaning of Sec. 16, Ch. 32, R. S., making the directors and officers liable for such excess to the creditors of such corporation. Such a construction would predicate the liability upon a mere neglect of duty in not keeping advised of the corporate action, whereas the ground of liability fixed by the statute is an assent to the excessive indebtedness.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-6\" pgmap=\"279\">Memorandum.-\u2014Suit to enforce the liability of directors under the statute against permitting the indebtedness of a corporation to exceed its capital stock.

By their appeal the record is now brought to this court.</p> <p id=\"b281-10\" pgmap=\"281\">The provision of the statute involved reads as follows :</p> <blockquote id=\"b281-11\" pgmap=\"281\">\u201cIf the indebtedness'of any stock corporation shall exceed the amount of its capital stock, the directors and officers of such corporation assenting thereto shall be personally and individually liable for such excess to the creditors of such corporation.\u201d R. S., Ch. 32, Sec. 16.</blockquote> <p id=\"b281-12\" pgmap=\"281\">Assuming, for the present purpose, that the indebtedness of the incorporation did exceed the capital stock, the question is whether the appellees, being directors, did assent thereto, within the meaning of the statute, so as to render themselves liable for such excess. It appears that the stock of the corporation was held mainly by one man, Augustus Warren, and that affairs of the corporation were practically under his exclusive management.</p> <p id=\"b281-13\" pgmap=\"281\">Tin- appellees, while holding stock, and while occupying the p\u00ab : uion of directors, seem to have given but little, if any, i.amtion to the business.</p> <p id=\"b282-4\" pgmap=\"282\">It is not shown by the proofs offered in support of the lull that they really knew the financial condition of the company, and they testify positively that they were not aware that the indebtedness exceeded the capital stock until it had all been incurred, and the affairs of the concern were about to be placed in the hands of a receiver.</p> <p id=\"b282-5\" pgmap=\"282\">The appellants insist, however, that by using the proper care, they might have ascertained the exact condition of the company at any time, and if they failed so to d\u00f3, they were guilty of negligence, and must therefore be regarded as having assented to the indebtedness.</p> <p id=\"b282-6\" pgmap=\"282\">It may be fairly inferred from the evidence that the appellees were negligent in the discharge of their duties as directors; that they really took no active interest in the management of the business; that they permitted Mr. Warren to conduct it as he saw fit, without any supervision on their part; and that, by the exercise of proper diligence, they might have known, at all times, what ivas the state of affairs. If this makes them liable under the statute, the decree in their favor is erroneous.</p> <p id=\"b282-7\" pgmap=\"282\">The liability must be predicated upon assent, and this must involve knowledge; without knowing that a thing exists, one can not be said to assent to it.</p> <p id=\"b282-8\" pgmap=\"282\">It is not sufficient that he neglects to do that which would lead him to knowledge. The statute does not impose liability for mere negligence in not properly discharging the duty of an officer or director. It does not say liability shall arise where he has negligently permitted the indebtedness to exceed the capital stock, but when he has assented thereto.</p> <p id=\"b282-9\" pgmap=\"282\">There must be a mental act, based upon some information or perception of facts ; but mere failure to know, or to take the steps which, if taken, would bring the facts to light, will not suffice.</p> <p id=\"b282-10\" pgmap=\"282\">The position of the appellants is, that the duty of a director requires him to know what the corporation is doing, and it is negligence in him not to know ; hence, he is conclusively presumed to have known, and, having made no objection, he is to be considered as assenting.</p> <p id=\"b283-4\" pgmap=\"283\">But this is more than the statute has declared.</p> <p id=\"b283-5\" pgmap=\"283\">It is an attempt to predicate liability upon mere neglect of duty in not keeping advised of the corporate action, whereas, the ground of liability, fixed by the statute, is that there was assent to the prohibited action. Patterson v. Stewart, 45 Minn. 84; Patterson v. Eobinson, 3G Hun, 622. -</p> <p id=\"b283-6\" pgmap=\"283\">We are of opinion the decree should be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
