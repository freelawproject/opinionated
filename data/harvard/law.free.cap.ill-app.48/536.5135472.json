Gifts Inter Vivos\u2014Promissory Note\u2014Consideration.\u2014John O. Bolin, a man of a religious turn of mind, conferred with the officers and members of the board of trustees of the Illinois Christian Missionary Convention, relative to making a provision for the institution. About January, 1886, he went to J. W. Boren, and handed him certain papers and said to him, \u201c \u2019 Squire, if anything happens to me, mail these letters.\u201d One of them was directed to A. McLean, and stamped. The others were all inside of a blank envelope. Mr. Bolin said to Boren, \u2018\"Inside, the blank one, will tell you what to do.\u201d Mr. Boren took the letters, wrote across them the name of John O. Bolin, and said to him, \u201cIf anything happens to me, these belong to you.\u201d In January, 1889, Bolin died. Boren mailed the letter directed to A. McLean to him. It contained a note for two thousand dollars. On opening the blank envelope, among others, was another envelope directed to N. S. Haynes, evangelist, etc., properly directed and stamped. This letter Boren mailed, and it was received by Mr. Haynes, and contained a note for two thousand dollars, of which the following is a copy:</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b533-6\" pgmap=\"533\">$2,000.

Bolin, came to the office of John W. Boren, and handed him two envelopes, saying at the same time, \u201c \u2019 Squire, if anything should happen, mail these letters.\u201d One of these envelopes was addressed to A. McLean, secretary of the Foreign Christian Missionary Society, and the other one was blank. Bolin said further: \u201c Inside, the blank one will tell you what to do.\u201d Boren took the two envelopes and placed them in a large envelope, and sealed it, and wrote Mr. Bolin\u2019s name across it. Mr. Bolin looked on while his name was being written across the envelope, and at the same time Boren said to him, \u201c If anything happens to me, this is yours.\u201d After this no mention of the matter was ever made by either of these parties to the other.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-7\" pgmap=\"534(180) 535(80)\">Shortly prior to the death of Mr. Bolin, which occurred on January 15, 1889, Mr. Boren called on him, and asked him if there was anything he could do for him in the way of business, and he replied, \u201c FTothing; everything is all right.\u201d In this conversation no mention was made of the notes. Immediately after Mr. Bolin\u2019s death, Boren opened the envelope which he addressed to Mr. Bolin, and also the blank envelope which it contained, and found that the blank envelope contained five envelopes, sealed and stamped, and addressed to the following parties: One to Miss Oallie Buckhart, Holden, Mo.; one to FT. S. Haynes, corresponding secretary of the permanent fund of the Illinois Christian Missionary Convention; one to the treasurer of the Eureka College; one to J W. Boren, and one to the deacons of the Christian Church, of Milton. Boren mailed or delivered all of these envelopes, including the one to A. McLean, at once. The envelope directed to McLean contained two notes, one of which is the note sued on in the case of the Foreign Christian Missionary society against appellee, and the other was a similar note for the sum of $1,000, payable to the Christian Woman\u2019s Board of Missions. The envelope addressed to FT. S. Haynes contained the note sued on in this case without any note or letter of explanation. The note was written upon a blank form sent bjr Mr. McLean to Mr. Bolin by mail, at the request of the latter. The note is as folows:</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-5\" pgmap=\"535\">Miltost, Pike Co., Ill., August 24, 1884.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-6\" pgmap=\"535\">Ten years after date I promise to pay to the trustees of the permanent fund of the Illinois Christian Missionary Convention, two thousand dollars ($2,000), without interest, for said fund, in consideration of one dollar ($1) and other valuable consideration.

O. Bolis.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-8\" pgmap=\"535\">At one time, when in attendance upon an annual meeting of the appellant convention, held at Eureka, Illinois, Mr. Bolin said to Mr. Haynes, then a member of appellant\u2019s executive board, that his health was not good, and he might not live long, and he desired to arrange his affairs soon, and that he had visited Eureka for the special purpose of conferring with him (Haynes) relative to the disposition of his property. Haynes suggested that he first provide for his wife. Bolin replied that he had fully arranged in his mind as to that; that his wife would be amply provided for, and that he thought he ought to devote about $6,000 to Christian work. Haynes suggested that Eureka College and the appellant convention were commendable organizations, and worthy his consideration, and suggested that $4,000 donated to the college, and $2,000 to the missionary convention would be worthily bestowed. Bolin and Haynes had further conversation, but Mr. Haynes was unable to recall it in detail, but said it was about a will making bequests.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-9\" pgmap=\"535(29) 536(84)\">FTeither Haynes nor McLean nor any other person connected with either of the missionary societies, or the appellant convention, knew of the existence of the notes until they were received from Bolin through the mails. It does not appear that the appellant convention or either missionary society incurred liability, or expended any moneys upon the faith of a donation from Bolin, but such organizations were then each engaged in the beneficent work for which they were created, and were relying for funds wherewith to carry on the work, upon donations, which it was expected would, from time to time, without their knowledge or solicitation, be made and bestowed upon them.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-5\" pgmap=\"536\">The case was, upon these facts, submitted to the court without the intervention of a jury, and the finding and judgment being adverse to the appellant, the record was brought here by appeal for review.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-6\" pgmap=\"536\">Appellants\u2019 Beiee.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-7\" pgmap=\"536\">While the rule of law is that a note or bill is not the subject of a gift inter vivos by the maker, an exception is often made in favor of notes by way of subscription for the endowment or other aid of public charities, religious societies or educational institutions.

In his case, perhaps, this general expectation of death was aroused and quickened by his failing health. Otherwise, he ivas in no fear of death, immediate or remote. Gifts, made under such circumstances, can not be regarded as donatio causa mortis. 2 Blackstone Com. 514; Story Eq. Juris. Sec. 607 a.</p> <p id=\"b540-8\" pgmap=\"540\">A gift inter vivos is only enforced when it is a completed gift. The donor must relinquish, absolutely and irrevocably, present and future dominion and power over the subject-matter of such a gift. True, the delivery may be in escrow, to vest upon the happening of an event, but this contingency must not be at the mere will or pleasure of the donor. His dominion and right of control must cease before such a gift becomes absolute and fixed, so that it may be enforced at law. Jackson v. Railway Co., 88 N. Y. 520; 8th Am. and Eng. Ency. of Law, page 1313.</p> <p id=\"b540-9\" pgmap=\"540\">If such a gift is not completed during the lifetime of the donor, his death revokes the part which has been performed. 8 Am. and Eng. Ency. sujyra.</p> <p id=\"b540-10\" pgmap=\"540(95) 541(71)\">The decedent procured from the appellant convention, a blank form for anote, for the\"payment of money to it. This he signed, but instead of delivering it to the appellant, as a binding obligation, he deposited it with one who was to act for him, and retain it during his lifetime. Manifestly, he intended to keep the note within his own control, so that he could repossess himself of it, if he chose so to do. To our mind, it clearly appears, from the evidence, that the deceased did not intend to irrevocably invest the appellant with legal power to enforce against him payment of the sum of money mentioned in the note. He did not know but that his life might be prolonged, or, for other reasons, he might need, or prefer to otherwise apply and appropriate, his means. At any rate, he did not choose to bind himself absolutely to pay it to the appellant during his lifetime. lie left the gift incomplete.</p> <p id=\"b541-5\" pgmap=\"541\">It is insisted, however, that the evidence conclusively shows that he did intend to bestow the money upon the appellant, after his death, and that he executed the note and delivered it to Mr. Boren, with instructions to deliver it to the appellant after his death, for the purpose of effecting that intent; that upon his d th-bed, his words and conduct were such as to confirm and ratify his former act, and that in pursuance thereof, the note was delivered to the appellant, who rightly possesses it and may laivfully enforce its payment. If it be conceded that all this is proven, it only appears that the deceased desired, and attempted to make, a disposition of his property to take effect only after his death. This he might lawfully do, but not by means of an undelivered note.</p> <p id=\"b541-6\" pgmap=\"541\">The experience of ages has demonstrated the wisdom and the necessity of guarding such bequests, or gifts of property, against fraud, undue influence, and imposition. All the States of our Union have statutes designed to supply such safeguards. If one desires to make a solemn disposition of his property, to take effect only after his death, yet leaving him so long as he may live fully empowered to change such disposition, or to apply its subject-matter to his own use, or to any other purpose, he must do so by a will executed in strict conformity with the statutory enactments regulating such bequests. Redfield on Wills, Vol. 3, 348; Cline v. Jones, 111 Ill. 563; Olney v. Howe, 89 Ill. 556.
