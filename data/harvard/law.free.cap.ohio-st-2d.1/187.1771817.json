In such instance, it is contended that a diesel locomotive being moved while not under power is a car and that therefore Section 4999.08, Revised Code, requires that there be a five-man crew.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The case is before this court on appeal from the order of the Public Utilities Commission dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">As held in the above-cited case, this statute, being a penal statute, must be strictly construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Therefore, in our opinion, a diesel locomotive, being moved while not under power, is not a \u201ccar,\u201d within the meaning of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-7\">Tart, C.
