Thus, the illegality of the process by which one is taken into custody does not affect the validity of a subsequent conviction based upon a proper indictment or information. <em>Jetter </em>v. <em>Maxwell, Warden, </em>176 Ohio St., 219; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Maxwell, Warden, </em>174 Ohio St., 29. The irregularity of an arrest cannot be inquired into by habeas corpus after conviction. <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Haskins, Supt., </em>176 Ohio St., 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">The petitioner urges that he was not guilty of the offense charged. The guilt or innocence of an accused is not cognizable in habeas corpus. <em>Page </em>v. <em>Green, Supt., </em>174 Ohio St., 178; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Maxwell, Warden, </em>174 Ohio St., 32; <em>In re Poage, </em>87 Ohio St., 72. This is a question which must be raised by appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">\n<em>Petitioner remanded to custody.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b90-13\">Taet, C.
