J. Braun, the other issued by The Lumbermens Mutual Insurance Company to Joan Bailey.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-15\">On October 31,1959, while both policies were in effect, Braun injured a third person while driving Bailey\u2019s car with her permission. It is admitted that under standard clauses cont\u00e1ined in each of these policies, both policies cover the claim of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>injured person. The question to be answered is whether the coverage of either is as to the excess only or whether under the policies it is the duty of the two companies involved to prorate any loss for which Braun is liable. Each policy states that under certain circumstances its coverage is \u2018 \u2018 excess \u2019 \u2019 to other valid and collectible insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The Motorists policy states that the insurance afforded by the policy with respect to \u201cany other automobile\u201d when driven by the named insured \u2018 \u2018 shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance available to the insured or owner of such other automobile.\u201d Since Braun was driving an \u201cother automobile\u201d this excess provision is effective if Bailey\u2019s policy is \u201cother valid and collectible insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The Lumbermens policy provides that, with respect to the \u201cowned automobile,\u201d a person driving with the permission of the named insured is an \u201cinsured,\u201d and that other insurance available to the insured with respect to a nonowned automobile shall be excess over any other valid and collectible insurance, and defines a \u201cnonowned\u201d automobile as an automobile \u201cnot owned by or furnished for the regular use of either the named insured or any relative * <em>* </em>Since Bailey\u2019s automobile, driven by Braun at the time of the accident, did not fall into this \u201cnonowned\u201d category by policy terms, the excess provision of Lumbermens policy does not apply. Thus, insurance under Lumbermens policy is valid and collectible insurance available to Braun.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Briefly stated, when the two insurance policies are properly read, Lumbermens\u2019 excess clause does not apply to this case, and there is no conflict with the excess clause appearing in the Motorist policy which clearly does apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">The situation remaining is one in which the \u201cexcess provision\u201d of the driver\u2019s policy (Motorists) must be considered as it relates to the \u201cprorata\u201d provision of the \u201cowner\u2019s\u201d policy (Lumbermens). This relationship has been considered and the problem therein resolved by this court in <em>Trinity Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>General Accident, Fire &amp; Life Assur. Corp., Ltd., </em>138 Ohio St. 488. It was there decided that the owner\u2019s policy is primary and the driver\u2019s policy is excess only.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Of interest is the following from an article on the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>by Henry E. Barksdale, Conflicting Decisions on Primary and Excess Coverage under Automobile Liability Policies, Insurance Counsel Journal, January 1965, page 158:</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u2018 \u2018 The rule of thumb that insurance on the car is primary\u2014 that on the driver is excess has been long recognized by most insurance companies. To use a shorter term \u2014 insurance follows the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">This interpretation of these policies is supported by the following : 8 Appleman on Insurance Law and Practice, 400 to 402, Section 4914; <em>Mountain States Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>American Casualty Co., </em>135 Mont. 475, 342 P. 2d 748; <em>Turpin </em>v. <em>Standard Reliance Ins. Co., </em>169 Neb. 233, 99 N. W. 2d 26; <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dykhottse, Admr., </em>219 F. Supp. 62; and <em>American Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Republic Indemnity Co. of America, </em>52 Cal. 2d 507, 341 P. 2d 675, wherein it is stated at page 512:</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u201cThe \u2018other insurance\u2019 clause in American\u2019s policy is identical with that contained in the \u2018National Standard Automobile Policy,\u2019 used by the great majority of casualty insurers in the United States. * * * That policy as well as the policies involved here extends coverage to the named insured when he drives a car other than his own and also to any other person when driving the car of the named insured. For that reason there will be dual insurance when an accident is caused by a person not driving his own car and both the driver and the owner are insured under a standard policy. Clearly the excess provision of the \u2018 other insurance \u2019 clause is intended to show how the loss should be borne in this frequently recurring situation. It is impossible, and could not have been intended, that the excess provision would govern with respect to the insurance of the driver and that at the same time the prorate provision would control with respect to the insurance of the owner because pro-ration of the loss and treating the driver\u2019s insurance as excess over the insurance of the owner obviously lead to inconsistent results. The only construction of the \u2018other insurance\u2019 clause under which both its parts will be meaningful is that the <em>excess </em>provision alone controls in every situation which falls within its terms, such as when a person is driving the car of another and both the driver and the owner have insurance, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number><em>prorate </em>provision alone governs in all other situations, for example, when more than one policy has been issued to the same person. When the driver\u2019s insurance is excess, it necessarily follows that the insurance of the owner is primary, and therefore the owner\u2019s insurer must bear the entire loss to the extent of the limits of the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">It follows that the policy of Lumbermens Insurance Company is primary and the policy of the Motorists Mutual Insurance Company is excess coverage. It was error not to have so declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-8\">Taft, C.
