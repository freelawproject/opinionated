None of these matters are cognizable in or grounds for release by habeas corpus. <em>Tomkalski </em>v. <em>Maxwell, Warden, </em>175 Ohio St. 377; <em>Jetter </em>v. <em>Maxwell, Warden, </em>176 Ohio St. 219; <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Maxwell, Warden, </em>175 Ohio St. 317; <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Green, Supt., </em>173 Ohio St. 531; and <em>Orr </em>v. <em>Maxwell, Warden, </em>174 Ohio St. 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Petitioner urges also that the prosecuting attorney concealed the fact that there was perjured testimony at petitioner\u2019s trial, and that during the course of the trial the prosecuting attorney commented on crimes for which defendant had been indicted but not yet tried. There is no evidence of this other than petitioner\u2019s own statement. However, even if true, it would be of no avail to petitioner. Petitioner is presently incarcerated as a result not only of his convictions by a jury but also his convictions by pleas of guilty. Thus, even if there was error in petitioner\u2019s trials, he is still subject to detention under his pleas of guilty, hence, relief by habeas corpus does not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">This is true also in relation to petitioner\u2019s contention that the same evidence was used at his trial on three separate charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Next, petitioner contends that two offenses should not arise out of the same statute. Apparently it is petitioner\u2019s contention that he should not be sentenced for both breaking and entering and grand larceny for the same burglary. These are separate and distinct offenses. As was stated in <em>Boyer </em>v. <em>Maxwell, Warden, </em>175 Ohio St. 318, 319:</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\"><em>\u201c* * * </em>These are two separate and distinct offenses with entirely different elements. The offense of breaking and entering is accomplished at the time of the entry, and the accused is guilty thereof whether he commits the intended felony or not. The actual commission of the intended felony is not an element of the offense of breaking and entering. Where the felony actually is committed, a new and different crime arises for which the accused may also be convicted. See <em>Grove </em>v. <em>Maxwell, Warden, </em>173 Ohio St. 559.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Therefore, the petitioner\u2019s contentions are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">\n<em>Petitioner remanded to custody.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b104-11\">Taft, C. J., Zimmerman, Matthias, O\u2019Neill,, Herbert, Schneider and Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
