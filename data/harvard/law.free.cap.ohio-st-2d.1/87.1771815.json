The court\u2019s journal entries completely refute petitioner\u2019s contention in this matter. Such journal entries and the certificate of sentence show that petitioner pleaded guilty and was sentenced by the court on August 1, 1963, for the crime of felonious assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-16\">\n<em>Petitioner remanded to custody.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b105-17\">Taet, C.
