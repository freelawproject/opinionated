The case is before the court on an agreed stipulation of facts. This stipulation and the pleadings show that respondent was appointed as a member of the Lorain Metropolitan Housing Authority on December 1, 1959, for a five-year term, and that he was appointed as a park commissioner on December 30, 1961, for a three-year term. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>is stipulated that respondent is still acting as a park commissioner, and that although he has acted as a member of the Housing Authority from 1959 through December 1, 1964, there is nothing in the pleadings or stipulation to indicate that he has been reappointed as a member of the Housing Authority. The fact is that respondent is not presently a member of the Housing Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Since respondent no longer holds both offices, this case is moot, and the petition is dismissed. <em>Miner </em>v. <em>Witt, Clerk, </em>82 Ohio St. 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-7\">Taft, C.
