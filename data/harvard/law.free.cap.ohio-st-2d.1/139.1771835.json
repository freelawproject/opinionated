J.</author>\n<p id=\"AX\">Section 2915.111 provides punishment as for a misdemeanor \u201cfor a first offense\u201d and punishment as for a felony <em>(i. e., </em>imprisonment for a maximum term of more than one year. See Sections 1.05 and 1.06, Revised Code) \u201cfor each subsequent offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Defendant was opnvicted for a violation of that statute, which took place in October 1961. This conviction was in March 1962. Thereafter, defendant was indicted and convicted as a subsequent offender for a violation of that statute, which occurred in February 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Defendant contends that he cannot he convicted as a subsequent offender because his second violation of the statute occurred before and not after his conviction for the first violation thereof. In other words, he contends and the Court of Appeals held that a violation of the statute could not bea\u201c subsequent offense,\u201d within the meaning of this statute, unless such violation occurred after defendant\u2019s conviction for a previous violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The effect of this contention and of this holding is either (1) to read the words \u201cfirst offense\u201d where they occur in the statute as though they read \u201cfirst conviction\u201d or (2) to insert in the statute a requirement, not expressed therein, <em>i. e., </em>that, in order to be a \u201csubsequent offense,\u201d an offense must occur \u201cafter a conviction for a first offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The ordinary meaning of the word \u201coffense\u201d is \u201cthe doing that which a penal law forbids to be done or omitting to do what it commands.\u201d On the other hand, a \u201cconviction\u201d is \u201cthat legal proceeding which ascertains the guilt of the party upon which the sentence or judgment is founded.\u201d Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary (Baldwin\u2019s Century Ed. 1940). In other words, a conviction is a legal ascertainment that an offense has been committed. A conviction is not an essential element of an offense although an offense is always a prerequisite to a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Thus, it would be necessary, in order to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, either to give other than their ordinary meaning to the words \u201cfirst offense\u201d in the statute or to add words to the statute which the statute does not contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">As stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dale </em>(1900), 110 Iowa 215, 217, 81 N. W. 453, \u201cthe statute does not, in terms, require that the convictions should antedate the offense charged * * *. What reason is there for adding something to the language of the statute?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">As stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>McCormick </em>(1928), 104 N. J. Law 288, 140 A. 297:</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\u201cThe \u2018offense\u2019 took place when the alleged criminal act was committed irrespective of the time of conviction or the plea of guilty, so long, at least, as such conviction or plea of guilty took place before the return of the indictment charging a similar offense as a second offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In support of the Court of Appeals judgment, defendant has referred to <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>State </em>(1928), 27 Ohio App. 297, 161 N. E. 284; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowman </em>(1962); 116 Ohio App. 285, 187 N. E. 2d 627; <em>Staniforth </em>v. <em>State </em>(1927), 24 Ohio App. 208, 156 N. E. 924; and <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Myers, Supt. </em>(1959), 110 Ohio App. 469, 169 N. E. 2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">None of these authorities represent a holding or support the conclusion that there can be no conviction for a \u2018 \u2018 subsequent offense\u201d which occurred before a conviction for a prior offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\"><em>Larney </em>v. <em>City of Cleveland </em>(1878), 34 Ohio St. 599, does hold that \u201cwhere a greater punishment may be inflicted upon a conviction for a second or subsequent violation of a criminal law, than for the first, the fact that the offense charged is a second or subsequent offense must be averred in the indictment or information, in order to justify the increased punishment.\u201d In the instant case, the indictment does aver that necessary fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\"><em>Carey </em>v. <em>State </em>(1904), 70 Ohio St. 121, 70 N. E. 955, goes further and states in paragraph two of the syllabus that \u201can affidavit for prosecution * <em>* </em>* which * * * does not allege a previous conviction, is in legal effect a charge of a first offense only # # * J?</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">In the instant case, the indictment does \u201callege a previous conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">However, the first sentence of paragraph two of the syllabus of the <em>Carey case </em>states further that \u201cthe term \u2018offense\u2019 as used\u201d in a statute in a manner similar to its use in the statute involved in the instant case \u201cis the equivalent of conviction.\u201d This dictum, when taken out of context, would appear at first to support defendant\u2019s position. However, as indicated in the opinion at page 125, the term \u201csecond offense\u201d would then mean \u201csecond conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">Thus, if the statute in the instant case is rewritten in accordance with the dictum in the first sentence of paragraph two of the <em>Carey case, </em>it would provide punishment as for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>misdemeanor \u201cfor a first conviction\u201d and punishment, as for a felony \u201cfor each subsequent conviction\u201d and thereby it would provide for increased punishment for any conviction, such as that in the instant case, \u201csubsequent\u201d <em>to \u201ca first conviction.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUx\">Certainly, the <em>Carey case </em>cannot support in any way a reasonable conclusion that the words in the statute involved in the instant case, \u201cfirst o\u00edfense,\u201d can be interpreted to read \u201cfirst conviction\u201d without then having the words \u201csubsequent offense\u201d made to read \u201csubsequent conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We recognize that there are authorities outside Ohio which hold that similar statutory provisions require that an offense must occur after conviction for a prior offense in order to be a subsequent offense. See 25 American Jurisprudence 266, Section 12; 24B Corpus Juris Secundum 466, Section 1960 (5) (b); annotation, 24 A. L. R. 2d 1247, 1249. However, for the reasons hereinbefore stated, we are of the opinion that it is not necessary in order to have a conviction for a subsequent offense under Section 2915.111, Revised Code, that such subsequent offense should occur after a conviction for a first offense. The judgment of the Court of Appeals must, therefore, be reversed and that of the Common Pleas Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b161-8\">Zimmerman, Matthias, O\u2019Neill, Herbert, Schneider and Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
