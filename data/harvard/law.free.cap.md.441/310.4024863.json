We hold that unpaid wage claims arising from employment entered into in states other than Maryland are not excluded, for that reason alone, from being litigated under the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law (\u201cMWPCL\u201d), Labor &amp; Employment, \u00a7\u00a7 3-501 <em>et seq. </em>The choice of law doctrine <em>lex loci contractus </em>is not implicated, in the absence of an express choice of law selection in the contract, when such claims do not involve the validity, enforceability, interpretation, or construction of the employment contract. We suggest further that the MWPCL repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>sents Maryland\u2019s strong public policy. Final resolution of the parties\u2019 dispute must await, however, another day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">I. Statement op the Case, Numerous Allegations, and One Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Matthew Feinberg, Esq. (\u201cFeinberg\u201d), filed on 4 October 2012 a Complaint in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Montgomery County, against Cunningham &amp; Associates, P.L.C. (\u201cC <em>&amp; </em>A\u201d), a Virginia-based law firm, and its principal, Joseph F. Cunningham (\u201cCunningham\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the Complaint set out four counts, only one survives here: Feinberg\u2019s claimed violation by C &amp; A and Cunningham of the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law (\u201cMWPCL\u201d), Maryland Code (1999, 2008 Repl. Vol.), Labor &amp; Employment, \u00a7\u00a7 3-501 <em>et seq.,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for which he seeks $1,974.20 in unpaid wages, treble damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Feinberg was the only witness to testify at the 17 April 2013 trial in the District Court. He told the Court of his application for an attorney position with C &amp; A, the interview process, and his initial understanding of the terms of his employment. Feinberg suggested that he was hired by C &amp; A to serve as a Maryland attorney, handle Maryland cases, appear before Maryland courts, and advise Maryland clients. He recounted signing a written agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) with Cunningham wherein his position was described as that of an \u201cindependent contractor,\u201d although he could not recall specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>cally where geographically he signed the agreement. He spoke about his day-to-day practice, work environment, and responsibilities, including Cunningham\u2019s requirement that he spend the vast majority of his time in C &amp; A\u2019s Virginia office. Feinberg testified that his work for Petitioners included representing clients at trial and motions hearings, attending depositions, meeting with clients, and gaining admission to the U.S. District Court, all in Maryland. As might be expected in a wage claim case, a substantial portion of Feinberg\u2019s testimony was devoted to the manner in which he was paid by C &amp; A and monies that he claimed were withheld improperly from his paychecks on various occasions. The Agreement that Feinberg signed with Cunningham was produced. The portions of the contract relevant potentially to the payment of wages are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">That in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, and for other good and valuable consideration, it is hereby mutually agreed ...:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">5. Contractor invoices will be submitted bi-weekly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">7. The Contractor will determine the amount of hourly time expended on work assigned to be undertaken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">8. The Contractor\u2019s earnings will depend solely on his/her own production.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Feinberg also discussed several instances when he disputed with Cunningham particular withholdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">At the close of Feinberg\u2019s case-in-chief, Petitioners moved to dismiss the remaining wage claims on two grounds: first, no claim could lie on an implied contract theory, such as quantum meruit or unjust enrichment, as there was an express contract between the parties; and, second, the parties\u2019 contract was governed, under Maryland\u2019s choice of law principles, by Virginia\u2019s law, and, as such, the MWPCL did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>apply.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After hearing arguments from both sides, the District Court granted Petitioners\u2019 motion. Ruling from the bench, the judge found the following facts in support of his ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjY\">[T]he testimony in this case began by Mr. Feinberg describing his applying for this job, seeing this ad and applying with [C &amp; A]. And he submitted his resume[;] he then goes to Virginia where he meets with [Cunningham].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">... They signed this contract. I think it\u2019s a Virginia contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">... I understand Mr. Feinberg has an office in Bethesda.... And he was living in D.C. ... [A]fter he left [C <em>&amp; </em>A] he moved to Gaithersburg where he got a couple checks. And then he moved back to D.C.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The trial judge\u2019s ruling turned on one fact: the employment contract was a \u201cVirginia\u201d contract. In his view, because the Agreement between Feinberg and C <em>&amp; </em>A was an employment contract entered in Virginia, and not in Maryland, the court held that the MWPCL did not apply, and the contract was governed instead by Virginia law. Furthermore, the District Court did not identify a strong public policy basis to apply the MWPCL to Feinberg\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, the District Court did not find any facts in addition to the one that was\u2014in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>its view\u2014dispositive.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court noted that the dismissal was without prejudice, in order to preserve any potential causes of action that Feinberg may have in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Feinberg filed a Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment and/or for Reconsideration regarding his MWPCL claim. He relied on <em>Himes Associates, Ltd. v. Anderson, </em>178 Md.App. 504, 943 A.2d 30 (2008), which he suggested was controlling appellate precedent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In that case, the plaintiff, employed by a Virginia company, worked primarily from a Virginia office, but performed certain work in Maryland. <em>Himes, </em>178 Md.App. at 513-16, 943 A.2d at 35-36. The intermediate appellate court held that Anderson could bring a suit in Maryland under the MWPCL. <em>Himes, </em>178 Md.App. at 535, 943 A.2d at 48. Feinberg argued that he was actually C &amp; A\u2019s employee, not an independent contractor, and as such that he was entitled to the unpaid wages, treble damages, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs. His motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Feinberg appealed, on the record, to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 7\u2014102(b)(1). The parties submitted on memoranda. Feinberg reiterated his argument that <em>Himes </em>controlled, that the District Court erred in granting Petitioners\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Feinberg\u2019s MWPCL claim, and further argued that the evidence at trial indicated that there was a violation of the MWPCL. Petitioners, in their written response, argued that the doctrine of <em>lex loci contractus </em>required that Feinberg\u2019s claims be resolved under Virginia law. Petitioners relied on several federal cases for the proposition that the MWPCL did not reflect any fundamental public policy of Maryland so as to supersede traditional conflict of laws principles. Petitioners argued, in the alternative, that if the MWPCL claim was dismissed improperly below, the case should be remanded for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>fact-finding. Feinberg, in his reply, argued <em>inter alia </em>that <em>lex loci contractus </em>did not apply to his wage claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The Circuit Court reversed the dismissal of Feinberg\u2019s MWPCL claim and remanded the matter for further proceedings. That court did not disturb the District Court\u2019s factual finding that the employment contract was a \u201cVirginia\u201d contract, but reasoned that <em>Himes </em>controlled, suggesting that Feinberg could recover under the MWPCL. The Circuit Court declined to determine whether Feinberg was indeed an employee of C <em>&amp; </em>A or whether there was a bona fide dispute as to the wages claimed, but instead left those issues to the District Court on remand.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">We granted C &amp; A\u2019s and Cunningham\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari. 437 Md. 66, 85 A.3d 156 (2014). Petitioners posed the following two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">1. Does application of the Md. choice of law principle of <em>lex loci contractus </em>preclude a claim under the Md. Wage Payment and Collection Law (MD.Code Ann. Lab. &amp; Empl. \u00a7 3-501 et seq. (\u201cMWPCL\u201d))?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">2. Does proper application of <em>lex loci contractus </em>preclude respondent\u2019s MWPCL claim?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Petitioners urge us to address squarely the interface between the reach of the MWPCL and the common law choice of law principle <em>lex loci contractus. </em>They argue that choice of law principles require the parties\u2019 dispute over unpaid wages be settled under Virginia law in the appropriate forum, rather than under the MWPCL, because the contract was a \u201cVirginia\u201d contract. In support of their argument, Petitioners marshal several federal cases decided by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland and the U.S. Court of Appeals for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the Fourth Circuit to suggest that disputes in Maryland\u2019s courts over employment contracts entered into in other states should be resolved according to the law of those other states, unless the other state\u2019s law runs contrary to a <em>strong </em>Maryland public policy. Specifically, Petitioners argue that Virginia\u2019s relevant statutory law is a substantive part of the parties\u2019 contract, and therefore choice of law principles are implicated. Petitioners further assert that the MWPCL does not represent a strong public policy of Maryland, and that <em>lex loci contractus </em>should not be abandoned in favor of a more \u201cmodern\u201d approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Feinberg reiterates the arguments made in the trial courts, and suggests further that the Circuit Court declined correctly to apply <em>lex loci contractus </em>to the present litigation because that doctrine only applies to questions of validity or interpretation of a contract. He argues also that, even if <em>lex loci contractus </em>does apply, the MWPCL represents a strong public policy which should override the application of that doctrine to the case at bar, and this Court should ignore selectively the doctrine in favor of a more modern approach favoring his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">We hold that the matter before us does not implicate the choice of law doctrine of <em>lex loci contractus. </em>In a nifty bit of considered dicta, even if <em>lex loci contractus </em>applied, we think that it would not preclude a claim such as Respondent\u2019s under the MWPCL, as the MWPCL represents a strong public policy of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The rules of procedure governing appeals to a circuit court on the record made in the District Court \u201care not as comprehensive as those governing appeals to the Court of Special Appeals or to [the Court of Appeals], [but] we have said that the ordinary rules governing the scope of appellate review in the latter courts are generally applicable to appeals on the record in a circuit court.\u201d <em>Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kenney, </em>323 Md. 116, 122, 591 A.2d 507, 509-10 (1991) (citing <em>Ryan v. Thurston, </em>276 Md. 390, 391-93, 347 A.2d 834, 835-36 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>(1975)). For purposes of this appeal, the parties have treated the trial court\u2019s decision as an \u201c[a]ction [t]ried [without a [j]ury\u201d pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131. Under this rule, the appellate court must \u201creview the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial-' court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of witnesses.\u201d Md. Rule 8-131 (c). Appellate courts \u201c \u2018accept and [are] bound by findings of fact in the lower court unless they are clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>State Sec. Check Cashing, Inc. v. American General Financial Services (DE), </em>409 Md. 81, 110, 972 A.2d 882, 899 (2009) (quoting <em>$3,417.46 U.S. Money v. Kinnamon, </em>326 Md. 141, 149, 604 A.2d 64, 67 (1992)). We review the trial court\u2019s application of law to the facts for legal error, a non-deferential standard. <em>State Sec. Check Cashing, Inc., </em>409 Md. at 111, 972 A.2d at 899. We review also without deference the trial court\u2019s pure conclusions of law. <em>Id. </em>Under this standard, the lower court\u2019s interpretations of law \u201cenjoy no presumption of correctness on review: the appellate court must apply the law as it understands it to be.\u201d <em>Rohrbaugh v. Estate of Stern, </em>305 Md. 443, 447 n. 2, 505 A.2d 113, 115 n. 2 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\n<em>A. The Underlying Cause of Action: The Maryland, Wage Payment and Collection Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Maryland allows employees to recover wages withheld unlawfully from them by their employers under two statutes: the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law (\u201cMWPCL\u201d) and the Maryland Wage and Hour Law (\u201cMWHL\u201d). <em>Peters v. Early Healthcare Giver, Inc., </em>439 Md. 646, 652-53, 97 A.3d 621, 624-25 (2014). The MWHL provides a minimum wage standard, <em>id., </em>and the MWPCL \u201csets certain standards for the frequency and methods of compensation, permissible deductions from pay, and notification of employees about the details of pay and changes in the amount or method of payment.\u201d <em>Ocean City, Md., Chamber of Commerce, Inc. v. Barufaldi, </em>434 Md. 381, 385, 75 A.3d 952, 954 (2013). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>MWPCL is a statutory cause of action, the purpose of which is \u201cto provide a vehicle for employees to collect, and an incentive for employers to pay, back wages.\u201d <em>Battaglia v. Clinical Perfusionists, Inc., </em>338 Md. 352, 364, 658 A.2d 680, 686 (1995); <em>see Barufaldi, </em>434 Md. at 384, 75 A.3d at 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">We have had occasion to examine in detail the development of the MWPCL and its fee-shifting provision. <em>See Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 515-18, 819 A.2d 354, 362-64 (2003); <em>Barufaldi, </em>434 Md. at 391-94, 75 A.3d at 958-59. We note here only a few highlights of that history. The precursor to the MWPCL was enacted in 1966, but did not provide originally for a direct private action against an employer for a violation of its provisions. <em>Marshall v. Safeway, Inc., </em>437 Md. 542, 559, 88 A.3d 735, 744-45 (2014). After the elimination of the unit within the office of the Commissioner of Labor and Industry responsible for prosecuting such civil actions, the General Assembly added a private right of action to \u201cprovide a meaningful remedy to the harm flowing from the refusal of employers to pay wages lawfully due____\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>437 Md. at 562, 88 A.3d at 746; <em>see Baltimore Harbor Charters, Ltd. v. Ayd, </em>365 Md. 366, 380-83, 780 A.2d 303, 311-13 (2001). The private cause of action was also designed to be \u201can incentive for employers to pay[ ] back wages,\u201d <em>Medex v. McCabe, </em>372 Md. 28, 39, 811 A.2d 297, 304 (2002) (quotations omitted), and to \u201censure that an employee will have the assistance of competent counsel in pursuing what is likely to be a relatively small claim.\u201d <em>Barufaldi, </em>434 Md. at 393, 75 A.3d at 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Although the distinction has not been material heretofore in the reasoning in our MWPCL cases,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> various federal courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>have struggled to identify whether the private cause of action under the MWPCL is a contract-based, tort-based, or statute-based cause of action. Choice of law questions have been important for federal courts exercising their supplemental jurisdiction over various state law claims and wielding choice of law doctrines. <em>See Yeibyo v. E-Park of DC, Inc., </em>No. DKC 2007-1919, 2008 WL 182502, at *4 (D.Md. Jan. 18, 2008).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Yeibyo, </em>attempting to determine whether the MWPCL or MWHL applied to the case, the hearing judge endeavored to follow our advice in <em>Erie Insurance Exchange v. Heffernan:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqB\">Generally, in a conflict-of-laws situation, a court must determine at the outset the nature of the problem presented to it for solution, specifically, if it relates to torts, contracts, property, or some other field, or to a matter of substance or procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\"><em>Yeibyo, </em>2008 WL 182502, at *4-5 (quoting <em>Erie Insurance Exchange v. Heffernan, </em>399 Md. 598, 615, 925 A.2d 636, 646 (2007)). The <em>Yeibyo </em>court could not determine conclusively if it should follow <em>lex loci delicti </em>(if the MWPCL claim sounded in tort) or <em>lex loci contractus </em>(if the MWPCL claim sounded in contract) with regard to the MWPCL claim, but supposed that MWPCL claims sounded likely in contract as \u201cemployment relationships are paradigmatically contractual in nature.\u201d <em>Yeibyo, </em>2008 WL 182502, at *4; see <em>Blanch v. Chubb &amp; Son, Inc., </em>No. CCB-12-1965, 2014 WL 3421534, at *2 n. 4 (D.Md. Jul. 10, 2014) (noting that MWPCL claims \u201cmust have a contractual predicate\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The <em>Yeibyo </em>court concluded ultimately that Maryland courts would apply likely the law of the District of Columbia in either circumstance based on the facts of the case and the MWPCL claim was dismissed ultimately. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>Yeibyo, </em>2008 WL 182502, at *5-6. A federal district court in New York also attempted in <em>Arakelian v. Omnicare, Inc., </em>to determine whether MWPCL claims sound in contract or tort. 735 F.Supp.2d 22, 37 (S.D.N.Y.2010). Reviewing Maryland and federal case law, the <em>Arakelian </em>court observed that \u201c[i]t is not entirely clear whether claims under Section 3-507.1(b) of the [MWPCL] sound in contract or tort,\u201d but concluded, similar to the <em>Yeibyo </em>court, that the MWPCL would not apply under New York\u2019s choice of law rules as the forum state. <em>Arakelian, </em>735 F.Supp.2d at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The MWPCL makes available a cause of action to jilted employees. The causes of action under the MWPCL, like those available under the Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, are remedial in nature, in that both provide a remedy to employees who are attempting to collect lost wages. <em>See Johnson v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>430 Md. 368, 377, 61 A.3d 33, 38 (2013) (\u201c \u2018[W]e recognize that the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act is a remedial statute.\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>Montgomery County v. Deibler, </em>423 Md. 54, 61, 31 A.3d 191, 195 (2011))).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although the cause of action assumes the existence of some sort of underlying contract, it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>sound <em>per se </em>in contract. A MWPCL claim does not require necessarily analysis of the parties\u2019 underlying contract, nor does an action under the MWPCL require that a breach of contract action be pursued contemporaneously. Instead, a MWPCL action may be an independent, stand-alone claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><em>B. The Proper Application of </em>Lex Loci Contractus</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Maryland has recognized the common law doctrine of <em>lex loci contractus </em>since at least 1807. <em>See De Sobry v. De Laistre, </em>2 H. &amp; J. 191, 191 (Md.1807). This doctrine requires that, when determining the construction, validity, enforceability, or interpretation of a contract, we apply the law of the jurisdiction where the contract was made. <em>Lewis v. Waletzky, </em>422 Md. 647, 657 n. 8, 31 A.3d 123, 129 n. 8 (2011) (\u201cWhen determining which law controls the enforceability and construction of a contract, we apply <em>lex loci contractus.\u201d); American Motorists Ins. Co. v. ARTRA Group, Inc., </em>338 Md. 560, 570, 659 A.2d 1295, 1300 (1995) (\u201c[T]he construction and validity of a contract [must] be determined by the law of the place of making of the contract.\u201d); <em>Ward v. Nationwide Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>328 Md. 240, 246-47, 614 A.2d 85, 88 (1992) (\u201c[I]n deciding questions of interpretation and enforceability of contract provisions, a Maryland court ordinarily should apply the law of the jurisdiction where the contract was made. This choice of law principle is referred to as <em>lex loci contractus.\u201d); Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hart, </em>327 Md. 526, 529, 611 A.2d 100, 101 (1992); <em>Kramer v. Bally\u2019s Park Place, Inc., </em>311 Md. 387, 390, 535 A.2d 466, 467 (1988); <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. G.C. Zarnas and Co., </em>304 Md. 183, 188, 498 A.2d 605, 607 (1985). If the contract contains a choice of law provision, we apply generally the law of the specified jurisdiction. <em>ARTRA Group, Inc., </em>338 Md. at 573, 659 A.2d at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">We have deployed the doctrine of <em>lex loci contractus </em>when interpreting many kinds of contracts, but most frequently where insurance contracts were at issue. In <em>ARTRA Group, Inc., </em>we turned to <em>lex loci contractus </em>when considering the validity and interpretation of a pollution exclusion clause in an insurance contract. 338 Md. at 565-66, 659 A.2d at 1297. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number><em>Ward, </em>we relied on the doctrine to interpret a personal injury protection benefits provision of an automobile insurance contract. 328 Md. at 242, 614 A.2d at 85. We have referred also to <em>lex loci contractus </em>when determining whether a California marriage contract was valid,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Port v.

As the parties did not determine for themselves a jurisdiction\u2019s law to apply, should there be a dispute over the validity and enforceability of the contract, we would apply Virginia law as determined by <em>lex loci contractus. </em>Similarly, if there was a dispute over the construction or interpretation of one of the express terms or provisions of the contract, we would apply Virginia law under <em>lex loci contractus. </em>In this case, however, neither party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>disputes the validity or enforceability of the contract. The contract contains no express terms regarding what Feinberg was to be paid, or for which services. The contract is silent largely as to the recovery of unpaid wages, providing only that \u201cContractor invoices will be submitted bi-weekly,\u201d \u201c[t]he Contractor will determine the amount of hourly time expended on work assigned to be undertaken,\u201d and \u201c[t]he Contractor\u2019s earnings will depend solely on his/her own production.\u201d There is nothing in the Agreement relevant expressly to the payment of wages to interpret or enforce. The Agreement does not even contain Feinberg\u2019s hourly rate. No party has asked us to interpret or construct an express term of the Agreement. The doctrine of <em>lex loci contractus, </em>accordingly, does not apply to Feinberg\u2019s unpaid wages claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Petitioners suggest that there are certain implied terms added to the parties\u2019 contract that implicate <em>lex loci contractus. </em>Petitioners note that, when construing contracts, relevant statutory requirements and standards are as much a part of a Virginia contract as if incorporated expressly by reference therein. They cite Virginia and federal cases in support of this assertion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Specifically, they draw our attention to a case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit citing a case of the Virginia Supreme Court, both of which suggest that, when construing insurance contracts, a relevant \u201c \u2018statutory provision is as much a part of the policy as if incorporated therein.\u2019 \u201d <em>A &amp; E Supply Co. v.

Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 40.1-29 (West 2009). The relevant portions of that statute are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">A. 1. All employers operating a business shall establish regular pay periods and rates of pay for employees except executive personnel. All such employers shall pay salaried employees at least once each month and employees paid on an hourly rate at least once every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>two weeks or twice in each month.... Upon termination of employment an employee shall be paid all wages or salaries due him for work performed prior thereto; such payment shall be made on or before the date on which he would have been paid for such work had his employment not been terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">2. Any such employer who knowingly fails to make payment of wages in accordance with this section shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each violation....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">C. No employer shall withhold any part of the wages or salaries of any employee except for payroll, wage or withholding taxes or in accordance with law, without the written and signed authorization of the employee. An employer, upon request of his employee, shall furnish the latter a written statement of the gross wages earned by the employee during any pay period and the amount and purpose of any deductions therefrom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">D. No employer shall require any employee, except executive personnel, to sign any contract or agreement which provides for the forfeiture of the employee\u2019s wages for time worked as a condition of employment or the continuance therein, except as otherwise provided by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">E. An employer who willfully and with intent to defraud fails or refuses to pay wages in accordance with this section is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor if the value of the wages earned and not paid by the employer is less than $10,000 and is guilty of a Class 6 felony if the value of the wages earned and not paid is $10,000 or more or, regardless of the value of the wages earned and not paid, if the conviction is a second or subsequent conviction under this section....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">G. In addition to being subject to any other penalty provided by the provisions of this section, any employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>who fails to make payment of wages in accordance with subsection A shall be liable for the payment of all wages due, plus interest at an annual rate of eight percent accruing from the date the wages were due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">H. Civil penalties owed under this section shall be paid to the Commissioner for deposit into the general fund of the State Treasurer....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Petitioners argue that the foregoing statutory provisions should be considered part and parcel of the parties\u2019 Agreement as implied terms. The Agreement, in the Petitioners\u2019 view, thereby provides an administrative remedy in cases of withheld wages, but no private cause of action (other than a breach of contract claim). Construed as such, the dispute between the parties is one of construction of a contract\u2019s terms, and thus <em>lex loci contractus </em>determines that the law of Virginia should apply, to the exclusion of the MWPCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">We are not persuaded by this argument. Rather, we agree with Feinberg that such an understanding of <em>lex loci contractus </em>would be an impermissibly broad application of the doctrine. We are unaware of a case in which we used <em>lex loci contractus </em>to import another forum\u2019s statute into a foreign contract as an implied term and then interpret the contract in light of that implied term to the exclusion of our laws and remedies. Instead, the doctrine of <em>lex loci contractus </em>should be understood properly to apply only to the express terms of a contract, not implied ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Moreover, Petitioners\u2019 argument, that we look to Virginia\u2019s law in determining whether wages were withheld improperly and, if so, the proper remedy, would lead nonetheless to an outcome unfavorable to Petitioners: the assertedly implied term of \u00a7 40.1-29 is essentially one of remedies, but under the choice of law principle <em>lex fori, </em>we look to the law of the forum in determining the remedy available to a plaintiff in a contract-related action, not <em>lex loci contractus. Eastwood v. Kennedy, </em>44 Md. 563, 567-68 (1876); <em>see Mike Smith Pontiac, GMC, Inc. v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc., </em>356 Md. 542, 741 A.2d 462 (1999) (applying the rate of post-judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>interest of the <em>lex fon </em>(Maryland) instead of that of the judgment-rendering state); <em>see also Traylor v. Grafton, </em>273 Md. 649, 668-69, 332 A.2d 651, 664 (1975) (noting that the answer to the question of whether the subject clause should be construed to provide for the payment of liquidated damages was the same under both the <em>lex fori </em>and the <em>lex loci contractus </em>). Thus even though the Agreement between the parties is a \u201cVirginia\u201d contract, if we embraced Petitioners\u2019 choice of law argument, the remedies available to Feinberg are determined by the law of Maryland as the <em>lex fori.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In <em>Himes, </em>178 Md.App. 504, 943 A.2d 30, the Court of Special Appeals considered a very similar factual situation to the present case, holding that Virginia employers could be subject to liability under the MWPCL in certain circumstances. The employee in <em>Himes </em>brought in Maryland courts a breach of contract claim and a MWPCL claim seeking to recover contractually-provided severance pay. <em>Himes, </em>178 Md.App. at 512-13, 943 A.2d at 34-35. The employee, who lived in Maryland, worked for a Virginia employer and spent most of his work time in that state. <em>Himes, </em>178 Md.App. at 513-15, 943 A.2d at 35-36. Anderson, the employee, was tasked with overseeing the construction of a building in Virginia, but, as a part of those responsibilities, he was required to present a proposal in Baltimore and attend meetings twice a month in Baltimore. <em>Id. </em>On two other occasions, the employee was asked to visit a work site in Gaithersburg and work on a project in Aberdeen in Maryland. <em>Himes, </em>178 Md.App. at 515-16, 943 A.2d at 36-37. Himes, the employer, argued that the MWPCL extended liability only to <em>Maryland </em>employers, and, being a Virginia company, it was not liable to Anderson. <em>Himes, </em>178 Md.App. at 532-33, 943 A.2d at 46. In riposte, the employee argued for a more expansive understanding of the term \u201cemployer.\u201d <em>Himes, </em>178 Md.App. at 534, 943 A.2d at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The intermediate appellate court agreed with the employee. After noting that the scope of the term \u201cemployer\u201d in the MWPCL depended on the meaning of the related phrase \u201cemploys an individual in the State,\u201d \u00a7 3-501(b), the court turned to the definition of \u201cemploys.\u201d <em>Himes, </em>178 Md.App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>535, 943 A.2d at 48. As defined in \u00a7 3-101, the term \u201cemploy\u201d specifically includes \u201c(i) allowing an individual to work; and (ii) instructing an individual to be present at a work site.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals concluded that \u201c[t]he plain language of LE section 3-101 covers the situation in which a company outside of Maryland directs its employee to go to a work site in Maryland.\u201d <em>Himes, </em>178 Md.App. at 535, 943 A.2d at 48. Because the employee attended meetings twice a month in Baltimore, the intermediate appellate court concluded that the Virginia employer must confront the employee\u2019s MWPCL claims.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals did not consider explicitly in <em>Himes lex loci contractus, lex fori, </em>or any other choice of law doctrines. Nonetheless, general conflict of laws issues were raised. The employer alluded to the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation\u2019s [DLLR]\u2019s pamphlet entitled \u201cMaryland Guide to Wage Payment and Employment Standards\u201d in suggesting certain jurisdictional limits on the MWPCL. <em>Himes, </em>178 Md.App. at 533, 943 A.2d at 47. The version of the pamphlet contained the following note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">*Note on Jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">Claims for unpaid wages must be brought in the state in which the work was performed. If work was performed in more than one state, claims may generally be filed in the state in which the employer maintains its business office\u2014 that is, the office where the employee reports to or was hired out of.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-7\"><em>Id. </em>Based on the language of the pamphlet and Himes\u2019s reading of the term \u201cemployer,\u201d the employer argued that suit should have been filed in Virginia under \u00a7 40.1-29 instead of in Maryland under the MWPCL. <em>Id. </em>The intermediate appellate court responded to that argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">The DLLR\u2019s \u201cNote on Jurisdiction,\u201d stating that when work has been performed in more than one state \u201cclaims may generally be filed in the state in which the employer maintains its business office[,]\u201d cannot alter the plain meaning of the language of the controlling statute or its application to the evidence in this case. When statutory language is unambiguous, we will not defer to an agency\u2019s differing interpretation of it. Moreover, the wording of the \u201cNote on Jurisdiction\u201d is not mandatory and does not wholly support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>[the employer\u2019s] position. The note states only that, when an individual has performed work in more than one state, his claim for unpaid wages <em>\u201cmay generally </em>be filed in the state where the employer maintains its business office.\u201d (Emphasis added). It does not <em>require </em>that such a claim be filed in the state where the employer keeps a business office. Thus, even under the DLLR\u2019s interpretation of the MWPCL, [the employee] was not prohibited from filing his claim for unpaid wages in Maryland.[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9o\"><em>Himes, </em>178 Md.App. at 535-36, 943 A.2d at 48 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). The Court of Special Appeals affirmed ultimately the trial court\u2019s award to the employee of treble damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs. <em>Himes, </em>178 Md.App. at 543, 943 A.2d at 52-53. The employer petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which we denied. <em>Himes v. Anderson, </em>405 Md. 291, 950 A.2d 829 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Based on our analysis of the doctrine of <em>lex loci contractus, </em>we come to a conclusion shared by the Court of Special Appeals: employees working for employers located in Virginia are not limited to the remedies available under Virginia\u2019s wage payment laws, but may, in certain circumstances, be answerable to claims under the MWPCL in Maryland courts.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>C.

Even if we were prepared to hold that <em>lex loci contractus </em>applied to this dispute in the manner in which Petitioners would have us apply the doctrine, we would be inclined not to foreclose the possibility of Feinberg recovering under the MWPCL in Maryland\u2019s courts for public policy reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We have long recognized an exception to the application of <em>lex loci contractus: </em>we refuse to apply the doctrine when doing so would be \u201ccontrary to a strong public policy of this State.\u201d <em>ARTRA Group, Inc., </em>338 Md. at 573, 659 A.2d at 1301; <em>see Laboratory Corp. of America v.

The contract between the antagonists provided that the contractor would hold the steel plant owner harmless from any injuries suffered by the contractor or any subcontractors. <em>Bethlehem Steel, </em>304 Md. at 185-86, 498 A.2d at 606.

Maryland recognized wrongful birth actions, but North Carolina did not. <em>Hood, </em>395 Md. at 611, 911 A.2d at 842-43. The District Court needed to know ultimately whether to apply the substantive law of Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>or of North Carolina. <em>Id. </em>We extrapolated from a Maryland statutory prohibition on interfering with a woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy that another state\u2019s failure to recognize wrongful birth actions was contrary to the strong public policy of Maryland. <em>Hood, </em>395 Md. at 624-25, 911 A.2d at 850-51. The court determined that the right to seek damages in a wrongful birth action represented \u201cclear, strong, and important Maryland public policy,\u201d as represented in Maryland Code \u00a7 20-209(b) of the Health General Article, which precluded the State from \u201cinterfering with the decision of a woman to terminate her pregnancy at any time ... if the fetus is affected by genetic defect or serious deformity or abnormality.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In <em>Kramer v. Bally\u2019s Park Place, Inc., </em>we considered whether a New Jersey gambling contract violated Maryland public policy such that a Maryland court should refuse to apply New Jersey law. 311 Md. 387, 535 A.2d 466. The petitioner wrote a check for $5,000, payable to Bally\u2019s Park Place, as payment of a gambling debt, but argued before us that gambling debts were not recognized as legal or valid in Maryland. <em>Kramer, </em>311 Md. at 388-89, 535 A.2d at 466-67. The development and advance of gambling laws were in a state of flux, as some forms of gambling were becoming legalized and, accordingly, we determined that prohibitions on gambling in Maryland did not represent our state\u2019s strong public policy. <em>Kramer, </em>311 Md. at 396, 535 A.2d at 470. We drew similar inferences, based on the changes in laws governing terms of credit card agreements, in <em>Jackson v. Pasadena Receivables, Inc., </em>398 Md. 611, 624-27, 921 A.2d 799, 806-08 (2007). In that case, we reviewed the history of Maryland\u2019s laws regarding bank-issued credit cards, and held that, based on the tightening of some requirements and the loosening of others, and the absence of any clear legislative intent indicating strong public policy, Maryland\u2019s laws regarding signatures on credit card agreements did not constitute \u201cfundamental\u201d public policy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The Court of Special Appeals has looked also to changing societal mores in determining whether a strong public policy is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>implicated by legislative enactment. In <em>Linton v. Linton, </em>the intermediate appellate court engaged in an analysis to determine whether public policy would be violated by Maryland courts entertaining an inter-spousal tort action prohibited here at the time by the doctrine of inter-spousal immunity (but allowable in Virginia) pursuant to <em>lex loci delicti. </em>46 Md.App. 660, 663, 420 A.2d 1249, 1251 (1980). Referencing changing perspectives in society on permitting the bringing of suits regarding inter-spousal torts, the court held that the public policy reflected in Maryland\u2019s inter-spousal immunity doctrine was not sufficiently strong to decline to entertain the suit. <em>Linton, </em>46 Md.App. at 663, 667, 420 A.2d at 1251, 1253. The Court of Special Appeals revisited this question in the context of interfamilial tort suits, reiterating the reasoning of <em>Linton </em>in <em>Rhee v. Combined Enterprises, Inc., </em>74 Md.App. 214, 223-25, 536 A.2d 1197, 1201-02 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Petitioners\u2019 brought to our attention several cases in which federal judges, applying conflict of law principles, found that a private right of action under the MWPCL was not available to employees claiming unpaid wages under contracts entered outside of Maryland. Each of these cases involved contractual choice of law clauses,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and in each, the sitting judge considered whether the MWPCL reflected strong public policy of Maryland, and concluded ultimately that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In <em>Taylor v. Lotus Development Corp., </em>the hearing judge determined that a choice of law provision in the parties\u2019 employment contract, electing to be governed under Massachusetts law, was enforceable to the exclusion of the MWPCL, because the MWPCL did not constitute public policy strong enough to overcome the parties\u2019 choice of law provision. <em>Taylor v. Lotus Dev. Corp., </em>906 F.Supp. 290, 297-98 (D.Md. 1995). That court was of the opinion that, under Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>law, the \u201cmere presence of dissimilar law is insufficient to render a choice-of-law provision void; rather, [the other state\u2019s] law must run contrary to a <em>strong </em>Maryland public policy to be unenforceable.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>906 F.Supp. at 298 (emphasis added). The <em>Taylor </em>court determined that the MWPCL did not represent Maryland\u2019s \u201cfundamental public policy\u201d because the statute did not \u201cunambiguously express[ ] that [its] provisions represented fundamental public policy of the state [or that] any purported waiver of the provisions contained in those statutes was expressly unenforceable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The MWPCL, \u201csimply by its existence\u201d alone, did not represent a fundamental policy of Maryland. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Roughly fifteen years later, in <em>Sedghi v. Patchlink Corp., </em>another judge in the federal District Court of Maryland concluded that the MWPCL did not embody strong public policy, and accordingly enforced a choice of law clause opting to apply Arizona law. No. JFM-07-1686, 2010 WL 3895472, at *4 (D.Md. Sept. 30, 2010).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> That court relied on <em>Taylor </em>for the proposition that \u201cthe MWPCL did not represent fundamental public policy.\u201d <em>Id. Sedghi </em>was reversed in part ultimately, but on other grounds. <em>Sedghi v. PatchLink Corp., </em>440 Fed.Appx. 165 (4th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In <em>Kunda v. C.R. Bard, Inc. </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the MWPCL did not express fundamental Maryland policy sufficiently enough to trump the parties\u2019 New Jersey choice of law contract provision. 671 F.3d 464, 466 (4th Cir.2011). That court determined that the MWPCL contained no express language of legislative intent nor any anti-waiver provisions. <em>Kunda, </em>671 F.3d at 468. Immediately prior to the filing of the opinion in <em>Kunda, </em>however, House Bill 298 (2011 session), enacted by the Maryland Legislature, took effect and changed the landscape of the MWPCL by adding an anti-waiver provision of a sort to the MWPCL. <em>See infra </em>Op. 344-48, 107 A.3d at 1215-18. Perhaps the Fourth Circuit was unaware of this change; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>perhaps they determined not to assign to the change much weight.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> That court reasoned that, as (at that time) forty-two other states had enacted similar wage payment laws, the MWPCL likely was not fundamental public policy, as \u201c[t]he availability of comparable, albeit different, legislation in different states demonstrates that protection under the MWPCL is unnecessary where there is a substitute, as there is here.\u201d <em>Kunda, </em>671 F.3d at 469. We do not deign to speak for our fellow states as to why they may have enacted similar wage payment laws. We can say that, in Maryland, the protections afforded the timely payment of wages owed are quite important, and many of our laws dealing with the subject reflect our strong public policies in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We encourage a future Maryland Court to hold (in light of the considered dicta expressed here) that the MWPCL represents strong Maryland public policy. The anti-waiver provision and other clear indicators of legislative intent point to such a conclusion. \u201c[D]eclaration of the public policy of the State is normally the function of the legislative branch of government; in discerning that policy, courts consider, as a primary source, statutory ... provisions.\u201d <em>Jones v. Malinowski, </em>299 Md. 257, 273 n. 4, 473 A.2d 429, 437 n. 4 (1984). An anti-waiver provision was added to the MWPCL by House Bill 298 of the 2011 session as \u00a7 3\u2014502(f), which provides that \u201c[a]n agreement to work for less than the wage required under this subtitle is void.\u201d Md. Code (1999, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2014 Cum. Supp.), Labor &amp; Employment Art., \u00a7 3\u2014502(f). The subtitle referenced by \u00a7 3-502(f) is Subtitle 5 (Wage Payment and Collection) of Title 3 (Employment Standards and Conditions). The \u201cwage[s] required\u201d means \u201call compensation that is due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>an employee for employment,\u201d including bonuses, commissions, fringe benefits, overtime benefits, and other forms of remuneration promised for services. \u00a7 3\u2014501(c). Under \u00a7 3-502(f), parties cannot make agreements in which they agree to work for less than the wages owed to them. This anti-waiver provision is similar to the one in <em>National Glass, </em>where we held that an anti-waiver provision signaled the existence of strong public policy.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Before the anti-waiver provision was added, our case law suggested that employees could not contract away their right to be compensated for their work. In <em>Medex, </em>we held that \u201c[cjontractual language between the parties cannot be used to eliminate the requirement and public policy that employees have a right to be compensated for their efforts.\u201d <em>Medex, </em>372 Md. at 39, 811 A.2d at 304. We did not have occasion in that case to discuss whether this reflected the <em>strong </em>public policy of our State, but we agreed with the Court of Special Appeals that \u201ca contract conflicting with public policy set forth in a statute is invalid to the extent of the conflict between the contract and that policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>McCabe v. Medex, </em>141 Md.App. 558, 566, 786 A.2d 57, 62 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Despite the language in <em>Medex </em>suggesting the importance of the policy embodied in the MWPCL, federal courts continue, it seems, to hold that the MWPCL does not apply when parties choose another state\u2019s law in a choice of law clause. <em>See, e.g., Kunda, </em>671 F.3d at 468 (\u201c[T]he Maryland Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Medex v. McCabe </em>fails to show that the MWPCL is a fundamental Maryland public policy____\u201d); <em>Lantry v. Pitney Bowes Inc., </em>No. 08:08-CV-1273-AW, 2011 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>3843693, at *3 (D.Md.

VisionAIR, Inc., </em>385 F.Supp.2d 549, 558 (D.Md.2005) (denying a motion for summary judgment in light of a factual question as to the nature of an employee\u2019s commissions, and noting that an employment agreement clause \u201cmay contravene Maryland\u2019s public policy as embodied in the MWPC[L]\u201d); <em>Adams v. Wells Fargo Advisors, LLC, </em>No. ELH-12-2130, 2014 WL 2124447, at *26 (D.Md.

The anti-waiver provision of the MWPCL originated as House Bill 298 and was introduced in the Maryland General Assembly in 2011. H.D. 298, 2011 Leg., 428th Sess. (Md. 2011). The Fiscal and Policy Note of the Bill suggested that it had no effect except to \u201cclariffy] current law.\u201d Dep\u2019t Legis. Serv., Fiscal &amp; Pol\u2019y Note, 2011-298, at 1 (Md. 2011). The term \u201cclarifying\u201d \u201csometimes can be helpful in signaling legislative intent.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>430 Md. at 389, 61 A.3d at 45. The term \u201ccan mean ... that this is what lawmakers viewed as the state of the law all along.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>430 Md. at 389, 61 A.3d at 45.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>While amendments are not controlling as to the meaning of prior iteration of the same statutory scheme, \u201c \u2018nevertheless, subsequent legislation can be considered helpful to determine legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>430 Md. at 389, 61 A.3d at 45 (quoting <em>Chesek v. Jones, </em>406 Md. 446, 462, 959 A.2d 795, 804 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The testimony of one of the Bill\u2019s sponsors, Delegate Jose-line A. Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk, before the Senate Finance Committee, is particularly informative. She explained that employers doing business in Maryland were forcing employees to waive their MWPCL rights, either explicitly or by \u201capplying the laws of other states to their employment relationship that provide fewer protections than the MWPCL.\u201d <em>Wage Payment and Collection: Void Agreements: Blearing on H.B. 298 Before the H.D. Economic Matters Committee, </em>428th Sess. 1 (2011) (statement of Del. Joseline A. Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk). She named Sedghi<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> in her testimony, recounting that court\u2019s determination that the MWPCL did not represent \u201cimportant \u2018public policy.\u2019 \u201d She suggested that \u201c[b]y placing an express prohibition against contracting for less than the wages owed, we can clarify for the courts that the MWPCL is important public policy and remove any question that such agreements should be voided.\u201d <em>Id.; see Johnson, </em>430 Md. at 388, 61 A.3d at 44-45 (recognizing that the existence of a copy of a decision in a bill file along with numerous references to a decision of the Court of Appeals in the legislative history indicated that an amendment was made in response to that decision). She noted also that the same language existed already in \u00a7 3-405 of the Maryland Wage and Hour Law and should be interpreted the same way.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>She iterated the same testimony regarding H.B. 298 before the House Economic Matters Committee a month earlier. <em>Wage Payment and Collection: Void Agreements: Hearing on H.B. 298 Before the S.

The bill passed in the House and Senate and became effective on 1 October 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The interpretation of the MWPCL requires a certain appreciation of other provisions of Maryland\u2019s overall labor and employment statutory scheme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">When the statute to be interpreted is part of a statutory scheme, it must be interpreted in that context. That means that, when interpreting any statute, the statute as a whole must be construed, interpreting each provision of the statute in the context of the entire statutory scheme. Thus, statutes on the same subject are to be read together and harmonized to the extent possible....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\"><em>Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v. Fitzpatrick, </em>366 Md. 295, 302-03, 783 A.2d 667, 671 (2001) (citations omitted). Workers\u2019 compensation statutes, although sufficiently different from contract and tort principles so as to be considered separately, nonetheless have some affinity to both. <em>See Hood, </em>395 Md. at 621, 911 A.2d at 848. In the context of workers\u2019 compensation statutes, we have at times applied a public policy exception. <em>See Hutzell v. Boyer, 252 </em>Md. 227, 249 A.2d 449 (1969); <em>Hauch v. Connor, 295 </em>Md. 120, 453 A.2d 1207 (1983). In <em>Hutzell, </em>we rejected the application of Virginia law which otherwise would have applied because Maryland had \u201ca genuine interest in the welfare of a person injured within its borders\u201d and the \u201csocial and economic problems following [the injury] ... are properly matters of public concern.\u201d <em>Hutzell, 252 </em>Md. at 233, 249 A.2d at 452. More recent workers\u2019 compensation cases reflect a pointed willingness by Maryland to allow itself to be a forum where the rights of employees may be vindicated to the fullest extent possible under our workers\u2019 compensation statutory scheme. For example, in <em>Pro-Football, Inc. v. McCants, </em>a player on the roster of the Washington NFL football team brought in Maryland a workers\u2019 compensation claim for game injuries sustained in various forums\u2014some in Maryland, and some out of state. 428 Md. 270, 275-76, 51 A.3d 586, 589-90 (2012). McCants\u2019 employment contract contained a forum-selection clause choosing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Virginia law, but we allowed McCants nonetheless to maintain a claim in Maryland for the injuries sustained here and out-of-state. <em>McCants, </em>428 Md. at 288, 51 A.3d at 596-97; <em>see Pro-Football, Inc. v. Tupa, </em>197 Md.App. 463, 471, 474, 14 A.3d 678, 682, 684 (2011), <em>aff'd, </em>428 Md. 198, 51 A.3d 544 (2012) (holding that a player on the roster of the Washington NFL football team was a \u201ccovered employee\u201d under \u00a7 9-203(a) of the workers\u2019 compensation statute despite working \u201cintermittently\u201d in Maryland playing games at FedEx Field and \u201cprimarily\u201d in Virginia practicing).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Although significant differences exist between our workers\u2019 compensation statutory scheme and the MWPCL, we refer to these cases to make a point that Maryland is willing generally to allow itself to be used as a forum by workers seeking recovery of their wage claims. We offer no prediction as to the ultimate success or failure of Feinberg\u2019s claim, recognizing that additional facts must be found on remand before its merits may be adjudicated finally.

In that matter, we were asked to determine whether an amendment to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act providing for certain benefits to dependents applied retrospectively or prospectively. <em>Johnson, </em>430 Md. at 373, 61 A.3d at 35. As a part of our analysis, we recognized that whether a statute applied to future cases was determined by consideration of four basic principles: (1) the presumption that statutes operate prospectively, (2) statutes governing procedure or remedy will be applied to cases pending when the statute becomes effective, (3) statutes are given retroactive effect if that is what the Legislature intended, and (4) despite legislative intent, statutes will not be applied retroactively if doing so would impair vested rights, deny due process, or violate the prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>laws. <em>Johnson, </em>430 Md. at 381-82, 61 A.3d at 40-41.

Indeed, the opinion does not note where the employee signed the written employment agreement, but does say that a draft was sent to the employee at his home in Annapolis and that he executed it shortly after receiving it. <em>Himes, </em>178 Md.App. at 513, 943 A.2d at 35.

As to the question of work time spent by Anderson in Maryland, the Court of Special Appeals did not highlight other points of connection that the employee had with Maryland, including the projects that he worked on in Gaithersburg and Aberdeen.
