Hodes, Respondent, was admitted to the Bar of this Court on December 18, 1975. On October 29, 2013, the Attorney Grievance Commission, (\u201cPetitioner\u201d or \u201cBar Counsel\u201d), acting pursuant to Maryland Rule lO-NSRa),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\u201cPetition For Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Respondent related to his representation of Gloria S. Ominsky. Petitioner alleged that Respondent violated the following Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cRule\u201d): 1.7 (Conflict of Interest: General Rule),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rule 1.15(d) (Safekeeping Property),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 8.1(a) (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 8.4(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>(b), (c) and (d) (Misconduct),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as well as Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code (Misuse of trust money).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">In an Order dated November 4, 2013, we referred the matter to Judge Vicki Ballou-Watts of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for a hearing, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Respondent was served with the Petition for Disci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>plinary or Remedial Action, our Order and the Writ of Summons on November 20, 2013, to which Respondent filed a timely response.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Judge Ballou-Watts held evidentiary hearings on March 4, 2014, March 5, 2014 and March 10, 2014. At the hearings, Bar Counsel presented testimony from individuals associated with Respondent\u2019s former law firm, Hodes, Pessin and Katz, P.A. (hereinafter \u201cHPK\u201d), to include Richard \u201cRicky\u201d Adams, a paralegal, Donna Zurowski, one of Hodes\u2019s secretaries, and five attorneys, Kimberly Battaglia,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Steven Allen, Kevin Bress, Helen Smith and Drake Zaharris. Hodes testified on his own behalf; he additionally called Lynn Lazzaro, his accountant, LeDonna Berman, a paralegal from his former law firm, Ellen Hodes, his wife, Donna Balanesi, his current secretary, and several character witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Bar Counsel introduced various documents, which were admitted into evidence, including Gloria S. Ominsky\u2019s Last Will and Testament, a Power of Attorney executed by her, an unexecuted Promissory Note, a Promissory Note Guaranty signed by the Respondent, correspondence between Ms. Ominsky and the Respondent, copies of numerous checks and copies of bank account statements. Respondent introduced various documents, which were admitted into evidence, including another copy of Gloria S. Ominsky\u2019s Last Will and Testament, a memorandum to the Ominsky file written by Richard Adams, bank account statements and Hodes\u2019s resume.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Judge Ballou-Watts issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in which she found, by clear and convincing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>evidence, that Respondent violated Rules 1.7, 1.15(d), 8.1(a),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 8.4(a), (b), (c) and (d) of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct and Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code, all of which had been charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Judge Ballou-Watts\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law state:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">The Respondent was admitted to the Maryland Bar in December 1975. He is a 1975 graduate of the University of Baltimore School of Law. Respondent practiced law at several law firms throughout Maryland until he founded Michael Hodes, P.A. during the late 1980\u2019s. He developed a practice concentration in the areas of estates, trusts and what came to be recognized as elder law. Over time, the law firm he founded grew and became known as Hodes, Ulman, Pessin and Katz. Respondent served as Managing Partner of the law firm until 2007. Drake Zaharris succeeded Respondent as the Managing Partner and continues to serve in that capacity. When Attorney Lou Ulman left the practice, the firm was known as Hodes, Pessin and Katz, P.A. (hereinafter \u201cHPK\u201d) until Respondent left the firm in May 2012. After his departure from HPK, Respondent established a new Towson-based firm known as \u201cMichael Hodes, LLC.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">Respondent has been recognized by several organizations for his skill and experience in the practice areas of elder law, estates and trusts and wealth preservation. He serves as an adjunct law professor at two area law schools and discusses elder law issues during weekly radio broadcasts. Respondent has also been associated with philanthropic efforts for local institutions including his law school alma mater, the University of Baltimore. During the evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>hearing, several witnesses testified that they trusted him, valued his advice and appreciated his professional service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\">At all relevant times herein, until his departure from the firm in May 2012, Respondent practiced in HPK\u2019s \u201cWealth Preservation\u201d Department. There were three sections within the Wealth Preservation Department, namely, Estate Planning, Probate and Trust Administration and Elder Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">In 2005, Respondent and HPK began representing Gloria S. Ominsky. Ms. Ominsky sought legal advice in connection with elder care planning and asset preservation related to her sister Elaine Ominsky, who became disabled after a stroke. Both women were unmarried, had no children and no close relatives. They lived together in Pikesville, Maryland in a home inherited from their parents. The law firm helped secure Medicaid coverage for Elaine Ominsky and prepared estate planning documents for both Elaine and Gloria Ominsky. In the early stages of Respondent\u2019s Attorney-Client relationship with Gloria Ominsky, the value of her asset portfolio was between 1.5 to 2 million dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">Events During 2009-2011</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">After Gloria Ominsky\u2019s health began to decline in 2009, she talked with Respondent about executing a new will to replace the will she executed in 2005. Another HPK attorney prepared a new Last Will and Testament which named Respondent as Personal Representative. The new will also contained certain trust provisions for which Respondent was named as Trustee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">In addition, the law firm prepared a Durable Power of Attorney naming Respondent and another HPK attorney, Kevin Bress, to serve as Gloria Ominsky\u2019s attorneys-in-fact, jointly or individually, with regard to her personal care and various financial and property transactions. Although Kevin Bress was named as attorney-in-fact for Gloria Ominsky under the Durable Power of Attorney, he never exercised any authority on her behalf. And, Kevin Bress was never directly involved in the firm\u2019s representation of Gloria Ominsky.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>The Last Will and Testament and the Durable Power of Attorney were executed by Gloria Ominsky on April 27, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">During the last two years of her life, Gloria Ominsky moved from her home in Pikesville to an assisted living facility in Owings Mills (hereinafter \u201cThe Atrium\u201d) and later to Levindale Geriatric Center. She developed a relationship of trust with Respondent as her adviser and depended upon him for legal, financial, medical and personal matters. In November 2009, after Gloria Ominsky moved to The Atrium, Respondent\u2019s nephew, Brian Gates, moved into the Ominsky home. Although Mr. Gates did not pay rent, he paid the BG &amp; E bills and kept the home secure.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Paralegals in the law firm ran personal errands for Gloria Ominsky, paid bills, coordinated medical appointments and pharmacy needs and provided transportation for medical appointments. Ricky Adams was the HPK paralegal who handled the payment of bills and monitored her financial records. Another HPK paralegal, LeDonna Berman, coordinated medical appointments, pharmacy needs and transportation for medical visits. Gloria Ominsky was aware that the law firm billed her for the aforementioned nonlegal work at the HPK paralegal rate of $200.00 to as much as $275.00 per hour. Sometime between 2009 and 2010, Respondent introduced his wife (Ellen Hodes) to Gloria Ominsky. Subsequently, Respondent suggested to Gloria Ominsky that his wife could perform personal errands such as transporting Ms. Ominsky to medical appointments, talking with medical providers and shopping. Ms. Ominsky signed an undated letter on HPK letterhead agreeing to pay for Mrs. Hodes\u2019 services at an hourly rate of \u201c$25.00 per hour plus out of pocket expenses\u201d for \u201cday to day tasks\u201d and to \u201cbe an advocate with ... [her] personal and health care concerns and other situations that may arise.\u201d Respondent drafted and signed the letter. This arrangement saved money for Ms. Ominsky and provided income for Mrs. Hodes who was not employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>In 2010, Gloria Ominsky was diagnosed with cancer and began receiving chemotherapy. Because of her declining health, she could no longer drive and Respondent recommended that she sell her Buick LaCrosse. However, Ms. Ominsky did not want to sell her car. Instead, in May 2010, she authorized Respondent to \u201coperate and maintain the vehicle on her behalf and by her direction,\u201d according to a file memo prepared by Mr. Adams. Ms. Ominsky also agreed to pay expenses associated with driving her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">After her health began to decline, Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal checkbook, Wachovia bank statements and all other financial records were kept at the HPK office in a file cabinet near the desk of paralegal Richard Adams. As noted, Mr. Adams was the HPK paralegal responsible for handling the payment of Ms. Ominsky\u2019s bills. Whenever bill payment was needed, he followed an established procedure: Mr. Adams would take an invoice (or bill), prepare a check for payment with all sections completed except the date and signature line. Next, he would submit the invoice, an envelope and the prepared check to Respondent for approval and signature. Once Respondent signed the check, Mr. Adams made a copy of the invoice and check for the file. The payment was then mailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">There was a similar approval process for the payment of Ellen Hodes\u2019 time and expenses. Mrs. Hodes submitted a timesheet and any receipts for reimbursements. Mr. Adams prepared a check for payment but submitted Mrs. Hodes\u2019 timesheets and receipts to Kim Battaglia, an HPK attorney within the Wealth Preservation Department. Ms. Battaglia would review the timesheet and reconcile the receipts. On repeated occasions, the timesheets included requests for payment at the rate of $80.00 per hour. When this occurred, Ms. Battaglia attached a copy of the agreement for personal services to the timesheet as a reminder that Ms. Ominsky had agreed to pay Mrs. Hodes at the rate of $25.00 per hour. Ms. Battaglia would then return the documentation to Mr. Adams and ask him to submit a corrected check to Respondent for signature with the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>vised timesheet (and a copy of the personal services agreement) attached. Ms. Battaglia also reviewed the receipts (and Mr. Adams prepared the checks) whenever there was a reimbursement request for LeDonna Berman, Mr. Adams or Respondent. However, she did not have authority to reject the Respondent\u2019s reimbursement requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">On May 14, 2010, Respondent charged two gasoline purchases to his American Express card at a Royal Farms store. One charge was in the amount of $52.15 at 8:48. The second charge, a few minutes later, was in the amount of $28.85. Respondent submitted receipts for these gasoline payments as part of a larger claim for reimbursement. He then issued a check to himself drawn on Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal account that included reimbursement for the May 14, 2010 gas purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">On October 31, 2010, at 5:43 p.m., a parking citation was issued to a Lexus vehicle registered to Mrs. Hodes. Mrs. Hodes testified that she was shopping for Ms. Ominsky when she received the citation. Respondent submitted proof of the paid fine for reimbursement. In addition, on January 6, 2011, Respondent was the operator of Ms. Ominsky\u2019s car when a traffic citation was issued. However, Respondent issued a check drawn on Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal account to pay the $75.00 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Petitioner contends that Respondent took advantage of his position of trust attained through the attorney-client relationship with Gloria Ominsky when he: 1) received reimbursement for simultaneous gas purchases for his wife\u2019s vehicle and Ms. Ominsky\u2019s Buick on May 14, 2010; 2) authorized reimbursement to Ellen Hodes for a parking citation she received for her Lexus while shopping at Market Place in Baltimore City on October 31, 2010; and 3) used Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal checking account to pay the $75.00 traffic fine. According to Petitioner, these \u201cexpenses were not reasonably related to the care or representation of Ms. Ominsky.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Respondent testified that these expenses, like all others, were reimbursed because they were incurred while he or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Mrs. Hodes was engaged in activity on Ms. Ominsky\u2019s behalf. Mrs. Hodes testified that she asked Ms. Ominsky about reimbursing the parking citation and that subsequently, she was reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">In addition, several witnesses testified that even after her health declined, Ms. Ominsky was alert and continued to be actively involved in the review of her expenses. If she objected to the reimbursement of any expenses, there is no evidence of it. As a result, Petitioner has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent obtained unauthorized reimbursements for the gas purchases and parking citation. Petitioner has also failed to meet its burden of proof in connection with the Respondent\u2019s payment of the traffic citation from Ms. Ominsky\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"AjGm\">Checks Issued From Gloria Ominsky\u2019s Wachovia Checking Account in February 2011</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Gloria Ominsky entered hospice care at Northwest Hospital during the last one to two weeks of her life. She died on February 20, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In February 2011, Respondent personally issued check number 7416 in the amount of $775.00 made payable to his wife Ellen Hodes. The date on check number 7416 was \u201c2/15/11.\u201d However, it did not post as a debit to Ms. Ominsky\u2019s Wachovia checking account until March 3, 2011. Respondent personally issued a second cheek number 7413 in the amount of $14,500.00 made payable to \u201cMichael Hodes Financial,\u201d a financial consulting business owned by Respondent. The second check was dated \u201c2/18/11.\u201d That check was deposited on February 22, 2011 to an account in the name of \u201cMichael Hodes Financial Consultants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Petitioner contends that after Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death, Respondent removed checks from her personal checkbook, handwrote both checks and backdated them so that it would appear that the checks were issued before her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">In addition, as to the aforementioned check issued to Michael Hodes Financial ($14,500.00), Petitioner contends that Respondent directed his secretary to create an invoice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>after Gloria Ominsky\u2019s death and to backdate same in an attempt to \u201clegitimize\u201d the payment even though Ms. Ominsky had never entered into a written agreement for financial consulting services or received any itemized bills for same.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Respondent denies the checks were backdated. He also maintains that the $14,500.00 payment to Michael Hodes Financial was for financial consulting services contracted for and rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent personally issued checks 7416 and 7413 after Gloria Ominsky\u2019s death but backdated the checks to make it appear that they were issued before February 20, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The two checks were not prepared in advance by Mr. Adams, attached to an invoice or reviewed by Ms. Battaglia pursuant to the established HPK procedure. Instead, they were removed from the checkbook and issued by Respondent. In addition, there was no explanation on the memo line for either check. And, there were no timesheets or expense receipts in the Ominsky file to support the check issued to Mrs. Hodes.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">It is also interesting to note that the two checks were issued out of order. Check 7413 was dated \u201c2/18/11\u201d and posted as a debit to Ms. Ominsky\u2019s Wachovia account on February 23, 2011, while check 7416 was dated \u201c2/11/11\u201d though not posted as a debit to Ms. Ominsky\u2019s account until March 3, 2011. Perhaps most telling is the fact that Mr. Adams, who was responsible for keeping Ms. Ominsky\u2019s checkbook, reconciling her bank statements and paying her bills, had never seen checks 7413 and 7416 until after HPK began its internal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">In addition, as to check 7413 issued to Michael Hodes Financial in the amount of $14,500.00, this Court is satisfied by clear and convincing evidence that it was issued after Gloria Ominsky\u2019s death to pay monies that Respondent\u2019s financial consulting business was not entitled to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Respondent established a separate business entity known as \u201cMichael C. Hodes Financial Consultants, Ltd.\u201d (herein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>after \u201cMCH Financial\u201d) in the mid-1980\u2019s. He testified that clients of MCH Financial were billed either annually or hourly at the rate of $600.00 per hour. Respondent entered into a professional relationship with Ms. Ominsky beginning in 2005. He and HPK provided elder care and estate planning services to Ms. Ominsky which included, <em>inter alia, </em>advice on how to protect assets. HPK charged Ms. Ominsky legal fees of almost $200,000.00 for these services. However, Gloria Ominsky never entered into a written agreement with MCH Financial for financial consulting services. And, MCH Financial never issued an itemized statement, invoice or annual bill to Gloria Ominsky at any time prior to her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">After Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death and after check 7413 was posted to the MCH Financial account, Kevin Bress learned of the $14,500.00 check and asked Respondent about it. Respondent advised that the check was payment for financial services rendered. Mr. Bress asked Respondent whether he had an invoice for the services. Respondent did not produce an invoice at that time. However, he then instructed HPK secretary Donna Zurowski to create an invoice from MCH Financial to Gloria Ominsky for \u201cFinancial Planning for 2008-2011\u201d in the amount of $14,500.00. The invoice contained no itemization or additional explanation of charges. Although the invoice was dated \u201cJanuary 1, 2011\u201d and addressed to Gloria Ominsky, in care of Respondent, it was not created until March 1, 2011\u2014nine (9) days after her death. Once the invoice was created, Respondent presented the document to Mr. Bress and said, \u201cSee, I have an invoice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">During the evidentiary hearing, Respondent offered a second explanation for the $14,500.00 check. He testified that the $14,500.00 check was based on his entitlement to compensation as Ms. Ominsky\u2019s Power of Attorney. However, Respondent\u2019s alternative explanation for issuing check 7413 as compensation for services rendered as Power of Attorney is not credible. Respondent told Kevin Bress that check 7413 was for financial services rendered. Nothing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the language of the backdated invoice supports this alternative explanation. In addition, if check 7413 was issued as compensation for services as the Power of Attorney, the payee would not have been MCH Financial.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Estate Probate, The Ominsky Trust and Respondent\u2019s Taking and Use of Trust Funds</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In March 2011, after Gloria Ominsky\u2019s death, Respondent petitioned for probate of the estate with the Register of Wills for Baltimore County. HPK attorney Helen Smith handled the administration of the estate and Respondent was appointed as Personal Representative under the provisions of the will. When the estate inventory was filed, its value was approximately $400,000.00, with the bulk of the estate held in a UBS investment account valued at $352,900.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Under the terms of Gloria Ominsky\u2019s will, the residuary estate was designated to a testamentary trust with Respondent as Trustee. In the event Elaine Ominsky predeceased Gloria Ominsky (which she did), the will required Respondent to establish and incorporate a tax-exempt charitable foundation known as \u201cThe Ominsky Family Charitable Foundation\u201d (hereinafter \u201cFoundation\u201d) and to distribute the trust to the Foundation. Under the terms of the will, Respondent would also determine the number of Foundation Board members and serve as Chairman of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">On March 8, 2011, Respondent executed a document entitled an \u201cOrganizational Action of the Board of Directors of [the Ominsky Foundation]\u201d in which he appointed himself as President and Treasurer. Respondent appointed his \u25a0wife, Ellen Hodes, as Vice President and Secretary. No other board members were appointed. And, on March 14, 2011, \u201cThe Ominsky Family Charitable Foundation\u201d was incorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">On February 8, 2012, the Orphans Court approved the First and Final Administration Account and the estate was closed. Although the bulk of the residuary estate was in the UBS investment account, it was liquidated at Respondent\u2019s direction. The funds from the liquidation were de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>posited into HPK\u2019s escrow account. It is important to note that liquidation of the UBS investment account was not necessary. The UBS account could have been passed directly to the testamentary trust and in turn to the Foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">On March 8, 2012, Respondent opened a checking account at M &amp; T Bank in the name of \u201cGloria S. Ominsky Irrevocable Trust\u201d (hereinafter \u201cOminsky Trust\u201d or \u201cthe Trust\u201d). Pursuant to the Trust provisions of the will, Respondent was the Trustee. He was also the only signatory for the Trust bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">On March 9, 2012, Respondent directed the issuance of a check drawn on HPK\u2019s escrow account in the amount of $375,355.52 and made payable to the \u201cGloria S. Ominsky Irrevocable Trust.\u201d Because of an administrative delay related to the opening of the Trust account, Respondent was unable to deposit the check into the Ominsky Trust account until March 21, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">On March 28, 2012, Respondent issued two (2) checks from the Ominsky Trust account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">Check 5001\u2014Payable to MCH Financial for $3,500.00;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">Check 5002\u2014Payable to Mikelen Gallery, LLC for $270,000.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">The check in the amount of $270,000.00 was deposited into the M &amp; T checking account of Mikelen Gallery, LLC (hereinafter \u201cMikelen\u201d) with the word \u201cloan\u201d written on the memo line. Mikelen Gallery, LLC is a business partnership formed by Respondent and his wife, Ellen Hodes, in 2006 for the operation of an art and antiques gallery. Mikelen is not a charitable organization within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">The next day, on March 29, 2012, Respondent made an \u201cin branch transfer\u201d of $265,000.00 from the Mikelen account to a joint personal account at M &amp; T Bank. The joint personal account was in the name of Respondent and his wife. At the time of the deposit, the joint personal account had a negative balance of $-3,183.74.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>After the $265,000.00 deposit, Respondent issued a series of five (5) checks between March 29, 2012 and April 11, 2012. The five (5) checks totaled the sum of $100,317.21. And, the interest rates for the five creditors ranged from the lowest at 13.24% to the highest at 28.24%.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Respondent issued the following checks from his joint personal account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">\n<em>Date Check# Amount Payee Interest Rate</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">3/29/12 1581 $25,010.91 M&amp;TBank 18.00%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">3/29/12 2097 $30,227.00 Bank of America 15.24%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">3/29/12 2115 $4,204.00 American Express 13.24%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-9\">4/3/12 365 $22,875.30 Citi Cards 17.24%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-10\">4/11/12 2112 $18,000.00 Air Tran Visa 28.24%</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">On April 8, 2012, Respondent also issued a check from the same joint personal account to the Weingart Trust in the amount of $161,500.00 to pay the balance of a personal loan he had obtained from a trust managed by his brother-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">In addition, Respondent issued another check (2113) from his joint personal account to the \u201cLaurie Manney Trust\u201d (hereinafter \u201cManney Trust\u201d) in the amount of $1,272.79. Laurie Manney is the Respondent\u2019s sister. He made monthly loan payments to her trust pursuant to the terms of a promissory note in his name. At the time of the evidentiary hearing, Respondent testified that the balance on the Manney Trust loan was \u201cabout $100,000.00.\u201d It is important to note that Respondent did not consult with independent counsel regarding the propriety of the \u201cloan\u201d from the Ominsky Trust at any point prior to or after the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">On April 4, 2012, Respondent instructed his secretary Donna Zurowski to create a new document from his edits of a copy of the Laurie Manney promissory note. The new document was a promissory note which obligated Mikelen Gallery, LLC as \u201cMaker,\u201d to repay the aforementioned $270,000.00 \u201cloan\u201d that was made by the Ominsky Trust to Mikelen. Under the terms of the Mikelen Gallery, LLC Promissory Note (hereinafter \u201cPromissory Note\u201d), there would be \u201cinterest on the unpaid principal balance from the date of this Note, until paid, at five percent (5%) per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>annum.... \u201d Interestingly, the name of \u201cMichael C. Hodes,\u201d which appeared as the Maker on the Manney promissory note was marked out. In its place, Respondent identified the Maker as \u201cMikelen Gallery, LLC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Although the draft Promissory Note was given to Ms. Zurowski on April 4, 2012 and edited the same day, Respondent backdated the document to March 30, 2012 to make it appear as though it was prepared contemporaneously with the deposit of $270,000.00 from the Trust to Mikelen Gallery, LLC (and then transferred to Respondent\u2019s joint personal account).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In addition, Petitioner contends that although Ms. Zurowski prepared the edited Promissory Note on April 4, 2012 as instructed, it was never executed. According to Petitioner, a separate \u201cAssignment of Promissory Note,\u201d (hereinafter \u201cthe Assignment\u201d) which purports to assign the Ominsky Trust\u2019s interest in the Mikelen Promissory Note to the Foundation, was also never executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">In contrast, Respondent urges the Court to find that he executed both the Promissory Note and the Assignment contemporaneous with the transfer of funds from the Ominsky Trust account to Mikelen Gallery, LLC. In addition, he contends that a loan at 5% interest was beneficial to the Foundation as assignee of the Promissory Note because the rate would give the Foundation a higher return than the then prevailing market interest rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Ms. Zurowski, Respondent\u2019s legal secretary, scheduled his appointments and performed other administrative work. She was unfamiliar with Gloria Ominsky and had never worked on the Ominsky file. Although Ms. Zurowski typed the Promissory Note as instructed, she was uncomfortable with it and showed the document to Ms. Smith. The conversation between Ms. Zurowski and Ms. Smith triggered a discussion between lawyers in HPK\u2019s Wealth Preservation Department, namely attorneys Kevin Bress, Kim Battaglia and Helen Smith. Mr. Bress in turn questioned Respondent about the transaction during an informal meeting in the firm\u2019s lounge on April 12, 2012. Ms. Battaglia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>was present during the meeting. At that point, Mr. Bress and Ms. Battaglia were only aware of the drafted note. Respondent led Mr. Bress and Ms. Battaglia to believe that he had discussed the potential loan with his Certified Public Accountant Lynn Lazzaro and that the firm would not be involved. However, the information eventually made its way to the firm\u2019s managing partner, Drake Zaharris.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">On April 25, 2012, Ms. Smith took Respondent\u2019s shadow file for Gloria Ominsky to Mr. Zaharris. She advised Mr. Zaharris that she was concerned about the possibility that Respondent may have taken money from the Ominsky trust and loaned it to himself or Mikelen Gallery, LLC. Mr. Zaharris reviewed the law firm\u2019s Ominsky files, discovered the unexecuted Promissory Note and Assignment, saw the check register, confirmed the deposit of the $270,000.00 check and initiated a further internal investigation. He never saw an executed version of the Promissory Note or the Assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Ultimately, HPK retained outside counsel and Mr. Zaharris called an emergency meeting with the firm\u2019s equity members on Sunday, April 29, 2012. At the time of the emergency meeting, Respondent was in Seattle at a conference. During a meeting break, Mr. Allen, Mr. Zaharris and outside counsel placed a telephone call to Respondent. Respondent was placed on speaker phone. Mr. Allen took the lead in the conversation and asked Respondent whether he took the money from the Trust. Respondent acknowledged that he had taken the money to pay personal bills and admitted that he did not have the funds to repay it. When Respondent was asked if he signed the Promissory Note, he did not respond. Mr. Allen encouraged Respondent to retain counsel, told him that members of the firm were upset and advised him that he would need to leave the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In a subsequent dinner meeting, Respondent told Mr. Allen that he executed the Promissory Note and that Ms. Zurowski witnessed the signing. Mr. Allen again told Respondent that HPK members were upset and that he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>have to leave the firm. He also told Respondent that the firm would negotiate a fair separation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Promissory Note and the Assignment were created after Respondent issued checks 5001 and 5002 from the Ominsky Trust account <em>and </em>after Respondent transferred $265,000.00 from Mikelen Gallery, LLC to his joint personal account. The Court also finds that Respondent never executed the Promissory Note or the Assignment. Mr. Zaharris reviewed the firm\u2019s Ominsky files as part of an internal investigation and no copies of the Promissory Note and Assignment were ever found. In addition, Respondent was unable to produce a copy of the Promissory Note and Assignment he claimed to have signed. And, Donna Zurowski testified that she never saw Respondent sign the note. Although Mr. Adams testified that he had seen the executed version of the Promissory Note, during redirect examination he was unable to recall any details about an executed Note. As a result, the Court finds that Mr. Adams was simply mistaken when he testified about having seen the executed Promissory Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Respondent\u2019s Restitution of $270,000.00 to the Foundation</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">After a series of negotiations regarding the terms of his separation from HPK, Respondent received a compensation package which included three checks totaling $216,000.00 made payable to him on the condition that said monies would be used to repay $270,000.00 to the Foundation. Restitution of the $270,000.00 transferred by Respondent from the Ominsky Trust account to his Mikelen Gallery, LLC account was repaid in May 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">On May 18, 2012, HPK reported the aforementioned matters to Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Respondent\u2019s Statement Under Oath and Production of Purported Promissory Note Guaranty</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">On December 12, 2012, during Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation, Respondent provided a statement under oath, pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>to Md.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-732.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] At the time of his statement, Respondent testified that on March 28, 2012, he prepared and executed a Promissory Note Guaranty (hereinafter \u201cGuaranty\u201d) in order to personally guarantee the payment of the Mikelen Promissory Note. According to Respondent, he does not recall who typed the Guaranty, but it was not typed by anyone at the firm. A copy of the purported Guaranty was faxed to Respondent\u2019s counsel and Bar Counsel on December 18, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Petitioner contends that the \u201cGuaranty\u201d was not created until after Bar Counsel began its investigation and questioned why Respondent was not personally liable as the maker of the Promissory Note since the $270,000.00 was for personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent testified falsely regarding the creation and execution of the Guaranty. The Guaranty was purportedly created at the same time as the Promissory Note and Assignment, yet witnesses testified that it did not resemble any forms typically used by HPK attorneys and staff. In addition, no one at the firm ever saw the purported Guaranty nor was it found in any of the law firm\u2019s Ominsky files. Most significant is the fact that the first time Respondent mentioned the existence of a Guaranty was after Bar Counsel began its investigation. It is also important to note that the purported Guaranty could not have been created on March 28, 2012 because Donna Zurowski did not type the Promissory Note until April 4, 2012. In other words, Respondent could not have guaranteed an obligation before it existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Check 5001 in the Amount of $3,500.00 Issued to MCH Financial</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Lastly, the Petitioner contends that the check issued to MCH Financial from the Ominsky Trust account in the amount of $3,500.00 was an unearned payment and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Court agrees. Similar to the check Respondent issued to MCH Financial in the amount of $14,500.00 after Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death, there was no itemization, contract or invoice to support the $3,500.00 payment. In fact, Respondent admitted that he did not know why the check was issued but said, \u201cit would probably have been for financial planning going forward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The Petitioner has the burden of proving the alleged violations by clear and convincing evidence. Md.Code Ann. 16-757(b).[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">This Court has applied the appropriate standard and makes the following conclusions of law by clear and convincing evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">RULE 1.7: CONFLICT OF INTEREST\u2014GENERAL RULE</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involved a conflict of interest.

Rules of Prof\u2019l Conduct R. 1.7 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.7 because his actions in connection with his own personal interests had an adverse impact on his duty of loyalty to Ms. Ominsky and the Ominsky Trust. Those actions materially limited his representation of her interests and the interest of the Trust beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Respondent was obligated as an attorney and a fiduciary to protect Ms. Ominsky\u2019s interests and assets even after her death. He served as her attorney from 2005 up until her death. Under the terms of her will, he was appointed as Personal Representative of her Estate, Trustee of her Testamentary Trust and Chairman of the Board for The Ominsky Family Charitable Trust Foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">\u201cConflicts of interest impair the trustee\u2019s ability to act on behalf of the beneficiaries with independent and disinterested judgment in the administration of the trust, the rationale being that it is generally not possible for the same person to act fairly in two capacities and on behalf of two interests in the same transaction.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Sachse, </em>345 Md. 578, 588, 693 A.2d 806, 811 (1997) (quoting George G. Bogert, <em>The Law of Trusts and Trustees </em>\u00a7 543 (2d ed. rev.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">Immediately upon her death from cancer, Respondent acted in his own self-interest by issuing checks to his wife ($775.00) and to his consulting business known as MCH Financial ($14,500.00) and backdated those checks with full knowledge that neither payee was entitled to payment. Respondent then failed in his transparent attempt to hide the fact that his consulting business was not entitled to the check for $14,500.00 by instructing his secretary to create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>an invoice for services, address the invoice to Gloria Ominsky and backdate same to a date before her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Respondent also violated Rule 1.7 in his capacity as Trustee of the Ominsky Trust when he engaged in self-dealing to the detriment of the Trust beneficiary and removed $270,000.00 from the Ominsky Trust account so that he could pay personal debts. He also acted in his own self-interest and to the detriment of the Trust beneficiaries when he issued a check to his financial consulting business for an unearned fee in the amount of $3,500.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u201cPerhaps the most fundamental duty of a trustee is that he must display throughout the administration of the trust complete loyalty to the interest of the beneficiarles] and must exclude all selfish interest and all consideration of the interests of third persons.\u201d <em>Sachse, </em>345 Md. at 588, 693 A.2d at 811 (quoting Bogert, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 541).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">RULE 1.15: SAFEKEEPING PROPERTY</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">Hi H\u00ed \u2756 H* H* Hs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">(d) Upon receiving funds or other property in which a client or third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the client or third person.

Rules op Prof\u2019l Conduct R. 1.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">This court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15. Under the terms of Gloria Ominsky\u2019s Last Will and Testament, the residuary estate was to be held in trust. Respondent, as Trustee, was obligated to distribute the Trust funds to a charitable foundation known as The Ominsky Family Charitable Foundation as directed by the provisions of her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Once the First and Final Administration Account was approved and the estate was closed, Respondent unnecessarily liquidated the UBS investment account funds and deposited those funds into the firm\u2019s escrow account. He then opened a checking account at M &amp; T Bank in the name of Gloria S. Ominsky Irrevocable Trust and deposited $375,355.52 into the Trust account. However, instead of promptly delivering the Trust funds to the Foundation, Respondent removed $270,000.00 for his own benefit to facilitate the payment of personal debts. He also removed an additional $3,500.00 for the benefit of a financial consulting company he owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">RULE 8.1: BAR ADMISSION AND DISCIPLINARY MATTERS</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">An applicant for admission or reinstatement to the bar, or a lawyer in connection with a bar admission application or in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">([a]) knowingly make a false statement of material fact Md. Rules op Prof\u2019l Conduct R. 8.1. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.1 because Respondent testified falsely during his statement under oath on December 12, 2012. Bar Counsel initiated an investigation into Respondent\u2019s reported activities including the removal of $270,000.00 from the Trust account for use in paying personal debts. Respondent has consistently characterized the removal of those funds as a \u201cloan.\u201d To buttress this claim, Respondent gave a statement under oath pursuant to the Maryland Code Annotated Section 16-732 and testified that on March 28, 2012 he executed a personal Guaranty for the repayment of the aforementioned $270,000.00. Md.CodeAnn. \u00a7 16-732.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">For the reasons set forth in this Court\u2019s Findings of Fact, the Court finds that Respondent knowingly made a false statement about the existence and execution of a personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Guaranty to repay the $270,000.00 during the investigation by Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">RULE 8.4: MISCONDUCT</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZI\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">(a) violate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">(b) commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Md. Rules of Prof\u2019l Conduct R. 8.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(a) because Respondent violated the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct as described in these Conclusions of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">Under Rule 8.4(b), it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">Although Respondent has not been prosecuted for a violation of the Maryland Code, Criminal Law Article Section 7-113(a), Embezzlement-Fraudulent misappropriation by fiduciaries, this Court concludes by clear and convincing evidence that his strategic removal of $270,000.00 from the Ominsky Trust while serving as Trustee was a knowing and willful violation which reflects adversely on a lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer. Md.Code Ann., Crim. Law \u00a7 7113(a) (\u201cA fiduciary may not: (1) fraudulently and willfully appropriate money or a thing of value that the fiduciary holds in a fiduciary capacity contrary to the requirements of the fiduciary\u2019s trust responsibility; or (2) secrete money or a thing of value that the fiduciary holds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>in a fiduciary capacity with a fraudulent intent to use the money or thing of value contrary to the requirements of the fiduciary\u2019s trust responsibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Respondent violated Rule 8.4(c) because his conduct in: 1) issuing checks to his wife and his consulting business without following the system of checks and balances established by the law firm; 2) backdating those checks to make it appear that they were issued before Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death; 3) creating an invoice, <em>post hoc, </em>for monies his consulting business was not entitled to; and 4) instructing his secretary to backdate the invoice to a date before Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death, can only be described as dishonest and fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Similarly, Respondent\u2019s removal of $270,000.00 from the Ominsky Trust to his business account for Mikelen Gallery, LLC and immediate \u201cin branch\u201d transfer of $265,000.00 from the Mikelen account to a joint personal bank account, held with his wife, in order to pay personal debts, was dishonest and fraudulent. Respondent unsuccessfully attempted to hide the fact that the entire series of aforementioned transactions was designed to hide his true goal\u2014to inconspicuously use trust funds to pay personal debts. He was not entitled to \u201cloan\u201d $270,000.00 or any other monies from the Trust to himself. However, if he had truly intended to \u201cborrow\u201d funds from the Trust, he would have sought approval from independent counsel and executed a promissory note in his own name at the time the funds were removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Instead, Respondent engaged in a ruse with other members of the law firm and Bar Counsel (and this Court) about a Promissory Note on behalf of Mikelen Gallery, LLC, an Assignment in favor of the Foundation and a personal \u201cGuaranty.\u201d As a result, this Court finds that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Rule 8.4(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">This Court also finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(d). Respondent\u2019s conduct, as described under Rules 8.4(a), (b) and (c) is prejudicial to the administration of justice because he took trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>funds in his capacity as an attorney and fiduciary and used them to pay personal debts. His conduct is also harmful to the legal profession because it undermines the public\u2019s confidence that an attorney will exercise his fiduciary duties in protecting funds entrusted to his professional care and responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">MARYLAND BUSINESS OCCUPATIONS AND PROFESSIONS ANNOTATED CODE \u00a7 10-306: MISUSE OF TRUST MONEY</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">A lawyer may not use trust money for any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Md.Code Ann., Bus.

MITIGATION</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">The Respondent has the burden of proving matters of mitigation or extenuation by a preponderance of the evidence. Md.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-757.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">This Court finds Respondent has established by a preponderance of the evidence that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-11\">1. Respondent has never been disciplined or sanctioned by the Court since his admission to the Maryland Bar on December 18,1975.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-12\">2. Respondent made restitution to the Foundation in the amount of $270,000.00 in May 2012. While it is true that HPK required payment of restitution as a condition of the Separation Agreement, three checks issued to Respondent by the law firm totaling $216,000.00 were endorsed to the Foundation. Respondent contributed $54,000.00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>and paid the Foundation with a check drawn on his personal account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\">3. Respondent has been recognized by several organizations for his skill and experience in the practice areas of elder law, estates and trusts and wealth preservation. He serves as an adjunct law professor at two area law schools and discusses elder law issues during weekly radio broadcasts. Respondent has also been associated with philanthropic efforts for local institutions including his law school alma mater, the University of Baltimore. During the evidentiary hearing, several witnesses testified that they trusted him, valued his advice and appreciated his professional service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Yet, with all of his knowledge and experience in the practice areas of elder law and estates and trusts, Respondent displayed a remarkable lack of insight into his professional responsibility as an attorney and fiduciary. He continued to insist that he had taken a \u201cloan\u201d of $270,000.00 from the Trust in order to pay personal bills, as if this form of self-dealing was acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In addition, Respondent showed no remorse for his actions. Instead, he complained that he was subjected to a \u201cstar chamber\u201d investigation by his former law firm and claimed that members of the firm reported his activity to Bar Counsel in an effort to \u201csteal\u201d his practice and \u201cmake him look like a crook.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">V.

Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">\u201c \u2018This Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings in Maryland.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 73, 753 A.2d 17, 26 (2000). With respect to exceptions, upon our review of the record, \u201cthe hearing judge\u2019s findings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>fact generally will be accepted unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Whitehead, </em>405 Md. 240, 253, 950 A.2d 798, 806 (2008), citing Rule 16-759(b)(2). \u201cA hearing judge\u2019s factual finding is not clearly erroneous if there is any competent material evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. McDonald, </em>437 Md. 1, 16, 85 A.3d 117, 125 (2014) (internal quotation omitted). As to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, such as whether provisions of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct were violated, our consideration is <em>de novo. </em>Rule 16-759(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Bar Counsel has not filed any exceptions to Judge BallouWatts\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Respondent has filed exceptions, in which he challenges various findings of fact and numerous conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">II. Respondent\u2019s Exceptions to Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Respondent initially argues that he was not acting in the role of an attorney when he was operating as an attorney-in-fact or as the Trustee of the Gloria S. Ominsky Irrevocable Trust (hereinafter \u201cOminsky Trust\u201d or \u201cthe Trust\u201d), and claims, therefore, that the Rules of Professional Conduct and Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct govern Maryland attorneys\u2019 conduct and ethical obligations. Rule 8.5(a)(1) states: \u201cA lawyer admitted by the Court of Appeals to practice in this State is subject to the disciplinary authority of this State, regardless of where the lawyer\u2019s conduct occurs.\u201d Rule 8.5(a)(1) identifies Maryland Rule 16-701(a) as a cross-reference, which defines \u201cattorney\u201d as: \u201ca person admitted by the Court of Appeals to practice law in this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code states: \u201cA lawyer may not use trust money for any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.\u201d In Section 10-101(g) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the Maryland Code, \u201clawyer\u201d is defined as: \u201can individual who is admitted to the Bar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Clearly, Respondent was an attorney in 2011 and 2012, when the acts in question occurred. He was admitted to the Bar of this Court in December of 1975 and continued his licensure through the time of his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Respondent, however, argues that, even though he was licensed, he was not acting within an attorney-client relationship and was, instead, acting in a personal or non-legal capacity as either an attorney-in-fact or the Trustee of the Ominsky Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">This Court recently opined about the parameters of the attorney-client relationship in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Shoup, </em>410 Md. 462, 489-90, 979 A.2d 120, 135-36 (2009):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">As an initial matter, we acknowledge that determining \u201cwhat constitutes an attorney-client relationship is a rather elusive concept.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shaw, </em>354 Md. 636, 650, 732 A.2d 876, 883 (1999) (quoting <em>Folly Farms I, Inc. v. Trustees, </em>282 Md. 659, 670, 387 A.2d 248, 254 (1978)). The facts and circumstances of each particular case are critical in determining whether an attorney-client relationship exists. <em>See Shaw, </em>354 Md. at 650-51, 732 A.2d at 883. A key factor that courts look to is whether the purported \u201cclient\u201d sought legal advice. <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Forma-Pack, Inc., </em>351 Md. 396, 421, 718 A.2d 1129, 1141 (1998). Certainly, an attorney-client relationship still can be found even though the attorney renders services or advice that is not strictly legal in character. <em>See, e.g., Page v. Penrose, </em>147 Md. 225, 227-28, 127 A. 748, 749 (1925). Moreover, a personal relationship or close friendship with a purported \u201cclient\u201d does not preclude a court from finding that an attorney-client relationship exists. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brooke, </em>374 Md. 155, 175, 821 A.2d 414, 425 (2003). Our cases make clear that an explicit agreement or payment arrangement is not a prerequisite to the formation of an attorney-client relationship. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. James, </em>355 Md. 465, 476-77, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>735 A.2d 1027, 1033 (1999) (quoting <em>Central Cab Co. v. Clarke, </em>259 Md. 542, 549-50, 270 A.2d 662, 666 (1970)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Here, Hodes asserts that his various roles were personal or non-legal in nature with respect to the assets of Ms. Ominsky and, therefore, he should not be subject to the imposition of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Even were we to accept Hodes\u2019s characterization that he was acting in a personal or non-legal role when he acted as an attorney-in-fact or as the Trustee of the Ominsky Trust, however, his actions would still be subject to the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Insofar as personal or non-legal conduct is concerned, we have recognized, as Hodes argues, that a finding made by the hearing judge that an attorney-client relationship did not exist, indeed, could eliminate the possibility of an attorney facing disciplinary action. In <em>Shoup, </em>410 Md. at 468-71, 979 A.2d at 123-25, Shoup was charged with violations of Rules 1.1, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.7(b), 1.8(a), 1.15(a), (b) and (c), and 8.4(a), (c) and (d), Section 10306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code and Maryland Rule 16-609,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which is a regulation of attorney trust accounts outside of the disciplinary rules, arising from a real estate investment he made on behalf of a woman who the hearing judge characterized as his \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d The hearing judge specifically found that no attorney-client relationship existed between Shoup and his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d based on the testimony of Shoup\u2019s \u201cgirlfriend\u201d that they had a romantic relationship and she never intended Shoup provide her with legal services. The hearing judge also found that Shoup\u2019s conduct was not dishonest or fraudulent nor prejudicial to the administration of justice. This Court, although determining ultimately that Shoup violated Rule 16-609, upheld the hearing judge\u2019s findings that a personal relationship, rather than one of attorney-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>client, existed and his acts were not dishonest, deceitful, fraudulent, nor so criminal or egregious that the harm to his paramour was patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">We also have recognized that an attorney acting in a personal capacity was not subject to discipline when the hearing judge found that the attorney\u2019s conduct was not so \u201cextreme that it inherently <em>harms </em>the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Harris, </em>403 Md. 142, 154, 939 A.2d 732, 739 (2008). In <em>Harris, </em>we upheld the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Harris was acting solely on his own behalf when Harris requested an investment fund, jointly owned by his ex-wife\u2019s estate and himself, to be transferred into his sole ownership. The hearing judge found that Harris \u201cdid not show good faith, and was certainly dishonest,\u201d but \u201c[t]he type of dishonesty that was present in this case does not necessarily prejudice the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155, 939 A.2d at 739-40. We upheld these findings. However, we did impose discipline in the case, even though Harris acted in a personal capacity, because he made a knowing misrepresentation to the employees of the investment fund company that he had sole ownership of the fund, when, in fact, ownership had been converted to a tenancy in common by operation of law after his divorce from his ex-wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">As <em>Harris </em>suggests, we have imposed discipline in situations in which the attorney was acting in a personal capacity, such as when the hearing judge had found that the attorney\u2019s conduct was in \u201cdirect contravention\u201d to his obligations as a lawyer and the attorney was aware his actions would thwart a criminal investigation. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Sheinbein, </em>372 Md. 224, 239, 812 A.2d 981, 989-90 (2002). In <em>Sheinbein, </em>the hearing judge found that Sheinbein aided his son in fleeing to Israel after his son had committed murder. The hearing judge found that Sheinbein \u201chad the commensurate requisite intent to obstruct or hinder\u201d the police investigation and that \u201cthat respondent\u2019s sending his son to Israel in spite of the knowledge that his son was an \u2018integral party to a criminal investigation\u2019 was \u2018 \u201cin direct contravention to the oath he swore in open court when he was admitted to the Bar of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Court of Appeals of Maryland on June 24, 1971.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239, 245, 812 A.2d at 990, 993. The hearing judge\u2019s findings supported our determination that Sheinbein\u2019s \u201cutter abandonment of proper professional conduct in the face of the circumstances of [the victim\u2019s] murder leads this Court to only one conclusion: that respondent is no longer fit to practice law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, 812 A.2d at 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">We have declined to further extend the purview of the Rules when the attorney was acting in a non-legal capacity. In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Link, </em>380 Md. 405, 428-29, 844 A.2d 1197, 1211 (2004), this Court upheld the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Link had engaged in \u201crude, boorish, insensitive, oppressive and certainly insulting\u201d behavior, when he became involved in a heated argument with an MVA employee in circumstances where it was not apparent that he was representing a client. This Court determined that Link\u2019s conduct was not criminal \u201cnor conduct of the kind that the harm or potential harm flowing from it is patent,\u201d and, thus, was not subject to the Rules. <em>Id. </em>at 429, 844 A.2d at 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In contradistinction, we have determined that attorneys, acting in a non-legal role, are subject to the purview of the Rules when the hearing judge has found that the attorney\u2019s conduct was dishonest, fraudulent, deceitful or constituted a misrepresentation. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lazerow, </em>320 Md. 507, 578 A.2d 779 (1990), a non-practicing attorney, who was acting in a non-legal capacity, was involved in the building and renting of houses. While acting in that capacity, Lazerow took over $200,000.00 of purchasers\u2019 down payments, which are statutorily required to be held in escrow accounts, to pay the bills of his home building enterprises. The hearing judge found, and we agreed, that Lazerow\u2019s conduct, while \u201c \u2018not for the furtherance of any immediate personal financial gains ... clearly show[ed] an intent to mislead (i.e., fraudulent intent).\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512, 578 A.2d at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">More recently, in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Seltzer, </em>424 Md. 94, 34 A.3d 498 (2011), an attorney, who was a managing partner of several realty companies, engaged in deceitful and fraudu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>lent conduct arising out of his attempted purchase of commercial real estate. We determined that Seltzer was subject to the Rules when the hearing judge found that Seltzer\u2019s conduct in misappropriating funds from his real estate company\u2019s escrow account was deceitful, constituted the crime of theft and was prejudicial to the administration of justice. The hearing judge found Seltzer\u2019s \u201ccontinuing course of deceit for nine (9) months was prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d when he created fraudulent documents to induce a seller to enter into a contract with him, misrepresented his role in his real estate company and misappropriated funds from his real estate company. <em>Id. </em>at 106, 34 A.3d at 506. The hearing judge also found Seltzer\u2019s conduct was deceitful and constituted theft when Seltzer withdrew money from his real estate company\u2019s operating account \u201cand converted those funds for his own use without entitlement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110, 34 A.3d at 508. We emphasized that merely because Seltzer \u201cengaged in deceitful conduct outside of the practice of law does not immunize the sanctionable nature of his behavior.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114, 34 A.3d at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We have recognized, in this vein, the \u201cfundamental requirements\u201d of a lawyer are honesty, integrity and respect for the legal system. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Milliken, </em>348 Md. 486, 520, 704 A.2d 1225, 1241 (1998). When an attorney manifests dishonest, deceitful or fraudulent conduct in a personal or non-legal capacity, the lawyer brings into question whether he or she possesses the requisite character to practice law and to justify the trust and confidence necessary to interact with clients, the public and the legal system. Charles W. Wolfram, Modern Legal Ethics \u00a7 3.1 (1986) (\u201cMisconduct by a licensed lawyer suggests that unless discipline is imposed, the lawyer might use the shield of the license to induce trust in prospective clients, courts, and other lawyers and thereby gain the opportunity to harm members of the public.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 5 cmt.6 (2000) (\u201cProfessional duties defined in lawyer codes are mainly concerned with lawyer functions performed by a lawyer in the course of representing a client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>and causing harm to the client, to a legal institution such as a court, or to a third person. Those duties extend further, however, and include some lawyer acts that, even if not directly involving the practice of law, draw into question the ability or willingness of the lawyer to abide by professional responsibilities.\u201d); <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Agnew, </em>271 Md. 543, 550, 318 A.2d 811, 815 (1974) (\u201cIf a lawyer elects to become a business man, he brings to his merchantry the professional requirements of honesty, uprightness, and fair dealing. Equally, a lawyer who enters public life does not leave behind the canons of legal ethics.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Therefore, even were Hodes to have been operating in a personal or a non-legal capacity when he was in the role of an attorney-in-fact or as a Trustee when he removed $14,500.00 and $775.00 from Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal account and $270,000.00 and $3,500.00 from the Trust account, he was found by the hearing judge to have acted dishonestly and fraudulently. With respect to the $270,000.00, Judge BallouWatts determined, additionally, that his conduct constituted the crime of embezzlement under Section 7-113(a) of the Criminal Law Article of the Maryland Code (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Hodes, nevertheless, was not found by the hearing judge to have been acting in a personal or non-legal capacity, as an attorney-in-fact or as a Trustee. Rather, Hodes was found to have had an attorney-client relationship with Ms. Ominsky, which did not terminate. Judge Ballou-Watts found that Ms. Ominsky developed a \u201crelationship of trust with Respondent as her adviser and depended upon him for legal, financial, medical and personal matters.\u201d It was from this attorney-client relationship that Hodes\u2019s roles of attorney-in-fact and Trustee emanated.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Respondent, in the instant case, was operating under authority given to him by Ms. Ominsky\u2019s Power of Attorney when he withdrew $14,500.00 and $775.00 from her personal account. Judge Ballou-Watts found, among other facts, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae3\">After Gloria Ominsky\u2019s health began to decline in 2009, she talked with Respondent about executing a new will to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>replace the will she executed in 2005. Another HPK attorney prepared a new Last Will and Testament which named Respondent as Personal Representative. The new will also contained certain trust provisions for which Respondent was named as Trustee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">In addition, the law firm prepared a Durable Power of Attorney naming Respondent and another HPK attorney, Kevin Bress, to serve as Gloria Ominsky\u2019s attorneys-in-fact, jointly or individually, with regard to her personal care and various financial and property transactions. Although Kevin Bress was named as attorney-in-fact for Gloria Ominsky under the Durable Power of Attorney, he never exercised any authority on her behalf. And, Kevin Bress was never directly involved in the firm\u2019s representation of Gloria Ominsky.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">The Last Will and Testament and the Durable Power of Attorney were executed by Gloria Ominsky on April 27, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">After her health began to decline, Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal checkbook, Wachovia bank statements and all other financial records were kept at the HPK office in a file cabinet near the desk of paralegal Richard Adams.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">With respect to issuance of the $14,500.00 and $775.00 checks, Judge Ballou-Watts found, specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">Gloria Ominsky entered hospice care at Northwest Hospital during the last one to two weeks of her life. She died on February 20, 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">In February 2011, Respondent personally issued check number 7416 in the amount of $775.00 made payable to his wife Ellen Hodes. The date on check number 7416 was \u201c2/15/11.\u201d However, it did not post as a debit to Ms. Ominsky\u2019s Wachovia checking account until March 3, 2011. Respondent personally issued a second check number 7413 in the amount of $14,500.00 made payable to \u201cMichael Hodes Financial,\u201d a financial consulting business owned by Respondent. The second check was dated \u201c2/18/11.\u201d That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>check was deposited on February 22, 2011 to an account in the name of \u201cMichael Hodes Financial Consultants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Respondent\u2019s access to Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal checking account funds was as a result of his acting under the Power of Attorney executed by Ms. Ominsky when Hodes was her lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">With respect to Hodes\u2019s conduct when he was acting as a Trustee of the Ominsky Trust, Judge Ballou-Watts found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">Another HPK attorney prepared a new Last Will and Testament which named Respondent as Personal Representative. The new will also contained certain trust provisions for which Respondent was named as Trustee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">Under the terms of Gloria Ominsky\u2019s will, the residuary estate was designated to a testamentary trust with Respondent as Trustee. In the event Elaine Ominsky predeceased Gloria Ominsky (which she did), the will required Respondent to establish and incorporate a tax-exempt charitable foundation known as \u201cThe Ominsky Family Charitable Foundation\u201d (hereinafter \u201cFoundation\u201d) and to distribute the trust to the Foundation. Under the terms of the will, Respondent would also determine the number of Foundation Board members and serve as Chairman of the Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">On March 8, 2012, Respondent opened a checking account at M &amp; T Bank in the name of \u201cGloria S. Ominsky Irrevocable Trust\u201d (hereinafter \u201cOminsky Trust\u201d or \u201cthe Trust\u201d). Pursuant to the Trust provisions of the will, Respondent was the Trustee. He was also the only signatory for the Trust bank account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Ms. Ominsky\u2019s Last Will and Testament was drafted by a member of Respondent\u2019s firm and included a provision that created a testamentary trust with the Respondent designated as the Trustee. Respondent\u2019s role as Trustee emanated directly out of his attorney-client relationship with Ms. Ominsky.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Similar circumstances arose in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Owrutsky, </em>322 Md. 334, 347, 587 A.2d 511, 517 (1991), where the hearing judge found that Owrutsky was an attorney for Joseph and Ella Peigert and violated the Rules of Professional Conduct when he loaned himself money from a testamentary trust created by Joseph Peigert\u2019s will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\">On August 17, 1981, the respondent withdrew $48,370.82 from a passbook account at Second National entitled \u201cOwrutsky and Drake, attorneys for Robert Peigert Trust\u201d and deposited those funds into his escrow account. On August 18, 1981, a $40,000 check was drawn on those trust funds in the respondent\u2019s escrow account to the order of Gerald and Bette Patt. The $40,000 escrow check was redeposited the same day to the respondent\u2019s escrow account as funds of Gerald and Bette Patt. The same day two $20,000 checks were then drawn on those funds in the escrow account, one to the order of Bette Patt and one to the order of Owrutsky and Drake, P.A., the respondent\u2019s law firm. The $20,000 escrow check to Owrutsky and Drake, P.A. was deposited into the law firm\u2019s general account and on that same day, August 18,1981, respondent drew a $20,000 check to himself from the firm\u2019s general account. The balance in the respondent\u2019s firm\u2019s general account at the time of the $20,000 deposit was $5,034.14. The respondent signed all of the checks in this transaction, and was fully aware that he was obtaining $20,000 from the trust funds. A demand note to the Robert Peigert trust for $40,000 was signed by Bette and Gerald Patt. Bette Patt was the respondent\u2019s employee since 1969 and a close friend. The loan to Gerald and Bette Patt was made without the knowledge or consent of Doris McMahon, co-trustee, and was unsecured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The hearing judge further found \u201cthat part of the loan to Bette Patt was, in fact, a loan to the respondent from trust funds, which was improper\u201d and concluded that it constituted a violation of the disciplinary rules. <em>Id. </em>We agreed, and noted that the loan \u201cinvolve[d] a violation of the duty of loyalty owed by a fiduciary\u201d and that it \u201cis a breach of trust for a trustee to lend trust funds to himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 587 A.2d at 519. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>stated that, \u201c \u2018[t]his is true, even though by the terms of the trust [the trustee] is given the widest powers of investment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 587 A.2d at 519, quoting 2A Scott, <em>The Law of Trusts </em>\u00a7 170.17. We opined that, \u201c \u2018Even where the trustee is authorized to make such investments as in his absolute and uncontrolled discretion he may see fit, however, it has been held that he cannot properly lend trust funds to himself personally.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting 3A Scott, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 227.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><em>Owrutsky </em>demonstrates that we have disciplined an attorney for his conduct when that conduct emanated from an attorney-client relationship. Here, like <em>Owrutsky, </em>Respondent had an attorney-client relationship with Ms. Ominsky that began in 2005, which facilitated all of his actions on her behalf, such as attorney-in-fact and as Trustee. Hodes breached his fiduciary duty as an attorney-in-fact and as a Trustee, capacities which he acted in pursuant to Ms. Ominsky\u2019s Power of Attorney and Will.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Respondent also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s failure to find facts that he had included in his post-hearing Proposed Findings of Fact. Specifically, he had offered that he had engaged in certain philanthropic and charitable activities; that Respondent and Ms. Ominsky had a close, familial, relationship; what the average compensation is for attorneys-in-fact; that the Power of Attorney executed by Gloria Ominsky was still in effect to authorize him to make a $14,500.00 payment to himself; that the interest rate of the loan of $270,000.00 was at an above-market rate; that Respondent had no history of defaulting on loan payments; that members of the firm were aware that Mikelen Gallery was owned by Respondent and his wife; that the removal of $270,000.00 was a loan, and not a \u201cso-called \u2018loan\u2019 \u201d; that Respondent treated the transaction as a loan and Mr. Adams began the loan documentation process as early as March 8, 2012; that Lynn Lazzaro, CPA, was told about the $270,000.00 and asked to create an amortization schedule; that Respondent made no effort to disguise the existence of the $270,000.00 withdrawal; and that Respondent cooperated with both Pessin Katz Law P.A., the successor to HPK, and with Bar Counsel in their respective investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>We overrule Respondent\u2019s numerous exceptions regarding the proposed facts he submitted, because the hearing judge is not required to accept all or any of Bar Counsel or Respondent\u2019s proposed findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">A judge hearing an attorney grievance matter does not need to meld together his or her own opinion, taking bits and pieces of each party\u2019s proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law, but may adopt one party\u2019s filing in its entirety, as long as it accurately reflects the judge\u2019s independent factual findings, proven by clear and convincing evidence at the hearing, and the legal conclusions flowing therefrom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8G\"><em>Attorney Grievance v. Joseph, </em>422 Md. 670, 696, 31 A.3d 137, 153 (2011). Judge Ballou-Watts made independent findings, established by clear and convincing evidence, based upon her evaluation of what she heard and saw after three days of evidentiary hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">At the heart of the rest of Respondent\u2019s voluminous exceptions are four transactions. Respondent issued two checks from Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal Wachovia bank account, which he had access to because of his role as her attorney-in-fact: check 7416 for $775.00 to his wife, Ellen Hodes, and check 7413 for $14,500.00 to his financial consulting company, Michael Carl Hodes Financial (hereinafter \u201cMCH Financial\u201d). Hodes, additionally, issued two checks from the Ominsky Trust bank account at M &amp; T Bank, while acting in his capacity as Trustee of the Ominsky Trust: check 5001 for $3,500.00 to MCH Financial, and check 5002 for $270,000.00 to Mikelen Gallery, LLC. After depositing the $270,000.00 check into the Mikelen Gallery account, Respondent transferred $265,000.00 from the Mikelen Gallery account to his personal joint checking account.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In developing her factual findings, the hearing judge discredited much of Respondent\u2019s testimony regarding his explanation of his writing of the four checks and his testimony regarding the creation and execution of a Promissory Note, Assignment of the Promissory Note and a Guaranty for his withdrawal of $270,000.00 from the Ominsky Trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Hodes argues that Judge Ballou-Watts improperly discredited his testimony when he testified that he issued the $14,500.00 check from Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal account as remuneration to him for his services rendered as Ms. Ominsky\u2019s attorney-in-fact; when he testified that he had a conversation with his accountant, Lynn Lazzaro, with respect to the $270,000.00 he took from the Ominsky Trust account; when he testified that he executed the Promissory Note; and when he recounted that he did not testify falsely on December 12, 2012, during his statement under oath pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-732,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> when he stated to Bar Counsel that he had executed a personal Guaranty for the $270,000.00 withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">We generally \u201cdefer to the credibility findings of the hearing judge.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Agbaje, </em>438 Md. 695, 722, 93 A.3d 262, 277 (2014). \u201c \u2018The hearing judge is in the best position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and to decide which one to believe and, as we have said, to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. DiCicco, </em>369 Md. 662, 683-84, 802 A.2d 1014, 1026 (2002), quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Monfried, </em>368 Md. 373, 390, 794 A.2d 92, 101 (2002); <em>see also Attorney Grievance v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 17, 741 A.2d 1143, 1152 (1999) (stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>that the hearing judge is \u201cin the best position to assess first hand a witness\u2019s credibility\u201d). As we have stated, a hearing judge is \u201cfree to disregard the testimony of respondent if the judge believed the evidence was not credible.\u201d <em>Monfried, </em>368 Md. at 390, 794 A.2d at 101. Judge Ballou-Watts\u2019s credibility determinations are within her discretion and, accordingly, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions related to the hearing judge\u2019s credibility determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Embedded also in practically all of his exceptions is Hodes\u2019s assertion that the hearing judge relied on evidence and testimony that was not material nor probative and, therefore, not relevant. Among his challenges, Respondent claims that it was not relevant that the $14,500.00 and $775.00 checks were not issued pursuant to the typical HPK firm procedure; that Mr. Adams did not see the $14,500.00 check or the $775.00 check until after HPK began its internal investigation; that there was a lack of explanation in the memo line of both checks; that there was a lack of timesheets or expense reports in the Ominsky file to support the $775.00 check; that the Promissory Note was not signed; that the unexecuted Promissory Note and the Assignment of the Note were created after the $270,000.00 withdrawal from the Ominsky Trust corpus; and that the document entitled \u201cPromissory Note Guaranty\u201d was created after the Promissory Note and Assignment of the Note were drafted. A hearing judge, however, has broad discretion to determine evidence\u2019s relevance when considering its admission. <em>Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Maryland v. Gasper, </em>418 Md. 594, 619, 17 A.3d 676, 691 (2011) (\u201cIt is frequently stated that the issue of whether a particular item of evidence should be admitted or excluded is committed to the considerable and sound discretion of the trial court____\u201d) (internal citation omitted). Judge Ballou-Watts appropriately exercised her discretion in her determination of both probative value and materiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">We now turn to Respondent\u2019s specific factual exceptions:</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Respondent excepts to the factual finding that he improperly issued two checks, one for $775.00 to his wife, Ellen Hodes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>and another for $14,500.00 to his financial consulting company, MCH Financial, from Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal Wachovia bank account. Judge Ballou-Watts found that both the $14,500.00 and the $775.00 check were issued after Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death, that Respondent had backdated the two checks to appear as though they were issued prior to death and that both payments were unearned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">Immediately upon [Ms. Ominsky\u2019s] death from cancer, Respondent acted in his own self-interest by issuing checks to his wife ($775.00) and to his consulting business known as MCH Financial ($14,500.00) and backdated those checks with full knowledge that neither payee was entitled to payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Hodes argues, initially, that the hearing judge\u2019s findings that he improperly issued the $14,500.00 and $775.00 checks were not based on clear and convincing evidence, because, he alleges, that the hearing judge wrongly relied on the wavering testimony of Kimberly Battaglia, an attorney at HPK, regarding the date the checks were issued. Ms. Battaglia\u2019s testimony, however, established unequivocally and consistently that she first saw the checks for $14,500.00 and $775.00 after Ms. Ominsky had died. We, accordingly, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Respondent also argues that the hearing judge relied on the evidence that the $14,500.00 and $775.00 checks were not issued pursuant to the typical HPK firm procedure, which he claims does not demonstrate when the checks were issued or if they were backdated. Judge Ballou-Watts found that the HPK approval procedure for payments of Ms. Ominsky\u2019s bills, according to the testimony of Richard Adams, a former HPK paralegal, included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">Whenever bill payment was needed, [Mr. Adams] followed an established procedure: Mr. Adams would take an invoice (or bill), prepare a check for payment with all sections completed except the date and signature line. Next, he would submit the invoice, an envelope and the prepared check to Respondent for approval and signature. Once Respondent signed the check, Mr. Adams made a copy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the invoice and check for the file. The payment was then mailed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Judge Ballou-Watts found, also, that the HPK approval procedure for payments to Ellen Hodes, according to the testimony of Mr. Adams and Ms. Battaglia, entailed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">There was a similar approval process for the payment of Ellen Hodes\u2019 time and expenses. Mrs. Hodes submitted a timesheet and any receipts for reimbursements. Mr. Adams prepared a check for payment but submitted Mrs. Hodes\u2019 timesheets and receipts to Kim Battaglia, an HPK attorney within the Wealth Preservation Department. Ms. Battaglia would review the timesheet and reconcile the receipts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Judge Ballou-Watts identified these omissions as significant. She found, specifically, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">The two checks were not prepared in advance by Mr. Adams, attached to an invoice or reviewed by Ms. Battaglia pursuant to the established HPK procedure. Instead, they were removed from the checkbook and issued by Respondent. In addition, there was no explanation on the memo line for either check. And, there were no timesheets or expense receipts in the Ominsky file to support the check issued to Mrs. Hodes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">It is also interesting to note that the two checks were issued out of order. Check 7413 was dated \u201c2/18/11\u201d and posted as a debit to Ms. Ominsky\u2019s Wachovia account on February 23, 2011, while check 7416 was dated \u201c2/11/11\u201d though not posted as a debit to Ms. Ominsky\u2019s account until March 3, 2011. Perhaps most telling is the fact that Mr. Adams, who was responsible for keeping Ms. Ominsky\u2019s checkbook, reconciling her bank statements and paying her bills, had never seen checks 7413 and 7416 until after HPK began its internal investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The omissions in the observance of the HPK procedures demonstrate Respondent\u2019s deliberate attempt to circumvent controls established by the law firm to limit defalcation and we, therefore, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Respondent also argues that when the hearing judge made her factual findings she erroneously relied on the fact that there was no explanation in the memo line of both checks and that there were no timesheets nor expense receipts in the Ominsky file to support the $775.00 check payment to Ellen Hodes. As we have often stated, \u201cit is elementary that the hearing judge \u2018may elect to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sheridan, </em>357 Md. at 17, 741 A.2d at 1152, quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kemp, </em>303 Md. 664, 675, 496 A.2d 672, 677 (1985). Judge Ballou-Watts\u2019s reliance on this evidence was within her discretion and we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Respondent also takes issue with Judge Ballou-Watts\u2019s finding that the checks were issued out of order and posted after Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death. Judge Ballou-Watts recognized that \u201cCheck 7413 was dated \u20182/18/11\u2019 and posted as a debit to Ms. Ominsky\u2019s Wachovia account on February 23, 2011, while check 7416 was dated \u20182/11/11\u2019 though not posted as a debit to Ms. Ominsky\u2019s account until March 3, 2011.\u201d Judge BallouWatts\u2019s determination regarding the order of the issuance of the checks is significant, because it highlights Respondent\u2019s dishonest conduct when viewed in the totality of Respondent\u2019s other actions, such as that he did not follow the protocol established by HPK in issuing the checks and he backdated the checks. Again, these findings were based on clear and convincing evidence and supported by the record and we, therefore, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Respondent\u2019s next four exceptions relate only to the $14,500.00 check issued from Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal Wachovia account made payable to Respondent\u2019s financial consulting firm, MCH Financial. Hodes had access to Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal account pursuant to the Power of Attorney given to him by Ms. Ominsky.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Respondent next excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that, \u201cGloria Ominsky never entered into a written agreement with MCH Financial for financial consulting services. And, MCH Financial never issued an itemized statement, invoice or annu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>al bill to Gloria Ominsky at any time prior to her death\u201d in support of the $14,500.00 payment to MCH Financial. Judge Ballou-Watts found, additionally, that Respondent had \u201cfull knowledge\u201d that MCH Financial was not entitled to payment and was created after Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">[Respondent] then instructed HPK secretary Donna Zurowski to create an invoice from MCH Financial to Gloria Ominsky for \u2022 \u201cFinancial Planning for 2008-2011\u201d in the amount of $14,500.00. The invoice contained no itemization or additional explanation of charges. Although the invoice was dated \u201cJanuary 1, 2011\u201d and addressed to Gloria Ominsky, in care of Respondent, it was not created until March 1, 2011\u2014nine (9) days after her death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Respondent argues that Bar Counsel offered no proof that MCH Financial had not earned the $14,500.00 and that the hearing judge\u2019s finding that the check was unearned was not based on clear and convincing evidence. To the contrary, however, Judge Ballou-Watts\u2019s findings were based on clear and convincing evidence that Hodes failed to produce any written agreement or itemized invoice between MCH Financial and Ms. Ominsky for the $14,500.00. There was no proof, additionally, of any oral agreement between MCH Financial and Ms. Ominsky adduced during the evidentiary hearings. An exhibit introduced during the hearings was a Microsoft Word detailed properties record for the invoice, which recorded when the document was created and edited. The properties record indicated the document was not created until March 1, 2011. Ms. Zurowski also testified that she created the document in March of 2011. We, accordingly, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Respondent also claims that Judge Ballou-Watts incorrectly inferred that he acted fraudulently as a result of his producing the MCH Financial invoice for $14,500.00 after Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death, as she found that, \u201ccreating an invoice, <em>post hoc, </em>for monies his consulting business was not entitled to ... can only be described as dishonest and fraudulent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>We have recognized that the finding that an attorney \u201cengaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation [is] within the province of the hearing judge, to be decided after consideration of character testimony and other evidence presented.... \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Thomas, </em>409 Md. 121, 156, 973 A.2d 185, 206 (2009). We have opined, also, that \u201c[a]n attorney\u2019s intent ... may be inferred from circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Jarosinski, </em>411 Md. 432, 452, 983 A.2d 477, 489 (2009). \u201cMoreover, in making the determination that an attorney\u2019s misconduct was willful, the hearing judge may choose the evidence upon which to rely and, as long as the record supports the corresponding finding, we will not disturb the hearing judge\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">There was clear and convincing evidence to support that the $14,500.00 invoice was a product of fraudulent conduct, because it was created after the death of Ms. Ominsky, did not reflect any itemization, and there was no proof adduced at the evidentiary hearings of any written or oral agreement between MCH Financial and Ms. Ominsky. Judge Ballou-Watts also based her determination that Respondent harbored fraudulent intent upon Respondent\u2019s other conduct, such as that he did not follow the protocol established by HPK in issuing the check, he backdated the check and he instructed his secretary to backdate the invoice. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Respondent excepts to Judge Ballou-Watts\u2019s finding that the $14,500.00 was not a payment for his services as Ms. Ominsky\u2019s attorney-in-fact, pursuant to the Power of Attorney. Judge Ballou-Watts found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">Respondent told Kevin Bress that check 7413 was for financial services rendered. Nothing in the language of the backdated invoice supports this alternative explanation. In addition, if check 7413 was issued as compensation for services as the Power of Attorney, the payee would not have been MCH Financial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The basis for this finding was Kevin Bress\u2019s testimony that, when he met with Hodes, Hodes stated that the invoice was for financial services rendered by MCH Financial, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>claiming it was payment for him acting as Ms. Ominsky\u2019s attorney-in-fact, and then later provided Mr. Bress with the purported invoice between MCH Financial and Ms. Ominsky. We, therefore, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Respondent then excepts to the inference of fraudulent intent drawn by Judge Ballou-Watts from Hodes\u2019s explanation that the $14,500.00 check was to pay him for his services as an attorney-in-fact, as well as the fact that MCH Financial was the payee of the $14,000.00 check, rather than Hodes. Certainly, the inference drawn by the hearing judge was one within her discretion, especially because neither explanation of the $14,500.00 check was supported by the record. <em>See Jarosinski, </em>411 Md. at 452, 983 A.2d at 489. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">With regard to the $270,000.00 check that Hodes wrote from the Ominsky Trust\u2019s corpus while he was a Trustee, Respondent first excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that \u201cRespondent led Mr. Bress and Ms. Battaglia to believe that he had discussed the potential loan with his Certified Public Accountant Lynn Lazzaro and that the firm would not be involved.\u201d Hodes excepts to the use of the words \u201cled to believe\u201d, because he infers a malignant purpose by use of the phrase. Both Mr. Bress and Ms. Battaglia testified that they were told by the Respondent that he had discussed the potential loan with Lynn Lazzaro and not to be concerned with the file as it was no longer with the firm. Judge Ballou-Watts\u2019s finding was based on clear and convincing evidence and we, therefore, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Respondent also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that he never executed a Promissory Note between Mikelen Gallery and the Ominsky Trust to repay the Trust for the $270,000.00 he removed from the Trust account. The hearing judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">On April 4, 2012, Respondent instructed his secretary Donna Zurowski to create a new document from his edits of a copy of the Laurie Manney promissory note. The new document was a promissory note which obligated Mikelen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Gallery, LLC as \u201cMaker,\u201d to repay the aforementioned $270,000.00 \u201cloan\u201d that was made by the Ominsky Trust to Mikelen. Under the terms of the Mikelen Gallery, LLC Promissory Note (hereinafter \u201cPromissory Note\u201d), there would be \u201cinterest on the unpaid principal balance from the date of this Note, until paid, at five percent (5%) per annum....\u201d Interestingly, the name of \u201cMichael C. Hodes,\u201d which appeared as the Maker on the Manney promissoiy note was marked out. In its place, Respondent identified the Maker as \u201cMikelen Gallery, LLC.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\">Although the draft promissory note was given to Ms. Zurowski on April 4, 2012 and edited the same day, Respondent backdated the document to March 30, 2012 to make it appear as though it was prepared contemporaneously with the deposit of $270,000.00 from the Trust to Mikelen Gallery, LLC (and then transferred to Respondent\u2019s joint personal account).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">The Court also finds that Respondent never executed the Promissory Note or the Assignment. Mr. Zaharris reviewed the firm\u2019s Ominsky files as part of an internal investigation and no copies of the promissory Note and Assignment were ever found. In addition, Respondent was unable to produce a copy of the Promissory Note and Assignment he claimed to have signed. And, Donna Zurowski testified that she never saw Respondent sign the note. Although Mr. Adams testified that he had seen the executed version of the Promissory Note, during redirect examination he was unable to recall any details about an executed Note. As a result, the Court finds that Mr. Adams was simply mistaken when he testified about having seen the executed Promissory Note.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">This finding is based on clear and convincing evidence: Mr. Zaharris testified that during the investigation initiated by the law firm he did not see any executed Promissory Note in the Ominsky file; Ms. Zurowski testified that she never saw Respondent sign the Promissory Note; and Respondent never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>produced a copy of an executed Promissory Note. We, accordingly, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Respondent next excepts to Judge Ballou-Watts\u2019s finding that his creation of the Promissory Note and the Assignment of the Note, which allegedly assigned the Ominsky Trust\u2019s interest in the $270,000.00 Promissory Note to the Ominsky Family Charity Foundation, occurred after he withdrew the $270,000.00 from the Ominsky Trust, as well as her finding of fraudulent intent. Judge Ballou-Watts found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">The Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Promissory Note and the Assignment were created after Respondent issued checks 5001 [for $3,500.00] and 5002 [for $270,000.00] from the Ominsky Trust account <em>and </em>after Respondent transferred $265,000.00 from Mikelen Gallery, LLC to his joint personal account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">Similarly, Respondent\u2019s removal of $270,000.00 from the Ominsky Trust to his business account for Mikelen Gallery, LLC and immediate \u201cin branch\u201d transfer of $265,000.00 from the Mikelen account to a joint personal bank account, held with his wife, in order to pay personal debts, was dishonest and fraudulent. Respondent unsuccessfully attempted to hide the fact that the entire series of aforementioned transactions was designed to hide his true goal\u2014to inconspicuously use trust funds to pay personal debts. He was not entitled to \u201cloan\u201d $270,000.00 or any other monies from the Trust to himself. However, if he had truly intended to \u201cborrow\u201d funds from the Trust, he would have sought approval from independent counsel and executed a promissory note in his own name at the time the funds were removed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">Instead, Respondent engaged in a ruse with other members of the law firm and Bar Counsel (and this Court) about a Promissory Note on behalf of Mikelen Gallery, LLC, an Assignment in favor of the Foundation and a personal \u201cGuaranty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>There is clear and convincing evidence that Hodes created the Promissory Note and Assignment of the Note after his removal of the $270,000.00 from the Trust account on March 28, 2012. Ms. Zurowski testified that she created the Promissory Note on April 4, 2012. The record shows that the document is backdated to March 30, 2012. The Assignment of the Note is dated April 30, 2012. Judge Ballou-Watts is entitled to infer Respondent\u2019s intent from circumstantial evidence. <em>See Jarosinski, </em>411 Md. at 452, 983 A.2d at 489. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that he \u201ctestified falsely regarding the creation and execution of the Guaranty\u201d in his statement under oath, provided to Bar Counsel pursuant to Rule 16-732. Specifically, Judge BallouWatts found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">On December 12, 2012, during Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation, Respondent provided a statement under oath, pursuant to Md.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-732.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>] At the time of his statement, Respondent testified that on March 28, 2012, he prepared and executed a Promissory Note Guaranty (hereinafter \u201cGuaranty\u201d) in order to personally guarantee the payment of the Mikelen Promissory Note. According to Respondent, he does not recall who typed the Guaranty, but it was not typed by anyone at the firm. A copy of the purported Guaranty was faxed to Respondent\u2019s counsel and Bar Counsel on December 18, 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">The Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent testified falsely regarding the creation and execution of the Guaranty. The Guaranty was purportedly created at the same time as the Promissory Note and Assignment, yet witnesses testified that it did not resemble any forms typically used by HPK attorneys and staff. In addition, no one at the firm ever saw the purported Guaranty nor was it found in any of the law firm\u2019s Ominsky files. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Most significant is the fact that the first time Respondent mentioned the existence of a Guaranty was after Bar Counsel began its investigation. It is also important to note that the purported Guaranty could not have been created on March 28, 2012 because Donna Zurowski did not type the Promissory Note until April 4, 2012. In other words, Respondent could not have guaranteed an obligation before it existed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Judge Ballou-Watts\u2019s finding is based on clear and convincing evidence: Mr. Adams testified that he had never seen the Promissory Note Guaranty, had never seen a Guaranty at HPK in that format and had never seen Respondent use a cut and paste method to create documents; Ms. Battaglia testified that she had never seen the Guaranty prior to the investigation, had never seen a Guaranty at HPK in that format, had never seen the Respondent use a cut and paste method to create documents and had never seen Respondent use a photocopier to create documents with that method; Ms. Zurowski testified that she had never seen the Guaranty before, had never seen a Guaranty at HPK in that format and had never observed Respondent use a cut and paste method to create documents. Judge Ballou-Watts\u2019s finding was also based on the fact that Respondent did not mention the existence of the Guaranty until he gave his Rule 16-732 statement. All of this evidence supports the finding that the Guaranty was created after Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation had begun and that Respondent testified falsely that the Guaranty existed prior to the investigation. We, therefore, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Respondent next excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that \u201cthere was no itemization, contract or invoice to support the $3,500.00\u201d check Respondent issued from the Ominsky Trust account and that, therefore, the payment was unearned. Respondent argues that the $3,500.00 was an advance payment to MCH Financial for services not yet rendered and, thereby, concedes that the payment was not earned at the time the check was issued. In addition, Judge Ballou-Watts\u2019s finding was based on the lack of a written agreement between Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Ominsky and MCH Financial, as well as the lack of records of the financial services rendered or to be rendered in the future. Respondent failed to produce any contract or invoice for the $3,500.00 between Ms. Ominsky and MCH Financial. Judge Ballou-Watts\u2019s finding is, therefore, supported by clear and convincing evidence and we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Having overruled all Respondent\u2019s exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and having determined that the findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence in the record, we now turn to Respondent\u2019s numerous exceptions to Judge Ballou-Watts\u2019s conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">III. Respondent\u2019s Exceptions to Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Respondent first excepts to the conclusion that he violated Rule 1.7. Rule 1.7, entitled \u201cConflict of Interest: General Rule\u201d, provides, in relevant part, that an attorney \u201cshall not represent a client if ... there is a significant risk that representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by ... a personal interest of the lawyer.\u201d Hodes argues that Ms. Ominsky was not his client when he removed $14,500.00 and $775.00 from her personal checking account and, thus, Rule 1.7 is inapplicable. This assertion, of course, flies in the face of Hodes\u2019s representation that the $14,500.00 and $775.00 checks were actually issued prior to Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death under the Power of Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The hearing judge, however, concluded that Hodes violated Rule 1.7:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.7 because his actions in connection with his own personal interests had an adverse impact on his duty of loyalty to Ms. Ominsky and the Ominsky Trust. Those actions materially limited his representation of her interests and the interest of the Trust beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">Immediately upon [Ms. Ominsky\u2019s] death from cancer, Respondent acted in his own self-interest by issuing checks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>to his wife ($775.00) and to his consulting business known as MCH Financial ($14,500.00) and backdated those checks with full knowledge that neither payee was entitled to payment. Respondent then failed in his transparent attempt to hide the fact that his consulting business was not entitled to the check for $14,500.00 by instructing his secretary to create an invoice for services, address the invoice to Gloria Ominsky and backdate same to a date before her death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Unlike what Hodes asserts, our Rule 1.7, in contrast to the ABA Model Rule 1.7 (\u201cConflict of Interest: Current Clients\u201d), does not require that the client be a \u201ccurrent client\u201d, nor does it require a \u201cconcurrent\u201d conflict of interest, nor does it require that there is an immediacy to the existence of the representation. <em>See </em>Model Rules of Profl Conduct R. 1.7 (2013). We considered incorporating the ABA Model Rule 1.7 language of \u201ccurrent\u201d and \u201cconcurrent\u201d when we adopted the current Rule 1.7 in 2005, but we declined to add those terms. 32:5 <em>Maryland Register </em>539-42 (Mar. 4, 2005). As a result, the factual predicates were met for Hodes\u2019s conduct to constitute a violation of Rule 1.7 whether he was found to have withdrawn the $14,500.00 and $775.00 from Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal account before or after her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Judge Ballou-Watts found, moreover, that Respondent violated Rule 1.7 when he engaged in self-dealing by transferring $270,000.00 from the Trust account into his own account to pay personal debts and by issuing a check for $3,500.00 from the Trust account payable to MCH Financial. She reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">Respondent also violated Rule 1.7 in his capacity as Trustee of the Ominsky Trust when he engaged in self-dealing to the detriment of the Trust beneficiary and removed $270,000.00 from the Ominsky Trust account so that he could pay personal debts. He also acted in his own self-interest and to the detriment of the Trust beneficiaries when he issued a check to his financial consulting business for an unearned fee in the amount of $3,500.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\u201cPerhaps the most fundamental duty of a trustee is that he must display throughout the administration of the trust complete loyalty to the interest of the beneficiarles] and must exclude all selfish interest and all consideration of the interests of third persons.\u201d <em>Sachse, </em>345 Md. at 588, 693 A.2d at 811 (quoting Bogert, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 541).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">A trustee has a duty to \u201cact solely in the interest of the trust.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

As we emphasized in <em>Sachse:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">In the management of a trust, a trustee is charged with exercising \u201cthe care, skill, prudence, and diligence of an ordinary prudent [person] engaged in similar business affairs and with objectives similar to those of the trust in question.\u201d <em>Maryland Nat\u2019l Bank v. Cummins, </em>322 Md. 570, 580, 588 A.2d 1205, 1210 (1991). \u201cAll trustees are subject to common law duties and equitable rules or principles.\u201d George G. Bogert, <em>The Law of Trusts and Trustees </em>\u00a7 541 (2d ed. rev.1993). \u201cPerhaps the most fundamental duty of a trustee is that he must display throughout the administration of the trust complete loyalty to the interests of the beneficiar[ies] and must exclude all selfish interest and all consideration of the interests of third persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 543; <em>see also Board of Trustees v.

Conflicts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>interest impair the trustee\u2019s ability to act on behalf of the beneficiaries with independent and disinterested judgment in the administration of the trust, the rationale being that it is generally not possible for the same person to act fairly in two capacities and on behalf of two interests in the same transaction. Bogert, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 548.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 588, 693 A.2d at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In another fiduciary scenario, <em>Attorney Grievance v. Ruddy, </em>411 Md. 30, 981 A.2d 637 (2009), we determined that Ruddy violated Rule 1.7 when, acting as his aunt\u2019s personal representative, he failed to make arrangements to obtain interest payments on a loan he had taken from his aunt prior to her death, because there were estate beneficiaries who would have benefitted from his payment of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Hodes argues, however, that <em>Ruddy </em>gives him support, because, he asserts, the case stands for the proposition that a fiduciary is permitted to make a loan to himself under Rule 1.7. In actuality, <em>Ruddy </em>does not support that conclusion. After Ruddy drafted a will for his aunt, he borrowed $95,000.00 from her, which was to be repaid after her death. Ruddy and his wife, thereafter, signed a promissory note to repay the loan without interest within one hundred twenty (120) days after his aunt\u2019s death without any further interest provisions. Ruddy\u2019s aunt died and Ruddy was appointed as Personal Representative of his aunt\u2019s estate. Upon preparing the inventory of the estate, Ruddy realized the note was already in default, because 120 days had passed. Ruddy paid the $95,000.00 loan out of his legacy from the estate, but failed to make any arrangements to obtain interest payments and referred to the loan as non-interest bearing in his inventory of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">We did not discipline Ruddy for having taken a loan from his aunt, but did determine his actions constituted a conflict of interest with respect to the collection of interest for the loan, because he should have made provisions for payment of interest after 120 days. We emphasized that \u201cthere were over thirty other interested parties who would have benefitted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>the payment of interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73-74, 981 A.2d at 662. Hodes, however, cannot gain succor from the <em>Ruddy </em>case, because Hodes removal of $270,000.00 from the Trust was not with the consent of Ms. Ominsky, nor was it prior to her death, nor was Ms. Ominsky a family member of Hodes, in line with <em>Ruddy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Respondent additionally argues that his taking of the $270,000.00 from the Trust was on terms favorable to the Trust, because the interest rate to be paid was above prime; thus, he argues, no conflict of interest existed. We do not find this argument convincing. In <em>Whitehead, </em>405 Md. at 257, 950 A.2d at 808, we disciplined an attorney who loaned himself $600,000.00 from a conservatorship to purchase property titled in his name and his business partner\u2019s name. Whitehead purchased the building as an investment property for himself and his business partner, and secured the $600,000.00 loan with a Note, Mortgage and Assignment of Rents and Leases. Whitehead was not charged with a violation of Rule 1.7, but we concluded that Whitehead\u2019s removal of the $600,000.00 was self-dealing and \u201cclearly a misappropriation\u201d, because he intentionally removed the money to benefit himself. <em>Id. </em>at 257, 950 A.2d at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">We reached a similar result in <em>Sachse, </em>345 Md. at 588, 693 A.2d at 811, in dealing with a conflict of interest in a trust situation, when we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">Conflicts of interest impair the trustee\u2019s ability to act on behalf of the beneficiaries with independent and disinterested judgment in the administration of the trust, the rationale being that it is generally not possible for the same person to act fairly in two capacities and on behalf of two interests in the same transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\"><em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Pattison, </em>292 Md. 599, 608, 441 A.2d 328, 332 (1982) (\u201cIt is fundamental that a fiduciary may not make a loan, secured or unsecured (as was this), unto himself.\u201d). When Hodes removed $270,000.00 and $3,500.00 from the Trust Account to benefit himself and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>wife, to the detriment of the Trust beneficiaries to whom he owed a duty of loyalty, he violated Rule 1.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Respondent additionally excepts to Judge Ballou-Watts\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 1.15(d). Rule 1.15(d) provides that a lawyer must promptly deliver funds to a client or third party that the client or third party is entitled to receive. Judge Ballou-Watts concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15. Under the terms of Gloria Ominsky\u2019s Last Will and Testament, the residuary estate was to be held in trust. Respondent, as Trustee, was obligated to distribute the Trust funds to a charitable foundation known as The Ominsky Family Charitable Foundation as directed by the provisions of her will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">Once the First and Final Administration Account was approved and the estate was closed, Respondent unnecessarily liquidated the UBS investment account funds and deposited those funds into the firm\u2019s escrow account. He then opened a checking account at M &amp; T Bank in the name of Gloria S. Ominsky Irrevocable Trust and deposited $375,355.52 into the Trust account. However, instead of promptly delivering the Trust funds to the Foundation, Respondent removed $270,000.00 for his own benefit to facilitate the payment of personal debts. He also removed an additional $3,500.00 for the benefit of a financial consulting company he owned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Respondent argues that there was no evidence that he violated Rule 1.15(d), because he claims that he was allowed by the terms of Ms. Ominsky\u2019s will to loan money to himself.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>also argues that his conduct did not violate Rule 1.15(d), because he was not representing a client at the time of his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Rule 1.15(d) \u201crefers generally to a lawyer\u2019s duty to act with the care of a professional fiduciary for any property held by an attorney on behalf of third persons,\u201d regardless of if it is in the course of representation. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Johnson, </em>409 Md. 470, 492, 976 A.2d 245, 258 (2009), quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Clark, </em>363 Md. 169, 767 A.2d 865 (2001).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We have previously found violations of Rule 1.15(d) when attorneys failed to properly distribute funds to third parties when acting in the role of fiduciaries. <em>See id. </em>at 493, 976 A.2d at 258-59 (two attorneys acting as settlement agents both violated Rule 1.15(d), then codified as Rule 1.15(b), for failing to disburse funds to seller of home).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">As Judge Ballou-Watts found, Respondent was acting as a Trustee of the Ominsky Trust at the time he withdrew the funds. Regardless of the clause in Ms. Ominsky\u2019s will which permitted Respondent to \u201cmake loans\u201d, Hodes\u2019s withdrawals of the $270,000.00 and $3,500.00 were violative of his duty of loyalty to the beneficiaries of the Trust. <em>See Owrutsky, </em>322 Md. at 348-51, 587 A.2d at 518-19 (attorney engaged in misconduct when he withdrew funds as trustee from testamentary trust, because the loan was improper even though there was a clause allowing trustees to make investments). We thus conclude, as did the hearing judge, that Respondent violated Rule 1.15(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In a similar vein, Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>because, he alleges, he had a duty as trustee to invest the Trust\u2019s corpus. Section 10-306 provides: \u201cA lawyer may not use trust money for any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.\u201d To constitute a violation of Section 10-306, \u201cthe Court must find that the misappropriation or unauthorized use of the trust funds was knowing and/or intentional.\u201d <em>Jarosinski, </em>411 Md. at 445, 983 A.2d at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In <em>Sachse, </em>345 Md. at 590-91, 693 A.2d at 812-13, we upheld the hearing court\u2019s conclusion that Sachse, as trustee of a Trust, violated Section 10-306 when he allowed a client-beneficiary to deplete the Trust\u2019s assets by investing in a corporation without securing the transactions or investigating the nature of the transactions. Similarly, in <em>Whitehead, </em>405 Md. at 252, 950 A.2d at 805, we determined Whitehead violated Section 10-306, in his fiduciary role as conservator, in which the \u201cobligation to safeguard the assets of the estate are the same\u201d as a trustee, by utilizing monies entrusted to him to purchase real property titled in his name and that of his business partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Respondent willfully and intentionally removed $270,000.00 from the Ominsky Trust account to pay his personal debts and, therefore, violated Section 10-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Respondent next excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 8.1(a). Rule 8.1(a) prohibits a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact in a disciplinary matter. Judge Ballou-Watts found that Respondent testified falsely during his Rule 16-732 statement under oath when he claimed that he had executed a personal Guaranty for repayment of the $270,000.00 that he removed from the Trust Account, when in fact, he executed the Guaranty after Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation began.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Respondent contends he did not violate Rule 8.1(a), because there was no affirmative evidence offered by Bar Counsel that he testified falsely. In fact, however, as noted above, there was clear and convincing evidence that Hodes did testify falsely regarding his execution of the purported Guaranty. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Mr. Adams, Ms. Battaglia and Ms. Zurowski all testified that they had never seen the Guaranty prior to the investigation, had never seen a Guaranty at HPK in that format and had never seen, contrary to Respondent\u2019s explanation, Respondent use a cut and paste method to create documents. Respondent, additionally, did not mention the existence of the Guaranty until he gave his Rule 16-732 statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Rule 8.1(a) is violated when an attorney knowingly makes a false statement of material fact during a disciplinary proceeding. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Kapoor, </em>391 Md. 505, 894 A.2d 502 (2006) (attorney violated Rule 8.1(a) when he made a false statement of material fact in a statement under oath when he told Bar Counsel that his client never tendered him a $50.00 check, when his client in fact had and he had cashed and spent the check); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Nussbaum, </em>401 Md. 612, 934 A.2d 1 (2007) (attorney violated Rule 8.1(a) when he submitted altered escrow account ledgers to Bar Counsel which he claimed were made contemporaneously with his transactions, when they were not, because the timing of the entries was material to Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation); <em>Harris, </em>403 Md. at 164, 939 A.2d at 745 (attorney violated Rule 8.1(a) when he knowingly misrepresented to Bar Counsel in a letter that he titled a Fund to his name when he knew he did not have sole ownership to \u201chold the account in a \u2018self-imposed trust\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We agree with Judge Ballou-Watts \u201cthat Respondent knowingly made a false statement about the existence and execution of a personal Guaranty to repay the $270,000.00 during the investigation by Bar Counsel.\u201d Several witnesses from Hodes\u2019s former firm testified they had never seen the Guaranty, had never seen a Guaranty in that format at HPK and had never seen Hodes use a cut and paste method to create documents. Hodes, additionally, did not mention the Guaranty until the date of his statement under oath on December 12, 2012, well after the investigation had begun. Accordingly, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exception and conclude that Respondent violated Rule 8.1(a) when he testified falsely regarding the Guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Respondent next challenges the conclusion that his actions constituted a violation of Section 7-113(a) of the Criminal Law Article of the Maryland Code (\u201cEmbezzlement-Fraudulent misappropriation by fiduciary.\u201d), and, therefore, violated Rule 8.4(b), which prohibits an attorney from engaging in \u201ca criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer\u201d, because, he alleges, the $270,000.00 was a \u201cloan\u201d to him. Section 7-113(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An\">(a) Prohibited.\u2014A fiduciary may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">(1) fraudulently and willfully appropriate money or a thing of value that the fiduciary holds in a fiduciary capacity contrary to the requirements of the fiduciary\u2019s trust responsibility; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">(2) secrete money or a thing of value that the fiduciary holds in a fiduciary capacity with a fraudulent intent to use the money or thing of value contrary to the requirements of the fiduciary\u2019s trust responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">A criminal charge or conviction is not required in order to violate Rule 8.4(b). <em>Jarosinski, </em>411 Md. at 454, 983 A.2d at 490 (\u201c[T]o conclude that an attorney has violated MRPC 8.4(b), the attorney need not have been convicted of a criminal act; the hearing judge need only find clear and convincing evidence that the attorney committed the underlying offense.\u201d).

Thompson, </em>367 Md. 315, 324, 786 A.2d 763, 769 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Hodes fraudulently and willfully removed money from a Trust he held in a fiduciary capacity as a Trustee, contrary to his responsibilities as a Trustee. Irrespective of the clause in Ms. Ominsky\u2019s will which permitted Respondent to \u201cmake loans\u201d, Hodes\u2019s withdrawal of $270,000.00 was violative of his duty of loyalty to the beneficiaries of the Trust. He removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>$270,000.00 and used the money to pay off personal debts and, therefore, his actions violated the strictures of Section 7-113(a) and Rule 8.4(b). <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Prichard, </em>386 Md. 238, 247, 872 A.2d 81, 86 (2005) (attorney\u2019s conduct constituted a Rule 8.4(b) violation when he engaged in criminal conduct under Section 7-113 by fraudulently and willfully appropriating money he held in a fiduciary capacity).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Respondent also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 8.4(c), which states that it is professional misconduct for an attorney to engage in conduct that involves dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. Specifically, Judge Ballou-Watts determined Hodes violated 8.4(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">1) issuing checks to his wife and his consulting business without following the systems of checks and balances established by the law firm; 2) backdating those checks to make it appear that they were issued before Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death; 3) creating an invoice, <em>post hoc, </em>for monies his consulting business was not entitled to; and 4) instructing his secretary to backdate the invoice to a date before Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death, [which] can only be described as dishonest and fraudulent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Judge Ballou-Watts found, also, that \u201cRespondent\u2019s removal of $270,000.00 from the Ominsky Trust to his business account for Mikelen Gallery, LLC and immediate \u2018in branch\u2019 transfer of $265,000.00 from the Mikelen account to a joint personal bank account, held with his wife, in order to pay personal debts, was dishonest and fraudulent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">An attorney\u2019s conduct constitutes a violation of Rule 8.4(c) when an attorney improperly removes funds and utilizes the money for his or her personal gain. <em>See Whitehead, </em>405 Md. at 257, 950 A.2d at 808 (attorney violated Rule 8.4(c) by misappropriating funds when he intentionally removed $600,000.00 from a conservatorship without court approval and used the funds to purchase real property titled in his name and his business partner\u2019s name); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 773 A.2d 463 (2001) (attorney violated Rule 8.4(c) when she took money from her employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>for her own purposes). We have recognized that \u201cself-dealing implicates dishonesty.\u201d Whitehead, 405 Md. at 259, 950 A.2d at 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">We agree with Judge Ballou-Watts that Respondent\u2019s conduct in issuing unearned checks for $14,500.00 and $775.00 from Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal account for services that had not been rendered and his removal of $270,000.00 and $3,500.00 from the Trust account were acts of dishonesty. Hodes improperly removed funds from both Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal account and the Trust account and utilized those funds for his and his wife\u2019s personal benefit. His conduct was dishonest and, thus, violated Rule 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Respondent excepts, thereafter, to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 8.4(d), because, he claims, there is no evidence that his conduct interfered with or was prejudicial to the administration of justice. Judge Ballou-Watts determined that Respondent\u2019s conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice and harmful to the legal profession, \u201cbecause it undermines the public\u2019s confidence that an attorney will exercise his fiduciary duties in protecting funds entrusted to his professional care and responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">We have recognized that, \u201c[c]onduct which is likely to impair public confidence in the profession, impact the image of the legal profession and engender disrespect for the court is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Agbaje, </em>438 Md. at 717, 93 A.3d at 274, citing <em>Attorney Grievance Com\u2019n of Maryland v. Childress, </em>360 Md. 373, 758 A.2d 117 (2000); <em>see also Sheinbein, </em>372 Md. at 252-53 &amp; n. 16, 812 A.2d at 996-97 &amp; n. 16 (2002). In <em>Whitehead, </em>405 Md. at 260, 950 A.2d at 810, for example, we concluded Whitehead violated Rule 8.4(d) when he removed $600,000.00 in funds from a conservatorship; we noted \u201cRespondent\u2019s self-dealing was harmful to the legal profession because his behavior undermines public confidence that an attorney will maintain entrusted funds as a fiduciary and as required by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Hodes, likewise, abused his position as Trustee of the Ominsky Trust and engaged in self-dealing by removing trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>funds to pay his personal debts. Such conduct \u201cundermines public confidence that an attorney will maintain entrusted funds as a fiduciary and as required by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260, 950 A.2d at 810. Respondent also testified falsely during Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation that he executed a Guaranty for the loan at the time he withdrew the money. Hodes\u2019s self-dealing and deceitful conduct were prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Rule 8.4(a) provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201cviolate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct\u201d. Rule violations, by themselves, are sufficient to support a violation of Rule 8.4(a). <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Dominguez, </em>427 Md. 308, 47 A.3d 975 (2012). We have determined Hodes violated Rules 1.7,1.15(d), 8.1(a), 8.4(b), (c) and (d). Respondent, accordingly, has violated Rule 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In summary, we agree with Judge Ballou-Watts that Respondent violated Rules 1.7, 1.15(d), 8.1(a), 8.4(a), (b), (c) and (d), as well as Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">IV. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Respondent has already been disbarred as per our October 7, 2014 <em>per curiam </em>order. The bases for Hodes\u2019s disbarment are clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Initially, it is well settled that the purpose \u201cof attorney discipline is protection of the public, rather than punishment\u201d of the errant attorney. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Coppola, </em>419 Md. 370, 404, 19 A.3d 431, 451 (2011), citing <em>Attorney Grievance v. Goff, </em>399 Md. 1, 30, 922 A.2d 554, 571 (2007). \u201cImposing a sanction protects the public interest \u2018because it demonstrates to members of the legal profession the type of conduct which will not be tolerated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Gallagher, </em>371 Md. 673, 714, 810 A.2d 996, 1020, quoting <em>Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 96, 753 A.2d at 38 (citation omitted). We evaluate each attorney grievance matter on its own merits, considering the particular facts and circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>in order to determine an appropriate sanction. <em>Coppola, </em>419 Md. at 404, 19 A.3d at 451, citing <em>Attorney Grievance v. Bleecker, </em>414 Md. 147, 176, 994 A.2d 928, 945 (2010). We also look to \u201cthe presence or absence of mitigating factors and the prior disciplinary history of the attorney ... particularly as it reveals the presence or absence of misconduct of the same, or similar, kind to that being addressed.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. McCulloch, </em>404 Md. 388, 402, 946 A.2d 1009, 1018 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">We previously have referred to the aggravating factors found in Standard 9.22 of the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions for guidance when imposing discipline; the factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">(a) prior disciplinary offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">(b) dishonest or selfish motive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">(c) a pattern of misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">(d) multiple offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">(e) bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">(f) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">(g) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-12\">(h) vulnerability of victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-13\">(i) substantial experience in the practice of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-14\">(j) indifference to making restitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-15\">(k) illegal conduct, including that involving the use of controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-16\"><em>Standard 9.22 of the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions </em>(1992); <em>see Bleecker, </em>414 Md. at 176-77, 994 A.2d at 945-46 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">Here, aggravating factors (b), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (i) are implicated, because Respondent had embodied a dishonest and selfish motive, engaged in a pattern of misconduct, committed multiple offenses, testified falsely during the grievance investigation and he refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct. Hodes had substantial experience in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>the practice of law, especially in the elder care as well as estates and trusts fields, from which this case evolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Factor (b), \u201cdishonest or selfish motive\u201d, is present here as Respondent had both a dishonest and selfish motive as he removed $270,000.00 and $3,500.00 from the Trust account for his own benefit and the benefit of his financial consulting company and issued unearned checks for $775.00 and $14,500.00 from Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal account for his and his wife\u2019s benefit. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Penn, </em>431 Md. 320, 65 A.3d 125 (2013) (aggravating factor (b) present when attorney engaged in self-dealing transactions). His dishonest motive is borne out by his false testimony before Bar Counsel when he attempted to misdirect the investigation into his wrongful act.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Factor (c), \u201ca pattern of misconduct\u201d, is relevant in this case. A pattern of misconduct is formed by a series of acts, even if that series of acts is performed to achieve a single goal. <em>See Coppola, </em>419 Md. at 406, 19 A.3d at 453. Hodes engaged in a pattern of misconduct, including: (1) issuing a $775.00 check to his wife and a $14,500.00 check to his financial consulting business without following HPK\u2019s protocol from Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal account, (2) backdating the two checks to make it seem that they were issued prior to Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death, (3) creating an invoice after-the-fact for the $14,500.00 his financial consulting business did not earn, (4) directing his secretary to backdate the invoice to a date before Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death, (5) issuing a $270,000.00 check from the Ominsky Trust account to his and his wife\u2019s art gallery, which he later transferred to their joint personal account, (6) issuing a $3,500.00 check from the Ominsky Trust account to his financial consulting business, (7) failing to execute a Promissory Note for the $270,000.00 and (8) testifying falsely regarding the existence of a Promissory Note Guaranty for the $270,000.00 check. These actions form a clear pattern of misconduct. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Factor (d), \u201cmultiple offenses\u201d, is also implicated. Hodes engaged in multiple offenses when he made four different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>transactions to benefit himself, right on the heels of Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death from cancer, in violation of Rules 1.7, 1.15(d), 8.4(a), (b), (c) and (d). His conduct in removing the funds from Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal account and the Ominsky Trust account and his subsequent ruse during Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation in violation of 8.1(a), in an attempt to deceive, implicates multiple offenses. <em>See Bleecker, </em>414 Md. at 177-78, 994 A.2d at 946 (concluding aggravating factor (d) is implicated when a lawyer violates multiple disciplinary rules).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Factor (f), \u201cfalse statements\u201d, is also implicated, because Hodes testified falsely in his Rule 16-732 statement under oath about \u201cthe existence and execution of a personal Guaranty to repay the $270,000.00\u201d he improperly removed from the Trust account. <em>See Dominguez, </em>427 Md. at 327, 47 A.3d at 985-86 (attorney\u2019s false statement to Bar Counsel implicated aggravating factor (f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Factor (g), \u201crefusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct\u201d, is also relevant in the instant case. During his Rule 16-732 statement under oath, Hodes refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct and claimed that members of the firm reported his activity to Bar Counsel in an effort to \u201csteal\u201d his practice and \u201cmake him look like a crook\u201d. At the time of the evidentiary hearings, Hodes \u201ccomplained that he was subjected to a \u2018star chamber\u2019 investigation by his former law firm\u201d. Hodes\u2019s remorselessness further intensifies the nefariousness of his conduct. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Mininsohn, </em>380 Md. 536, 846 A.2d 353 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Finally, with respect to factor (i), \u201csubstantial experience in the practice of law\u201d, Respondent is a veteran attorney, having been admitted to the Bar of this Court on December 18, 1975. The fact that Hodes has spent his career in a practice dominated by work in the elder care, trust and estates and wealth preservation areas is undoubtedly an aggravating factor. <em>See Coppola, </em>419 Md. at 406-07, 19 A.3d 431 at 453 (attorney\u2019s experience extensively in the area of estates and trusts since 1996 was an aggravating factor); <em>see also Whitehead, </em>405 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>at 263, 950 A.2d at 812; <em>Mininsohn, </em>380 Md. at 576, 846 A.2d at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Mitigating factors, if such exist, that we often consider include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">absence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\"><em>Coppola, </em>419 Md. at 407, 19 A.3d at 453 (internal quotations omitted). The hearing judge determined that mitigating factors present in this case included Respondent\u2019s lack of a prior disciplinary record; that Respondent repaid the $270,000.00; that \u201cRespondent has been recognized by several organizations for his skill and experience in the practice areas of elder law, estates and trusts and wealth preservation\u201d; that he served as a law professor and discussed elder law issues during weekly radio broadcasts; that he \u201chas been associated with philanthropic efforts for local institutions\u201d; and that several character witnesses \u201ctestified that they trusted him, valued his advice and appreciated his professional service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aum\">The mitigation found by Judge Ballou-Watts, however, does not lessen the seriousness of Hodes\u2019s egregious and deceitful conduct. We have recognized that \u201cintentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse.\u201d <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 418, 773 A.2d at 488; <em>see Seltzer, </em>424 Md. at 118, 34 A.3d at 512-13 (disbarring attorney for issuing bad checks, providing fraudulent documents, and withdrawing funds from his realty company\u2019s escrow account); <em>Johnson, </em>409 Md. at 508, 976 A.2d at 267 (disbarring two attorneys for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>their involvement in a \u201cfraudulent, equity-stripping transaction\u201d with home-owners); <em>Lazerow, </em>320 Md. at 515-16, 578 A.2d at 783 (disbarring non-practicing attorney who misappropriated home purchasers\u2019 payments out of escrow accounts). Clearly, Hodes engaged in self-dealing, as well as deceitful and duplicitous acts, designed to benefit himself and his wife and to shield him from discipline. Disbarment is the only appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Hodes, however, identifies various cases in which we did not disbar as examples of the sanction we should have imposed upon him. Two of the cases involved negligence, however: <em>Attorney Grievance v. Tun, </em>428 Md. 235, 51 A.3d 565 (2012) (suspension appropriate when respondent negligently, but not intentionally, overbilled the District of Columbia Superior Court for legal services rendered to indigent defendants in criminal cases) and <em>Attorney Grievance v. Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. 341, 872 A.2d 693 (2005) (suspension appropriate when misappropriation of funds was caused by respondent\u2019s ineffectual accounting procedures and the respondent\u2019s employee\u2019s theft).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The remainder of the cases cited by Hodes are no longer part of our modern attorney discipline jurisprudence,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> because, as we noted in <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 418, 773 A.2d at 488:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">With our opinion today, we impress upon the members of the bar that the Court does not consider <em>Hess </em>or the pre<em>Kenney </em>cases to be authority for an argument for leniency in attorney disciplinary matters involving intentionally dishonest conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">We therefore conclude that Respondent\u2019s cases, decided prior to our rule adopted in <em>Vanderlinde </em>that intentionally dishonest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>conduct normally results in disbarment, absent compelling circumstances, are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Hodes issued two unearned checks from Ms. Ominsky\u2019s personal account, one for $775.00 to his wife, and one for $14,500.00 to his financial consulting company, merely a day after Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death from cancer, to benefit himself and his wife. He backdated the checks to make it appear as though he issued them during her lifetime. He then directed his secretary to create and backdate an invoice from his financial consulting company to Ms. Ominsky, after-the-fact, in attempt to legitimize the $14,500.00 check. After Ms. Ominsky\u2019s death, as directed in her will, he became Trustee of the Ominsky Trust, a testamentary trust intended to be disbursed into the Ominsky Family Charitable Foundation from which he perversely funnelled funds directed to the Charitable Foundation by fraudulently and willfully removing $270,000.00 and $3,500.00 to benefit himself and his wife. He continued his subterfuge by testifying falsely during his Rule 16-732 statement under oath in an attempt to camouflage his fraudulent behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Hodes\u2019s conduct was intentionally dishonest, fraudulent and demonstrative of a lack of the fundamental qualities of a lawyer: honesty, integrity and respect for the legal system. <em>See Milliken, </em>348 Md. at 520, 704 A.2d at 1241. He continues to fail to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct. We cannot and will not condone such behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Accordingly, we entered the October 7, 2014, <em>per curiam, </em>order, disbarring Michael Carl Hodes.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-13\">.

We have explained the clear and convincing evidence standard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-10\">The requirement of \"clear and convincing\u201d or \"satisfactory\u201d evidence does not call for \"unanswerable\u201d or \"conclusive\u201d evidence. The quality of proof, to be clear and convincing, has also been said to be somewhere between the rule in ordinary civil cases and the requirement of criminal procedure\u2014that is, it must be more than a mere preponderance but not beyond a reasonable doubt. It has also been said that the term \"clear and convincing\u201d evidence means that the witnesses to a fact must be found to be credible, and that the facts to which they have testified are distinctly remembered and the details thereof narrated exactly and in due order, so as to enable the trier of the facts to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue. Whether evidence is clear and convincing requires weighing, comparing, testing, and judging its worth when considered in connection with all the facts and circumstances in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-11\"><em>Attorney Grievance v.
