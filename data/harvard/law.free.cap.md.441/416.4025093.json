Mixter, Respondent, was admitted to the Bar of this Court on November 20, 1980. On March 26, 2013, the Attorney Grievance Commission, (\u201cPetitioner\u201d or \u201cBar Counsel\u201d), acting pursuant to Maryland Rule lGWSRa),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>\u201cPetition For Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Respondent, alleging that Mixter engaged in a \u201cpattern and practice that is outside the bounds of zealous representation, in direct defiance of the Discovery Guidelines of the State Bar, contrary to the Rules of Civil Procedure and in violation of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d Violations were alleged of the following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cRule\u201d): 3.1 (Meritorious Claims and Contentions),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3.2 (Expediting litigation),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 3.3 (Candor Toward the Tribunal),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 3.4 (Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>4.1 (Truthfulness in Statements to Others),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 4.4 (Respect for Rights of Third Persons),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 5.3 (Responsibilities Regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Nonlawyer Assistants),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Matters)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and 8.4 (Misconduct).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>In an Order dated March 28, 2013, we referred the matter for a hearing to Judge Melissa Phinn of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On August 22, 2013, at the request of Judge Marcella Holland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Circuit Administrative Judge for the Eighth Judicial Circuit, this case was reassigned to Judge Timothy J. Doory.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">On May 31, 2013, a copy of the Petition, our Order and a writ of summons was served on Mixter\u2019s counsel to which Mixter filed an Answer in which he denied all of Bar Counsel\u2019s allegations. A five-day hearing was held before Judge Doory, during which voluminous exhibits from both parties were admitted, the majority of which included Mixter\u2019s files from the various cases in which his actions occurred, as well as testimony from expert and lay witnesses; the latter included character witnesses called by Mixter. Judge Doory, on June 9, 2014, issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in which he found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Mixter had violated Rules 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4(a), (c), (d) and (f),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 4.1(a), 4.4(a) and 8.4(a), (c) and (d), but not Rules 5.3(c) and 8.1.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">For an understanding of the bases of Judge Doory\u2019s findings that Mixter had filed various frivolous motions and made misrepresentations in connection with unenforceable subpoenas, as well as that Mixter made misrepresentations to various courts in relation to Maryland Rule 2-431<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> certificates, we provide an overview of the applicable Maryland Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Subpoenas, according to Maryland Rule 2-510(a),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> may be issued \u201cto compel a party over whom the court has acquired jurisdiction to attend, give testimony, and produce and permit inspection [and] copying ... of designated documents ... or tangible things at a deposition,\u201d the service of which is \u201cpermitted by Rule 2-121(a)(3)\u201d.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Maryland Rule 2\u2014121(a)(3) provides that service may be accomplished by mailing by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>certified mail, restricted delivery, and that service \u201cby certified mail under this Rule is complete upon delivery.\u201d \u201cIf service is by certified mail, the proof shall include the original return receipt.\u201d Maryland Rule 2-126(a)(3). When a deposition subpoena is issued which calls for the production of documents, Maryland Rule 2-412(c) provides that, \u201cthe designation of the materials to be produced as set forth in the subpoena shall be attached to or included in the notice and the subpoena shall be served at least 30 days before the date of the deposition.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Furthermore, according to Maryland Rule 2-413(a)(l),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> a non-party witness only may be required to attend a deposition \u201cin the county in which the person resides or is employed or engaged in business, or at any other convenient place fixed by order of court.\u201d A party to an action, on the other hand, \u201cmay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>be required to attend a deposition wherever a nonparty could be required to attend or in the county in which the action is pending.\u201d Maryland Rule 2\u2014413(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Because \u201cthe subpoena powers of the State of Maryland stop at the state line\u201d, <em>(Attorney Grievance v. Gallagher, </em>371 Md. 673, 702, 810 A.2d 996, 1013 (2002), quoting <em>Bartell v. Bartell, </em>278 Md. 12, 19, 357 A.2d 343, 347 (1976)), when the deposition of, and/or documents from, a non-party outside of Maryland is sought, the dictates \u201cof the place where the deposition is held\u201d must be followed. Maryland Rule 2-413(a)(2). The intersection of Maryland Rules 2\u2014413(a)(1), (a)(2) and (b) has been described as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">[Rule 2-413] is conceptually a venue rule providing for the place where a deposition is taken. It is limited by the judicial power of the courts to compel appearance or to sanction nonappearance. As a practical matter, a nonresident nonparty may be compelled to attend a deposition only to the extent he or she is subject to a body attachment, <em>i. e., </em>is present in the state. <em>See </em>Rule 2-510(i). A party\u2019s deposition may be noticed for a location in the county where the action is pending, whether or not the party is a resident of that county. This is because the party has been subjected to the judicial power of the court when initially served with process in the action under Rule 2-121. The party who is a resident of the State may be deposed in the county in which the party resides or works as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">With respect to a nonparty, there are fewer appropriate locations. The nonparty who is a resident may be deposed in the county where he or she lives or works. A nonresident, on the other hand, cannot be forced to give a deposition in this State at all unless served with a subpoena while in <em>this </em>State. If the nonresidence is served in this State, the deposition may be taken in the county of service or within 40 miles of the place of service. If not served with a subpoena while in this State, the nonresident will have to be deposed in his or her own state under its rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Neimeyer &amp; Schuett, Rule 2-413, Maryland Rules Commentary 297 (3d ed.2003, 2013 Supp.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Subpoenas were issued, by Mixter, to non-party witnesses in various of the following states during the years specified, according to Judge Doory\u2019s findings of fact: Arizona (2012),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Florida (2008, 2009, 2011),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Iowa (2009, 2010),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> North Carolina (2010),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Pennsylvania (2008, 2009, 2010),<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> South Carolina <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>(2009, 2010),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Texas (2012),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Virginia (2007, 2009, 2010, 2011)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and Washington D.C.

A \u201ccommission\u201d is a court order that authorizes the judiciary of another state to issue a subpoena to the witness who is located in that state. <em>See Forensic Advisors, Inc. v. Matrixx Initiatives, Inc., </em>170 Md.App. 520, 525, 907 A.2d 855, 857 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Securing medical records of an adverse party requires observance of one of a variety of additional protocols as provided by Section 4-306 of the Health-General Article of the Maryland Code, four of which are relevant.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> First, the party requesting the records may submit written assurance to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>health care provider that \u201ca person in interest has not objected to the disclosure of the designated medical records within 30 days after the notice [that medical records had been requested] was sent\u201d to the patient.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Section 4-306(b)(6)(i)(1)(B). In the event that there had been an objection to disclosure of the health care records, the party seeking disclosure could provide written certification to the health care provider that the objection had been resolved and that the new request complies with the terms of the resolution to the objection. Section 4-306(b)(6)(i)(l)(C). The health care service provider also could be afforded proof that the court in which the litigation is pending has waived service of a subpoena for the production of documents to the provider for good cause. Section 4\u2014306(b)(6)(i)(2). The fourth possibility is to submit to the health care provider a copy of a court order expressly authorizing disclosure of the designated medical records. Section 4-306(b)(6)(i)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Maryland Rule 2-431 also creates a \u201ccertificate requirement\u201d that is a prerequisite to the trial court\u2019s resolution of a discovery dispute. The Rule provides that a court need not consider a discovery dispute, \u201cunless the attorney seeking action by the court has filed a certificate describing the good faith attempts\u201d to resolve the dispute with opposing counsel. The attorney must certify that he or she had been unable to reach an agreement with the opposition on the disputed issues and must \u201cinclude the date, time, and circumstances of each discussion or attempted discussion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In <em>Rodriguez v. Clarke, </em>400 Md. 39, 63, 926 A.2d 736, 750 (2007), we examined the history and purpose of the \u201ccertificate requirement\u201d contained in Maryland Rule 2-431 and emphasized that making \u201csincere attempts\u201d to resolve discovery disputes is \u201cintegral to the entire discovery process\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">The import of Maryland Rule 2-431\u2019s good faith requirement is highlighted by its history. Its language derives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>from former Rule 417(g), \u201cDiscovery by Interrogatories to Party ... Gen\u2019l,\u201d which provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-4\">No dispute relating to discovery by way of interrogatory need be heard by the court unless counsel requesting the hearing shall first <em>certify to the court in uniting that after personal consultation and sincere attempts to resolve the differences with opposing counsel, </em>they have been unable to reach agreement on the disputed issues. No such efforts or certification shall be required with respect to any other form of discovery procedure provided for in Chapter 400 of these Rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">Maryland Rule 417(g) (adopted Dec. 17, 1975; effective Jan. 1, 1976) (emphasis added). In 1980, this Court, recognizing that the \u201csincere attempts\u201d provision of Rule 417(g) was integral to the entire discovery process, directed the Rules Committee to relocate the \u201csincere attempts\u201d certificate requirement to Rule 422, \u201cFailure to Make Discovery-Sanctions,\u201d thereby making it applicable to the entire discovery process and to. require that the certificate also set forth the date, time and place of each attempt. <em>See </em>Minutes of Rules Committee, November 18-19, 1977, and June 20-21,1980. This Court subsequently adopted subsection (d) of Rule 422, providing that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">No dispute relating to discovery need be heard by the court unless counsel requesting the hearing shall first certify to the court in writing that after personal consultation and sincere attempts to resolve the differences with opposing counsel they have been unable to reach agreement on the disputed issues. This statement shall recite, in addition, the date, time, and place of each consultation, and the names of all persons participating therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN4\">Maryland Rule 422(d) (adopted Oct. 1, 1980: effective Jan. 1,1981).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">During the revisory process of the Maryland Rules undertaken in the early 1980\u2019s, the subcommittee tasked with recodifying Chapter 400 of the Maryland Rules submitted numerous revisions of Rule 422, the first of which modified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the \u201cpersonal consultation\u201d and \u201csincere attempts\u201d language and provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">No dispute pertaining to discovery need be considered by the court unless counsel seeking action by the court shall first file a certificate describing the <em>good faith attempts to communicate with opposing counsel for the purpose of resolving </em>the dispute and certifying that they are unable to reach agreement on the disputed issues. The certificate shall include the date, time, and place of each <em>attempt to communicate </em>with opposing counsel and of each communication with opposing counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">Maryland Rules Committee, Notes of Style Subcommittee (Nov. 3, 1981) (emphasis added). The rule was later modified so that the \u201cgood faith attempts to <em>communicate </em>\u201d became a requirement to make \u201cgood faith attempts to <em>discuss,\u201d </em>and \u201cthe date, time and place of each <em>attempt to communicate </em>\u201d was changed to require the setting forth \u201cthe date, time and circumstances of each <em>discussion or attempted discussion.\u201d </em>Maryland Rules Committee, Notes of Style Subcommittee (April 28, 1983). This Court adopted the Committee\u2019s second draft recommendations on April 6, 1984, and the new Rule 2-431 became effective July 1, 1984.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 63-65, 926 A.2d at 750-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Discovery disputes arise, generally, when parties cannot agree upon the propriety of a particular disclosure, request or response; although ignoring discovery requests altogether also generates issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">Two general sorts of discovery disputes arise in the pretrial discovery process. The first is when discovery has been requested and the opponent responds but refuses to provide discovery at all or to the extent requested. Often, such a dispute stems from a good faith difference of opinion as to whether the requested discovery is appropriate. The second situation, lamentably, is when the party from whom discovery has been sought has simply ignored the discovery request or intentionally refused even to respond to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>John A.

In seven of the eleven cases, Judge Doory found that Respondent had filed frivolous motions with the various courts to enforce the invalid subpoenas, listed in Appendix 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In fourteen cases, Judge Doory found that Respondent had filed various different frivolous motions, some to compel, some for sanctions or some seeking contempt, directed to non-party witnesses emanating from his issuance of subpoenas that lacked proof of service or intentionally did not provide sufficient time for production of documents, listed in Appendix 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>In fifteen cases, according to the findings of fact, Mixter had also made false certifications to the various courts asserting that he had engaged in good faith efforts to resolve discovery-disputes, listed in Appendix 6. Judge Doory found that, in eight of those fifteen cases, Mixter had made misrepresentations to the courts by omitting material information from his motions, listed in Appendix 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">We recount below, for each of the categories of Judge Doory\u2019s findings, representative examples within the category.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The complete lists of Judge Doory\u2019s findings are included in the appendices attached to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">II. Judge Doory\u2019s Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In the first category of findings, entitled \u201cFrivolous Motions Directed at Witnesses\u201d, Judge Doory found that sixty-two separate motions to compel or hold in contempt, listed in Appendix 2, filed by Respondent and directed at non-party witnesses, were frivolous, because the underlying subpoenas that had commanded the appearance of the non-party witness and the production of documents were unenforceable. Judge Doory determined that the subpoenas were invalid, because \u201cthere was either no proof of service of the subpoena, or ... it did not provide the witness the requisite 30 days to produce documents as required by Maryland Rule 2-412(c)\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">The Court finds that each of the 62 motions in which the Respondent alleged that a witness had been properly served with a valid subpoena constitutes a misrepresentation to the court. The Respondent\u2019s pattern of practice in these cases is clear: in an attempt to mislead the Court, rather than represent the actual date of service, each of his motions states the witness in question was served \u201con or about\u201d the date the subpoena was <em>issued, </em>not served.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">The Respondent knowingly, intentionally and/or recklessly attached to the motions false evidence that the witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>had been properly served in an attempt to mislead the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">One of Judge Doory\u2019s findings in his first category was that Mixter had misrepresented to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, in a case entitled <em>Byme-Egan, </em>the date of service of a subpoena on Dr. Stephen Rosenbaum, as well as that the subpoena had been accompanied by a 80-day assurance letter. Mixter had represented in his \u201cMotion to Compel the Custodian of Records of Stephen Rosenbaum, M.D.\u201d, that the witness was served \u201con or about August 25, 2011\u201d as well as \u201cthat on September 26, 2011, the 30-day assurance letter was sent.\u201d Judge Doory found that, in fact, there had not been proper proof of service presented in the record and that the 30-day assurance letter authorizing the release of the records under Section 4-306(b)(6)(i)(l) of the Health-General Article of the Maryland Code had been sent on the same day the motion to compel was filed; therefore, the Motion, Judge Doory found, was frivolous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">Another example is found in the Motion to Compel the Custodian of Records of Stephen Rosenbaum, M.D. filed in <em>Byme-Egan. </em>To support his misrepresentation that the witness was served \u201con or about August 25, 2011\u201d the Respondent attached to his motion a signed return receipt green card.[<footnotemark>42</footnotemark>] The green card is clearly from something else as it was dated August 16, 2011, more than a week before the relevant subpoena was issued. The Respondent additionally claims that on September 26, 2011, the 30-day assurance letter was sent. Conspicuously, the Motion was filed on the same day\u2014September 26, 2011\u2014before the witness could have received the 30 day letter and could legally release the records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Judge Doory found that, \u201cOn occasion, the Respondent was successful in misleading the court and the requested relief was granted\u201d, as in <em>Keener, </em>in which a judge with the Circuit Court for Charles County had granted an order compelling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>the production of documents based upon Mixter\u2019s misrepresentation that he had properly served a subpoena on Civista Medical Center for the production of documents, along -with a 30-day assurance letter. Respondent, then, according to Judge Doory, had mailed a copy of the order to Civista and threatened to hold Civista in contempt if it failed to produce the requested documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">On November 16, 2009, the Respondent in <em>Keener, </em>filed a motion to compel the production of documents from various custodians of records, including Civista Medical Center (hereinafter Civista). In the motion, the Respondent misrepresented to the court that Civista had been properly served with a subpoena for medical records. The subpoena, issued on September 21, 2009, was defective on its face as it required production on October 19, 2009. The subpoena was served on September 22, 2009. On October 22, 2009, the Respondent sent a 30-day assurance letter and three weeks later filed the frivolous motion without any further attempts to resolve the \u201cdiscovery dispute\u201d. No doubt in reliance on the Respondent\u2019s misrepresentations that a valid subpoena was properly served and good faith efforts were made to resolve the discovery dispute prior to the filing of the motion, on March 11, 2010 an order compelling Civista to produce the requested documents was entered. On April 12, 2010, the Respondent mailed a copy of the order to Civista demanding the records be produced within five (5) business days and threatening further court intervention. On May 27, 2010, the Respondent filed a Motion to Hold Civista in Contempt and a show cause order was issued. On June 17, 2010, the Respondent withdrew the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">In the second category, Frivolous Motions Directed at Out-of-State Witnesses, Judge Doory found that Mixter would \u201cknowingly or recklessly, and in complete disregard for the Maryland Rules\u201d issue \u201cMaryland subpoenas to out-of-state witnesses over whom the Maryland courts have no jurisdiction and then filed frivolous motions to compel compliance with same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Judge Doory determined that twenty-four motions filed by Mixter, directed at out-of-state witnesses, listed in Appendix 3, were frivolous, \u201cbecause the court in which they were filed had no jurisdiction over the non-party witness and their failure to comply with a Maryland subpoena, as such, the grounds for each of the motions was without merit\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">The Respondent testified that on occasion he would mistakenly issue a Maryland subpoena to an out-of-state witness. The Court finds the Respondent\u2019s testimony not to be credible and finds that the Respondent, knowingly or recklessly, and in complete disregard for the Maryland Rules and directives from the court, issued Maryland subpoenas to out-of-state witnesses over whom the Maryland courts have no jurisdiction and then filed frivolous motions to compel compliance with same. The Court finds that the twenty-four (24) motions, identified in the attached Appendix Three (3), ... were frivolous because the court in which they were filed had no jurisdiction over the non-party witness and their failure to comply with a Maryland subpoena, as such, the grounds for each of the motions was without merit. Additionally, the Court finds the Respondent\u2019s failure to include the location of the out-of-state witnesses in the body of each Motion to be intentionally and knowingly misleading.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Judge Doory singled out Respondent\u2019s actions in <em>Mixter, </em>a defamation case Mixter had filed against attorneys who had filed complaints against him with the Attorney Grievance Commission, as contradicting Respondent\u2019s assertion that Maryland subpoenas had been issued to out-of-state witnesses only by mistake. Judge Doory observed that a subpoena Mixter had issued to Dr. Michael Conte in Arizona for service in that state had been returned as unserved, and found that, after the subpoena was returned, Mixter mailed the subpoena again to Dr. Conte on the same day he filed a motion to compel Dr. Conte\u2019s appearance in Maryland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">The subpoena directed to Michael Conte, Ph.D. by the Respondent in the <em>Mixter </em>case and the motions that follow belie the Respondent\u2019s testimony that Maryland subpoenas were issued to out-of-state witnesses only on occasion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>only by mistake. On March 6, 2012, the Respondent issued a subpoena from the Circuit Court for Baltimore County to Dr. Conte, located in Phoenix, Arizona. He attempted to serve the subpoena by first class mail, return receipt, restricted delivery. The subpoena directed Dr. Conte to personally appear. On April 18, 2012, the Respondent filed a Motion to Compel, misrepresenting to the court that Dr. Conte had been served on March 6, 2012. No proof of service as to Dr. Conte was attached to the Motion. The documents attached to Dr. Conte\u2019s opposition reveal the truth: On March 8, 2012, the certified mail directed to Dr. Conte was returned to the Respondent. On April 18, 2012, after the date of the deposition had come and gone, the Respondent put the returned certified mail into a new envelope and mailed the new envelope, by first class mail only, to Dr. Conte who received the mail on April 20, 2012. Also on April 18, 2012, the Respondent filed his Motion to Compel, knowing that Dr. Conte had, as of that date, not received any subpoena. In his opposition, Dr. Conte, through counsel, raised various deficiencies with the subpoena including, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Respondent issued a Baltimore City subpoena to an Arizona resident. The Respondent, rather than acknowledge the error and withdraw his motion, filed a Reply in which he repeated his misrepresentation that Dr. Conte had been served on March 6, 2012 and advanced the impractical arguments that Maryland Rule 2-418 provides the Circuit Court for Baltimore City \u201cthe power to compel an out-of-state witness\u2019 attendance at a deposition in Maryland\u201d and that somehow Dr. Conte is required to produce the requested documents. Dr. Conte filed a Supplemental Memorandum in Support of his Response to the Motion to Compel requesting attorney\u2019s fees to which the Respondent filed a Response in which he again misrepresented to the court that Dr. Conte had been served on March 6, 2012 and advanced another frivolous argument: That Dr. Conte is subject to the jurisdiction of the court because he \u201cpreviously lived and worked in the State of Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>In the third category, Judge Doory found that Respondent had issued Maryland subpoenas, commanding the witnesses\u2019 appearance and production of documents, to thirty-five additional out-of-state witnesses, listed in Appendix 4, coupled with letters containing knowing and intentional misrepresentations to the witnesses that their appearance could be compelled in Maryland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">In addition to the Maryland subpoenas issued to out-of-state witnesses underlying each of the frivolous motions itemized on Appendix Three (3), the Court finds that the Respondent, in violation of the Maryland Rules issued Maryland subpoenas to the thirty-five (35) out-of-state witnesses identified on the attached Appendix Four (4) which is incorporated by reference herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">Each of the subpoenas directed to an out-of-state witness included a cover letter from the Respondent which provided: \u201cEnclosed please find a notice of deposition and subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>which is being served upon you via certified mail. If you would please forward copies of all documents requested by the date of the deposition it will not be necessary for you to testify or appear.\u201d The Court finds the Respondent knowingly and intentionally misrepresented to the non-party witnesses, most, if not all of whom were non-attorneys, that they could be compelled to appear in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Some of the out-of-state witnesses, whom Judge Doory identified as having received subpoenas requesting their personal appearance and the production of documents that were improperly issued from Maryland courts, included: Bartley J. Eckhardt, P.E., of Robson Forensic, located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Amgolf, Inc., located in Fairfax, Virginia; the Hope for Life Wellness Center, Inc., located in Miami, Florida; Thomas F. Grogan, C.F.E., of Victoria Business Center, located in Springfield, Pennsylvania; and Dr. Stephen Silibiger, located in Pawleys Island, South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Judge Doory also found that Mixter, in his own case, had issued a subpoena to the Custodian of Records of Trial Smith, Inc., located in Austin, Texas, for the production of documents. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Judge Doory noted that Mixter had accompanied the subpoena with an unsigned Commission to Take Foreign Deposition, which was a misrepresentation that he had requested and obtained such a commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">Accompanying the Maryland subpoena issued to TrialSmith, Inc., located in Austin, Texas, the Respondent provided an unsigned \u201cCommission to Take Foreign Deposition.\u201d As of April 25, 2012, the docket entries reveal that no request for commission had been made and none granted. The Court finds the Respondent serving an unexecuted Commission to Take Foreign Deposition on an out-of-state witness was knowingly and intentionally deceitful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In the fourth category, entitled \u201cSubpoenas Issued in Violation of Rule 2-418\u201d, Judge Doory found that \u201cRespondent had a pattern and practice of knowingly and intentionally noting depositions in the wrong venue in violation of Maryland Rule 2-413\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Mixter, according to the findings of fact, would subpoena non-party, fact witnesses for depositions and production of documents at his office in Baltimore City, when the witnesses were located outside of Baltimore City and the cases were not pending in Baltimore City:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">(1) Subpoenas issued to a fact witness located in Silver Spring and Laurel compelling their appearance at Respondent\u2019s office in Baltimore City where the case was pending in Montgomery County. (2) Subpoena issued to the plaintiff and fact witnesses located in Prince George\u2019s County compelling their appearance at Respondent\u2019s office in Baltimore City where their case was pending in Prince George\u2019s County. (3) Subpoenas issued to witnesses located in Baltimore County, compelling appearance at the Respondent\u2019s office in Baltimore City. (4) Subpoenas issued to fact witnesses located in Montgomery County, compelling their appearance at the Respondent\u2019s office in Baltimore City. (5) Subpoena issued to the Custodian of Records of Maryland Association for Justice, located in Howard County compelling its appearance at the Respondent\u2019s Office in Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>City. (6) Subpoena issued to opposing counsel located in Washington County compelling his appearance at the Respondent\u2019s office in Baltimore City where the case at issue was pending in Washington County. (7) Subpoena to an elderly fact witness who resided in Kent County to appear for deposition in the Respondent\u2019s office in Baltimore City where the case was pending in Baltimore County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\">In the instances where the venue was challenged by opposing counsel, the Respondent rather than withdraw the subpoenas and note them in the appropriate venue, clung to his position and threatened sanctions or court intervention if the deponent failed to appear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In the section entitled \u201cAdditional Abuses of Subpoena Power\u201d, Judge Doory identified episodes in <em>Mixter, Alemu </em>and <em>Railey </em>as examples in which Respondent abused his authority as an officer of the court by issuing subpoenas in order to harass and intimidate witnesses and opposing counsel. Judge Doory found that Mixter, in his own case, had issued subpoenas to ten witnesses, compelling appearance and the production of documents, without having provided sufficient time for such production, simply to harass the recipients:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjA\">In the <em>Mixter </em>case, the Respondent issued numerous subpoenas aimed solely at harassing witnesses (most of whom were Respondent\u2019s opposing counsel in other non-related cases) and the defendant\u2019s. On March 6, 2012, the Respondent issued subpoenas to nine \u201ccustodians of records\u201d for attorneys and one doctor: Irwin E. Weiss, Esquire, Daniel Sussman, Esquire, John Kazmierczak, Esquire, Steven Shechtel, Esquire, Howard Simcox, Esquire, Lee J. Eidleberg, Esquire, Henry Greenberg, Esquire, Stephen A. Markey, III, Esquire, Michael Conte, M.D. The subpoenas directed the witnesses to \u201cappear and produce all documents or other forms of communications, including electronic either received from or forwarded to James Farmer or James E. Farmer, P.A. or Charles Bowie or Alison Heurich or Charles E. Farmer regarding Mark T. Mixter at any time whatsoever.\u201d Despite the fact that subpoenas issued from the Circuit Court for Baltimore City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>have an option to allow the witnesses to \u201cproduce documents and or objects only\u201d, the Respondent instructed the witnesses to \u201cpersonally appear and produce documents or objects.\u201d The subpoenas were accompanied by a cover letter that provided: \u201cIf you would please forward copies of all documents requested by the date of the deposition it will not be necessary for you to testify or appear. Please not that we are not authorizing the use of a record copy service. Additionally, we will not pay for any such services without written approval.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">All of the subpoenas were issued on March 6, 2012 and required appearance on April 6, 2012. None of the subpoenas were timely served to allow the witnesses the requisite 30 days to produce documents. Many of the nine witnesses filed, or retained counsel to file motions to quash and/or limit the subpoenas, all of which were granted by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In Mixter\u2019s own case, Judge Doory recounted, among others, the events surrounding the subpoena directed to an attorney named Daniel Sussman, one of the witnesses in the suit. Mr. Sussman had filed a motion to quash Mixter\u2019s deposition subpoena and production of documents. Judge Doory found that Mixter had misrepresented in his response to the motion the date upon which Mr. Sussman had been served, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">Mr. Sussman, upon receipt of the deficient subpoena, wrote to the Respondent. By letter dated March 12, 2012, Mr. Sussman stated that he had \u201csearched the file of Daniel L. Sussman and there are no records relevant to this matter.\u201d Mr. Sussman further informed the Respondent that he would not be appearing on the date of deposition. On April 22, 2012, Mr. Sussman was served with a subpoena compelling his appearance at deposition on May 3, 2012 and directing him to produce documents. On May 1, 2012, Mr. Sussman, through counsel, filed a Motion to Quash. In response, the Respondent filed a response to Mr. Sussman\u2019s motion, a motion to compel Mr. Sussman\u2019s appearance at deposition, and a reply to Mr. Sussman\u2019s response thereto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>in which he misrepresented, among other things, the date that Mr. Sussman was served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Finally, Judge Doory observed that Mixter also had subpoenaed the driving record of James Farmer, a <em>Mixter </em>defendant, and, in response to Mr. Farmer\u2019s motion for a protective order as to his driving record, Mixter asserted \u201ca multitude of disingenuous arguments\u201d, including \u201cthat the driving record may reveal impeachable evidence including criminal convictions for driving-related offenses and alcohol related charges or problems that \u2018may form the basis for evidence of habit/routine practice under Maryland Rule 5-406\u2019 or \u2018a common pattern of ongoing alcohol-related problems and/or alcohol-related criminal convictions.\u2019 \u201d The Circuit Court for Baltimore City granted a protective order on the basis that Mr. Farmer\u2019s \u201cdriving record had absolutely nothing to do with the pending claim for defamation and that the subpoena was aimed solely at harassing the defendant\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">On June 14, 2012, the Respondent issued a subpoena and notice of deposition to the Custodian of Records for the Motor Vehicle Administration requesting \u201cthe entire driving record, including but not limited to any and all records, including, but not limited to, license tag applications and associated records, registration applications and associated records, driving records, handicapped tag applications and associated records, and any other records regarding James Farmer ... from the date of issue of any driver\u2019s license.\u201d Mr. Farmer, through counsel, filed a motion for protective order on the basis that Mr. Farmer\u2019s driving record had absolutely nothing to do with the pending claim for defamation and that the subpoena was aimed solely at harassing the defendant. In response, the Respondent pursued a multitude of disingenuous arguments: that the driving record may reveal impeachable evidence including criminal convictions for driving-related offenses and alcohol related charges or problems that \u201cmay form the basis for evidence of habit/routine practice under Maryland Rule 5-406\u201d or \u201ca common pattern of ongoing alcohol-related problems and/or alcohol-related criminal convictions.\u201d By Order dated Au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>gust 7, 2012, Mr. Farmer\u2019s Motion for Protective Order was granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Judge Doory found that Respondent also had misused subpoenas in <em>Railey </em>by attempting to compel the defendants\u2019 attorney to produce documents unrelated to the litigation at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">In <em>Railey </em>the Respondent propounded written discovery on the defendants and requested production of documents related to other civil matters in which the defendants had been involved. The unrelated matters involved garnishment of wages of some of the defendant\u2019s employees and did not implicate the defendant in any fault in those matters whatsoever. Counsel for the defendants invited the Respondent to defense counsel\u2019s office to review all of the files requested. Despite the offer, the Respondent issued a notice of deposition to defense counsel to appear in Baltimore City for deposition. The defendants were forced to file a motion for protective order and the court found, \u201c[o]f course it is improper to compel a deposition of a party\u2019s counsel, especially in another county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Finally, in <em>Alemu, </em>Judge Doory found that Mixter had abused the subpoena authority by attempting to secure the exhibits from Mixter\u2019s client\u2019s deposition, for which he was sanctioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">In <em>Alemu, </em>the Respondent issued a Maryland subpoena to the custodian of records of his opposing counsel located in the District of Columbia. The subpoena requested the custodian appear for a deposition and produce the exhibits from the Respondent\u2019s client\u2019s deposition. Plaintiffs counsel filed a Motion for Protective Order and requested sanctions. A hearing was held on March 8, 2010 during which the court found the Respondent abused his authority to issue subpoenas and issued sanctions in the amount of $250. The Respondent refused to pay the sanctions ordered and as a result, the Plaintiff filed a Motion for Sanctions. In response to the Motion, the Respondent argued that he \u201cintends to appeal\u201d the order issuing sanctions in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>amount of $250. An order was negotiated whereby the Respondent paid the $250 but did not waive his right to appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Judge Doory, in the section of his findings of fact entitled \u201cFrivolous Motions Directed at Opposing Party\u201d, found forty-two instances, listed in Appendix 5, in which Mixter had filed frivolous motions, \u201cbecause the Respondent either failed to make any good faith efforts to resolve the discovery disputes or the filings were filed prematurely or otherwise do not comply with the Maryland Rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Judge Doory put forth one example of Mixter having filed frivolous motions to compel and for sanctions directed at the opposing party in <em>Koontz. </em>Judge Doory noted that Respondent had propounded discovery on the <em>Koontz </em>plaintiffs for their medical and financial information, for which the plaintiffs had requested that Mixter agree to a confidentiality agreement in order to limit disclosure. Mixter, according to Judge Doory, moved to compel production of the medical and financial information, rather than enter into a confidentiality agreement. Judge Doory found that a judge in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County denied Mixter\u2019s motion but ordered that the plaintiffs provide the requested discovery, once a confidentiality agreement was executed. Mixter then, according to Judge Doory, moved for the circuit court to reconsider its denial of his motion to compel; then, before the circuit court had ruled on the motion, he executed a confidentiality agreement and demanded production of the medical and financial information from the plaintiffs within five days. Judge Doory found that, once the five days had elapsed, Respondent filed a motion to dismiss and/or for sanctions based upon the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to provide their medical and financial information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">The Respondent propounded discovery on the Plaintiffs, the discovery requested sensitive medical and financial information. The Plaintiffs asked the Respondent to enter into a confidentiality agreement which would not in any way preclude his receipt of discoverable information but rather limit the disclosure or redisclosure of sensitive information. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Respondent refused to enter into a confidentiality agreement and the Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Protective Order on August 11, 2009. On August 25, 2009, the Respondent filed a motion to compel discovery. By Order entered September 18, 2009, the court denied the Respondent\u2019s motion to compel and ordered that the Plaintiffs \u201cshall provide the requested discovery upon execution of an appropriate protective order to maintain confidentiality of medical and financial records.\u201d On September 28, 2009, the Respondent filed a motion for reconsideration of the order. On October 8, 2009, the Respondent forwarded an executed Stipulation regarding confidentiality to the Plaintiffs and demanded that the outstanding discovery be provided \u201cwithin 5 business days.\u201d Less than two weeks later, the instant motion [to dismiss and/or for sanctions for Plaintiffs\u2019 complete failure to provide discovery] was filed. In addition to being filed prematurely, without allowing the Plaintiffs time to produce the requested information, the motion was filed without any good faith efforts to resolve the discovery dispute and the relief sought, dismissal and sanctions, is not contemplated under the Maryland Rules. Where there has been a response to discovery, albeit incomplete, the only remedy is a motion for an order compelling discovery. <em>See </em>Rule 2-482. In the Motion, the Respondent states that the Plaintiffs \u201crefuse to produce the discovery.\u201d There is no evidence that, once the confidentiality agreement was signed, the Plaintiffs refused to produce the information and documentation requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">In the \u201cFalse Certifications\u201d Section, Judge Doory found fifty-three instances in which \u201cthe Respondent falsely certified to the court that good faith efforts to resolve discovery disputes had been made,\u201d listed in Appendix 6. According to Judge Doory, Mixter\u2019s certifications contained misrepresentations which were intended to mislead the courts into believing that he had engaged in good faith attempts to resolve discovery disputes; in fact, the exhibits Mixter had attached to the certificates were the original letters accompanying the subpoenas sent before any discovery dispute could have existed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>In each motion, in an attempt to mislead the court, the Respondent refers the court to attached exhibits \u201cevidencing\u201d his attempts to resolve the alleged discovery dispute. The exhibits attached to the motion are all the original cover letters accompanying the subpoena and/or the 30-day assurance letters, both of which were sent before any \u201cdiscovery dispute\u201d could have existed. The Court finds that the Respondent knowingly and intentionally falsely certified that he had complied with Rule 2-431. The Respondent testified at trial that in addition to the cover letters being sent, a phone call was always made in an attempt to resolve the discovery dispute before any motion was filed. No documentation was provided to support this claim and the Court finds the Respondent\u2019s testimony not credible. Rule 2-431 specifically states that the certificate <em>\u201cshall </em>include the date, time, and circumstances of <em>each </em>discussion or attempted discussion.\u201d (emphasis added). The Respondent failed to produce any evidence of the alleged phone calls: he did not offer any telephone message slips, memorandum to the file or phone records evidencing any of the purported phone calls that were \u201calways\u201d made prior to filing a motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">In the Section entitled \u201cMisrepresentations by Omission\u201d, Judge Doory observed that Mixter had intentionally omitted from the twelve motions listed in Appendix 7 responses from the adverse parties or the witnesses, in an attempt to advance his position. In the Maryland Rule 2-431 certificates, for example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">As discussed above, Rule 2-431 requires the Respondent to provide the date, time and circumstances of each discussion or attempted discussion had in an effort to resolve a discovery dispute prior to filing a motion. The Respondent routinely omitted correspondence from the other party or the witnesses related to the discovery dispute from his [Rule 2-431] certificate. The Court finds that the Respondent\u2019s omission of material evidence was intentional and in an effort to advance his position. Each of the motions filed by the Respondent and itemized on the attached Appendix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Seven (7), constitutes a misrepresentation by omission to the court as the Respondent knowingly and intentionally failed to include correspondence relating to the discovery dispute to the court for consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In the ninth category of his findings of fact, entitled \u201cMisrepresentations and Disregard for Court Orders and Directives\u201d, Judge Doory found that in the <em>Alemu, Byme-Egan, Canby, Ch\u00edneme, Davis, Fuselier, Green, Johnson, Keener, Koontz, Mixter, Pearson </em>and <em>Presbury </em>cases that Mixter had, in bad faith and without substantial justification, knowingly and intentionally made misrepresentations as to the contents of court orders or had disregarded court orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In <em>Byme-Egan, </em>Judge Doory found that Mixter had knowingly and intentionally misrepresented to White Marsh Psychiatric Associates that no objection had been made to his subpoena for the third-party defendant\u2019s mental health records and failed to provide the protective order that had been entered related to those same records:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">On December 2, 2011, the Respondent filed a Motion to Compel directed at the third-party defendant/counter-plaintiff in <em>Byme-Egan </em>based on her failure to provide answers to interrogatories and responses to requests for production of documents. On December 19, 2011, the third-party defendant filed a response to the motion stating: \u201cThis case was removed to Federal Court by Empire after it filed a Third Party Complaint against Seay in State Court and she filed a counterclaim. Seay avers that this court has no jurisdiction in this matter and she has filed a Motion to Remand to State Court which has yet to be ruled upon. In any event, Seay intends to respond to Empire\u2019s discovery requests within ten days.\u201d On December 20, 2011, the Respondent wrote a letter to the Honorable J. Frederick Motz and stated, \u201cThe defendant\u2019s motion to compel discovery from the plaintiff ... was filed on December 2, 2011. A response was filed yesterday and admits to the plaintiffs failure to timely answer my client\u2019s discovery requests. Therefore, please provide counsel with a ruling on that motion at your earliest convenience.\u201d The court finds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the Respondent knowingly and intentionally mischaracterized and misrepresented the content of the opposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">On February 21, 2012, Ms. Seay sought a protective order to prevent the Respondent from obtaining her psychiatric records. On May 5, 2012, the Respondent filed his opposition. On May 16, 2012, the Respondent sent a letter to White Marsh Psychiatric Associates, knowingly and intentionally misrepresenting that no objection had been made to the subpoena issued and requested Ms. Seay\u2019s mental health records be provided. On May 18, 2012, Judge C. Philip Nichols, Jr., granted Ms. Seay\u2019s motion and ordered that her psychological or mental health records, if any, are not to be produced. In complete disregard for Judge Nichols\u2019 order, on July 13, 2012, the Respondent filed a motion to compel White Marsh Psychiatric Associates to produce Ms. Seay\u2019s treatment records. Despite withdrawing the motion to compel, Judge Nichols entered a Show Cause Order for Contempt directed at the Respondent. In response, the Respondent knowingly and purposefully skewed the facts of the case and his actions. While he admits that the subpoena directed to White Marsh was issued on April 16, 2012 before the protective order was granted, he omits from his response that the motion for a protective order was filed on February 21, 2012, and that while it was pending he knowingly and intentionally misrepresented to White Marsh on May 16, 2012 that no objection to the subpoena had been made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In <em>Ch\u00edneme, </em>Judge Doory found that Mixter had facilitated the alteration and destruction of important evidence by his client. Judge Doory explained that when Mixter represented the defendant landlord in a mold case, the plaintiffs expert had attempted to inspect the premises, but Mixter blocked the expert from doing so. The plaintiff, according to Judge Doory, then filed a motion to compel, which was granted by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, providing that the plaintiffs expert was to be allowed on the premises to conduct his testing. Judge Doory found, however, that, when the expert returned to the property, the items the expert had previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>intended to sample had been removed, thereby thwarting any testing, for which Judge Doory found that Mixter had facilitated his client\u2019s alteration and destruction of evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\">In <em>Ch\u00edneme, </em>the Respondent represented the defendant, landlord Ch\u00edneme in a mold case. The Plaintiff hired an expert, Robert K. Simon, Ph.D., an industrial hygienist-chemist to inspect the property on January 8, 2008. There was prior bad history between Respondent and Dr. Simon based on experience in <em>Garnett.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">Prior to January 8, 2008, the third scheduled attempt to inspect the property, Dr. Simon received a subpoena to be deposed on January 7, 2008. Respondent claims it was only a records deposition but it still predates Dr. Simon\u2019s inspection, the commencement of his participation in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">Dr. Simon went to 3706 Hillsdale Ave. and met plaintiff Shaneise Smith, Respondent and the Defendant on January 8, 2008. Dr. Simon testified that Respondent impaired his ability to inspect the property. Respondent allowed Dr. Simon to photograph some areas, take air samples and to do swipe testing. He did not allow access to the basement door area. Respondent did not allow Dr. Simon to do any \u201cdestructive testing.\u201d Dr. Simon, in his expert opinion, felt it necessary to take carpet samples under a formerly leaking radiator; to take a section of wallboard inside a closet; to take a two-inch by two-inch section of water damaged 1950\u2019s knotty pine paneling in the basement. Respondent testified that he was not at liberty to allow Dr. Simon to \u201ctear apart\u201d the property for testing. Respondent, in his experience felt this testing was unnecessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">Later in the day on January 8, 2008, Plaintiffs attorney Gary F. Stern filed a motion to compel to allow Dr. Simon access to do this testing. He argues that the requested inspection, testing and sampling of said property would not be burdensome to the Defendant, intrusive or outside the ambit contemplated by the rules of discovery and Plaintiff would be prejudiced in presenting their case without the expert\u2019s report. Further Stern argues that any delay in allowing Plaintiffs expert to gather samples for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>of testing would allow the Defendant to alter, destroy or otherwise conceal critical evidence in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\">On January 28, 2008, Respondent filed a response. In his response, Respondent offers: \u201cThe Plaintiff also argues that delaying this process will prejudice the plaintiffs case by allowing the defendant to alter, destroy or otherwise conceal critical evidence. That argument is rather disingenuous given that the plaintiff has not resided at the defendant\u2019s premises for almost two years, and knew that she was going to assert this claim when she resided there or shortly thereafter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">After a great amount of wrangling over the setting of depositions and sharing of discovery documents; after Dr. Simon hired his own attorney, Steve Stine, Esq., to represent him in dealings with Respondent, on June 23, 2008, the Court granted a Motion to Compel Entry Upon the Premises. In June of 2008, Dr. Simon returned to the property to find that the carpet had been replaced and the knotty pine paneling had been replaced by painted wallboard. Dr. Simon\u2019s inspection had been thwarted. Respondent testified that at no time did he authorize his client to make alterations. It should be noted that this client was not called to testify and no evidence was presented to support the contention that the alterations were part of a beautification plan by the landlord on his own initiative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">The case dragged on through a series of embattled depositions. It was settled in November of 2008. In late December Dr. Simon was still hoping to be paid by Respondent for his depositions after a prolonged fee dispute. The Court finds the testimony of Dr. Simon on these points to be more credible than the testimony of the Respondent. The Court finds that without legitimate justification, Respondent facilitated his client in the alteration and destruction of important evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Judge Doory found that Mixter had also made a knowing misrepresentation to the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Keener. </em>Judge Doory observed that the Circuit Court for Charles County, after a hearing, had found Mixter in contempt for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>failure to comply with a previous court order. After a subsequent hearing, Judge Doory continued, the Circuit Court had awarded attorney\u2019s fees to Mixter\u2019s opposition. According to Judge Doory, Mixter appealed both of the Circuit Court\u2019s orders to the Court of Special Appeals, asserting that the rulings had been made without a hearing. When apprised of this misrepresentation, Judge Doory found that Mixter had filed an errata sheet alleging that the misrepresentation was a \u201ctypographical error\u201d; Judge Doory found that the error was not \u201ctypographical\u201d, because it provided the basis for an argument and, therefore, the errata sheet was itself a misrepresentation to the Court of Special Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">In <em>Keener, </em>the Plaintiff filed a motion to compel based on the Respondent\u2019s failure to adequately respond to requests for production of documents. Over the Respondent\u2019s opposition, the court ordered the Respondent to produce \u201call documents requested by the Plaintiff, less those to which a claim of privilege is attached, at 3:00 p.m. on December 14, 2010 or 9:00 a.m. on December 16, 2010 at the offices of counsel for the Plaintiff.\u201d On December 15, 2010, the Respondent, in defiance of the court order, asserted that by tendering medical records obtained through records depositions over the past year, he did not need to produce any documents. The Plaintiff filed a Motion for Finding of Contempt and on January 20, 2011, the court issued a show cause order directed at the Respondent. After being fully briefed, a hearing was held on March 22, 2011. Following the hearing, the Honorable Helen Ina Harrington found the Respondent in contempt for failure to comply with the court\u2019s order of December 8, 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">Following the finding of contempt, the Plaintiff requested they be paid their attorneys\u2019 fees for filing the various motions involving the contempt issue. The request was denied. The Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the request for attorneys\u2019 fees and, on November 20, 2011 a hearing was held on the motion for reconsideration. After the hearing, the court awarded attorney\u2019s fees against the Respondent personally in the amount of $3,287.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>The Respondent appealed both the finding of contempt and the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the Court of Special Appeals. In his brief he stated: \u201c[o]n March 22, 2011, without a hearing, the Circuit Court for Charles County granted the Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Contempt, finding that defense counsel was in contempt \u2018for failure to comply with the Court\u2019s Order of December 8, 2010.\u2019 \u201d The statement was a misrepresentation. The Respondent repeated the misrepresentation a second time in his brief, arguing to the Court of Appeals: \u201con March 22, 2011, the Circuit Court for Charles County inexplicably (and without a hearing) granted the Plaintiffs Motion for Contempt, finding the defense counsel was in contempt \u2018for failure to comply with the Court\u2019s Order of December 8, 2010.\u2019 \u201d In support of his argument that an order of contempt was improper the Respondent cited Maryland Rule 15-206(c)(2) which states \u201cUnless the court finds that a petition for contempt is frivolous on its face, the court shall enter an order providing for (i) a prehearing conference, or (ii) a hearing, or (iii) both. The scheduled hearing date shall allow a reasonable time for the preparation of a defense and may not be less than 20 days after the prehearing conference.\u201d The Respondent then argues that \u201cthe trial court erred in failing to set the above-captioned matter in for a hearing on the plaintiffs motion for contempt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">When the Plaintiff brought the misrepresentation to the Court of Special Appeals, the Respondent, rather than withdraw the argument and acknowledge that he had misrepresented the procedural posture of the case to the Court of Special Appeals, filed an errata sheet in which he alleges the misrepresentation on page 10 of his brief was a \u201ctypographical error\u201d. The Court finds that the errata sheet was a misrepresentation to the Court of Special Appeals\u2014the error was not typographical as it provided the basis for an argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In <em>Koontz, </em>Judge Doory observed that Respondent had wrongfully represented to health care providers that the opposing party had not objected to disclosure of their medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>records, in an effort to obtain confidential medical records. The parties in <em>Koontz, </em>according to Judge Doory, had, in fact, stipulated to the entry of a Protective Order to maintain the confidentiality of the plaintiffs\u2019 medical and financial records. Judge Doory found that Mixter violated the Order when he filed a Motion for Sanctions and/or Motion to Compel Supplemental Discovery to which he attached some of the confidential records at issue. Judge Doory noted that Mixter, after the plaintiffs had filed a Motion for Protective Order, issued subpoenas to nineteen of the plaintiffs\u2019 health care providers asserting that the plaintiffs had not objected to the disclosure of their medical information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">At the request of the Plaintiffs in <em>Koontz, </em>the court ordered that, before the Plaintiff was required to produce sensitive financial and medical information to the Respondent, the parties execute \u201can appropriate protective order to maintain confidentiality of medical and financial records. Such order will provide that the information may not be viewed or disclosed except to parties, counsel and their expert witnesses.\u201d On October 8, 2009, the Respondent forwarded an executed Stipulation and Protective Order regarding confidentiality to the Plaintiffs. The Stipulation included, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cany document (including discovery responses and transcripts of testimony) containing confidential or proprietary information shall be stamped with the legend \u201cCONFIDENTIAL\u201d or otherwise identified by the party disclosing such information as confidential information, and the information contained therein shall not be disclosed except as provided in paragraph 3 above.\u201d Paragraph Three (3) provided, that documents marked \u201cConfidential\u201d shall not be disclosed to anyone other than counsel, parties, court reporters and transcribers, expert witnesses and the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">On December 17, 2009, the Respondent filed a Motion for Sanctions and/or Motion to Compel Supplemental Discovery and, in violation of the protective order, attached thereto, the Plaintiffs\u2019 answers to interrogatories that had been marked \u201cConfidential.\u201d On May 12, 2010, the Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>filed an Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion for Protective Order and attached thereto the Plaintiffs medical reports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\">On or about April 21, 2010, the Respondent issued subpoenas to nineteen (19) of Plaintiffs healthcare providers in <em>Koontz. </em>On May 5, 2010, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for protective order to quash and/or limit the subpoenas. On May 21, 2010, while the motion for protective order was pending, the Respondent sent 30-assurance letters to the healthcare providers subject to the motion for protective order. In the letters, the Respondent misrepresented that the Plaintiff had \u201cnot objected to the disclosure of the requested medical records\u201d and asked that the records be forwarded at the earliest convenience. The court finds that the Respondent\u2019s statements to the healthcare providers were intentionally false.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">On July 1, 2010 and July 16, 2010, while the motion for protective order was still pending, the Respondent filed two Motions to Compel directed at records custodians subject to the protective order. The Motion to Compel filed July 16, 2010 was sent to the custodian of records with a cover letter from the Respondent which stated: \u201cEnclosed is a motion to compel discovery which we are filing in the case but which we would withdraw if we receive the records within five days. Furthermore, if you received a letter from opposing counsel (Ober, Kaler, Grimes &amp; Shiver) indicating that there was a protective order issued in this case, it was false. In fact, not only was a protective order not obtained, but none was sought.\u201d The Court finds the Respondent\u2019s statements in the letters of July 16, 2010 were intentionally false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbW\">Judge Doory found that, in <em>Pearson, </em>Respondent had \u201cin bad faith\u201d made \u201can intentional effort to obstruct the defendants\u2019 access to information and to circumvent [a] court order\u201d. According to Judge Doory, a judge of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County had granted an order permitting the defendants to speak with the plaintiffs health care providers without the presence of opposing counsel. Judge Doory found that Mixter, subsequently, wrote letters to the nine health care providers admonishing them not to speak to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>defense attorneys, in an attempt to circumvent the court order and obstruct the defense\u2019s access to evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">In <em>Pearson, </em>the Respondent represented the Plaintiffs, a husband and wife, in a medical malpractice claim. The Defendants sought a court order to allow them to discuss the Plaintiffs healthcare with her healthcare providers, without the presence of opposing counsel. The Defendants listed the nine healthcare providers that they wanted to interview. By Order dated May 18, 2012, the court granted the defendants the relief they sought and ordered \u201cthat the attorneys for the parties to this lawsuit are permitted to engage in <em>ex parte </em>discussions with [the nine healthcare providers identified].\u201d On May 21, 2012, the Respondent wrote to the nine healthcare providers and stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201cPlease be advised that I represent <em>your patient, </em>Gina Pearson in the above-captioned case. This case alleges medical malpractice on the parts of Dr. Lyles and Dr. Barson and their treatment of Ms. Pearson. Today, Judge Geter of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County signed the enclosed order permitting the lawyers representing [the defendants] to contact you directly to discuss your treatment of Ms. Pearson. The order does not compel or mandate that you speak to these lawyers. Furthermore, neither Ms. Pearson or myself wish to have you speak to these lawyers unless we are present. Therefore, it would be appreciated that in the event you are contacted by a representative of the two law firms that represent [the defendants], that you politely refuse to discuss Ms. Pearson\u2019s treatment with that individual____We would also urge you to make sure that if you are contacted by anyone who wants to speak to you about your treatment of Ms. Pearson and they are from any law firm other than mine, that you simply indicate that you are not willing to talk to them informally.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">The defendants filed a motion for sanctions and the Respondent filed an opposition. A hearing was held on August 17, 2012 at which the Honorable Melanie Shaw Geter found that while the Respondent\u2019s letters to the healthcare providers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>\u201cthwarts the spirit of the order\u201d they did not directly violate the order. This Court finds the Respondent\u2019s May 21, 2012 letters were sent, in bad faith, in an intentional effort to obstruct the defendants\u2019 access to information and to circumvent the court order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Judge Doory also determined that Mixter had maintained the <em>Railey </em>litigation \u201cin bad faith and without substantial justification. Not only did the Respondent bring and pursue the case in bad faith but he engaged in abusive, harassing and frivolous discovery practices throughout the entire case\u201d. Judge Doory found that Respondent had represented Nancy Railey, plaintiff, before the Circuit Court for Washington County against, <em>inter alia, </em>a group known as the \u201cCochran Defendants.\u201d According to Judge Doory, after Ms. Railey\u2019s deposition, it became clear that there was no legal basis for Ms. Railey\u2019s claims. Judge Doory observed that, nevertheless, Mixter had frivolously and in bad faith continued the action against the Cochran Defendants and had refused to dismiss a named defendant unless the defense counsel drafted the line of dismissal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">In <em>Railey </em>the Respondent, on behalf of the plaintiff Nancy Railey, filed suit against a number of Defendants alleged to have been involved in the Plaintiffs\u2019 purchase of nursery stock at an auction. Included among the defendants were the auction company, the auctioneer and an employee of the company, the \u201cCochran Defendants.\u201d The Plaintiffs, through the Respondent, sued the Cochran Defendants for fraud, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and assault. Summary judgment was eventually granted to all defendants on all grounds. During discovery the Cochran Defendants deposed Ms. Railey whose testimony undermined the factual basis for all of the counts against the Cochran Defendants. Despite the \u201cdevastating\u201d deposition, the Respondent continued to pursue the case in bad faith and without substantial justification. Not only did the Respondent bring and pursue the case in bad faith but he engaged in abusive, harassing and frivolous discovery practices throughout the entire case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Following Ms. Railey\u2019s deposition in which she exonerated the Cochran Defendants, the Respondent unilaterally noted the depositions of ten non-party witnesses, six of whom were Cochran employees. The deposition notices served no legitimate purpose and were aimed solely at harassing the Cochran defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">Special note should be made of the Defendant Leo Cline. He was a named party among the \u201cCochran Defendants\u201d because the Plaintiff represented by the Respondent believed he had a managerial position at the auction. It was learned during discovery that he was primarily involved in manually setting up the auction site. On April 7, 2011 [defendants\u2019 attorney] Alfred Scanlon urged respondent to dismiss Leo Cline from the case based upon the unquestioned testimony of everyone deposed that it would be impossible for him to be involved in any of Respondent\u2019s theories of liability. Respondent replied that he would be willing to dismiss Mr. Cline, without prejudice, only if Mr. Scanlon would prepare the line of dismissal. Mr. Scanlon quite credibly described this as a \u201ctit for tat\u201d attitude. The Respondent never filed the Line of Dismissal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">At an August 24, 2011 motions hearing, Respondent refused to even orally dismiss this meritless claim. Mr. Cline remained an active defendant until the granting of summary judgment on September 8, 2011.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">During the hearings in the instant case, Judge Doory also had received \u201csubstantial testimony ... with regards to the [misleading] use of [a trial court\u2019s action in a case titled] <em>Greater Washington Orthopaedic Group, PA v. Varner and Miles &amp; Stockbridge </em>(Case No. 88899)\u201d (Hereinafter <em>\u201cVarner\u201d). </em>In <em>Varner, </em>according to Judge Doory, \u201con April 9, 1993, the Honorable Peter J. Messitte, then of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland, issued a \u2018Revised Order\u2019 \u201d in which Judge Messitte explained \u201cthat the treating physician for a plaintiff cannot charge a fee for deposition or trial that is greater than the fee charged to the physician\u2019s usual and customary office practice.\u201d Judge Doory found that Mixter routinely mailed to expert witnesses for the opposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>side a copy of Judge Messitte\u2019s interlocutory order in <em>Varner </em>along with a cover letter stating, \u201cI have also enclosed a copy of the decision in the case of <em>Greater Washington Orthopedic Group, P.A. v. Varner, et al., </em>which sets forth the method of payment for your time spent testifying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">At the hearing, Judge Doory received testimony from Mixter\u2019s expert witness, Alan Feld, as an expert in the field of civil litigation, who \u201ctestified that the <em>Varner </em>opinion provides a proper guideline to be used in determining what a reasonable fee would be for an expert\u2019s time.\u201d Judge Doory, despite Mr. Feld\u2019s testimony, found that \u201cRespondent\u2019s statement to the non-lawyer witnesses that the <em>Varner </em>opinion governs \u2018the method of payment\u2019 is misleading\u201d:<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">Respondent\u2019s statement to the non-lawyer witness that the <em>Varner </em>opinion governs \u201cthe method of payment\u201d is misleading. While the <em>Varner </em>opinion <em>may </em>provide some guidance to a court in determining what a reasonable fee is pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-402(g)(3), it is of questionable value to send to a non-lawyer witness of the opponent. The Honorable Judge Lawrence P. Fletcher-Hill, for the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, in denying one of Respondent\u2019s motions to hold an expert in contempt and to set the expert\u2019s fee, opined:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">As discussed, Defendants rely heavily on the Revised Order in <em>Greater Washington Orthopaedic Group, P.A. v. Varner. </em>The very short answer to Defendants\u2019 reliance on this order as controlling in this case is that it is a nonbinding order of another Circuit Court issued almost twenty years ago. It is persuasive authority at most. In addition, it was limited by its terms to treating physicians who are called upon to testify in that capacity. More important, it pre-dates <em>Kilsheimer, </em>which is binding on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>this Court and the revisions to what is now Maryland Rule 2-402(g)(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">The Respondent\u2019s practice of including the <em>Varner </em>opinion in his correspondence with expert witnesses raises the question of motive. Respondent claims that this is done to control excess fees and save money for his clients, although considering filing and litigation costs no net savings were shown. Petitioner contends that this is primarily a ploy by Respondent to increase his billable hours. The Court cannot accept either theory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">The Court finds that Respondent uses the <em>Varner </em>opinion as part of an opening salvo to indicate that depositions and discovery involving expert witnesses will be conducted on the terms he dictates. It is an attempt by Respondent to upset expert witnesses and create fee and discovery disputes with an aim to take an unfair advantage for his clients by having witnesses fail to cooperate and potentially be excluded from trial. Including the <em>Varner </em>opinion in opening correspondence is an announcement to opposition that, as Lee Salteberg, Esq., testified, it\u2019s time to \u201cbuckle up and hold on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">In the twelfth section of the findings of fact entitled \u201cMotions for Contempt: Harassment and Intimidation\u201d, Judge Doory found that Mixter would routinely file motions to hold medical professionals, who had been noted as expert witnesses by the other side, in contempt, based upon their alleged failure to appear for their deposition. The motions, however, omitted the fact that there were disputes as to payment of the experts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9i\">The Respondent routinely filed motions to hold expert witnesses and lay witnesses in contempt of court based on their alleged failure to appear for deposition in disregard of a validly issued and properly served subpoena. The record reveals the inescapable truth: all of the motions as they related to medical professionals are based on an alleged dispute as to the method and amount the professional will be paid for their deposition testimony. Rather than file an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>appropriate motion with the court\u2014a motion to set the experts\u2019 fees\u2014the Respondent filed to hold the doctors in contempt and within those motions made substantial misrepresentations to the court. The Court finds that this practice is disingenuous and most assuredly aimed at harassing and intimidating opposing parties and expert witnesses by threatening an order of contempt in an attempt to force the expert to appear at deposition on terms, often unreasonable, set by the Respondent or be excluded from testifying at trial. Despite the duplicative nature of many of the motions that are discussed below, a review of each is important to understand how the Respondent casually made misrepresentations to the court that potentially have real and lasting impact on non-parties. All of the motions related to all of the witnesses are based on material misrepresentations: that the witnesses were properly served with a valid subpoena and failed to appear for deposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Judge Doory determined that the motions within the Petitioner\u2019s exhibits related to Joshua Aaron, M.D., Ian M. Weiner, M.D., Douglas M. Shepard, M.D., Clifford T. Solomon, M.D., Mark Danziger, M.D., William Tham, M.D., Kevin Lurie, M.D., Curtis Colbert, Thomas M. Weschler, Richard Thompson, Paul R. Cooper, Robert H. Hillman, Douglas Barnes, D.D.S., Shaheer Yousaf, M.D., Mathew Mulqueen and Victor Wowk, M.D., were all \u201cbased on material misrepresentations: that the witnesses were properly served with a valid subpoena and failed to appear for deposition\u201d and were \u201cmost assuredly aimed at harassing and intimidating opposing parties and expert witnesses\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">As an example, the circumstances in which Dr. Shepard was involved are typical of the entire group of experts. Judge Doory found that Mixter had noted the deposition of Dr. Shepard and had included the <em>Varner </em>opinion with the notice of deposition. When Dr. Shepard\u2019s employer requested advance payment of his fees, Judge Doory noted that Mixter cancelled the deposition, refused to pay Dr. Shepard\u2019s fee and called Dr. Shepard to threaten contempt if Dr. Shepard did not appear at the deposition. Judge Doory found that Mixter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>subsequently filed a Motion to Hold Dr. Shepard in Contempt in which he misrepresented to the court that Dr. Shepard had been properly served; the circuit court, subsequently, in reliance on Mixter\u2019s misrepresentation, issued a Show Cause Order directed at Dr. Shepard that Mixter was to serve on the doctor by October 10, 2009. Judge Doory found that Mixter, then, on October 19, 2009, filed a false Affidavit of Service which misrepresented that Dr. Shepard had been served on October 6, 2009:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">On June 17, 2009, Respondent noted the deposition of Douglas M. Shepard M.D., the Plaintiffs treating physician, for August 7, 2009, in <em>Gnip. </em>Enclosed with the subpoena and notice of deposition was a copy of the <em>Varner </em>opinion. MedStar Health, Dr. Shepard\u2019s employer, requested Dr. Shepard\u2019s fees be pre-paid in the amount of $750.00 per hour. On August 6, 2009, Respondent cancelled the deposition and refused to pay Dr. Shepard\u2019s fee. On or about August 6, 2009, the Respondent called Dr. Shepard, used colorful language, told him that he would not pay his fee and threatened to hold him in contempt of court if he did not appear at deposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">On or about September 25, 2009, the Respondent filed a Motion to Exclude and/or Motion to Hold in Contempt Douglas M. Shepard, M.D. In the motion the Respondent misrepresents to the court that Dr. Shepard \u201cwas served on June 17, 2009\u201d and directs the court to the attached green card. The green card is signed, not by Dr. Shepard but by \u201cN. Flavers.\u201d On September 30, 2009, in reliance on the Respondent\u2019s misrepresentation, the court issued a Show Cause directed at Dr. Shepard. The Show Cause Order required Dr. Shepard be served on or before October 10, 2009. On October 19, 2009, the Respondent filed an Affidavit of Service in which he falsely certified that the Show Cause Order was served on Dr. Shepard \u201con or about October 6, 2009 by evidence of the signature on the return receipt attached to this affidavit as Exhibit \u2018A\u2019 \u201d. The return receipt attached shows that the certified mail was not sent restricted delivery as required by Rule 2-121 and was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>signed for by Dr. Shepard. On October 19, 2009, the case settled. On October 20, 2009, Dr. Shepard\u2019s Attorney, Shannon M. Marshall, Esquire filed Non-Party Douglas Shepard, M.D.\u2019s Response to Defendant\u2019s Motion to Hold Dr. Shepard in Contempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">III. Judge Doory\u2019s Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">After delineating these comprehensive findings of fact, Judge Doory then determined the following conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ1\">Rule 3.1. Meritorious Claims and Contentions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">The Court finds that each of the frivolous motions the Respondent filed as discussed herein is a violation of Rule 3.1. Additionally the Court finds that the Respondent\u2019s bringing and pursing the <em>Radley </em>litigation violates Rule 3.1. Failure to promptly dismiss the Defendant Leo Cline is particularly egregious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">Rule 3.2. Expediting litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">The Court finds the Respondent\u2019s pattern of practice as demonstrated in the cases at issue herein violates Rule 3.2. Specifically, the Court finds the Respondent\u2019s filing of frivolous motions, requesting hearings on every motion and opposition filed, generally acting in an obstructionist manner and failing to cooperate with opposing counsel in the orderly taking of discovery including exchanging written discovery and taking depositions, creating protracted fee disputes with experts and causing confusion for opposing parties, witnesses and the courts all knowingly and purposefully delays litigation and cannot be said to be in the best interest of the client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">Rule 3.3. Candor Toward the Tribunal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">The Court finds that the Respondent routinely made false statements of material fact to the courts in violation of Rule 3.3(a)(1) and (a)(4). In addition to the specific misrepresentations to the court outlined in the section entitled \u201cMisrep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>resentations and Disregard for Court Orders and Directives,\u201d the Respondent routinely misrepresented that out-of-state witnesses were subject to the jurisdiction of Maryland courts, valid subpoenas were issued and properly served, dates of service, that he made good faith efforts to resolve discovery disputes prior to filing motions and that opposing parties or non-party witnesses had refused to respond to his efforts to resolve discovery disputes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">Rule 3.4. Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">The Court finds the Respondent violated Rule 3.4(a) by obstructing Dr. Simon\u2019s access to evidence and thereby facilitating his client in the destruction of evidence in the <em>Ch\u00edneme </em>case. The Respondent and his client were present during Dr. Simon\u2019s initial inspection and learned the specific areas that would be subject to testing. When Dr. Simon returned months later to conduct his inspection and gather samples, the property had been repaired. The Respondent took no steps to preserve the evidence that the Plaintiff needed to pursue her claim although the attorneys discussed this very possibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">In addition to knowingly disobeying the rules of procedure as outlined, the Court finds that the Respondent knowingly and intentionally disobeyed specific court orders and directives as stated in the section entitled \u201cMisrepresentations and Disregard for Court Orders and Directives\u201d in violation of Rule 3.4(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">The Court finds that the Respondent abused his authority, as an officer of the court, to issue frivolous subpoenas and make frivolous discovery requests and demands in violation of Rule 3.4(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">The Court finds that the Respondent, in requesting the Plaintiffs\u2019 doctors to not speak with defense counsel in <em>Pearson </em>violated Rule 3.4(f).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">Rule 4.1. Truthfulness in Statements to Others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>In addition to the false statements made to the courts as discussed under Rule 3.3, the Court finds the Respondent made false statements of material facts to opposing parties and witnesses as described in the section entitled \u201cMisrepresentation and Disregard for Court Orders and Directives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\">The Court finds that the Respondent violated Rule 4.1(a) in that he made a false statement of law to third persons including: (1) stating, either directly or by way of motion, to witnesses that they could be held in contempt of court or subject to other sanctions for failing to appear at deposition where the witnesses were never properly served with a valid subpoena; (2) stating to non-party out-of-state witnesses that they were required to comply with a Maryland subpoena; (3) stating to parties or witnesses that they were compelled to appear for deposition at a location in violation of Rule 2-413.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">Rule 4.4. Respect for Rights of Third Persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">The Court finds that the Respondent knowingly abused his authority, as an officer of court, to routinely attempt to do discovery that has no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay or burden the witnesses and/or opposing party. The Court finds that the Respondent, knowingly and intentionally sought medical records in violation of the HIPAA requirements and/or the Health-General Article by failing to properly serve medical providers with valid subpoenas and failing to send the required assurances that no objection to the subpoenas had been made. Seeking psychiatric records contrary to court orders and seeking lifelong traffic histories would have no purpose other than to embarrass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">Rule 5.3. Responsibilities Regarding Non-lawyer Assistants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">In view of Respondent\u2019s testimony in trial and at deposition that he takes complete responsibility for any and all product by his office, the Court is not convinced by clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Rule 5.3(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\">Rule 8.1. Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">In view of extensive records and documents provided by Respondent and counsel, the Court is not convinced by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Rule 8.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">Rule 8.4. Misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">The Court, as discussed herein, having concluded that Respondent violated multiple Rules, concludes that Respondent has also committed misconduct in violation of Rule 8.4(a). <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Foltz, </em>411 Md. 359, 411, 983 A.2d 434, 465 (2009) (internal citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">As discussed herein the Respondent\u2019s ordinary and usual pattern of practice was laden with deceit and consistent misrepresentations to the courts, parties and witnesses of both fact and law in violation of Rule 8.4(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">Most assuredly, the Respondent\u2019s conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d). The Respondent\u2019s pattern of practice is to bend and break the rules to bully, harass and attempt to intimidate both parties and witnesses----The Respondent conducts discovery and pretrial depositions by bludgeoning his opponents and witnesses with unreasonable demands, frivolous motions and unnecessary acrimony. The effect of the Respondent\u2019s conduct is clear: his opponents and witnesses are forced to spend time and money and expend emotional energy defending against his frivolous requests and demands, the court dockets are clogged and the ordinary and proper resolution of claims is delayed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-11\">This is not a case of walking up to the line in the name of zealous representation. This is a case of consistent knowing and intentional violation of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct. The Respondent\u2019s argument that his actions are defensible in the name of \u201czealous representation\u201d is rejected. Although zealousness is a standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>proper representation, zealousness without the counterbalance of reasonableness amounts to obstreperousness and unfairness. While the vigorous representation of client\u2019s interests is laudable, the Court cannot condone the Respondent\u2019s conduct which, without question, brings the profession into disrepute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Mitigation</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Judge Doory did find that Mixter had proven that during the relevant time period he had suffered from increased stress as a result of his mother\u2019s death and his wife\u2019s treatment for cancer, and that Mixter had modified his office procedures regarding his interactions with witnesses, but did not accept other offered mitigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">Care Issues Involving Respondent\u2019s Wife and Mother</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">From January through July of 2010, Respondent was attending to his mother during her fatal bout with cancer. In April, May and June of 2012, Respondent was quite involved in his wife\u2019s diagnosis, treatment and convalescence from a brain tumor. Dr. Larry Carroll testifies that these situations increased the pressure Respondent was feeling and exacerbated Respondent\u2019s competitive personality. The Court accepts that this mitigation has been proven by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">Respondent\u2019s Health Problems</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">In 2008 through 2009, Respondent was dealing with Atrial Fibrillation which is now primarily controlled by medication. In 2012 through 2013, Respondent was dealing with prostate cancer. The conditions each complicated Respondent\u2019s work circumstances to the extent that he would be hampered from making appearances and meeting deadlines. The Court accepts that this mitigation has been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. The Court cannot accept mitigation as to active decisions made during these periods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Consultation with Larry Carroll, Ph.D.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">At the suggestion of his trial counsel, Respondent met with Dr. Carroll, a Clinical Psychologist, seven times beginning in late 2012. It is Dr. Carroll\u2019s policy to take no notes and file no reports but he opines that Respondent does not have any mental health issues. While he finds Respondent to be normal, he does note that Respondent is ultra-competitive. For the sessions he did have with Dr. Carroll, Respondent was engaged in what Dr. Carroll called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Respondent told Dr. Carroll that he has modified his office procedures to communicate better with opposing counsel and potential witnesses. To deal with Respondent\u2019s ultra competitive personality, Dr. Carroll suggested the technique of \u201cpausing\u201d before responding to his initial instinct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">The Court finds the results of Respondent\u2019s limited contact with Dr. Carroll to be very minor and cannot accept this as mitigation proven by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">Modification of Office Procedures</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">Respondent testified, and discussed with Dr. Carroll, that he has modified the procedure in his office to require additional calls and letters to witnesses and waiting well beyond thirty (80) days before reacting to failures to provide information. These changes seem minor and do not involve working with opposing counsel to solve problems; but they are an improvement. The Court will accept that this mitigation has been proven by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqD\">Limited Number of Cases and Minor Nature of Violations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">Respondent estimates that his firm has handled over thirty five hundred cases. Between six and seven hundred cases would be involved in the time covered by this investigation. Twenty-two cases would represent approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>three-percent of his firm\u2019s workload. It is a minor but significant percentage. It is also argued that the infractions are each quite venial. If the number of cases and the number of infractions within each case were substantially less, this argument would hold more weight. The Court cannot accept this as mitigation proven by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\">Court Imposed Deadlines</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">Both the Respondent and his expert Mr. Fell testified about the increased pressure on attorneys involved in the discovery process generated by court imposed deadlines pursuant to the new case management policies. All attorneys are subject to this and the Maryland Rules still apply. The court does not accept this as mitigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">Devotion of his Clients</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">Respondent presents the testimony of five of his many clients as a sampling of the high regard with which he is held by his clients. There is no question he is well respected by those he represents. The question for this Court is how he is recognized by all of the parties in the system. Review of the extensive documents submitted by Petitioner and Respondent disclose that he has been admonished, sanctioned or scolded by at least sixteen different judges during this period. The Court cannot accept the devotion of his clients as mitigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">IV. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\"> \u201cThis Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings in Maryland.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. O\u2019Leary, </em>433 Md. 2, 28, 69 A.3d 1121, 1136 (2013), quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Chapman, </em>430 Md. 238, 273, 60 A.3d 25, 46 (2013). \u201c[W]e accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact as prima facie correct unless shown to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Fader, </em>431 Md. 395, 426, 66 A.3d 18, 36 (2013), quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Rand, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>429 Md. 674, 712, 57 A.3d 976, 998 (2012). We conduct an independent, de novo review of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16\u2014759(b)(1).<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Mixter noted over one hundred and fifty exceptions to Judge Doory\u2019s findings, as well as an exception to each of Judge Doory\u2019s conclusions of law. Bar Counsel noted no exceptions to Judge Doory\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">A. Mixter\u2019s Exceptions to Judge Doory\u2019s Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Mixter excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s general finding that \u201cthe sixty-two (62) motions for relief described in the attached Appendix Two (2), incorporated by reference herein, filed by the Respondent and directed at non-party witnesses were frivolous. The motions were frivolous because ... the subpoena was ineffective as of the date of service because it did not provide the witness the requisite 30 days to produce documents as required by Maryland Rule 2-412(e).\u201d Mixter asserts that even though he had served subpoenas which provided less than thirty days for the recipient to produce documents, that this error was \u201charmless\u201d. We disagree and overrule this exception, because Maryland Rule 2-412(c), which requires thirty days\u2019 notice prior to a documents deposition, is written in mandatory nomenclature of \u201cshall\u201d. <em>See Dove v. State, </em>415 Md. 727, 738, 4 A.3d 976, 982 (2010). When the term \u201cshall\u201d is used in a Maryland Rule it \u201c \u2018denotes an imperative obligation inconsistent with the exercise of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gaetano v. Calvert Cnty., </em>310 Md. 121, 124-25, 527 A.2d 46, 47-48 (1987), quoting <em>City of College Park v. Cotter, </em>309 Md. 573, 588 n. 23, 525 A.2d 1059, 1066 n. 23 (1987). We disagree with Mixter.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Mixter also asserts, within the same exception, that he could move to compel compliance with subpoenas for which he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>provided less than thirty days\u2019 notice for the production of documents, because the motions had not been filed until after thirty days elapsed from service. Maryland Rule 2-412(c), again, requires thirty days\u2019 notice in order to secure subpoena enforcement. That a motion to compel was filed beyond thirty days after service is, therefore, irrelevant, because the time for the party\u2019s appearance, or for raising objections to the subpoena,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> had already occurred, with less time than required by the Rule. We, accordingly, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Mixter notes numerous exceptions based on the fact that Judge Doory did not find credible his testimony as well as that of some of his witnesses. We, however, generally, \u201cdefer to the credibility findings of the hearing judge.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Agbaje, </em>438 Md. 695, 93 A.3d 262 (2014). \u201c[T]he hearing judge is in the best position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and to decide which one to believe and, as we have said, to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. DiCicco, </em>369 Md. 662, 683-84, 802 A.2d 1014, 1026 (2002), quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Monfried, </em>368 Md. 373, 390, 794 A.2d 92, 101 (2002). <em>See also Attorney Grievance v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 17, 741 A.2d 1143, 1152 (1999) (stating that the hearing judge is \u201cin the best position to assess first hand a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d). As we have stated, a hearing judge \u201cis free to disregard the testimony of Respondent if the judge believed the evidence was not credible.\u201d <em>Monfried, </em>368 Md. at 390, 794 A.2d at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Mixter excepts to all of Judge Doory\u2019s findings that he knowingly and intentionally engaged in misconduct. He initially argues that Judge Doory erred because there was no direct evidence to support that his impropriety was both knowing and intentional. We have said, however, that intent \u201cmay be inferred from circumstantial evidence\u201d, <em>(Attorney Grievance v. Jarosinski, </em>411 Md. 432, 452, 983 A.2d 477, 489 (2009)), and that, even without an express disclosure of intent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>\u201cthe sum of the circumstantial evidence\u201d can demonstrate the Respondent\u2019s mental state. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Goodman, </em>426 Md. 115, 131, 43 A.3d 988, 997 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Mixter initially takes exception that Judge Doory did not find credible his testimony that he had, in fact, attempted to resolve discovery disputes by telephoning opposing parties to resolve issues before he filed motions to compel. We defer to Judge Doory\u2019s credibility findings and also note that in Mixter\u2019s twenty-two case files, introduced into evidence and comprising thirty-two volumes, he did not include any notation nor preserve any documentation in any file, with respect to any such telephone conversations or attempted resolution of discovery disputes.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Judge Doory found also that Mixter knowingly and intentionally misrepresented to various tribunals that he had engaged in good faith attempts to resolve discovery disputes as part of his Maryland Rule 2-431 certificates attached to the fifty-three motions listed in Appendix 6 and contained in Mixter\u2019s files. According to Judge Doory\u2019s findings, Mixter had attached to every one of his certificates of good faith, as evidence of his attempts to resolve the discovery disputes, a copy of his cover letter accompanying the original subpoenas mandating the production of documents and depositions. For example, within Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 18, which is comprised of Mixter\u2019s files from the <em>Mixter </em>litigation, was such a cover letter sent to Stephen Shechtel,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> an attorney in Rockville, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">Enclosed please find a Notice of Deposition and Subpoena Duces Tecum, which is being served upon you via certified mail. If you would please forward copies of all documents requested by the date of the deposition it will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>necessary for you to testify or appear. Please note that we are not authorizing the use of a record copy service. Additionally, we will not pay for any such services without written approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Judge Doory found that the cover letters were not representative of good faith attempts to resolve discovery disputes, because not only were they sent to witnesses before any dispute actually could have existed, but excusing a witness\u2019s presence if all documents are produced is not within the contemplation of the Maryland Rules for resolution of discovery disputes. The file reflects, moreover, that after Mr. Shechtel received the subpoena, he responded by letter objecting to it, asserting that: \u201cthe Subpoena was served not in accordance with Maryland Rules\u201d; the documents sought were \u201coutside of the Maryland Rules\u201d; the documents deposition was scheduled \u201cwithout the courtesy of an advance telephone call ... on a date and at a time that [Mr. Shechtel was] unavailable; the request was \u201cfar too broad\u201d; and the documents demanded \u201cmay constitute attorney work product and accordingly are not discoverable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Without responding to Mr. Shechtel\u2019s letter, Mixter subsequently filed a Motion to Compel in which he asserted that Mr. Shechtel \u201cdid not comply with any of the terms of the subpoena\u201d, attaching to it his original cover letter, and in which he failed to mention Mr. Shechtel\u2019s letter or any documentation of true good faith efforts at conciliation of the dispute. Ultimately, the Circuit Court quashed the subpoena, based upon the objections Mr. Shechtel had sent to Mixter, which Mr. Shechtel included with his subsequent Motion for Protective Order. Upon a review of the record that Judge Doory had before him, just as in the <em>Mixter </em>case and Mr. Shechtel\u2019s interactions, for all the motions listed in Appendix 6, there was clear and convincing evidence from which the hearing judge could find that Mixter had knowingly and intentionally certified that he acted in good faith to resolve discovery disputes when, in fact, he had not. We, accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>overrule Mixter\u2019s objections to Judge Doory\u2019s findings listed in Appendix 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Judge Doory also had before him, listed in Appendix 7, twelve motions authored by Mixter and contained in his files\u2014 six to compel, three for contempt, two for sanctions (one of which was, in the alternative, a motion to compel) and one for a protective order\u2014in which Judge Doory found that Mixter had knowingly and intentionally omitted reference to letters that attorneys had sent to him attempting to conciliate the discovery disputes before he filed the motions to compel, for contempt, for sanctions and for a protective order. Exhibit 18 includes an example chosen by Judge Doory to discuss, that being a Motion to Compel the production of documents from Steven A. Markey, III, from whom Mixter sought documents embodying any statements made by Mr. Markey to other attorneys about Mixter \u201cat any time whatsoever.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Mr. Markey responded to the subpoena by letter, included in Mixter\u2019s files, stating, \u201cI have done a diligent search of my computer records and I am unable to find any documents [responsive to your subpoena]\u201d; Mr. Markey, though, referred to a practice of his that he would engage in if approached about Mixter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">It is possible that one or more of [the <em>Mixter </em>defendants] were provided with a copy of the Order from [the Honorable] Susan Souder, a copy of the Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion to Compel Independent Medical Examination and Request for Sanctions in the matter of <em>Lewis v. Edison Schools, Inc., </em>or a copy of the U.S. District Court Opinion in the matter of <em>Higgenbotham [.Higginbotham </em>] <em>v. KCS International, Inc.[</em><footnotemark><em>49</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>I have enclosed copies of these documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>for your convenience. If and when I receive inquires about Mark T. Mixter, these are the documents I would possibly provide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Subsequently, Mixter filed a Motion to Compel the deposition and production of documents from Mr. Markey, in which he entirely omitted any reference to Mr. Markey\u2019s letter; instead, the motion included only an identical version of the cover letter, discussed <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>50</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Upon a review of the record, there are no instances in which Mixter included either the substance of material correspondence from opposing counsel regarding a discovery dispute or the correspondences themselves in his discovery motions, just as with Mr. Markey. We overrule Mixter\u2019s exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding in each instance listed in Appendix 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Judge Doory also found that that Mixter had intentionally and knowingly misrepresented to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, in the <em>Koontz </em>litigation, that the custodian of records for Dr. Eckel had been served with a subpoena for a documents deposition, \u201con or about 21st day of April, 2010\u201d. To his Motion to Compel documents from Dr. Eckel, Mixter had attached a United States Postal Service \u201cTrack &amp; Confirm\u201d receipt for the subpoena which revealed that it had not been delivered until April 27, 2010, six days after Mixter had claimed service had been accomplished and had actually been returned to Mixter\u2019s office on April 29, 2010. The problems with service on Dr. Eckel, however, had not been revealed in the Motion filed by Mixter. We, accordingly, overrule Mixter\u2019s exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that he knowingly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>intentionally misrepresented to the Circuit Court judge in <em>Koontz </em>that Dr. Eckel had properly been served.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Judge Doory found, as well, that, in the <em>Mixter </em>litigation, Mixter had intentionally and knowingly attempted to enforce an unserved subpoena commanding the personal appearance of, and the production of documents from, the custodian of records for Dr. Michael Conte. Judge Doory\u2019s finding was premised on Mixter\u2019s files, which reflect not only that, on March 8, 2012, Mixter had mailed a documents subpoena to Dr. Conte, but that the subpoena had been returned to Mixter\u2019s office and, on April 18, 2012, he had resent the subpoena to Dr. Conte by first-class mail, which our Rules do not contemplate as adequate service. On April 18, 2012, Mixter, however, filed a Motion to Compel in which he asserted that the subpoena had been served \u201con or about March 6, 2012\u201d, but he must have known the subpoena had not been served by the very fact that he had resent it. We, accordingly, overrule Mixter\u2019s exception to Judge Doory\u2019s determination that he had intentionally and knowingly attempted to enforce an unserved subpoena on Dr. Conte in the <em>Mixter </em>litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Judge Doory found that Mixter had knowingly and intentionally attempted to enforce twenty-four Maryland subpoenas to out-of-state witnesses, which are identified in Appendix 3, without having followed the protocols for issuing enforceable out-of-state subpoenas. Maryland Rule 2-413(a)(2) mandates that a nonparty may only be \u201crequired to attend a deposition outside of this State in accordance with the law of the place where the deposition is held.\u201d Mixter, however, issued the twenty-four subpoenas, and attempted to enforce them, without having acted \u201cin accordance with the law of the place\u201d where the various out-of-state witness were located.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Judge Doory specifically identified, in the <em>Mixter </em>files, an instance in which Mixter had intentionally misrepresented to a witness that he had complied with Maryland Rule 2-413(a)(2). Judge Doory observed that Mixter had mailed to TrialSmith, Inc., located in Austin, Texas, a notice of deposition, a Baltimore City subpoena for a documents deposition and an un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>signed Commission to Take Foreign Deposition. According to Judge Doory, the inclusion of an unexecuted commission was an intentional misrepresentation by Mixter to TrialSmith that he had complied with Section 20.002 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. After a review of the record accompanying each subpoena listed in Appendix 3, in every instance, as with TrialSmith, Mixter had attempted to enforce subpoenas for documents depositions served on out-of-state fact-witnesses in which he had failed to follow the rubric for issuance of such deposition subpoenas. We, accordingly, overrule Mixter\u2019s exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that he had knowingly and intentionally attempted to enforce the subpoenas identified in Appendix 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Judge Doory also found that Mixter had intentionally and knowingly misrepresented to non-party witnesses residing in other states that they could be compelled to appear and produce documents in Maryland. Judge Doory found that Mixter knew that every one of the thirty-five subpoenas listed in Appendix 4 was directed at a witness outside of Maryland, but did not comport with the proper procedures for the issuance of subpoenas to non-party witnesses outside of Maryland. While Mixter knew an out-of-state witness could not be compelled to attend a deposition in Maryland, as discussed <em>supra, </em>the subpoenas, in emphasized print, stated \u201cyou are liable to body attachment and fine for failure to obey this subpoena.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Mixter, in his cover letter included with the subpoenas, which we also have discussed <em>supra, </em>stated to the recipients that their attendance could be compelled by informing them that, \u201cif [they] would please forward copies of all documents ... it will not be necessary for [them] to testify or appear\u201d, thereby implying that the appearance of out-of-state witness could otherwise be compelled.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> We overrule Mixter\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that he intentionally and knowingly misrepresented to non-party, out-of-state witnesses, in connection with each subpoena identified in Appendix 4, that their appearance could be compelled at a documents deposition in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Judge Doory, also, found that in seven subpoenas in Mixter\u2019s files from five cases, Mixter had intentionally and knowingly misrepresented to non-party residents of Maryland that they could be compelled to appear and produce documents outside of their counties of residence or employment,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> in contradiction to the mandate of Maryland Rule 2\u2014413(a)(1).<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> As with the subpoenas directed to out-of-state witnesses, discussed <em>supra, </em>the subpoenas directed to in-state residents had contained the same highlighted language notifying the recipients that they could be subject to body attachment for non-appearance at the deposition and Mixter had included the same cover letters indicating that he would take action to compel the witnesses\u2019 appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">For example, Mixter\u2019s files from the <em>Mixter </em>litigation contain a subpoena, served on the Maryland Association for Justice, a non-party with its principal office in Howard County, commanding the personal appearance of, and production of documents from, its representative at Mixter\u2019s office in Baltimore City. The Association objected to the subpoena on the grounds that, <em>inter alia, </em>it was unenforceable, because it violated Maryland Rule 2-413. Mixter, in response, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>asserted that the Maryland Rule 2-413 violation \u201cdoes not render the subpoena unenforceable.\u201d Upon a review of the record pertinent to the other six subpoenas, Mixter had included the same subpoenas and cover letters which put the recipients on notice that their physical appearance could be compelled, so that we overrule Mixter\u2019s exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that Mixter had intentionally and knowingly misrepresented to non-party residents of Maryland that they could be compelled to appear and produce documents in violation of Maryland Rule 2\u2014413(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Judge Doory found, as well, that Mixter had knowingly and intentionally misrepresented to Judge J. Frederick Motz of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, during the <em>Byme-Egan </em>litigation, that the third-party defendant had admitted to a failure to timely respond to discovery requests. Mixter\u2019s files from the <em>Byme-Egan </em>litigation, which had been admitted into evidence as Petitioner\u2019s Exhibits 3 and 4, contain a Motion to Compel the third-party defendant\u2019s answers to interrogatories and production of documents, filed on December 2, 2011. The third-party defendant\u2019s Response, filed on December 19, 2011, included within Mixter\u2019s files, contained only three affirmations, none of which admitted to a failure to timely respond to Mixter\u2019s discovery requests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">1. This case was removed to Federal Court by Empire after it filed a Third Party Complaint against Seay in State Court and she filed a counterclaim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">2. Seay avers that this court has no jurisdiction in this matter and she has filed a Motion to Remand to State Court which has yet to be ruled upon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">3. In any event, Seay intends to respond to Empire\u2019s discovery requests within ten days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">In Mixter\u2019s letter to Judge Motz the very next day Mixter asserted, however, that the third-party defendant had \u201cadmitted] to the plaintiffs failure to timely answer my client\u2019s discovery requests\u201d, which was not reflective of the state of affairs. We, accordingly, overrule the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Judge Doory also found that Mixter had attempted to obtain the opposing parties\u2019 health care records during the <em>Byrne-Egan </em>and <em>Koontz </em>litigations by knowingly and intentionally misrepresenting to the health care providers that no objection had been made to the disclosure of such records. Mixter\u2019s files from <em>Byme-Egan </em>show that, on February 21, 2012, the third-party defendant filed a Motion for a Protective Order to \u201cbar the inquiry into and the disclosure of the unrelated mental health history of Emily Seay\u201d and that, on March 5, 2012, Mixter filed a response to the motion for a protective order. Mixter, despite having responded to the motion for a protective order as to Ms. Seay\u2019s health care records, sent a letter to her health care providers that stated, \u201cEmily Ann Seay ... has not objected to the disclosure of the requested medical records.\u201d Accordingly, we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In <em>Koontz, </em>Judge Doory also found that Mixter had attempted to obtain the plaintiffs medical records by knowingly and intentionally misrepresenting to the plaintiffs health care providers that no objections to such disclosure had been made. Mixter\u2019s files from the <em>Koontz </em>litigation show that Mixter had issued subpoenas to nineteen of the plaintiffs healthcare providers on April 21, 2010, requesting the plaintiffs medical records and that, on May 5, 2010, the plaintiff filed an \u201cEmergency Motion\u201d for a protective order or to quash or limit those nineteen subpoenas. Sixteen days later, Mixter sent a letter to the health care service providers, a sample of which is contained in his files, wherein he disregarded the existence of the Emergency Motion and informed the providers that, \u201c[the plaintiff] and her attorney have not objected to the disclosure of the requested medical records. Please forward the responsive records at your earliest convenience.\u201d Mixter\u2019s files support Judge Doory\u2019s finding that Mixter had made intentional misrepresentations to the plaintiffs health care providers. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Judge Doory also found that Mixter had knowingly and intentionally misrepresented to Judge Deborah K. Chasanow of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, in the <em>Davis </em>litigation, that the defendants had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>properly served with the complaint. Mixter\u2019s records, contained in Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 7, include return receipts from the mailed complaints that were that were signed on March 12, 2010. The receipts, however, were not signed by the defendants, as Judge Doory observed and as Mixter himself testified at the hearing before Judge Doory. Mixter, nonetheless, had included the return receipts as exhibits to affidavits he had executed under oath in which he affirmed to Judge Chasanow \u201cthat a complaint was duly served upon [the defendants] on or about March 12, 2010 by evidence of the signature on the return receipt attached to this affidavit\u201d. The record supports the finding that Mixter had made an intentional misrepresentation to Judge Chasanow; we, therefore, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Judge Doory found that Mixter had knowingly and intentionally obstructed his opposition\u2019s access to evidence in <em>Pearson </em>by sending a letter to his client\u2019s physicians requesting that they not speak to opposing counsel, despite a court order authorizing such communication. Mixter\u2019s files from the <em>Pearson </em>litigation, received into evidence as Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 21, include an Order from a Judge on the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, issued May 18, 2012, permitting the parties to \u201cengage in <em>ex parte </em>discussions with treating healthcare providers\u201d and allowing \u201cany third-party who is provided with a subpoena requesting the production of documents or commanding attendance at deposition or trial to disclose Protected Health Information in response to such request or subpoena.\u201d Mixter\u2019s files also contain a letter he had sent to one health care provider, dated just three days after the order, in which he told the physician, after acknowledging the Order, to \u201crefuse to discuss Ms. Pearson\u2019s treatment\u201d with the opposition. We overrule Mixter\u2019s exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that Mixter had intentionally attempted to prevent opposing counsel from speaking to his client\u2019s physicians in <em>Pearson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Judge Doory, thus, had clear and convincing evidence that had been contained within Mixter\u2019s own files from which he could find that Mixter had acted knowingly and intentionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>in making the various misrepresentations to courts, as well as to witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Mixter also notes exceptions to Judge Doory\u2019s findings that various Maryland subpoenas had been improperly served on out-of-state witnesses, because, Mixter argues, Bar Counsel had not presented proof that the various deponents had not consented to a waiver of the Rules. As we have discussed, however, the Maryland Rules and statutes of the various other states in issue require additional protocols for an out-of-state witness to be compelled to attend a deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">For example, Mixter asserts that, regarding the <em>Alemu </em>litigation, \u201cPetitioner also failed to produce any evidence that Maharishi University, while located [in Iowa], is not subject to Maryland\u2019s subpoena powers for other reasons or that an agreement had been entered into between the parties regarding requests for documents from out-of-state witnesses.\u201d The University is located in Iowa and only would have been subject to the authority of the Maryland courts, once Mixter complied with the strictures of Maryland Rule 2-413(a)(2), which would have required adherence to Section 622.84 of the Iowa Code, discussed <em>supra. </em>There was no documentation in Mixter\u2019s files that he had attempted to properly serve a subpoena on Maharishi University according to Iowa law or of an agreement waiving service, so that we overrule this exception. We overrule, as well, each of Mixter\u2019s similar exceptions premised on the assertion that Bar Counsel had failed to prove that the opposing party in each of the ten cases had not waived the Maryland Rules, because, upon a review of the record, there are no such documents regarding waiver included in any of the relevant files that were maintained by Mixter.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Mixter also excepts to six specific findings that Maryland subpoenas had contained misrepresentations to six non-party, out-of-state recipients, that their attendance could be compelled in Maryland.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Mixter\u2019s exceptions are premised on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>theory that the six witnesses became subject to jurisdiction in Maryland by allowing their designation as witnesses in Maryland courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We disagree, because Maryland Rule 2\u2014413(a)(2) is explicit that a non-party witness outside of Maryland only may be required to attend a deposition in accordance with the laws of the State where the witness resides. By failing to follow the protocols of the various states in which the witnesses resided, Mixter issued unenforceable subpoenas and the recipients could not be compelled to appear in Maryland. Accordingly, we overrule these exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Mixter also excepts that Bar Counsel could not have proven that ten subpoenas, from five cases, had not been properly served, because no proof of service was presented to Judge Doory. For example, Mixter argued that \u201cRespondent excepts to the court\u2019s finding that the [Motion to Compel custodians of records of Blake Construction and Cunningham Contracting in <em>Koontz </em>] was frivolous as no evidence was presented regarding how or when the witness was served.\u201d Proper service of a subpoena by mail, in compliance with Maryland Rule 2-121(a)(3), discussed <em>supra, </em>necessarily would generate a return receipt as proof of proper service signed by the party to be served or his or her authorized agent; Maryland Rule 2-126(a)(3) manifests that an original return receipt so signed is required for proof of service by mail. There were no return receipts evidencing proper service signed for by a proper party within any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>five files at issue. We, accordingly, overrule Mixter\u2019s exception that Bar Counsel could not prove there had not been proper service due to a lack of proof of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Mixter also excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s findings that various motions to compel the production of records from health care providers were frivolous, because valid subpoenas had been served upon the providers. Judge Doory found, however, that in six instances from four cases Mixter had not complied with additional steps for obtaining health care records provided by Section 4-306 of the Health-General Article of the Maryland Code, discussed <em>supra. </em>The record reflects that Mixter had not complied with Section 4-306, because he had either failed to send a 30-day assurance letter altogether to the medical provider, or he had mailed the letter less than one week before he certified service of a motion to compel the records, thereby providing insufficient time for the production of documents. We, therefore, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Mixter also excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that, \u201cRespondent had a pattern and practice of knowingly and intentionally noting depositions in the wrong venue\u201d. According to Mixter, Judge Doory erred because every subpoena for the production of documents in his files had included a cover letter stating that the witness would not have had to appear so long as the documents were produced. Judge Doory found, however, that every subpoena required personal appearance of the witness, because in every subpoena, in those same files, Mixter always had selected the option on the subpoena form that required the witnesses to \u201cpersonally appear and produce documents or objects\u201d, rather than checking the option which provided, \u201cproduce documents and or objects only\u201d.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> In so doing, Judge Doory found that Mixter had misrepresented to the witnesses that they could be compelled to appear in improper venues. Upon a review of the record, there are no instances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>in which Mixter issued a subpoena requesting only the production of documents, instead, he had sought the personal appearance of the recipient of his subpoenas. We, accordingly, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Mixter also excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that his \u201cMotion to Hold in Contempt Various Custodians of Records\u201d for absence at trial, filed in <em>Alemu, </em>was frivolous, because, according to Judge Doory, Mixter sought to hold non-party witnesses in contempt for their absence at a trial that had not taken place and that Mixter had moved to continue. Mixter asserts that Judge Doory erred in finding that it was he who had filed the motion to continue the trial date. We sustain this exception, because the docket sheet in <em>Alemu </em>reflects that the motion for a continuance had been filed by one other than Mixter.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Whether Mixter had filed the motion to continue, however, was not dispositive with regard to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the motion to hold the non-party witnesses in contempt was frivolous, because \u201cthere was no basis in fact or law to file a motion to hold non-party witnesses in contempt of court for failure to appear at a trial that did not take place.\u201d Mixter\u2019s file containing the docket sheet from <em>Alemu </em>reflects that the Circuit Court Judge had granted a postponement, on June 17, 2010, while Mixter had filed his motion for contempt, within the subsequent month, on July 8, 2010. We, accordingly, overrule Mixter\u2019s exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the \u201cMotion to Hold in Contempt various custodians of records\u201d was frivolous.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Mixter also excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motion to Compel the Custodian of Records of Maryland Dental Board to produce documents, filed in the <em>Canby </em>litigation on November 2, 2011, was frivolous. As Mixter recognized in his exception, he sent notice of the deposition on October 20, 2011 for a deposition to be held on October 31, 2011, which did not comport with the thirty-day requirement of the Maryland Rules.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Mixter excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motion to Compel the custodian of records of CSC-Layers to produce documents in <em>Dunston </em>was frivolous for being untimely, because, Mixter argues, Judge Doory could not rely upon the Circuit Court\u2019s order denying the Motion to Compel to conclude that the motion itself, also included in the record, was frivolous. In the Order, which was included with Mixter\u2019s files from <em>Dunston </em>in Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 8, Judge Audrey Carrion of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City denied the Motion to Compel as untimely, because it was filed \u201cin violation of the discovery deadline defined in the Scheduling Order.\u201d This exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Mixter notes an exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motion to Compel Custodian of Records of GEICO to produce documents in <em>Dunston </em>was frivolous, on the basis that the Motion to Compel was not part of the record before Judge Doory. Judge Doory could not have found that the motion to compel was frivolous, because that motion was not included in the <em>Dunston </em>files. We sustain this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Judge Doory found, as well, that the Motion to Hold in Contempt the records custodian of GEICO was a frivolous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>motion directed at a non-party. Mixter also excepts to this finding, on the basis that the Motion to Hold in Contempt was proper because GEICO had not complied with the order granting the previous motion to compel. Mixter\u2019s records from <em>Dunston </em>reveal, however, that the Motion to Hold in Contempt was untimely, because, according to an Order from the Circuit Court for Baltimore City denying the Motion to Hold in Contempt, \u201cThe Motion was filed in violation of the discovery deadline defined in the Scheduling Order.\u201d We, accordingly, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Mixter next excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motion to Compel the custodian of records of Washington Hospital Center, located in Washington, D.C., to produce documents in the <em>Fitzgerald </em>litigation was frivolous, because, he asserts, he had properly complied with the District\u2019s rules for service, as evidenced by a Washington D.C. subpoena in his files from the <em>Fitzgerald </em>litigation. As we explained <em>supra, </em>however, in 2008, when the subpoena was issued, the District of Columbia required that a commission and notice be issued by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. <em>See </em>D.C.Code \u00a7 14-103 (2008). We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Mixter also notes an exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motion to Compel production of documents from the Maryland Association of Justice filed in <em>Mixter </em>was frivolous. Mixter asserts that \u201cthe Maryland Association for Justice concedes that it was served a subpoena from Respondent\u201d. Service was not the issue, however, because the Association objected to enforcement of the subpoena on the grounds that the deposition was mandated to be taken in the wrong county, in Mixter\u2019s office in Baltimore City.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The Association, ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>mately, had secured a protective order. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Mixter excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motion to Compel the production of documents from the custodian of records for Dr. Rosenbaum contained a misrepresentation to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County in the <em>Byme-Egan </em>litigation. Mixter affirmed to the Circuit Court in the Motion to Compel that the witness was served \u201con or about August 25, 2011\u201d. Judge Doory observed, however, that \u201c[t]he green card is clearly from something else as it was dated August 16, 2011, more than a week before the relevant subpoena was issued.\u201d Mixter, however, urges that \u201cwhile it appears that the green card is dated \u20188/16/11\u2019 it is more likely that the green card is actually dated \u20188/26/11\u2019 \u201d. A review of the green card in Mixter\u2019s files that had been received into evidence reflects the date as \u201c8/16/11\u201d. We, therefore, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Mixter also excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that he misrepresented to the Circuit Court for Charles County in a Motion to Compel in <em>Keener </em>that an enforceable subpoena for the production of documents had been served upon the Civista Medical Center. Mixter, in his exception, asserts that the subpoena was enforceable, because it was served on Civista, located in Charles County, on September 21, 2009, and he sought production of documents at his office in Baltimore City on October 19, 2009. Furthermore, Mixter excepts on the basis that he had sent thirty-day assurance letters to Civista, in compliance with Section 4-306 of the Health-General Article of the Maryland Code, on October 22, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The subpoena directed at Civista, however, was unenforceable, because it sought the production of documents from a non-party witness in the wrong jurisdiction, as mandated by Maryland Rule 2-413, discussed <em>supra. </em>Furthermore, under Maryland Rule 2-412(c), Civista had thirty days within which to produce documents, but the subpoena for the production of documents called for fewer days. Under Section 4-306 of the Health-General Article of the Maryland Code, finally, Civista <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>could not have produced the documents on October 19, before it had received the 30-day assurance letters on October 22. We, therefore, overrule Mixter\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Mixter notes an exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motion to Compel the production of medical records from the United States Department of Health and Human Services in <em>Fitzgerald </em>was frivolous, because the Department had been properly served at its Maryland office. Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motion to Compel was frivolous, however, was based on the fact that Mixter had misrepresented to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County that he had complied with Maryland Rule 2-431, discussed <em>supra. </em>Mixter in fact, however, had not engaged in good faith efforts to resolve the dispute, and he had omitted from the motion relevant correspondence from the Department, such as letters he received notifying him that he was required to first obtain consent from Ms. Fitzgerald for the release of the requested documents. We accordingly overrule his exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Mixter excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that, in <em>Koontz, </em>the Motion to Compel the production of documents from the custodian of employment records for the United States Internal Revenue Service was frivolous, because he had properly served an enforceable subpoena on the Internal Revenue Service in Annapolis. Judge Doory had found, however, that the Motion to Compel was frivolous, because there had been no proof of service of the subpoena, which is supported by a review of Mixter\u2019s files in <em>Koontz. </em>We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Mixter also excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motion to Compel supplemental answers to interrogatories from the plaintiff, filed in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County in <em>Byme-Egan, </em>was a frivolous motion, because there had been no good faith attempts at resolution of the discovery dispute. We sustain this exception, because the record contains a copy of the opposing party\u2019s Answer to Motion to Compel in which they admit to having submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>incomplete answers to interrogatories.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Mixter excepts as well to Judge Doory\u2019s finding as frivolous the Motion in Limine to preclude Ms. Emily Seay from testifying as to her alleged emotional distress in the <em>Byme-Egtm </em>litigation. Mixter argues that the Motion in Limine was proper \u201cas it sought to preclude the Third-Party Defendant from introducing evidence of mental or psychological damages after a protective order had been entered precluding Respondent from obtaining medical records relating to said damages.\u201d Judge Doory\u2019s finding was based on the fact that Ms. Seay stipulated that, \u201c[she] is making no claim of psychiatric injuries as a result of this accident.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> As a result, Mixter\u2019s Motion in Limine was frivolous, and we overrule the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Mixter also notes an exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motion for Contempt filed in <em>Canby </em>to preclude Douglas Barnes from testifying and for sanctions was frivolous, because, he argues, \u201c[t]his motion was directed at an expert witness for Defendant. Therefore, Respondent excepts to the court\u2019s use of this motion to support its claim that Respondent filed frivolous motions directed at opposing parties.\u201d Mixter also excepts, with regards to Judge Doory\u2019s use of the Motion for Contempt to preclude Dr. Barnes, \u201cto the trial court\u2019s finding that the filing of a Motion [for Contempt]<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> against Dr. Barnes was a material misrepresentation to the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Judge Doory, however, had only made two findings with regards to the Motion for Contempt to preclude Dr. Barnes: that the motion contained a false certification of good faith efforts at resolution of a discovery dispute, (see Appendix 6 (\u201cVol. 6, tab 31\u201d)), and that the motion exemplified Mixter\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>use of motions for contempt in order to \u201charass[ ] and intimidat[e] opposing parties and expert witnesses by threatening an order of contempt in an attempt to force the expert to appear at a deposition on terms, often unreasonable, set by the Respondent or be excluded from testifying at trial.\u201d With respect to Dr. Barnes specifically, Judge Doory found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">\n<em>Douglas Barnes, D.D.S.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">On July 21, 2011, the Respondent filed Plaintiffs Motion for Contempt and to Preclude Douglas Barnes, D.D.S., from Testifying as a Witness on Behalf of the Defendant and for Sanctions in <em>Canby. </em>In the motion, the Respondent did not even allege that a subpoena was issued or served. Nonetheless, he requested the court hold Dr. Barnes in contempt for failing to voluntarily change the start time of the second day of his deposition from 10 a.m. to 9 a.m. to accommodate the Respondent\u2019s schedule. On August 3, 2011, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County denied the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">(internal record citations omitted). Mixter\u2019s files from <em>Canby </em>do not show any subpoena related to the Motion for Contempt and the exhibits included with the Defendant\u2019s Answer to Plaintiffs Motion for Contempt reveals the truth, that Mixter had filed the Motion for Contempt in an attempt to force Dr. Barnes\u2019s deposition to move forward on Mixter\u2019s own terms.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> We, accordingly, overrule Mixter\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Mixter excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motion to Compel answers to interrogatories and the production of documents from the opposition in the <em>Greenstein </em>litigation was frivolous, because Judge Doory had improperly relied upon \u201can order entered by Judge Fader in reference to Respondent\u2019s motion to compel\u201d. The Fader Order, contained in Mixter\u2019s files from <em>Greenstein </em>received into evidence as Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 14, in emphasized print, denied the Motion to Compel because, \u201cThere is no satisfactory certificate of good faith efforts to resolve the discovery dispute as required by the Maryland Rules.\u201d We, accordingly, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Mixter also notes an exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motion to Dismiss and/or for Sanctions for Plaintiffs Complete Failure to Provide Discovery in the <em>Koontz </em>litigation was a frivolous motion directed at the opposing party. Judge Doory found that Mixter had not acted in good faith by creating the discovery dispute, because Mixter had made unreasonable demands of his opposition, attempted to enforce those demands without any good faith effort at conciliation and, further, that Mixter had not presented evidence that the opposition refused to agree to his demands:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">The Respondent propounded discovery on the Plaintiffs, the discovery requested sensitive medical and financial information. The Plaintiffs asked the Respondent to enter into a confidentiality agreement which would not in any way preclude his receipt of discoverable information but rather limit the disclosure or redisclosure of sensitive information. The Respondent refused to enter into a confidentiality agreement and the Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Protective order on August 11, 2009. On August 25, 2009, the Respondent filed a motion to compel discovery. By Order entered September 18, 2009, the court denied the Respondent\u2019s motion to compel and ordered that the Plaintiffs \u201cshall provide the requested discovery upon execution of an appropriate protective order to maintain confidentiality of medical and financial records.\u201d On September 28, 2009, the Respondent filed a motion for reconsideration of the order. On October 8, 2009, the Respondent forwarded an executed Stipulation regarding confidentiality to the Plaintiffs and demanded that the outstanding discovery be provided \u201cwithin 5 business days.\u201d Less than two weeks later, the instant motion was filed. In addition to being filed prematurely, without allowing the Plaintiff time to produce the requested information, the motion was filed without any good faith efforts to resolve the discovery dispute and the relief sought, dismissal and sanctions, is not contemplated under the Maryland Rules. Where there has been a response to discovery, albeit incomplete, the only remedy is a motion for an order compelling discovery. <em>See </em>Rule 2\u2014432. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Motion, the Respondent states that the Plaintiffs \u201crefuse to produce the discovery.\u201d There is no evidence that, once the confidentiality agreement was signed, the Plaintiffs refused to produce the information and documentation requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN6\">Mixter\u2019s assertion, however, is that he had submitted the confidentiality agreement \u201cnearly two weeks before the motion to dismiss was filed\u201d and that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs should have been prepared to provide discovery responses upon receipt of the executed confidentiality agreement sought at their request.\u201d Mixter\u2019s files reflect that, contrary to Mixter\u2019s assertions, the plaintiffs had provided the requested discovery on October 26, 2009, which he believed to be inadequate. There is no documentation in the file, however, that demonstrates Mixter had acted in good faith to resolve the myriad of discovery issues. We overrule Mixter\u2019s exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motion to Dismiss was a frivolous motion directed at the opposing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Mixter notes an exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motion to Compel answers to interrogatories and the production of documents from the defendant filed in <em>Presbury </em>was frivolous, because, he argues, the motion was not premature. Judge Doory had found that the Motion to Compel was frivolous, because it was filed with a false certification that good faith efforts had been made to resolve the discovery dispute. Mixter\u2019s files from <em>Presbury </em>indicate that only one letter had been sent from Mixter to the opposition in an attempt to resolve the dispute, to which the opposition replied in an effort to address the outstanding issues. Mixter\u2019s files show that he had neither conciliated further nor described nor referenced the \u201cletter from opposing counsel informing him that, due to the fact the defendant was an out-of-state corporation, the discovery responses were not yet due\u201d, in his Motion to Compel, as required by Maryland Rule 2-431. We, accordingly, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Mixter also excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motions to Compel Supplemental Discovery, to Compel Supplemental Answers to Interrogatories, for Default Judgment and Other Sanctions and to Compel Supplemental Discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Concerning Expert Witnesses, all filed against the defense in <em>Railey, </em>were frivolous, because Judge Doory had improperly based his finding upon an opinion by the Circuit Court for Washington County in the case. The opinion, within Mixter\u2019s files from <em>Railey </em>that had been received into evidence as Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 25, provided, with regard to all four motions, that \u201cMixter and the Plaintiff proceeded in this case in bad faith and without substantial justification\u201d. We overrule Mixter\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Mixter notes an exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that he had omitted material correspondences in the Motion to Hold in Contempt Whole Foods Market, filed on July 23, 2010, during the <em>Alemu </em>litigation, because \u201c[t]he correspondence between Respondent and Whole Foods are set forth as exhibits to the motion.\u201d In an internal memorandum, included in Mixter\u2019s files, written from \u201cDonna\u201d to Mixter on May 18, 2010, she explained that \u201c[Whole Foods\u2019s Attorney] is very cooperative and wants to do everything she can to comply with the subpoenas/orders.\u201d The phone call is mentioned only in an exhibit attached to the Motion to Hold in Contempt, but without its substance or a description of Whole Foods\u2019s concerns, despite the requirements of Maryland Rule 2-431. We, accordingly, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Mixter excepts as well to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motion for Protective Order to preclude the <em>Alemu </em>plaintiff from taking a de bene esse deposition of Dr. Danziger, included a misrepresentation by omission. Judge Doory had found that Mixter had made the misrepresentation by omission by not attaching to the Motion for Protective Order, or otherwise describing, correspondences from opposing counsel, as required by Maryland Rule 2-431. Mixter\u2019s records from <em>Ale-mu </em>show that the Motion for a Protective Order included only Mixter\u2019s letters to opposing counsel, without inclusion of the return correspondence, which indicated that attempts had been made to resolve the dispute. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Mixter notes an exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Motion to Compel production of documents from the custodian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>of records of Neil J. Fagan, an attorney and putative deponent in <em>Gonzales, </em>contained a misrepresentation by omission to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and that the motion was frivolous. Judge Doory found that Mixter had requested documents from Mr. Fagan that Mr. Fagan had previously turned over to the plaintiffs attorney in <em>Gonzales </em>and that Mixter had omitted that Mr. Fagan had notified Mixter that he was no longer in possession of the requested documents before Mixter filed the motion on November 19, 2009. Mixter argues in his exception, however, that \u201c[i]t was immaterial that Mr. Fagan provided the documents responsive to Respondent\u2019s requests to [plaintiffs counsel] because the simple fact remains that the requested documents were not provided to Respondent in accordance with the subpoena.\u201d A review of Mixter\u2019s files, however, shows that, according to a letter written by Mixter on November 30, 2009, to both Mr. Fagan and the plaintiffs attorney, Mixter acknowledged that he had, on November 11, 2009, received documents responsive to the subpoena from the plaintiffs attorney.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> We, accordingly, overrule Mixter\u2019s exception as to a material omission having been made to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Mixter\u2019s records, furthermore, contain only the standard cover letter, discussed <em>supra, </em>as what he purported represented a good faith attempt at resolution of the dispute with Mr. Fagan prior to filing the Motion to Compel, but without any mention of the assurance from Mr. Fagan that he no longer had the documents nor any reference to Mixter\u2019s having received any documents responsive to the subpoena. We, accordingly, overrule this exception.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Mixter excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that he had \u201cmisrepresented a Court\u2019s Order when he filed a Motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Sanctions\u201d, while representing the plaintiff in <em>Canby. </em>In <em>Canby, </em>a dispute arose regarding whether the defendant\u2019s insurance representative had to be present at various pre-trial proceedings. Judge Doory found that Mixter had acted in derogation of a court order exempting the insurance representative\u2019s personal appearance at one such proceeding. Upon review, the defendant conceded that no order exempting the insurance representative\u2019s appearance had yet been entered at the time Mixter filed the Motion for Sanctions. We sustain this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Mixter next excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that, in the <em>Pearson </em>litigation, he had obstructed access to evidence by sending to Ms. Pearson\u2019s medical providers letters telling them not to speak to opposing counsel. Mixter argues that, technically, his actions did not violate the Circuit Court\u2019s order allowing ex parte communications. However, as Judge Melanie Shaw Geter found during the <em>Pearson </em>litigation and Judge Doory observed, \u201cthe Respondent\u2019s letters to the healthcare providers \u2018thwarts the spirit of [the] order\u2019 \u201d. Further, as discussed above, Judge Doory properly found that Mixter had intentionally sought to prevent the physicians from speaking to opposing counsel. We, therefore, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Mixter also notes an exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that he had brought and pursued the <em>Railey </em>litigation in bad faith, because opposing counsel \u201chad no idea as to what information Ms. Railey had presented to Respondent prior to the filing of the lawsuit.\u201d Mixter also excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that pursuing the <em>Railey </em>litigation against Leo Cline had been in bad faith, because it was defense counsel\u2019s \u201crefus[al] to draft the Line of Dismissal\u201d that kept Mr. Cline in the litigation. We sustain Mixter\u2019s exception as far as the record does not show he had brought the litigation in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The basis for Judge Doory\u2019s finding, however, was that the Circuit Court Judge had determined that the deposition of Ms. Railey, Mixter\u2019s client, had been \u201cdevastating\u201d to her claim against the Cochran Defendants and that, after her deposition, Mixter should have dismissed the Cochran Defendants from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the suit. Judge Doory had relied upon an unreported opinion from the Court of Special Appeals, included in Mixter\u2019s records from the <em>Railey </em>litigation, in which the intermediate appellate court vacated the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of the Cochran Defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions against Mixter. In the opinion, the Court of Special Appeals noted that \u201cin her deposition, Ms. Railey appeared to undermine the factual bases for many of the counts in the complaint\u201d and that the Cochran Defendants had appeared \u201cto generate a genuine issue as to the frivolous nature of some of [the] various motions, notices of deposition, and subpoenas advanced by [Mixter].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Furthermore, Mixter does not contend that there was any good faith basis to continue to maintain a suit against Mr. Cline, but, rather, that it was opposing counsel\u2019s responsibility to draft the line of dismissal that Mixter would file. Mixter\u2019s letter regarding dismissal of Mr. Cline was included in Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 24, which is one of the two volumes of Mixter\u2019s files from the <em>Railey </em>litigation. The letter shows that Mixter was aware that the action against Mr. Cline was baseless, but that he would only dismiss the action were opposing counsel to write the line of dismissal, as retribution for opposing counsel\u2019s threat to request costs and attorneys\u2019 fees for Mixter\u2019s bad faith pursuit of the <em>Railey </em>litigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">While I am willing to dismiss Mr. Cline from the litigation, you should know that we based our assertions against Mr. Cline based on information gleaned from your client that Mr. Cline had conducted a part of the auction held on June 28, 2008. Furthermore, I don\u2019t appreciate your Rule 1-341 threat. If you want to prepare the paperwork vis-\u00e1-vis Mr. Cline, I will agree to a dismissal (without prejudice) and we can proceed.[<footnotemark>66</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>We, accordingly, overrule Mixter\u2019s exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that pursuing the <em>Railey </em>litigation was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Mixter notes an exception to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that he used the <em>Varner </em>opinion issued in 1993 by Judge Messitte, at the time a Judge of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, to create discovery disputes and rattle witnesses. Judge Doory found that the <em>Varner </em>opinion \u201cexplains that the treating physician for a plaintiff cannot charge a fee for deposition or trial that is greater than the fee charged for the physician\u2019s usual and customary office practice.\u201d Mixter testified at length before Judge Doory about his practice of regularly including the <em>Varner </em>opinion with his subpoenas to opposing experts. When asked by Bar Counsel whether it was his \u201cintention to tell anyone, especially an expert witness, that the <em>Varner </em>decision was an appellate decision that was controlling\u201d, Mixter replied that he had not. Mixter agreed, however, that he regularly included the <em>Varner </em>opinion with letters to opposing experts informing them that it would control the method by which their fees would be determined, even though it was twenty years old and issued by one circuit court judge, prior to <em>Kilsheimer v. Dewberry &amp; Davis, </em>106 Md.App. 600, 665 A.2d 723 (1995), an opinion issued by the Court of Special Appeals, which was controlling at all relevant times that Mixter had sent the <em>Varner </em>opinion to opposing experts.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>do not disturb Judge Doory\u2019s finding that Mixter had intentionally used the <em>Varner </em>opinion to mislead experts and attempted to gain an unfair advantage, because we defer to his credibility determinations. <em>Agbaje, </em>438 Md. at 722, 93 A.3d at 277. We, therefore, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Mixter excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s finding that the Circuit Court Judge in <em>Byme-Egan </em>had granted Mixter\u2019s \u201cMotion for Contempt and for Show Cause Order, or, in the Alternative, Motion in Limine to Preclude Matthew Mulqueen from Testifying at Trial\u201d, filed on March 16, 2012, based upon misrepresentations made by Mixter in the motion that Mr. Mulqueen had been properly served with subpoenas for depositions scheduled for October 12, 2011: Mixter asserted that Mr. Mulqueen had \u201cbeen properly served with a subpoena and notice of deposition, [but] failed to appear for his October 12, 2011 deposition in this matter.\u201d In fact, however, the subpoena called for Mr. Mulqueen\u2019s attendance on November 14, 2011, rather than October 12, 2011.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Mr. Mulqueen did not appear on October 12, 2011, which precipitated Mixter sending a notice to take deposition on October 26, 2011, which he asserts was sufficient to establish a deposition on January 12, 2012, although the date on the notice was blank:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">We previously scheduled your deposition in the above-captioned case (in which you have been identified as a potential witness by Ms. Byrne-Egan) for October 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>2011.... Thus, you are in violation of the subpoena and notice of deposition which was previously served upon you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\">Accordingly, we have rescheduled your deposition for [blank]. Please call me to confirm your attendance at the deposition on that date and time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">On December 9, 2011, Mixter issued a subpoena for a deposition on January 17, 2012, at which Mr. Mulqueen did not appear. Mixter\u2019s files contain two undated green cards, which Mixter asserts were returned from the two subpoenas at issue in the Motion for Contempt. These facts do not show by clear and convincing evidence that Mixter made a material misrepresentation that Mr. Mulqueen had been properly served with deposition subpoenas. We sustain this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">With the exception of the four exceptions alleged by Mixter to the findings of fact that have been sustained, we determine that Judge Doory\u2019s findings were based on clear and convincing evidence and now turn to the exceptions Mixter filed with respect to Judge Doory\u2019s conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">B. Mixter\u2019s Exceptions to Judge Doory\u2019s Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Mixter excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 3.1, which requires that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous\u201d, by filing each of the one hundred and twenty-seven motions listed in Appendices 2, 3 and 5, as well as pursuing the <em>Railey </em>litigation. Judge Doory concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">The Court finds that each of the frivolous motions the Respondent filed as discussed herein is a violation of Rule 3.1. Additionally the Court finds that the Respondent\u2019s bringing and pursuing the <em>Railey </em>litigation violates Rule 3.1. Failure to promptly dismiss the Defendant Leo Cline is particularly egregious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">Mixter alleges that he did not violate Rule 3.1, because the motions were only inaccurate, rather than frivolous, under Maryland Rule 1-341. Mixter concedes, however, that \u201csome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>of his motions to compel did not have the appropriate documentation attached or in some instances failed to reference the full extent of the additional good faith efforts Respondent took to obtain his discovery before filing the motion,\u201d but maintains that, \u201cthis was through inadvertence and not with the intention to mislead any court\u201d. He also posits that the motions were not frivolous, because they raised meritorious claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">With respect to sixty-one of the motions identified by Judge Doory in Appendix 2 as \u201cFrivolous Motions Directed at Non-Party Witnesses\u201d, for which the evidence was clear and convincing, Judge Doory found that they \u201cwere frivolous because no valid subpoena was ever served on the witness; there was either no proof of service of the subpoena, or the subpoena was ineffective as of the date of service because it did not provide the witness the requisite 30 days to produce documents as required by Maryland Rule 2-412(c).\u201d Mixter had filed and pursued the motions by misrepresenting to the various courts that the underlying subpoenas had been served or that the subpoenas provided sufficient time for the production of documents that were being compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Judge Doory also identified the twenty-four motions contained in Appendix 3 as frivolous, based on clear and convincing evidence, because they were directed at out-of-state witnesses and \u201cthe court in which they were filed had no jurisdiction over the nonparty witness and their failure to comply with a Maryland subpoena, as such, the grounds for each of the motions was without merit.\u201d Judge Doory found that, in order to support enforcement of the subpoenas, Mixter misled the various circuit courts by omitting the states of residence of the parties under compulsion, knowing that they were out-of-state witnesses, to avoid notifying the Maryland judges that additional protocols were required. According to Judge Doory, Mixter, in the subpoenas he had issued, also had misrepresented to the out-of-state recipients that their appearance could be compelled in Maryland, even though under our Rules, their appearance could not be.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>With respect to forty-one of the motions listed in Appendix 5, Judge Doory relied on clear and convincing evidence that they \u201cwere frivolous because the Respondent either failed to make any good faith efforts to resolve the discovery disputes or the filings were filed prematurely or otherwise [did] not comply with the Maryland Rules.\u201d Under Maryland Rule 2-431, Mixter\u2014like any other attorney\u2014was required to engage in good faith efforts to resolve discovery disputes prior to filing motions to compel or for sanctions, which he failed to do, coupled with misrepresentations that he had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Mixter had attempted to enforce over one-hundred and twenty unenforceable subpoenas through meritless motions to compel in order to, as Judge Doory found, coerce his opposing parties into compliance with his excessive discovery requests by \u201cbludgeoning [them] with ... frivolous motions\u201d. Mixter\u2019s behavior was violative of Rule 3.1. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Gisriel, </em>409 Md. 331, 356-57, 974 A.2d 331, 346 (2009) (\u201cThe legal process should never be used as the Respondent did here, i.e., merely a device to apply pressure to the other parties.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Judge Doory also found, based upon clear and convincing evidence, with respect to the <em>Railey </em>litigation, that Mixter had pursued the suit \u201cin bad faith and without substantial justification\u201d, because Mixter knew that his client\u2019s deposition undercut the asserted claims. Rule 3.1 requires that attorneys \u201cinform themselves about the facts of their clients\u2019 cases and the applicable law and determine that they can make good faith arguments in support of their clients\u2019 positions.\u201d <em>Gisriel, </em>409 Md. at 355, 974 A.2d at 345, citing Rule 3.1 cmt.2. Mixter violated Rule 3.1, by continuing to pursue the <em>Railey </em>litigation after it became clear that there was no good faith basis for doing so. Accordingly, we overrule Mixter\u2019s exceptions with respect to Rule 3.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Mixter excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s conclusion that he had violated Rule 3.2, which requires that an attorney \u201cmake reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client\u201d, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>filing of frivolous motions, requesting hearings on every motion and opposition filed, generally acting in an obstructionist manner[,] failing to cooperate with opposing counsel in the orderly taking of discovery including exchanging written discovery and taking depositions, creating protracted fee disputes with experts and causing confusion for opposing parties, witnesses and the courts all knowingly and purposefully delays litigation and cannot be said to be in the best interest of the client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u201cThe effect of the Respondent\u2019s conduct\u201d, Judge Doory found, is that \u201cthe court dockets are clogged and the ordinary and proper resolution of claims is delayed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Mixter argues that Judge Doory erred, because \u201cthere is no evidence [that] Respondent\u2019s conduct delayed the litigation in any of the 22 cases at issue.\u201d He further contends that, \u201cIt is without merit to critique Respondent for routinely requesting a hearing on the motions he filed\u201d, because it was for the courts to determine if the hearings were warranted. Mixter asserts that Rule 3.2 only applies upon a finding that a case was delayed, citing <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Hermina, </em>379 Md. 503, 842 A.2d 762 (2004), or only \u201cto scenarios where either counsel did very little to advance his own client\u2019s claim or totally failed to participate in discovery\u201d, citing <em>Attorney Grievance v. Steinberg, </em>395 Md. 337, 910 A.2d 429 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">We have interpreted Rule 3.2 violations to include a situation in which an attorney pursued \u201cunwarranted motions ... thereby frustrating the opposing party\u2019s attempt to obtain rightful redress.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. McClain, </em>406 Md. 1, 14, 956 A.2d 135, 142 (2008). In <em>McClain, </em>the hearing judge found, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that McClain had engaged in tactics that were not geared towards expediting litigation, such as filing meritless motions in order to hinder the partition sale of his client\u2019s property. We determined that McClain violated Rule 3.2, because his motivation for filing the unwarranted motion was \u201cto prevent the sale of the property, thereby frustrating the opposing party\u2019s attempt to obtain rightful redress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also have indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Rule 3.2 may be the basis for discipline when an attorney files meritless recusal motions. <em>See Surratt v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>320 Md. 439, 468, 578 A.2d 745, 759 (1990) (\u201c[A] motion that turns out to be totally without basis in fact ... could be the subject of lawyer disciplinary proceedings\u201d, citing Rule 3.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Delay is not the dispositive issue under Rule 3.2,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> unlike what Mixter asserts. Judicial resources squandered on unnecessary motions, with the attendant waste of time and money experienced by opposing parties, are within the purview of Rule 3.2, as some of our sister courts have recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In <em>Obert v. Republic Western Ins. Co., </em>264 F.Supp.2d 106, 110 (D.R.I.2003), two of the attorneys for Republic Western Insurance Company had been admitted <em>pro hoc vice </em>and subsequently were ordered to show cause why that status should not be revoked \u201cbased on their actions in pursuit of an unsuccessful motion to recuse that they filed on behalf of their client\u201d in the District Court. The District Court referred the matter to a magistrate judge who concluded that the attorneys had impermissibly diverted the court\u2019s resources when they \u201cfiled an untruthful affidavit in support of the frivolous motion to disqualify\u201d in violation of Rule 3.2 of the Rhode Island Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 116. The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Court accepted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and revoked the attorneys\u2019 <em>pro hac vice </em>status. <em>See also In re Disciplinary Action against Murrin, </em>821 N.W.2d 195, 210 (Minn.2012) (Murrin violated Minnesota Rules of Professional Conduct 3.2<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> and 8.4(d),<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> by engaging \u201cin a pattern of seemingly endless pleadings that contained frivolous claims and were unnecessarily burdensome in length, violated court orders, wasted courts\u2019 resources, delayed litigation, and prejudiced the administration of justice.\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Okla. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Godlove, </em>318 P.3d 1086, 1090 (Ok.2013) (Godlove violated Rule 3.2<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> of the Oklahoma Rules of Professional Conduct by not expediting litigation when she pursued \u201cat least six cases and at least twenty-four pleadings\u201d frivolously attacking a court order and by not adhering to the rules of procedure on at least seventeen occasions in which she sought recusal of an assigned judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Mixter violated Rule 3.2 by filing over one hundred and twenty frivolous motions, which wasted valuable resources of the courts and the parties. His reliance on <em>Steinberg </em>is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Mixter also excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s conclusion that he had violated Rules 3.3(a)(1) and (a)(4). Rule 3.3(a)(1) requires that a lawyer not knowingly \u201cmake a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer\u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Rule 3.3(a)(4), similarly, requires that a lawyer shall not knowingly \u201coffer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false\u201d, and, that if a lawyer offers \u201cmaterial evidence and comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Judge Doory concluded Mixter violated Rules 3.3(a)(1) and (4) by regularly making \u201cfalse statements of material fact to the courts\u201d, as well as with \u201cthe specific misrepresentations to the court outlined in the section entitled \u2018Misrepresentations and Disregard for Court Orders and Directives\u2019\u201d and by \u201croutinely misrepresenting] that out-of-state witnesses were subject to the jurisdiction of Maryland courts, valid subpoenas were issued and properly served, dates of service, that he made good faith efforts to resolve discovery disputes prior to filing motions and that opposing parties or non-party witnesses had refused to respond to his efforts to resolve discovery disputes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Mixter urges that he did not violate Rules 3.3(a)(1) and (4) because the record is devoid of any false statement of fact that he made to the courts. Mixter also argues that \u201cwhere the documentation attached to Respondent\u2019s motions to compel were inaccurate, the fact the documentation was attached <em>proves </em>Respondent did not intend to mislead the court and certainly establishes that there was not the requisite scientor [sic] to deceive the court when filing these motions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Judge Doory found, in any event, by clear and convincing evidence, that Mixter had knowingly and intentionally made misrepresentations to various courts, to include: falsely asserting in the twenty-four motions listed in Appendix 3 that the opposing parties were properly served with subpoenas outside of Maryland; falsely certifying in the fifty-three certifications listed in Appendix 6 that he had engaged in good faith efforts at resolving discovery disputes; willfully omitting material information in connection with the twelve motions listed in Appendix 7; in the <em>Byme-Egan </em>litigation, writing a letter to Judge Motz, in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, in which he \u201cknowingly and inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>tionally mischaracterized and misrepresented\u201d the content of the opposition\u2019s motion; in the <em>Byrne-Egcm </em>litigation, also failing to inform the court, in his response to the court\u2019s Show Cause Order for Contempt, that a motion for a protective order as to the third-party defendant\u2019s mental health records was pending when he sought those same records; in the <em>Davis </em>litigation, filing a false affidavit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in which he asserted that the defendants had been properly served with copies of the complaint; in <em>Green, </em>writing letters to the clerk of the court demanding that hearings on at least five motions were required while omitting that the opposition had requested that the motions be ruled on without hearings and that some of the motions were not yet ripe; in the <em>Johnson </em>litigation, sending a letter to the clerk of the court \u201cinforming the Clerk that his Motion to Compel was unopposed, though he knew that the plaintiff had filed a timely opposition to Respondent\u2019s Motion to Compel\u201d; in <em>Keener, </em>misrepresenting to the Court of Special Appeals that it was only due to a typographical error that he had falsely framed the procedural history of the suit; in <em>Mixter, </em>asserting that a witness\u2019s discovery responses were overdue when, in fact, the witness had been served only three days prior to the date the motion was filed; and, in <em>Mixter, </em>also alleging that Dr. Conte had been properly served with a subpoena for documents when Mixter had filed the motion to compel on the same day he had mailed the subpoena underlying the motion to compel the production of documents from Dr. Conte.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">As Judge Doory found, Mixter knew that he was making misrepresentations to numerous courts, parties and witnesses. We, accordingly, overrule Mixter\u2019s exception to Judge Doory\u2019s conclusion that he had violated Rules 3.3(a)(1) and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Mixter also excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s conclusions that he had violated Rules 3.4(a), (c), (d) and (f). Rule 3.4(a) requires that an attorney not \u201cunlawfully obstruct another party\u2019s access to evidence\u201d. Judge Doory concluded that \u201cthe Respondent violated Rule 3.4(a) by obstructing the [plaintiffs expert\u2019s] access to evidence [for testing] and thereby facilitat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ing his client in the destruction of evidence in the <em>Ch\u00edneme </em>case.\u201d Mixter, however, posits that he did not violate Rule 3.4(a) because, \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence on this record that Respondent instructed his client to modify the property in question in any way\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">We overrule Mixter\u2019s exception. Judge Doory had before him clear and convincing evidence that, in the <em>Ch\u00edneme </em>litigation, Mixter\u2019s opposition filed a Request for Entry upon the Premises and the parties, thereafter, agreed to allow the expert to enter the premises to take the necessary samples and, that once the expert entered the premises, Mixter blocked the expert from gathering specimens required for testing. Mixter, therefore, obstructed access to evidence and, thereby, its preservation, in violation of Rule 3.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Judge Doory concluded also that Mixter violated Rule 3.4(c), which requires that an attorney not \u201cknowingly disobey an obligation under the rules of a tribunal\u201d, by \u201cknowingly disobeying the rules of procedure as outlined\u201d and by \u201cknowingly and intentionally disobeying] specific court orders and directives as stated in the section entitled \u2018Misrepresentations and disregard for Court Orders and Directives\u2019 \u201d. Mixter knowingly and intentionally: issued Maryland subpoenas to out-of-state witnesses, in violation of Maryland Rule 2-413(a)(2), while simultaneously violating the rules of various foreign jurisdictions, on the more than fifty occasions listed in Appendices 3 and 4; failed to follow the proper protocol per Section 4-306 of the Health-General Article of the Maryland Code in order to obtain medical records from health care providers; submitted the fifty-three Maryland Rule 2-431 certificates listed in Appendix 6 without having engaged in good faith attempts at resolving discovery disputes; issued subpoenas that provided less than thirty days for document production as required by Maryland Rule 2-412(e); delivered subpoenas by first-class mail, in violation of Maryland Rule 2-121(a)(3); attempted to prove service with falsified green cards, or without green cards altogether, contrary to Maryland Rule 2-126(a)(3); and noted depositions of in-state wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>nesses in improper counties as delineated by Maryland Rule 2-413(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Mixter excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s conclusion that he had violated Rule 3.4(c) on the same bases as his factual exceptions, that being that he did not knowingly disobey court orders or Maryland Rules, which we have already overruled. As a result, we overrule Mixter\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Under Rule 3.4(d), it is professional misconduct to \u201cmake a frivolous discovery request\u201d. Judge Doory concluded that Mixter violated Rule 3.4(d), because he \u201cabused his authority, as an officer of the court, to issue frivolous subpoenas and make frivolous discovery requests and demands\u201d. Mixter excepts on the basis that Judge Doory improperly found that the various subpoenas and discovery requests were frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">We already have recognized that Judge Doory had before him, clear and convincing evidence, that: sixty-one of Mixter\u2019s discovery motions directed at non-party witnesses listed in Appendix 2 were frivolous, because \u201cno valid subpoena was ever served on the witness; there was either no proof of service of the subpoena, or the subpoena was ineffective as of the date of service because it did not provide the witness the requisite 30 days to produce documents as required by Maryland Rule 2-412(c)\u201d; the twenty-four motions listed in Appendix 3 were frivolous discovery motions, because they sought to enforce Maryland subpoenas improperly served on out-of-state, non-party witnesses, through misrepresentations that the witnesses were properly served; the thirty-five subpoenas listed in Appendix 4 were frivolous, because they sought documents depositions of out-of-state, non-party witnesses, without complying with the applicable procedures, yet misrepresented to the recipients that their attendance could be compelled; forty-two of the discovery motions listed in Appendix 5 were frivolous, \u201cbecause the Respondent either failed to make any good faith efforts to resolve the discovery disputes or the filings were filed prematurely or otherwise do not comply with the Maryland Rules\u201d; and the motions he had filed to compel the attendance of a witness at a deposition in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>the wrong county were frivolous, because they violated Maryland Rule 2-413.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In ruling on the applicability of Rule 3.4(d) the Oklahoma Supreme Court faced a similar situation in <em>Godlove, </em>318 P.3d at 1092, with respect to their Rule 3.4(d).<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Underlying attorney Godlove\u2019s case was a final order from an Oklahoma trial court naming the trustees for the Lorice T. Wallace trust. <em>Id. </em>at 1089. Despite the final order, Godlove \u201cabused discovery by proceeding as if there had been no final determination of the trustees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1091. The Oklahoma Supreme Court determined that Godlove violated Rule 3.4(d) by filing numerous and irrelevant discovery requests. Mixter, similarly, violated Rule 3.4(d) by filing nearly one-hundred motions to compel that were based upon invalid subpoenas or contained false certifications to the various courts that he had complied with Maryland Rule 2-431 and we, therefore, overrule his exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Mixter then excepts to the conclusion that he violated Rule 3.4(f). Rule 3.4(f) requires that an attorney not \u201crequest a person other than a client to refrain from voluntarily giving relevant information to another party\u201d, with narrow exceptions, not applicable here. Judge Doory found that Mixter violated Rule 3.4(f) by \u201crequesting the plaintiffs doctors to not speak with defense counsel in <em>Pearson </em>\u201d after the Circuit Court Judge, Judge Shaw Geter, filed an Order allowing \u201cthat the attorneys for the parties to this lawsuit are permitted to engage in <em>ex parte </em>discussions with [the healthcare providers].\u201d According to Judge Doory, based upon clear and convincing evidence, Judge Shaw Geter \u201cfound that while the Respondent\u2019s letters to the healthcare providers \u2018thwarts the spirit of [the] order\u2019 they did not directly violate the order\u201d.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">A lawyer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">(d) in pretrial procedure, make a frivolous discovery request or fail to make reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally proper discovery request by an opposing party;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Mixter asserts, in conclusory fashion, that he did not violate Rule 3.4(f), because Judge Doory\u2019s conclusion was \u201cin correct [sic] on the facts and the law. Even [the Circuit Court Judge in <em>Pearson </em>] found the letters did not violate her Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AFV\">With respect to Judge Doory\u2019s conclusion that Rule 3.4(f) was violated when Mixter sent the letter to the <em>Pearson </em>physicians, we recognize that the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Pub. Law 104-191, 110 Stat.1936 (1996), codified as amended in scattered sections of Titles 18, 26, 29 and 42 of the United States Code, may have been implicated. <em>See Strayhorne v. Caruso, </em>No. 11-15216, 2014 WL 916814, at *2 (E.D.Mich. Mar. 10, 2014) (collecting cases) (\u201cThe parties recognize, and other courts have observed, that HIPAA neither permits nor prohibits such <em>ex parte </em>communications.\u201d). The record is not developed as to the HIPAA issue, however, because it was not raised by Bar Counsel nor Mixter, as it was not before us. The sanction against Mixter remains the same regardless of whether we overrule or sustain Judge Doory\u2019s conclusion that Mixter violated Rule 3.4(f). <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Snyder, </em>368 Md. 242, 261, 793 A.2d 515, 526 (2002) (electing not to address an exception the merits of which were not argued before the hearing judge, because \u201cit would not bear on the attorney\u2019s other violations and would not affect the sanction to be imposed\u201d). Therefore, we elect not to address the Rule 3.4(f) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Rule 4.1(a)(1) requires that the attorney not knowingly \u201cmake a false statement of material fact or law to a third person\u201d. Judge Doory concluded that Mixter violated Rule 4.1(a)(1) by making false statements of law to third parties regarding the enforceability of Maryland subpoenas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">The Court finds that the Respondent violated Rule 4.1(a) in that he made a false statement of law to third persons including: (1) stating, either directly or by way of motion, to witnesses that they could be held in contempt of court or subject to other sanctions for failing to appear at deposition where the witnesses were never properly served with a valid subpoena; (2) stating to non-party out-of-state wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>nesses that they were required to comply with a Maryland subpoena; (3) stating to parties or witnesses that they were compelled to appear for deposition at a location in violation of Rule 2-413.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Mixter asserts that he did not violate Rule 4.1, because he did not knowingly make misrepresentations to third parties. Judge Doory had before him clear and convincing evidence that Mixter knowingly had misrepresented to the recipients of the over fifty subpoenas listed in Appendices 3 and 4 that their appearance could be compelled in Maryland. Mixter also, as Judge Doory found, had misrepresented to numerous non-party witnesses, located in Maryland, that they could be compelled to attend a deposition in a county other than that in which they resided. Mixter, therefore, violated Rule 4.1(a)(1) on more than fifty occasions, and we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Mixter asserts that he did not violate Rule 4.4(a), which states that an attorney \u201cshall not use means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person, or use methods of obtaining evidence that the lawyer knows violate the legal rights of such a person\u201d, because his attempts to obtain medical records of various parties only failed for want of Rule compliance, and they were not done with the purpose of embarrassing, delaying or burdening a third person. Judge Doory concluded that Mixter did violate Rule 4.4(a), because he had attempted to obtain medical records, mental health records and driving records of opposing parties, in defiance of court orders and statutory restrictions, when such information served no substantial purpose in the litigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">The Court finds that the Respondent knowingly abused his authority, as an officer of court, to routinely attempt to do discovery that has no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay or burden the witnesses and/or opposing party. The Court finds that the Respondent, knowingly and intentionally sought medical records in violation of the HIPAA requirements and/or the Health-General Article by failing to properly serve medical providers with valid subpoenas and failing to send the required assurances that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>objection to the subpoenas had been made. Seeking psychiatric records contrary to court orders and seeking lifelong traffic histories would have no purpose other than to embarrass.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">In <em>McClain, </em>406 Md. at 15, 956 A.2d at 143, we determined that McClain had violated Rule 4.4(a), even though \u201cthere was no suggestion that Respondent\u2019s tactics were intended to injure [the third party] nor that he or his client bore any ill-will towards [the third party]\u201d, because McClain\u2019s actions \u201cwere pursued in total disregard for their substantial cost to [the third party], were intentionally dilatory and were without legal basis.\u201d In the instant case, similarly, Judge Doory had before him clear and convincing evidence that, during the litigation in his own case, Mixter had attempted \u201cto harass and intimidate the defendants\u201d by requesting their entire driving histories under \u201ca multitude of disingenuous arguments\u201d. As the Circuit Court Judge in <em>Mixter </em>stated, the driving records \u201chad absolutely nothing to do with the pending claim for defamation and that the subpoena was aimed solely at harassing the defendants].\u201d Mixter intentionally pursued the defendants\u2019 driving records without basis, causing his opposition to use time and resources to obtain protective orders as to their driving records, and delaying litigation, thereby violating Rule 4.4(a). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Judge Doory also had before him clear and convincing evidence that, in <em>Byme-Egan, </em>Mixter attempted to obtain the third-party defendant\u2019s mental health records, despite knowing that a motion for a protective order as to those records was pending. Even after the protective order was granted, Mixter filed a motion to compel production of the third-party defendant\u2019s mental health records in which he misrepresented to the health care provider that there had been no objection to the production of said records. Mixter\u2019s acts caused a useless waste of time and resources, in violation of Rule 4.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Judge Doory, finally, had clear and convincing evidence before him that, in <em>Koontz, </em>Mixter had issued subpoenas and filed motions which delayed discovery and burdened the oppo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>sition. Mixter had issued subpoenas to nineteen of the plaintiffs\u2019 health care providers, causing the plaintiffs to move for protective orders or to quash the subpoenas. While the motion for protective order was pending, Mixter misrepresented to the medical providers that there had been no objection to release of the records and filed motions to compel against two health care providers. None of Mixter\u2019s motions had any legal basis and only served to delay litigation because they unnecessarily required the plaintiffs to expend time and resources in addressing the motions and, therefore, violated Rule 4.4(a). We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Judge Doory also determined that Mixter violated Rule 8.4(c), which prohibits \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation\u201d, because of Mixter\u2019s \u201cusual pattern of practice ... laden with deceit and consistent misrepresentations to the courts, parties and witnesses of both fact and law\u201d. Mixter, however, urges he did not violate Rule 8.4(c), because there was not clear and convincing evidence that his actions were \u201cdesigned to bend or break the rules\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Judge Doory found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Mixter had knowingly and intentionally made many misrepresentations to the various courts, to include: falsely asserting in the twenty-four motions listed in Appendix 3 that the oppositions were properly served with subpoenas outside of Maryland; falsely certifying in the fifty-three certifications listed in Appendix 6 that he had engaged in good faith efforts at resolving discovery disputes; willfully omitting material information in connection with the twelve motions listed in Appendix 7; in <em>Alemu, </em>by omitting from a Motion for Protective Order to preclude the opposition from taking a de bene esse deposition of an expert, return correspondence from opposing counsel indicating that attempts had been made to resolve the dispute; in the <em>Byme-Egan </em>litigation, writing a letter to Judge Motz, in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, in which he \u201cknowingly and intentionally mischaracterized and misrepresented\u201d the content of the opposition\u2019s motion; in the <em>Byme-Egan </em>litigation, also failing to inform the court, in his response to the court\u2019s show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>cause order for contempt, that a motion for a protective order as to the third-party defendant\u2019s mental health records was pending when he sought those same records; in the <em>Davis </em>litigation, filing a false affidavit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in which he asserted that the defendants had been properly served with copies of the complaint; in <em>Fitzgerald, </em>by omitting from his Motion to Compel medical records from the United States Department of Health and Human Services letters he had received from the Department notifying him that he was required to first obtain the patient\u2019s consent for the release of the documents; in the <em>Gonzales </em>litigation, by omitting from his Motion to Compel the production of documents from Mr. Fagan correspondences from Mr. Fagan indicating that he had previously turned the requested documents over to Mixter\u2019s opposition; in <em>Green, </em>writing letters to the clerk of the court demanding that hearings on at least five motions were required while omitting that the opposition had requested that the motions be ruled on without hearings and that several of the motions were not yet ripe; in the <em>Johnson </em>litigation, sending a letter to the clerk of the court \u201cinforming the Clerk that his Motion to Compel was unopposed, though he knew that the plaintiff had filed a timely opposition to Respondent\u2019s Motion to Compel\u201d; in <em>Keener, </em>misrepresenting to the Court of Special Appeals that it was only due to a typographical error that he had falsely framed the procedural history of the suit; in <em>Mixter, </em>asserting that a witness\u2019s discovery responses were overdue when, in fact, the witness had been served only three days prior to the date the motion was filed; and, in <em>Mixter, </em>also alleging that Dr. Conte had been properly served with a subpoena for documents when Mixter had, in fact, filed the motion to compel on the same day he had mailed the subpoena underlying the motion to compel the production of documents from Dr. Conte.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Mixter engaged in dishonest and misrepresentative actions in violation of Rule 8.4(c), and we overrule his exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Mixter, finally, excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 8.4(d), which requires that an attorney not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\u201cengage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d, because, he asserts, \u201cThere is no clear and convincing evidence that Respondent\u2019s actions are designed to bend or break the rules, nor are they designed to bully, harass or intimidate both parties and witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Judge Doory concluded that Mixter violated Rule 8.4(d), because his conduct \u201cwithout question, brings the profession into disrepute\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">Most assuredly, the Respondent\u2019s conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d). The Respondent\u2019s pattern of practice is to bend and break the rules to bully, harass and attempt to intimidate both parties and witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">The Respondent conducts discovery and pretrial depositions by bludgeoning his opponents and witnesses with unreasonable demands, frivolous motions and unnecessary acrimony. The effect of the Respondent\u2019s conduct is clear: his opponents and witnesses are forced to spend time and money and expend emotional energy defending against his frivolous requests and demands, the court dockets are clogged and the ordinary and proper resolution of claims is delayed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">This is not a case of walking up to the line in the name of zealous representation. This is a case of consistent knowing and intentional violation of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct. The Respondent\u2019s argument that his actions are defensible in the name of \u201czealous representation\u201d is rejected. Although zealousness is a standard of proper representation, zealousness without the counterbalance of reasonableness amounts to obstreperousness and unfairness. While the vigorous representation of a client\u2019s interests is laudable, the Court cannot condone the Respondent\u2019s conduct which, without question, brings the profession into disrepute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice is that which \u201c \u2018impacts negatively the public\u2019s percep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>tion or efficacy of the courts or legal profession.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v.

We have said that \u201c \u2018conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice\u2019 \u201d should not be given a \u201c \u2018restricted meaning\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c \u2018the duty rests upon the courts, and the profession as a whole, to uphold the highest standards of professional conduct and to protect the public from imposition by the unfit or unscrupulous practitioner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v.

An attorney, finally, engages in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice when he or she files \u201cfrivolous motions,\u201d engages in \u201cintentionally dilatory tactics\u201d and makes repeated misrepresentations to the courts. <em>McClain, </em>406 Md. at 16, 956 A.2d at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Mixter impugned the efficacy of the courts and the legal profession by making over one hundred and twenty misrepresentations in twenty-two cases before numerous courts. As an officer of the court, Mixter was expected to manifest integrity, but, instead, he repeatedly made misrepresentations to various tribunals in an effort to abuse and browbeat his opponents into complying with his excessive and unnecessary discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Mixter, additionally, was abusive towards his colleagues at the Bar. In his own case, Mixter pursued an action for defamation in an effort to harass opposing counsel from previous suits, as well as those who had complained to Bar Counsel about his misbehavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Mixter, also, sullied the reputation of the courts, the profession and the legal system with the public as a result of his interactions with third parties. Mixter has conceded that, \u201cThere certainly are examples where the person on the receiving end of Respondent\u2019s conduct may have felt harassed or even that Respondent was attempting to intimidate him or her.\u201d He also, regularly and unscrupulously attempted to obtain medical records irrelevant to the various cases, (as with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Ms. Seay\u2019s mental health records in Byme-Egan), purely to harass members of the public. Rule 8.4(d) clearly prohibits such behavior. <em>See id. </em>at 16, 956 A.2d at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Finally, subsection (a) of Rule 8.4 states that it is professional misconduct to violate the Rules; consequently, a Rule violation is itself sufficient to support a violation of Rule 8.4(a). <em>Attorney Grievance v. Nelson, </em>425 Md. 344, 40 A.3d 1039 (2012). As stated above, Mixter had repeatedly violated a copious number of Rules and had, therefore, violated Rule 8.4(a). In summary, Respondent violated Rules 3.1, 3.2, 3.3(a)(1) and (a)(4), 3.4(a), (c) and (d), 4.1(a)(1), 4.4(a) and 8.4(a), (c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">C. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">When determining appropriate sanctions, it is well settled that the purpose of attorney discipline is to protect the public, not punish the attorney. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Coppola, </em>419 Md. 370, 19 A.3d 431 (2011). Attorney discipline is also directed at deterring other lawyers from violating the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct and to maintain the integrity of the legal profession. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. 341, 872 A.2d 693 (2005). We evaluate an attorney grievance matter on its own merits and impose sanctions \u201cthat are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Gore, </em>380 Md. 455, 472, 845 A.2d 1204, 1213 (2004). Therefore, we consider the nature of the ethical duties violated in light of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. 586, 911 A.2d 440 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">With regard to aggravating factors, we often consult Standard 9.22 of the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Hodes, </em>441 Md. 136, 206, 105 A.3d 533 (2014):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">(a) prior disciplinary offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">(b) dishonest or selfish motive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">(c) a pattern of misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>(d) multiple offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\">(e) bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">(f) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">(g) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">(h) vulnerability of victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">(i) substantial experience in the practice of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">(j) indifference to making restitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">(k) illegal conduct, including that involving the use of controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-11\"><em>Standard 9.22 of the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions </em>(1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Here, aggravating factors (a), (c), (d), (g) and (i) are present, because Mixter had previously been reprimanded for abusive discovery tactics, some of which have been replicated in this case, which include acts after 2008, when Mixter was previously sanctioned. Mixter has also evidenced a clear pattern of misconduct over twenty-two cases, has refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of any of his actions and has substantial experience in the law, having represented thousands of clients since being admitted to the Bar of this Court thirty-four years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">Factor (a), \u201cprior disciplinary offenses\u201d, is present here, because Mixter received a reprimand, by consent, from this Court for Rule 3.2 and 8.4(d) violations in 2008. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Mixter, </em>403 Md. 463, 943 A.2d 615 (2008). Bar Counsel summarized the reprimand as follows, to which Mixter does not except:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-14\">By Order of the Court of Appeals dated March 7, 2008, Respondent received a reprimand for violating Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.2 and 8.4(d). Specifically, Respondent during the course of representing a defendant in a civil matter, failed to cooperate with counsel for the other parties with respect to scheduling depositions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>failed to timely answer requests for his availability for depositions, and scheduled depositions without input. Additionally, Respondent filed motions that, at least in part, caused delay and prevented the expeditious conclusion of discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Factor (c), \u201cpattern of misconduct\u201d, is evidenced when an attorney\u2019s actions constitute the same course of conduct. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kerpelman, </em>292 Md. 228, 244, 438 A.2d 501, 509 (1981) (\u201cIf we could conclude that this was a pattern of conduct we would not hesitate to disbar.\u201d). Mixter\u2019s misrepresentations to courts include: falsely asserting in the twenty-four motions listed in Appendix 3 that the oppositions were properly served with subpoenas outside of Maryland; falsely certifying in the fifty-three certifications listed in Appendix 6 that he had engaged in good faith efforts at resolving discovery disputes; willfully omitting material information in connection with the twelve motions listed in Appendix 7; as well as numerous specific cases, including, in the <em>Davis </em>litigation, filing a false affidavit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in which he asserted that the defendants had been properly served with copies of the complaint; and, in <em>Mixter, </em>alleging that Dr. Conte had been properly served with a subpoena for documents when Mixter had filed the motion to compel on the same day he had mailed the subpoena underlying that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Mixter\u2019s misrepresentations to witnesses and third parties include: threatening the recipients of the over fifty subpoenas listed in Appendices 3 and 4 that their appearance could be compelled in Maryland, when it could not; informing numerous non-party witnesses, located in Maryland, that they could be compelled to attend a deposition in a county other than that in which they reside, when they could not; and notifying several health care providers that the subjects of the medical records Mixter had requested had not objected to disclosure of the records, when they, in fact, had.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">From the copious number of misrepresentations made with respect to the papers listed in each Appendix, as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>numerous additional misrepresentations found by Judge Doory, it is clear that Mixter engaged in several \u201cpattern[s] of misconduct\u201d, to include: misrepresenting proper service to courts; misrepresenting to courts that good faith attempts at resolving discovery disputes had been attempted; misrepresenting the law to third parties regarding compelling discovery; and misrepresenting to health care providers that there had been no objections to the release of certain records.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Factor (d), \u201cmultiple offenses\u201d, is implicated when an attorney violates multiple disciplinary rules. <em>See Hodes, </em>at 206-08, 105 A.3d 533 citing <em>Attorney Grievance v. Bleecker, </em>414 Md. 147, 994 A.2d 928 (2010) (aggravating factor (d) is implicated when a lawyer violates multiple disciplinary rules). We have concluded that Mixter violated Rule 3.1, 3.2, 3.3(a)(1) and (a)(4), 3.4(a), (c) and (d), 4.1(a)(1), 4.4(a) and 8.4(a), (c) and (d), therefore, aggravating factor (d) is included here.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Factor (g), \u201crefusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct\u201d, is also implicated. Mixter has not once acknowledged that he had committed any improper act and, even when he has recognized that \u201c[tjhere certainly are examples where the person on the receiving end of Respondent\u2019s conduct may have felt harassed\u201d, Mixter asserts that those feelings are \u201csubjective\u201d and, seemingly, irrelevant, because, he argues, no one was \u201cintimidated to the point that he or she changed their course of action\u201d. Out of Mixter\u2019s one-hundred and six pages of exceptions, he only asserts, in one sentence, that he is \u201csincerely remorseful\u201d, without elaboration. Factor (g) is clearly relevant. <em>See Hodes, </em>at 208, 105 A.3d 533 (\u201c[Respondent\u2019s] remorselessness further intensifies the nefariousness of his conduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Factor (i), \u201csubstantial experience in the practice of law\u201d, finally, is applicable. Mixter has been a member of the Maryland Bar for over thirty-four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">With respect to mitigating factors, we have considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgA\">\u201cAbsence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><em>Attorney Grievance v. O\u2019Leary, </em>433 Md. 2, 31, 69 A.3d 1121, 1138 (2013), quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Brown, </em>426 Md. 298, 326, 44 A.3d 344, 361 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Judge Doory determined that Mixter had proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, various mitigating factors, to include: attending to his mother during her fatal bout with cancer from January through July of 2010; caring for his wife in April through June of 2012 during her diagnosis, treatment and convalescence from a brain tumor; dealing with his, now controlled, Atrial Fibrillation<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> in 2008 through 2009; and modifying his office procedure to require additional calls and letters to witnesses to resolve discovery issues, but, as Judge Doory noted, without working with opposing counsel to solve problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Judge Doory found that Mixter did not prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, other purported mitigation, to include: consulting with Dr. Carroll, at the behest of trial counsel, to find better ways to deal with what Dr. Carroll described as Mixter\u2019s \u201cultra competitive personality\u201d; that the twenty-two cases here at issue are a mere three percent of Mixter\u2019s caseload and, therefore, insignificant; that Mixter had to work within court imposed deadlines which was a source of additional stress; and that Mixter\u2019s clients hold him in high regard. Mixter excepts to the failure to find these circumstances as mitigation, as well as to the failure to find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>that he cooperated with Bar Counsel and that he did not misrepresent any facts to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">With respect to Mixter\u2019s cooperation with Bar Counsel, Judge Doory noted that Mixter provided \u201cextensive records and documents\u201d and did not interfere with Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation and, therefore, we consider this as mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Regarding Mixter\u2019s work with Dr. Carroll, Judge Doory found that Mixter failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he sincerely attempted to change his abusive and misrepresentative practices, because Mixter had met with Dr. Carroll \u201cseven times beginning in late 2012\u201d, four years after his reprimand in 2008 and then only at the behest of trial counsel. We agree with Judge Doory that Mixter did not prove sincere attempts to change his practice by a preponderance of the evidence, and we overrule his exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Judge Doory made no findings that Mixter recognized the wrongfulness of his actions. Mixter\u2019s lack of remorse is an aggravating factor, in light of his grudging one-liner that acknowledged any regret out of over one hundred pages of exceptions. We, accordingly, overrule Mixter\u2019s exception that he had proven his remorsefulness by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Mixter repeatedly has urged that he was only acting as a zealous advocate for his clients, which Judge Doory should have considered a mitigating factor. We have addressed the role of zealous advocacy in the context of Rules violations in <em>McClain, </em>406 Md. 1, 956 A.2d 135. McClain argued that a sanction less than disbarment was appropriate for actions violative of Rules 1.1,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> 3.1, 3.2, 3.3(a), 4.4(a), 8.2(a)<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> and 8.4(c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>and (d), \u201cbecause he was not motivated by personal gain, but rather an overzealous desire to protect his client\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18, 956 A.2d at 145. We rejected that McClain\u2019s intent \u201cto further his client\u2019s interests ... is compelling enough for us to impose less of a sanction than disbarment\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 20, 956 A.2d at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Culver, </em>381 Md. 241, 282, 849 A.2d 423, 447-48 (2004), we reiterated that zealous advocacy is important to representing a client, but that it neither excuses nor mitigates Rule violations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">To be sure, \u201cthe American lawyer\u2019s professional model is that of zeal.... \u201d C. Wolfram, <em>Modem Legal Ethics, </em>\u00a7 10.3.1, Nature of the Principle of Zeal, at 578 (1986). But zeal is not boundless and some limits are acknowledged by all, although the limits are not always clear. <em>Id. </em>at 579. <em>See Little v. Duncan, </em>14 Md.App. 8, 15, 284 A.2d 641, 644 (1971) (stating that \u201c[z]eal in advocacy is commendable, but zeal, even in advocacy, without bounds may be contemptuous and disruptive\u201d); <em>In re Hockett, </em>303 Or. 150, 734 P.2d 877, 884 (1987) (noting that \u201c[zjealous representation is limited by more than the criminal law\u201d). Judge Arrie Davis, writing for the Court of Special Appeals, commented on the duty of an attorney to exercise zealous advocacy. He noted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">\u201cLest there be any doubt that we favor\u2014indeed believe an adversary system demands no less\u2014zealous advocacy, we reiterate unequivocally that it is an advocate\u2019s duty to use legal procedure for the fullest benefit of the client\u2019s cause, but it is also a duty not to abuse legal procedure. <em>See </em>Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, Comment to Rule 3.1.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\"><em>Reed v. Baltimore Life, </em>127 Md.App. 536, 552-53, 733 A.2d 1106, 1114-15 (1999).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Accordingly, we overrule Mixter\u2019s exception that his alleged zealous advocacy should be considered a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Mixter excepts to Judge Doory\u2019s failure to find his high volume practice as a mitigating factor, pointing to <em>Dore, </em>433 Md. 685, 73 A.3d 161 and <em>Attorney Grievance v. Geesing, </em>436 Md. 56, 80 A.3d 718 (2013), for support. <em>Dore </em>and <em>Geesing, </em>in fact, support Judge Doory\u2019s finding that Mixter\u2019s high volume practice was not a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In <em>Dore, </em>the attorney had \u201cauthorized his employees to sign his name on affidavits filed in foreclosure actions\u201d and the employees \u201cnotarized the bogus signatures\u201d to expedite Dore\u2019s firm in handling as many as 1,200 foreclosure filings per month. 433 Md. at 689, 690, 73 A.3d at 163, 164. Dore urged, for purposes of mitigation, that his behavior should have been considered in light of the high volume of filings his firm was facing. We rejected Dore\u2019s argument, noting instead that \u201c[c]ases not limited to a single violation or to one client\u2014even when the attorney\u2019s conduct is unintentional\u2014call for a more severe sanction\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 723, 73 A.3d at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In <em>Geesing, </em>a case in which we applied <em>Dore, </em>we suspended an attorney ninety days for \u201crobo-signing\u201d over 2,500 affidavits in foreclosure suits.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> 436 Md. at 58, 80 A.3d at 719. Despite Geesing\u2019s assertion that the high volume of his practice was a mitigating factor, we recognized that the high volume was, in fact, an aggravating factor, because Geesing had shown a pattern of misconduct and committed over 2,500 offenses. We also acknowledged that the high volume of filings required more diligence from Geesing, not less. The <em>Geesing </em>concurrence, finally, which had urged a lesser sanction, recognized that a significant sanction was still required \u201cgiven the high volume of these flawed mortgage affidavits\u201d. <em>Geesing, </em>436 Md. at 71, 80 A.3d at 727 (Adkins, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Mixter\u2019s attempt to find succor, then, in <em>Dore </em>and <em>Geesing </em>is unavailing, as we have recognized that a large volume practice only increases the need for diligence.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> We, accordingly, overrule Mixter\u2019s exception on the grounds that his high volume practice should be a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">With the aggravating and mitigating factors in mind, we turn to determining the appropriate sanction. Bar Counsel recommends disbarment in the present case, because \u201cRespondent engaged in intentionally dishonest, deceitful and misleading conduct.\u201d Mixter suggests that a public reprimand is appropriate, because he had made no misappropriation of funds, and \u201c[a] reprimand will acknowledge [the] serious nature of Respondent\u2019s misconduct\u201d as well as \u201cserve as a permanent warning to Respondent Mixter and to other lawyers that misconduct carries serious consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\u201cWe long have held that repeated acts of dishonest, fraudulent, or misleading behavior may warrant a sanction of disbarment\u201d, even in the absence of misappropriation of client funds. <em>Steinberg, </em>395 Md. at 373, 910 A.2d at 450. When an attorney \u201cengage[s] in intentional dishonest conduct ... the bar is set especially high, and disbarment will be the appropriate sanction\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 375, 910 A.2d at 451. \u201cCandor and truthfulness are two of the most important moral character traits of a lawyer.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Mixter has made hundreds of repeated misrepresentations, to include: falsely asserting in the twenty-four motions listed in Appendix 3 that the oppositions were properly served with subpoenas outside of Maryland; falsely certifying in the fifty-three certifications listed in Appendix 6 that he had engaged in good faith efforts at resolving discovery disputes; willfully omitting material information in connection with the twelve motions listed in Appendix 7; in <em>Alemu, </em>by omitting from a Motion for Protective Order to preclude the opposition from taking a de bene esse deposition of an expert, return correspondence from opposing counsel indicating that attempts had been made to resolve the dispute; in the <em>Byrne-Egan </em>litigation, writing a letter to Judge Motz, in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, in which he \u201cknowingly and intentionally mischaracterized and misrepresented\u201d the content of the opposition\u2019s motion; in the <em>Byrne-Egan </em>litigation, also failing to inform the court, in his response to the court\u2019s show cause order for contempt, that a motion for a protective order as to the third-party defendant\u2019s mental health records was pending when he sought those same records; in the <em>Davis </em>litigation, filing a false affidavit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in which he asserted that the defendants had been properly served with copies of the complaint; in <em>Fitzgerald, </em>by omitting from his Motion to Compel medical records from the United States Department of Health and Human Services letters he had received from the Department notifying him that he was required to first obtain the patient\u2019s consent for the release of the documents; in the <em>Gonzales </em>litigation, by omitting from his Motion to Compel the production of documents from Mr. Fagan correspondences from Mr. Fagan indicating that he had previously turned the requested documents over to Mixter\u2019s opposition; in <em>Green, </em>writing letters to the clerk of the court demanding that hearings on at least five motions were required while omitting that the opposition had requested that the motions be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>ruled on without hearings and that several of the motions were not yet ripe; in the <em>Johnson </em>litigation, sending a letter to the clerk of the court \u201cinforming the Clerk that his Motion to Compel was unopposed, though he knew that the plaintiff had filed a timely opposition to Respondent\u2019s Motion to Compel\u201d; in <em>Keener, </em>misrepresenting to the Court of Special Appeals that it was only due to a typographical error that he had falsely framed the procedural history of the suit; in <em>Mixter, </em>asserting that a witness\u2019s discovery responses were overdue when, in fact, the witness had been served only three days prior to the date the motion was filed; in <em>Mixter, </em>also alleging that Dr. Conte had been properly served with a subpoena for documents when Mixter had, in fact, filed the motion to compel on the same day he had mailed the subpoena underlying the motion to compel the production of documents from Dr. Conte; stating to witnesses that they could be held in contempt of court for failing to appear at depositions even though they had not been properly served with enforceable subpoenas; stating to non-party, out-of-state witnesses, that they were required to comply with a Maryland subpoena; stating to parties or witnesses that they could be compelled to appear for depositions at a location in violation of Rule 2-413; and informing health care providers that no objection had been made to the disclosure of medical information when, in fact, such objections had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Contrary to Mixter\u2019s assertion, a finding of misappropriation of client funds is not a prerequisite to disbarment. In <em>Steinberg, </em>395 Md. 337, 910 A.2d 429, the attorney violated Rules 3.3, 4.1 and 8.4(c) by making several false statements of material fact, to include: misrepresenting in a Motion to Reconsider an order granting a trustees\u2019 sale that his client had not been notified of the sale when, in fact, the client had been duly notified; misrepresenting to opposing counsel that his client refused to be deposed when the client made no such objection; and informing opposing counsel and his client, following Steinberg\u2019s discharge, that he had filed a motion to withdraw, which he had not done until months later. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>disbarred Steinberg in light of his numerous misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Underlying <em>Myers, </em>333 Md. 440, 635 A.2d 1315, where we also disbarred an attorney without a finding of misappropriation, were the attorney\u2019s repeated acts of misrepresentation. Myers had previously been suspended from the practice of law for lying to Bar Counsel during an investigation. After his reinstatement, Myers falsely testified before a district court judge regarding his driving history. We opined that, what set Myers apart from those instances where an attorney had committed a single isolated misrepresentation and not been disbarred, was that both instances of Myers\u2019s misconduct involved misrepresentation, in violation of Rules 3.3(a)(1) and 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Most recently, in <em>Buehler, </em>a reciprocal discipline case, we noted that \u201cBuehler\u2019s gravest transgressions are his repeated misrepresentations.\u201d <em>Buehler, </em>441 Md. at 246, 107 A.3d 1152. We disbarred Buehler in light of his repeated misrepresentations to the court as well has his failure to appear at scheduled hearings, his pursuit of meritless proceedings and his failure to notify Bar Counsel of disciplinary proceedings against him in another jurisdiction; there was no finding of misappropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Although Mixter urges as discipline a second reprimand, in cases of dishonesty we have imposed significant \u201ctime out\u201d from the practice of law, as acknowledged in <em>Dore </em>and <em>Geesing, </em>cases suggested by Mixter, in which significant mitigation was present. In <em>Dore, </em>we suspended the attorney for ninety days, rather than imposing a greater sanction, \u201cbecause of the many mitigating circumstances\u201d, to include: Dore had \u201cnever been disciplined nor ha[d] he ever been a respondent in a case filed in the Court of Appeals by the Attorney Grievance Commission\u201d; Dore had \u201cdecided to have his name listed in the signature block of documents filed in foreclosure cases to protect his employees from harassment ... and threats of violence by borrowers whose homes were in foreclosure\u201d; Dore had \u201cimmediately stopped the offending practice\u201d upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>receipt of a private admonition regarding his practice from a circuit court judge; \u201cno one ha[d] cited any inaccuracies in the[ ] Affidavits\u201d, demonstrating that the firm\u2019s \u201creview of the files prior to signing them was thorough\u201d; Dore had self-reported his misconduct to Bar Counsel; Dore had a good character and reputation in the community; and, according to the hearing judge, Dore \u201crecognize[d] his errors and [was] truly remorseful for this conduct.\u201d <em>Dore, </em>433 Md. at 699-702, 727, 73 A.3d at 169-71, 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">In <em>Geesing, </em>we also recognized the existence of a number of significant mitigating factors. Once Geesing became aware that it was improper to authorize staff members to sign documents in his name in foreclosure filings, he took immediate remedial action, to include: e-mailing his entire firm to inform them he would no longer \u201crobo-sign\u201d; recommending that his firm, at its own expense, dismiss the foreclosure actions and re-file them with appropriate documents (at a cost of over $12,000); identifying about 2,500 actions in which he recommended that he be allowed to file a \u201ccorrective affidavit\u201d at a cost of about $140,000; and reporting himself to the Attorney Grievance Commission. <em>Geesing, </em>436 Md. at 60-62, 80 A.3d at 720-22. Geesing, finally, \u201cshowed remorse for his misconduct, not merely because of the attorney disciplinary proceeding, but mainly because he dishonored his profession and disappointed his partners and his family, and because others may view the judicial process negatively as a result of his misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 80 A.3d at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In this case, in which Mixter has made hundreds of misrepresentations without remorse or attempt to rectify his transgressions, and has, instead, attempted to excuse his abusive discovery practices, disbarment is the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Respondent Mark T.

Without exception, these senior practitioners opined that professionalism has declined over the years. The decline is marked by rancorous discovery disputes; a loss of trust between lawyers (resulting in an increase in \"defensive practices,\u201d for instance, the perceived need to memorialize every discussion with a confirmatory letter); a breakdown of the traditional mentoring of new lawyers; an increase in the unauthorized practice of law; a lack of civility in and out of the courtroom; the failure of courtroom attorneys to treat witnesses and each other with respect; and an increase in lawyer advertising.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Judge Gorsuch of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit recently echoed the sentiments of the Maryland Judicial Task Force, observing that trial judges regularly \"live and breathe [discovery] problems; they have a strong situation sense about what is and isn\u2019t acceptable conduct\u201d, and when discovery disputes evolve into discovery abuses, the merits of the case are forgotten and the time and resources of the parties and attorneys are needlessly wasted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">Back in 1937 the drafters of the Federal Rules promised that their project would help ensure \"the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 1. To date, that promise remains elusive, more aspirational than descriptive. But it is surely the case that if court orders can be repeatedly flouted we will only retreat further from the goal. When a party feels at liberty to disobey not just a discovery request but two court orders compelling production of the same material in its control, weeks or months (as in this case) pass without progress in the litigation. Hours, days, weeks or lawyers\u2019 time are consumed at great expense. Focus shifts from the merits to the collateral and needless. This is not speedy, inexpensive, or just. Just the opposite. And no doubt tolerating such behavior would encourage only more of it. But there is such thing as discovery karma. Discovery misconduct often may be seen as tactically advantageous at first. But just as our good and bad deeds eventually tend to catch up with us, so do discovery machinations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\"><em>Lee v.

The six findings by Judge Doory are that: the <em>Alemu </em>defendants\u2019 motion to exclude Dr. Mark Danziger, a Washington D.C. resident, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>frivolous, because the underlying subpoena did not properly compel the attendance of an out-of-state witness; the Maryland subpoena to the custodian of records for Joseph Cammarata, in <em>Alemu, </em>was improperly directed at a non-Maryland resident seeking the production of documents; the Maryland subpoena directed to Bartley Eckhardt, in <em>Alemu, </em>was improper, because the expert lived outside of Maryland; the Maryland subpoena to the custodian of records for Capital Reporting, a Washington D.C. entity, in <em>Alemu, </em>improperly sought documents from a non-Maryland citizen; the Maryland subpoena to Larry Dinoff, an expert in <em>Alemu, </em>was improperly directed at a non-Maryland resident; and the Maryland subpoena for Thomas Grogan, a non-Maryland expert in <em>Pearson, </em>was improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\">. The subpoena forms for the various Maryland venues include three options: for personal appearance of the witness; for only the production of documents or objects from the witness; and for the personal appearance of the witness along with the production of documents or objects from the witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b527-6\">. We also note that Judge Doory found the motion was frivolous as the subpoena had been served on out-of-state witnesses, Bally\u2019s Total Fitness Corporate Office, California and Amgolf, Virginia, without a record that the proper protocols for those jurisdictions were followed. Additionally, Judge Doory found that subpoena served on United Flealthcare and the Worker\u2019s Compensation Commission were without compliance with Section 4-306 of the Health-General Article of the Maryland Code, and subsequent motions to compel were, therefore, frivolous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">. The <em>Canby </em>defendant filed an opposition to the Motion to Compel in which she asserted that Mixter's motion was frivolous for a number of reasons, including that \u201cthe purported Notice of Deposition does not afford the Dental Board the requisite thirty (30) days required by Maryland Rule 2-412(c).\u2019\u2019 The Dental Board also filed a motion to quash the subpoena on the grounds that the documents requested were statutorily-protected, confidential records. At the trial in <em>Canby, </em>the Circuit Court Judge ultimately denied Mixter\u2019s request that a representative of the Dental Board be permitted to testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b529-6\">. Paragraph 2 of the Association\u2019s filing states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">The Subpoena improperly states the location of the deposition is the offices of the Mark T.

Therefore, pursuant to Md. 2-413, the Subpoena is invalid and unenforceable.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\">.

In three separate paragraphs in Ms. Seay\u2019s Motion for a Protective Order she repeated that psychiatric damages were not being sought.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b532-9\">. In his exceptions, Mixter refers to the Motion for Contempt as a Motion to Compel. Judge Doory, however, made no findings with regards to a Motion to Compel Dr. Barnes and we conclude that Mixter had intended to refer to the Motion for Contempt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\">.
