In its pretrial statement, Petitioner withdrew its allegation that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.2(a). At the conclusion of the October 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>2013, hearing, Petitioner withdrew its allegations that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.4(a)(4) and MLRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b61-5\">BARBERA, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">On May 14, 2013, Petitioner, the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland, acting through Bar Counsel, filed with this Court a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action (the \u201cPetition\u201d) against Respondent, attorney Ronald Claude Brigerman, Jr. The Petition alleged violations of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) in connection with Respondent\u2019s abandonment of one client, failure to communicate with several clients, misrepresentation to a client and Petitioner, and failure to cooperate with Petitioner\u2019s investigation. Specifically, the Petition alleged that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1 (competence); MLRPC 1.2 (scope of representation and allocation of authority between client and lawyer); MLRPC 1.3 (diligence); MLRPC 1.4(a) and (b) (communication); MLRPC 1.15(a), (c), and (d) (safekeeping property); MLRPC 1.16(d) (declining or terminating representation); MLRPC 8.1(a) and (b) (bar admission and disciplinary matters); MLRPC 8.4(a), (c), and (d) (misconduct); and Maryland Rule 16-604 (trust account\u2014required deposits).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">On May 20, 2013, this Court designated the Honorable Leah J. Seaton of the Circuit Court for Dorchester County (the \u201chearing judge\u201d) to conduct an evidentiary hearing and render written findings of fact and conclusions of law. Respondent was served with process, in compliance with Maryland Rule 16-753, and, after he requested and was granted an extension, filed an Answer to the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action on August 1, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">The evidentiary hearing was held before the hearing judge on October 16, 2013. Thereafter, the hearing judge issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law, in which she concluded, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>had violated MLRPC 1.1; MLRPC 1.3; MLRPC 1.4(a) and (b) ; MLRPC 1.15(a), (c), and (d); MLRPC 1.16(d); MLRPC 8.1(a) and (b); MLRPC 8.4(a), (c), and (d); and Maryland Rule 16-604. On December 20, 2013, Petitioner filed Petitioner\u2019s Exceptions and Recommendation for Sanction (\u201cPetitioner\u2019s Exceptions\u201d), excepting to one of the hearing judge\u2019s legal conclusions. Respondent filed no exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">On September 4, 2014, this Court held oral argument. On September 10, 2014, we issued an Order of Remand, directing the hearing judge to clarify part of her discussion of the alleged mitigating circumstances in Respondent\u2019s case. The hearing judge then issued Supplemental Findings and/or Conclusions of Law as to Mitigating Factors (\u201cSupplemental Findings\u201d) on September 30, 2014. Petitioner filed its response to the Supplemental Findings on October 9, 2014, and Respondent filed his response on October 14, 2014, in which he recommended a reprimand as the appropriate sanction for his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Upon this Court\u2019s review of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as the Supplemental Findings, we hold that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1; MLRPC 1.3; MLRPC 1.4(a) and (b); MLRPC 1.15(a), (c), and (d); MLRPC 1.16(d); MLRPC 8.1(a) and (b); MLRPC 8.4(a), (c) , and (d); and Maryland Rule 16-604. We further hold, under the particular circumstances of this case, that the appropriate sanction is indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">We summarize, below, the hearing judge\u2019s written findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">Respondent graduated from the University of Baltimore School of Law in 1989. Thereafter and until sometime in 1993, he worked in a non-lawyer capacity for State Farm Insurance Company. From 1993 to 2001, Respondent handled bodily injury claims for Nationwide Insurance Company. Respondent was admitted to the Bar of this Court on December 16, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The current disciplinary matter stems from three separate complaints brought by three of Respondent\u2019s former clients, Kent Brummell, Renee Copper, and Terry Holden.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\n<em>Complaint of Kent Brummell</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In 2010, Kent Brummell (\u201cMr. Brummell\u201d) retained Respondent to defend him in a criminal prosecution. Mr. Brummell was found guilty and sentenced to 35 years of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">On January 11, 2012, Mr. Brummell filed a complaint with Petitioner, citing Respondent\u2019s failure to provide him with copies of documents from his case file. Mr. Brummell alleged that he had requested those documents several times prior to filing his complaint -with Petitioner but had received no reply from Respondent. Thereafter, Petitioner commenced an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">In a letter to Petitioner dated February 2, 2012, Respondent wrote that he never received Mr. Brummell\u2019s requests for the documents, adding that he would forward the documents upon his receiving Mr. Brummell\u2019s written request for the case file that included instructions on where to mail the file. On February 23, 2012, Mr. Brummell sent Respondent a request for the documents and provided Respondent with instructions on where to send the file documents. Respondent did not reply to Mr. Brummell\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Petitioner sent letters dated May 17, 2012, June 6, 2012, and July 11, 2012, to Respondent at his P.O. Box mailing address, at which Respondent was able to receive mail. The letters requested that Respondent respond to Mr. Brummell\u2019s complaint. Respondent received the letters, but did not reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">An investigator for Petitioner visited Respondent\u2019s office on August 7, 2012, and left his business card. That same day, Respondent called the investigator and said that he would send the documents to Mr. Brummell and respond to Petitioner\u2019s letters. In a subsequent e-mail, the investigator told Respondent to notify Petitioner if there would be a delay in sending the documents. On August 17, 2012, Respondent mailed Mr. Brummell\u2019s documents, via certified mail, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>correctional facility in which Mr. Brummell was incarcerated, yet Respondent did not inform Petitioner or the investigator that he had done so until the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">On August 8, 2012, Petitioner sent a letter to Respondent stating that the case would be formally docketed for an investigation and possible disciplinary action. Petitioner followed up with a certified letter on August 20, 2012, but the letter was returned unclaimed and without a response. Both letters were sent to Respondent\u2019s physical office address, at which Respondent claimed he had difficulty receiving mail. Respondent, however, had instituted mail forwarding from the physical address to his correct P.O. Box mailing address. The hearing judge found that Respondent had received the letters but failed to respond to Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Based on these facts, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.16(d); MLRPC 8.1(a) and (b); and MLRPC 8.4(a), (c), and (d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\n<em>Complaint of Renee Copper</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">In or about March 2010, Renee Copper (\u201cMs. Copper\u201d) retained Respondent to represent her in a personal injury claim resulting from an August 14, 2009, automobile accident. Respondent filed a lawsuit on behalf of Ms. Copper on September 22, 2011. A trial date was set for June 22, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">In or about April 2012, Respondent advised Ms. Copper that the defendant\u2019s insurance company, Progressive Insurance Company (\u201cProgressive\u201d), provided a settlement offer of $10,000. Ms. Copper authorized Respondent to accept the offer and dismiss the case. Respondent told Ms. Copper that he would do so and then inform her when the case was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">In May 2012, Progressive sent Respondent a $10,000 settlement check made payable to Respondent. On June 21, 2012, Respondent and defense counsel filed a Joint Line of Dismiss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>al of Ms. Copper\u2019s case. Respondent did not inform Ms. Copper of his receipt of the settlement check or the subsequent dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Between June 1, 2012, and the scheduled trial date of June 22, 2012, Ms. Copper attempted to contact Respondent about her case and the settlement, but Respondent never replied. Ms. Copper only learned that her case had been dismissed when she called the court about her matter. On or about June 22, 2012, Ms. Copper contacted Progressive directly and learned that Progressive had issued a $10,000 settlement check to Respondent approximately one month earlier. The check had not yet been negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">By chance, on August 18, 2012, Ms. Copper encountered Respondent at the Salisbury Mall. She questioned him about the settlement check. Respondent told Ms. Copper that he had sent her a letter with the breakdown of settlement disbursements. Respondent never sent such a letter to Ms. Copper. Respondent also said that he would call Ms. Copper the following week, but he failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">On September 12, 2012, Ms. Copper once again ran into Respondent by chance at a local store. She questioned Respondent about the settlement check, and Respondent told her to meet him the next day. That following day, Respondent and Ms. Copper met and deposited the check in Respondent\u2019s account. Respondent wrote Ms. Copper a check for her portion of the settlement proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Petitioner began investigating Ms. Copper\u2019s complaint in early August 2012. Petitioner sent Respondent letters dated August 2, 2012, September 4, 2012, October 2, 2012, October 16, 2012, and October 31, 2012. Respondent received, but did not respond to, Petitioner\u2019s letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Based on these facts, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.3; MLRPC 1.4(a)(1), (2), and (3); MLRPC 1.15(d); MLRPC 8.1(b); and MLRPC 8.4(a), (c), and (d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\n<em>Complaint of Terry J. Holden</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">On June 6, 2012, Terry J. Holden (\u201cMs. Holden\u201d) retained Respondent to represent her as a defendant in a civil matter involving Ms. Holden\u2019s alleged failure to pay for contractual services involving a home improvement project. The trial date was set for August 6, 2012, in the District Court sitting in Caroline County.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Respondent met with Ms. Holden on June 6, 2012. Ms. Holden paid Respondent, by check, a flat fee of $2,500 and provided him court documents and photographs of her home. Sometime later, Respondent cashed the check without depositing or maintaining the fees in a trust account, and without receiving Ms. Holden\u2019s informed consent not to deposit or maintain the fees in trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Respondent participated in a five-minute telephone call with a potential expert witness to discuss the contractor\u2019s work in Ms. Holden\u2019s case. Respondent did not perform any additional work on the matter. After the initial June 6, 2012, meeting, Ms. Holden attempted to contact Respondent, but she was unable to reach him. Ms. Holden left several messages for Respondent between July 31, 2012, and August 3, 2012, none of which Respondent returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">On or about August 1, 2012, Ms. Holden filed a <em>pro se </em>notice of intention to defend her case in the District Court. Shortly thereafter, she filed a complaint with Petitioner. The hearing judge found that, during the course of Petitioner\u2019s investigation, Respondent received, but did not respond to, letters from Petitioner dated August 29, 2012, September 27, 2012, November 15, 2012, and November 27, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Based on these facts, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1; MLRPC 1.3; MLRPC 1.4(a)(1), (2), and (3) and (b); MLRPC 1.15(a) and (c); MLRPC 1.16(d); MLRPC 8.1(b); MLRPC 8.4(a) and (d); and Maryland Rule 16-604.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\n<em>Mitigating and Aggravating Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In response to this Court\u2019s Order of Remand, the hearing judge submitted Supplemental Findings in which she found, by a preponderance of evidence, several mitigating factors. First, the hearing judge found that Respondent \u201cis remorseful for \u2018dropping the ball\u2019 in Ms. Holden\u2019s case\u201d and has \u201copenly acknowledged his failures in that case, and apologized for his inaction.\u201d The hearing judge acknowledged, though, that \u201cRespondent\u2019s remorse did not cause him to take any corrective action\u201d until the October 16, 2013, evidentiary hearing when he stated that he \u201cwas prepared to provide a refund.\u201d Petitioner informed this Court at oral argument that Respondent did provide the promised refund to Ms. Holden by handing her a money order for $2,500 on the day of the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Second, the hearing judge found \u201cthat Respondent\u2019s marital and custody difficulties beginning in October 2011 and lasting through 2012\u201d constitute a mitigating factor. The hearing judge explained that \u201cRespondent credibly testified that he went through a divorce and experienced significant custody issues regarding his youngest daughter, which took an emotional toll on him.\u201d Finally, the hearing judge found that \u201cRespondent has not been formally disciplined previously for any professional misconduct and is not currently the subject of any other complaints to the Attorney Grievance Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The hearing judge further found, however, that \u201cRespondent took no responsibility for his mistakes in Mr. Brummell\u2019s and Ms. Copper\u2019s cases\u201d and repeatedly disregarded \u201ccommunications and requests from Mr. Brummell and Ms. Copper.\u201d Also, \u201c[wjhatever stress [Respondent] was under as a result of his marital breakup does not justify his seven month disregard of Mr. Brummell\u2019s request for his file, and ignoring Ms. Copper\u2019s request for her settlement check.\u201d Furthermore, Respondent \u201cdisplayed] an indifference to the disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>legal process\u201d when he ignored repeatedly communications from Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In attorney discipline proceedings, this Court \u201chas original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Page, </em>430 Md. 602, 626, 62 A.3d 163 (2013). We accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact as correct unless shown to be clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lara, </em>418 Md. 355, 364, 14 A.3d 650 (2011). Neither Respondent nor Petitioner filed exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. We therefore treat those findings as established. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. Md. Rule 16-759(b)(l); <em>Page, </em>430 Md. at 626, 62 A.3d 163. The ultimate decision as to whether an attorney has engaged in professional misconduct lies with this Court. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Agbaje, </em>438 Md. 695, 717, 93 A.3d 262 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">\n<em>Petitioner\u2019s Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">Respondent did not file any exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. Petitioner filed one exception to the hearing judge\u2019s legal conclusion that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(c), \u201cby misrepresenting to Ms. Copper that he mailed her a letter containing a settlement breakdown.\u201d Petitioner agrees that the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings support that Respondent made this misrepresentation. Petitioner nonetheless argues that, because Petitioner did not charge Respondent with a violation of MLRPC 8.4(c) in connection with his representation of Ms. Copper, the hearing judge was precluded from finding that Respondent violated that rule while representing Ms. Copper.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>We agree. This Court has held that \u201can attorney may not be found guilty of violating a Rule of Professional Conduct unless that Rule is charged in the Petition For Disciplinary or Remedial Action.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sapero, </em>400 Md. 461, 487, 929 A.2d 483 (2007). This is because \u201cnotice should be given to the attorney of the charges made and opportunity afforded him for explanation and defen[s]e.\u201d <em>In re Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. 544, 550, 88 S.Ct. 1222, 20 L.Ed.2d 117 (1968). We therefore sustain Petitioner\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(c) in connection with Respondent\u2019s representation of Ms. Copper.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\n<em>Respondent\u2019s Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Based upon our <em>de novo </em>review of the hearing judge\u2019s remaining conclusions of law, we conclude that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1; MLRPC 1.3; MLRPC 1.4(a) and (b); MLRPC 1.15(a), (c), and (d); MLRPC 1.16(d); MLRPC 8.1(a) and (b); MLRPC 8.4(a), (c), and (d); and Maryland Rule 16-604.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">MLRPC 1.1</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">MLRPC 1.1 states that \u201c[a] lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client.\u201d We have held that \u201c[a] failure to make the proper and required filings in a client matter demonstrates a lack of the appropriate preparation and thoroughness necessary to provide competent representation.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shakir, </em>427 Md. 197, 205, 46 A.3d 1162 (2012); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Garrett, </em>427 Md. 209, 223, 46 A.3d 1169 (2012) (holding that an attorney violated MLRPC 1.1 by failing to take the \u201cnecessary, fundamental steps to further the clients\u2019 case[ ]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1, in connection with his representation of Ms. Holden, when he accepted Ms. Holden\u2019s fee and subsequently failed to provide her with competent or meaningful legal services. Respondent took a $2,500 fee from Ms. Holden, yet he failed to perform any legal services on her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>behalf beyond a five-minute telephone call with a potential witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">MLRPC 1.3 and 1.15(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">MLRPC 1.3 states that \u201c[a] lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d When an attorney \u201cd[oes] nothing whatsoever to advance the client\u2019s cause or endeavor[,]\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bahgat, </em>411 Md. 568, 575, 984 A.2d 225 (2009), or \u201cfail[s] to disburse funds to clients in a timely manner,\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zuckerman, </em>403 Md. 695, 713, 944 A.2d 525 (2008), the attorney violates MLRPC 1.3. MLRPC 1.15(d) provides, in relevant part, that, \u201c[u]pon receiving funds or other property in which a client or third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the client or third person[]\u201d and \u201cshall deliver promptly to the client or third person any funds or other property that the client or third person is entitled to receive.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The facts found by the hearing judge establish that Respondent failed to perform any meaningful legal services on Ms. Holden\u2019s behalf after entering into a retainer agreement. Respondent thereby violated MLRPC 1.3 in connection with his representation of Ms. Holden. The hearing judge found that Respondent \u201cfailed to notify Ms. Copper in May 2012 that he had received the $10,000 settlement check\u201d and \u201cfailed to promptly deliver the check to her.

Petitioner recommends disbarment. Respondent recommends a sanction of a reprimand, asserting that the mitigating circumstances found by the hearing judge substantially diminish the seriousness of his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The severity of the sanction for an attorney\u2019s misconduct \u201cdepends on the circumstances of each case, the intent with which the acts were committed, the gravity, nature and effect of the violations, and any mitigating factors.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ward, </em>394 Md. 1, 33, 904 A.2d 477 (2006) (citations omitted). The purpose of a sanction is not to punish the attorney, <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Lara, </em>418 Md. 355, 365, 14 A.3d 650 (2011). In <em>Lara, </em>we held that disbarment was appropriate where the attorney deposited unearned fees into his personal account, effectively abandoned his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>clients, and failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information, in violation of MLRPC 1.3, 1.4, 1.15, 1.16(d), 8.1(b), and 8.4(a) and (d). <em>Id. </em>at 361-65, 14 A.3d 650. Similarly, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Tinsky, </em>377 Md. 646, 655, 835 A.2d 542 (2003), we disbarred an attorney for his \u201clack of diligence, his lack of preparation, his failure to communicate with his clients, his charging of unreasonable fees, his failure to account for and return monies, his misrepresentations, and his failure to comply with Bar Counsel\u2019s requests[,]\u201d in violation of MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.16(d), and 8.4(d). <em>See also Fox, </em>417 Md. at 544-45, 11 A.3d 762 (\u201cThe combination of Respondent\u2019s violations\u2014in particular, abandonment of his clients, misrepresentation, and failure to cooperate with Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation\u2014convinces us that Respondent is unfit to practice law in Maryland and disbarment is the appropriate sanction to protect the public.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">As in <em>Lara </em>and <em>Tinsky, </em>Respondent effectively abandoned his representation of Ms. Holden when he took a fee from her and failed to perform any meaningful work on her matter. Respondent also neglected all three complainants when he failed to communicate with them or respond to their reasonable requests for information. Accordingly, Respondent committed the same violations as the attorneys in <em>Lara </em>and <em>Tinsky, </em>in which we held disbarment to be the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Respondent\u2019s misconduct is further exacerbated by his violations of MLRPC 8.1(a) and 8.4(c), which were not present in <em>Lara </em>and <em>Tinsky, </em>when he misrepresented to Mr. Brummell and Petitioner that he would return promptly Mr. Brummell\u2019s case file. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 773 A.2d 463 (2001), we held that disbarment is the default sanction \u201cin cases of intentional dishonesty, misappropriation cases, fraud, stealing, serious criminal conduct and the like\u201d and that \u201cwe will not accept, as \u2018compelling extenuating circumstances,\u2019 anything less than the most serious and utterly debilitating mental or physical health conditions[J\u201d <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 413, 773 A.2d 463. Since <em>Vanderlinde, </em>however, this Court has clarified that <em>Vanderlinde </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>not a \u201cbright-line rule,\u201d and \u201cwe must still examine the facts, circumstances, and mitigation in each case\u201d to determine the appropriate sanction. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lane, </em>367 Md. 633, 647, 790 A.2d 621 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">In the end, \u201c[t]he appropriate sanction depends on the facts and circumstances of the ease before us, including our assessment of aggravating and mitigating factors[.]\u201d <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Levin, </em>438 Md. 211, 228, 91 A.3d 1101 (2014). Several facts point us in the direction of a sanction short of disbarment. We find significant the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Respondent was experiencing personal problems, stemming from his divorce and child custody proceedings, during the time of his misconduct. Prior to these difficulties, Respondent never had been formally disciplined. Moreover, as found by the hearing judge, much of Respondent\u2019s misconduct resulted from his personal issues, which took an emotional toll on him during this time, rather than solely a dishonest or selfish motive. Furthermore, during oral argument before us, Petitioner informed us that Respondent returned the $2,500 fee to Ms. Holden. Respondent\u2019s conduct diverges from that in <em>Lara </em>and <em>Tinsky, </em>in which the attorneys never returned their unearned fees. <em>See Lara, </em>418 Md. at 362, 14 A.3d 650; <em>Tinsky, </em>377 Md. at 650, 835 A.2d 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In light of these factors, this case warrants a sanction less severe than disbarment. Personal issues, however, do not excuse an attorney\u2019s abrogation of his professional duties. Respondent\u2019s misconduct was severe\u2014he abandoned Ms. Holden, made misrepresentations to Mr. Brummell and Petitioner, and failed utterly to cooperate with Petitioner\u2019s investigation. Under the totality of the circumstances, taking into account the mitigating factors, we conclude that the appropriate sanction is an indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761(b), FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST RONALD CLAUDE BRIGERMAN, JR.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-11\">.
