Ensor (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County to hear this attorney discipline proceeding. On February 25 and 26, 2014, the hearing judge conducted a hearing. On April 17, 2014, the hearing judge filed in this Court an opinion including findings of fact and conclusions of law, concluding that Basinger had not violated MLRPC 1.4(b), 1.16(a)(3), or 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">On January 13, 2015, we heard oral argument. For the below reasons, we reprimand Basinger for violating MLRPC 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The hearing judge found the following facts, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">On June 6, 1983, this Court admitted Basinger to the Bar of Maryland. Since approximately 2005, Basinger has been a solo practitioner. Keys worked as a legal secretary for Ba-singer off and on for several years, but was no longer doing so in 2012. Thus, at the time of his alleged misconduct, Basinger was Keys\u2019s brother-in-law, her former employer, and her lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">On February 18, 2012, Keys\u2019s grandson died in motor vehicle accident. On that date, Keys telephoned her sister (Basinger\u2019s wife) and informed her of Keys\u2019s grandson\u2019s death. Basinger got on the telephone and offered legal assistance. Keys responded in the affirmative. Thus, on that date, Ba-singer and Keys entered into an attorney-client relationship. During the following weeks, Basinger mailed letters to third parties on Keys\u2019s behalf and investigated the circumstances of Keys\u2019s grandson\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>On March 8, 2012, an insurance company received from Keys a letter in which Keys denied that she had retained Basinger. On March 9, 2012, Basinger learned of Keys\u2019s letter. On March 12, 2012, Basinger mailed to Keys two letters, both of which were on his firm\u2019s letterhead. As of that date, Keys was either Basinger\u2019s client or his recently terminated former client; Basinger testified that he \u201cquit\u201d through his first letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">In his first letter, Basinger described what he had done on Keys\u2019s behalf; called Keys \u201cA TRUE C[* *]T\u201d who had \u201cfinally f[* * *]ed up one time too many\u201d; accused Keys of being dishonest; and stated that, if he ever saw her again, \u201cit [would] be too soon.\u201d In his second letter, Basinger shared what he had learned while investigating the circumstances of Keys\u2019s grandson\u2019s death; suggested that Keys perhaps was responsible for her grandson\u2019s death; called Keys \u201ca reprehensible human being\u201d with \u201cworthless progeny\u201d; accused Keys of being lazy and dishonest; and wished Keys \u201conly the worst from here on out.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 16, 2012, Basinger mailed to Keys a third letter, in which he accused Keys of \u201ctrying to weasel [her] way out of paying the full amount of [a funeral chapel]\u2019s bill[,]\u201d for her grandson\u2019s viewing and funeral.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The hearing judge stated: \u201cIt is abundantly clear that [ ] Basinger wrote the letters to his sister-in-law and that, in her estimation, [Keys] received the letters from her sister\u2019s husband, not her attorney.\u201d There was no indication that Basing-er\u2019s statements negatively impacted Keys\u2019s perception of the legal profession. At the hearing, Basinger denied that his conduct was wrongful.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">In an attorney discipline proceeding, this Court reviews for clear error a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and reviews without deference a hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-759(b)(2)(B) (\u201cThe Court [of Appeals] shall give due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McDowell, </em>439 Md. 26, 35, 93 A.3d 711, 716 (2014) (\u201c[T]his Court reviews for clear error a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact[.]\u201d) (Citations omitted); Md. R. 16-759(b)(l) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals shall review de novo the [hearing] judge\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d). This Court determines whether clear and convincing evidence establishes that a lawyer violated the MLRPC. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-757(b) (\u201cThe [Commission] has the burden of proving the averments of the petition [for disciplinary or remedial action] by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ArD\">(A) Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Basinger does not except to any of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. The Commission does not except to any of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and asserts that Basinger mailed the three letters to Keys \u201cwithin the constraints of an attorney-client relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">We agree. The hearing judge found that, as of March 12, 2012 (on which Basinger mailed his first two letters), Keys was either Basinger\u2019s client or his recently terminated former client. Significantly, nowhere in Basinger\u2019s response to the Commission\u2019s filing, and at no time at oral argument, did Basinger or his counsel dispute that Basinger mailed the three letters at least partially in his capacity as Keys\u2019s lawyer. Basinger\u2019s first letter includes detailed information about what Basinger had done on Keys\u2019s behalf in his capacity as her lawyer, and, like his other two letters, is headed: \u201cRe: Estate of [Keys\u2019s grandson], a minor[.]\u201d From beginning to end, Basinger\u2019s first letter reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">Re: Estate of [Keys\u2019s grandson], a minor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Dear Rosina [Keys]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-4\">I\u2019ve just finished a lengthy conversation with a PIP adjuster at [an insurance company] who tried to create a three-way conversation with you, but you refused. However, she did fax a copy of the letter you faxed to her earlier to me. I told you at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday evening when you called [my wife] and I begging for money to bury [your grandson] that I would handle this matter for you. I also interceded with [the director] at [a fluneral [c]hapel and she knocked off more than $900 of the bill for his funeral. I also stood ready to write you a check for the full amount of [your grandson]\u2019s funeral. I told you that I would and you assured me that you approved of my investigating how this accident took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">[A] retired Baltimore City detective, who has worked for me now for more than eight years, was able to get all the information from the Crash Team, the specially assigned Auto Fatality Unit of the Baltimore County Police, to give him everything he needed to make decisions about this case. When I talked to you earlier today on March 9, 2012, the only thing you told me was that you challenged whether I had gotten any reduction of [the funeral chapel\u2019s] bill. I also told you that [a different insurance company] has a larger policy and would probably be able to cover all of the outstanding bill and reduce a substantial amount of the $5000 of borrowed money to pay for [your grandson]\u2019s funeral.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">You told ... a[n insurance company\u2019s] corporate attorney[ ] that you had not asked me, directed me, contracted me or approved my efforts on your behalf. While I can understand the intense emotional stress that you\u2019re under, a lie is a lie. For you to spit on the kindness I showed to you by trying to sort out the details of this accident and my willingness to come to your financial aid is reprehensible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">You made a statement to another attorney that I had misrepresented my relationship with you as attorney/client. You and I had discussed on more than one occasion that [your daughter] was in a halfway house and would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>capable of managing this matter. The other option, your former son-in-law, you did not think was a good idea either. And then you tell [the attorney] that you had never talked to me. That is called defamation of character, and, if true, could get me disbarred and at least sanctioned and/or suspended. And your motivation? My kindness? My tolerance of your absolute evil behavior over all of these years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\">In closing, YOU ARE A TRUE C[* *]T! If I ever see you again, it will be too soon. I trust, once the full extent of all that I have to show [my wife] is revealed, that she and your two nieces will feel the same way. You finally f[* * *]ed up one time too many!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">Yours truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeq\">[signature]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1X\">C. Stephen Basinger</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Perhaps even more importantly, as the hearing judge noted, Basinger testified that he \u201cquit\u201d representing Keys through his first letter. Thus, Basinger\u2019s purpose in mailing the first letter was to formally acknowledge the representation\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">(B) Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Basinger does not except to any of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commission excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Basinger did not violate MLRPC 8.4(d) in mailing the letters to Keys.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For the below reasons, we sustain the Commission\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>MLRPC 8.4(d) (Conduct that is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(d). \u201cGenerally, a lawyer violates MLRPC 8.4(d) where the lawyer\u2019s conduct negatively impacts the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession.\u201d <em>McDowell, </em>439 Md. at 39, 93 A.3d at 719 (citation, ellipses, and internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, a lawyer violates MLRPC 8.4(d) where the lawyer\u2019s conduct \u201ctends to bring the legal profession into disrepute.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Reno, </em>436 Md. 504, 511, 83 A.3d 781, 785 (2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">For example, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Alison, </em>317 Md. 523, 540, 531, 565 A.2d 660, 668, 663-664 (1989), this Court held that a lawyer violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by, among other things, telling an employee of a clerk\u2019s office \u201cyou have to take the f[* * *]ing papers\u201d; referring to opposing counsel as a \u201cson of a b[* * * *]\u201d and an \u201ca[* * * * * *]\u201d; and saying \u201cf[* * *] you\u201d to the employee\u2019s supervisor. This Court acknowledged that \u201c[ajttorneys are not prohibited from using profane or vulgar language at all times and under all circumstances\u201d; nonetheless, this Court explained that \u201c[i]t is not difficult to visualize the damage to the court system and to the reputation of the legal profession that would result if attorneys were free to conduct their daily business with court clerks in the manner employed by\u201d the lawyer. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 565 A.2d at 667 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Here, clear and convincing evidence persuades us to reverse the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Basinger did not violate MLRPC 8.4(d) by mailing to Keys letters in which he called Keys \u201cA TRUE C[* *]T\u201d who had \u201cfinally f[* * *]ed up one time too many\u201d; called Keys \u201ca reprehensible human being\u201d with \u201cworthless progeny\u201d and a \u201cpathetic and dysfunc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>tional world\u201d; accused Keys of being lazy and dishonest, engaging in \u201cdefamation\u201d and \u201cabsolute evil behavior[,]\u201d and \u201ctrying to weasel [her] way out of paying the full amount of [a funeral chapel]\u2019s bill\u201d; suggested that Keys perhaps was responsible for her grandson\u2019s death; stated that, if he ever saw her again, \u201cit [would] be too soon\u201d; and wished Keys \u201conly the worst from here on out.\u201d Five circumstances are critical to our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">First, Basinger\u2019s statements were neither inartful slips of the tongue nor spoken in the heat of an oral altercation. Basinger caused his statements to be put into writing in letters that he signed and mailed to Keys. Basinger had an opportunity to amend his choice of words at any time before he mailed the letters to Keys.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Basinger\u2019s failure to take advantage of that opportunity establishes that his statements were deliberate, not inadvertent.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Second, as discussed above, Basinger\u2019s statements were made at least partially in his capacity as Keys\u2019s lawyer. All three of Basinger\u2019s letters are on his firm\u2019s letterhead and are headed: \u201cRe: Estate of [Keys\u2019s grandson], a minor[.]\u201d Ba-singer\u2019s purpose in mailing the first letter was to formally acknowledge the representation\u2019s termination. Basinger\u2019s first letter includes detailed information about what Basinger had done on Keys\u2019s behalf. Basinger\u2019s second letter includes information that he had learned while investigating the circumstances of Keys\u2019s grandson\u2019s death. Basinger\u2019s third letter pertains to the payment of the funeral chapel\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Third, Basinger\u2019s statements were insults aimed at the letters\u2019 recipient (his client, Keys) rather than a third party. For example, Basinger did not make statements along the lines of \u201cThe judge was foolish to rule in the other party\u2019s favor\u201d or \u201cOpposing counsel has been rude throughout these proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Fourth, Basinger\u2019s statements were not limited to an isolated incident; Basinger engaged in a pattern of numerous insults that spanned three letters. In his first letter, Basinger called Keys \u201cA TRUE C[* *]T\u201d who had \u201cfinally f[* * *]ed up one time too many\u201d; accused Keys of being dishonest; and stated that, if he ever saw her again, \u201cit [would] be too soon.\u201d In his second letter, Basinger suggested that Keys perhaps was responsible for her grandson\u2019s death; called Keys \u201ca reprehensible human being\u201d with \u201cworthless progeny\u201d and a \u201cpathetic and dysfunctional world\u201d; accused Keys of being lazy and dishonest; and wished Keys \u201conly the worst from here on out.\u201d In his third letter, Basinger accused Keys of \u201ctrying to weasel [her] way out of paying the full amount of [the funeral chapel]\u2019s bill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Finally, Basinger chose the word \u201cc[* *]t\u201d to refer to Keys. Merriam-Webster defines \u201cc[* *]t\u201d as a \u201cusually disparaging [and] obscene\u201d term for a \u201cwoman.\u201d C[* *]t, Merriam-Webster, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cC* *]t. In turn, Merriam-Webster defines \u201cobscene\u201d as \u201cvery offensive in usually a shocking way.\u201d Obscene, Merriam-Webster, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obscene. In other words, \u201cc[* *]t\u201d is a shockingly offensive insult for a woman, and thus connotes sexism, misogyny, and degradation of women. C<em>f. Passananti v. Cook Cnty., </em>689 F.3d 655, 665 (7th Cir.2012) (\u201cA raft of case law ... establishes that the use of sexually degrading, gender-specific epithets, such as ... \u2018c[* *]t,\u2019 ... has been consistently held to constitute harassment based upon sex.\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (first ellipses in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">In short, (1) at least partially in his capacity as Keys\u2019s lawyer, (2) Basinger put into letters (3) numerous insults, (4) including the obscene, sexist word \u201cc[* *]t,\u201d (5) that were aimed at the letters\u2019 recipient (his client, Keys). Together, these five circumstances clearly and convincingly establish that Basinger\u2019s conduct \u201ctends to bring the legal profession into disrepute[,]\u201d and thus were prejudicial to the administration of justice. <em>Reno, </em>436 Md. at 511, 83 A.3d at 785 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIt is not difficult to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>visualize the damage ... to the reputation of the legal profession that would result if attorneys were free to\u201d communicate with their clients in the egregiously unprofessional manner that Basinger employed. <em>Alison, </em>317 Md. at 538, 565 A.2d at 667. Basinger\u2019s conduct would not be tolerated from one\u2019s coworker, much less one\u2019s lawyer. <em>Cf. Burns v. McGregor Elec. Indus., Inc., </em>989 F.2d 959, 966 (8th Cir.1993) (\u201c[F]or a co-employee to refer to a woman employee as a ... \u2018c[* *]t\u2019 in the work place is indefensible.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">We emphasize that our conclusion is based on this attorney discipline proceeding\u2019s particular circumstances. We do not hold that a lawyer violates MLRPC 8.4(d) by slighting a client in any way or by using obscenities at any time. <em>See Alison, </em>317 Md. at 538, 565 A.2d at 667 (\u201cAttorneys are not prohibited from using profane or vulgar language at all times and under all circumstances.\u201d (Citation omitted)). We simply recognize that Basinger\u2019s egregiously unprofessional manner of communicating with Keys grossly exceeded an appropriate expression of grievances with Keys, and thus tended to bring the legal profession into disrepute.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Basinger raises red herrings in contending that he did not violate MLRPC 8.4(d) because: (1) his statements were \u201cprivate\u201d in the sense that they were \u201cnot known or intended to be known publicly\u201d; and (2) there was no indication that Basing-er\u2019s statements negatively impacted Keys\u2019s perception of the legal profession.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Both of Basinger\u2019s contentions are foreclosed by this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number><em>Saridakis, </em>402 Md. 413, 431-32, 430, 936 A.2d 886, 897, 896 (2007), in which, writing for this Court, the Honorable Glenn T. Harrell, Jr. concluded that a lawyer violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by negatively impacting the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession by violating MLRPC 1.8(c) (Conflict of Interest: Current Clients: Preparing Instrument Giving Lawyer Any Substantial Gift); in turn, the lawyer violated MLRPC 1.8(c) because \u201c[a] reasonable member of the public could well look askance at [the] arrangement [that the lawyer made] and suspect that collusion could have taken place.\u201d (Footnote and emphasis omitted). As Judge Harrell aptly explained, \u201c[f]or purposes of finding a violation of M[L]RPC 1.8(c), ... the objective perception by a member of the public, the protection of whom [the MLRPC] are created and enforced, is the proper vantage point from which to consider whether an actionable appearance of impropriety occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430 n. 10, 936 A.2d at 896 n. 10 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Thus, in <em>Saridakis, id. </em>at 430 n. 10, 936 A.2d at 896 n. 10, in determining whether the lawyer\u2019s conduct violated MLRPC 1.8(c), this Court applied the \u201cobjective\u201d standard of whether \u201c[a] reasonable member of the public could well look askance at such an arrangement and suspect that collusion <em>could </em>have taken placet,]\u201d not the subjective standard of whether the lawyer\u2019s conduct actually impacted the public and/or a particular person <em>(e.g., </em>a complainant) who is involved with the attorney discipline proceeding. Such a standard is equally applicable in determining whether a lawyer\u2019s conduct violates MLRPC 8.4(d) by engaging in conduct that negatively impacts the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">As Judge Harrell pointed out in <em>Saridakis, id. </em>at 430 n. 10, 936 A.2d at 896 n. 10, this objective standard promotes our purpose to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession. Indeed, departing from <em>Saridakis </em>would shift this Court\u2019s focus from a lawyer\u2019s conduct to: (1) other people\u2019s subjective perceptions of the lawyer\u2019s conduct; and (2) whether other people knew of the lawyer\u2019s conduct. Such a framework would lead to the absurd result that whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>lawyer violated MLRPC 8.4(d) would depend on: (1) how sensitive other people are; and (2) how much the lawyer\u2019s conduct was publicized. For example, a lawyer could violate MLRPC 8.4(d) by making certain statements to an extremely sensitive client, yet the lawyer would not violate MLRPC 8.4(d) by making the exact same statements to an extremely thick-skinned client. As another example, a lawyer could violate MLRPC 8.4(d) by making certain statements to a client if the client publicized the lawyer\u2019s statements; yet, the lawyer would not violate MLRPC 8.4(d) by making the exact same statements to the client if the client refrained from telling anyone else about the lawyer\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">The objective standard that this Court articulated in <em>Saridakis </em>is strengthened even further by the circumstance that, as in <em>Saridakis, </em>in countless other attorney discipline proceedings, this Court has held that lawyers violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by engaging in conduct that negatively impacted the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession, even though this Court did not mention, let alone consider, whether the lawyers\u2019 conduct actually negatively impacted the perception of the legal profession of the public and/or particular people who were involved with the attorney discipline proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. O\u2019Leary, </em>433 Md. 2, 40, 69 A.3d 1121, 1143-44 (2013); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Heung Sik Park, </em>427 Md. 180, 194, 46 A.3d 1153, 1161 (2012); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Butler, </em>395 Md. 1, 15, 909 A.2d 226, 234 (2006); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kapoor, </em>391 Md. 505, 532, 894 A.2d 502, 518 (2006); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. White, </em>354 Md. 346, 363-64, 731 A.2d 447, 457 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Indeed, on the other side of the coin, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Rand, </em>411 Md. 83, 95-96, 981 A.2d 1234, 1242 (2009), this Court held that a lawyer did not violate MLRPC 8.4(d), but did not even mention, let alone consider, whether the lawyer\u2019s conduct actually negatively impacted the perception of the legal profession of the public and/or a particular person who was involved with the attorney discipline proceeding. Thus, we are unpersuaded by Basinger\u2019s reliance on <em>Rand, </em>as well as his conjecture that, in <em>Rand, </em>there was no indication that the lawyer\u2019s conduct had gained \u201cpublic notoriety[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">As he does with <em>Rand, </em>Basinger misinterprets <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Link, </em>380 Md. 405, 429, 408-13, 844 A.2d 1197, 1211-12, 1199-1202 (2004), in which this Court held that a lawyer did not violate MLRPC 8.4(d) by yelling at an employee of the Motor Vehicle Administration, and concluded that a lawyer violates MLRPC 8.4(d) through \u201cpurely private conduct\u201d only if the conduct \u201cis criminal or so egregious as to make the harm, or potential harm, flowing from it patent[.]\u201d Basinger is mistaken in apparently assuming that, in <em>Link, </em>by \u201cprivate,\u201d this Court meant \u201cnot known or intended to be known publicly.\u201d Five circumstances establish that, in <em>Link, </em>by \u201cprivate,\u201d this Court meant \u201cunrelated to the practice of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">First, in <em>Link, id. </em>at 428, 844 A.2d at 1211, this Court explained that the lawyer\u2019s conduct was \u201cprivate\u201d because, \u201c[although [the lawyer] was representing a client at the time of the incident, that fact was not readily apparent or sought to be emphasized. Indeed, the [lawyer] resisted informing the [employee] that he was a lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Second, in <em>Link, id. </em>at 428, 427, 844 A.2d at 1211, 1210, in distinguishing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Childress, </em>360 Md. 373, 385-86, 758 A.2d 117, 123 (2000), this Court acknowledged that, in <em>Childress, </em>the lawyer engaged in \u201cpurely private\u201d <em>conduct\u2014i.e., </em>conduct that was \u201coutside his ... role as a lawyer[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Third, in <em>Link, </em>380 Md. at 421, 844 A.2d at 1207, this Court distinguished multiple cases, including <em>Alison, </em>317 Md. 523, 565 A.2d 660, on the ground that, in those cases, \u201cthe offending conduct occurred during the actual litigation process or while interviewing clients or others in connection with litigation or potential litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Fourth, on a related note, under Basinger\u2019s interpretation of <em>Link, Link </em>and <em>Alison </em>would be irreconcilable with each other. In <em>Alison, </em>317 Md. at 540, 531, 565 A.2d at 668, 663-64, this Court held that a lawyer violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by, among other things, telling an employee of a clerk\u2019s office \u201cyou have to take the f[* * *]ing papers.\u201d As Basinger points out, the lawyer did so \u201cin the presence of\u2019 multiple employees of the clerk\u2019s office, <em>id. </em>at 531, 565 A.2d at 663; thus, the lawyer\u2019s conduct was not \u201cprivate\u201d in the sense of \u201cnot known or intended to be known publicly.\u201d In <em>Link, </em>380 Md. at 429, 408-13, 844 A.2d at 1212, 1199-1202, this Court held that a lawyer did not violate MLRPC 8.4(d) by yelling at an employee of the Motor Vehicle Administration. Obviously, every office of the Motor Vehicle Administration contains several customers at nearly every office hour, and it is extremely dubious that none of those customers heard the lawyer\u2019s yelling. Indeed, the lawyer testified that the employee \u201cwas incredibly \u2018rude\u2019 to three customers who were in line before\u201d him, thus indicating other customers could hear any conversations with the employee. <em>Id. </em>at 412, 844 A.2d at 1201. Accordingly, the lawyer\u2019s conduct in <em>Link, </em>like the lawyer\u2019s conduct in <em>Alison, </em>was not \u201cprivate\u201d in the sense of \u201cnot known or intended to be known publicly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Fifth, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hall, </em>408 Md. 306, 330-31, 969 A.2d 953, 967 (2009), writing for this Court, Chief Judge Robert M. Bell\u2014who also authored this Court\u2019s opinion in Link\u2014explained that, in <em>Link, </em>380 Md. at 429, 844 A.2d at 1211-12, \u201cwe concluded that conduct, in the private world of attorneys, unrelated to actual litigation situations, is only prejudicial to the administration of justice when such purely private conduct is criminal or so egregious as to make the harm, or potential harm, flowing from it patent[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Thus, in <em>Link, </em>by \u201cprivate,\u201d this Court meant \u201cunrelated to the practice of law.\u201d Accordingly, <em>Link </em>is not dispositive where (as here) a lawyer engages in conduct that is related to the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">In sum, applying the objective standard that this Court articulated in <em>Saridakis, </em>we conclude that Basinger\u2019s conduct\u2014in his capacity as Keys\u2019s lawyer, putting into letters numerous insults (including the obscene, sexist word \u201cc[* *]t\u201d) that were aimed at the letters\u2019 recipient (his client, Keys)\u2014 would negatively impact \u201c[a] reasonable member of the publicas]\u201d perception of the legal profession. Thus, Basinger violated MLRPC 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">(C) Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">In the event this Court sustains the exception, the Commission recommends that we reprimand Basinger. Ba-singer, of course, does not recommend a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">In <em>McDowell, </em>439 Md. at 45-46, 93 A.3d at 722-23, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">This Court sanctions a lawyer not to punish the lawyer, but instead to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession. This Court protects the public by: (1) deterring other lawyers from engaging in similar misconduct; and (2) suspending or disbarring a lawyer who is unfit to continue to practice law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-9\">In determining an appropriate sanction for a lawyer\u2019s misconduct, this Court considers: (a) the duty violated; (b) the lawyer\u2019s mental state; (c) the potential or actual injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct; and (d) the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-10\">Aggravating factors include: (a) prior attorney discipline; (b) a dishonest or selfish motive; (c) a pattern of misconduct; (d) multiple violations of the MLRPC; (e) bad faith obstruction of the attorney discipline proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the Maryland Rules or orders of this Court; (f) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>discipline proceeding; (g) refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the misconduct; (h) vulnerability of the victim; (i) substantial experience in the practice of law; (j) indifference to making restitution; and (k) illegal conduct, including that involving the use of controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\">Mitigating factors include: (a) the absence of prior attorney discipline; (b) absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; (c) personal or emotional problems; (d) timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of the misconduct; (e) full and free disclosure to the Commission or a cooperative attitude toward the attorney discipline proceeding; (f) inexperience in the practice of law; (g) character or reputation; (h) physical disability; (i) a mental disability or chemical dependency including alcoholism or drug abuse where: (1) there is medical evidence that the lawyer is affected by a chemical dependency or mental disability; (2) the chemical dependency or mental disability caused the misconduct; (3) the lawyer\u2019s recovery from the chemical dependency or mental disability is demonstrated by a meaningful and sustained period of successful rehabilitation; and (4) the recovery arrested the misconduct and recurrence of the misconduct is unlikely; (j) delay in the attorney discipline proceeding; (k) the imposition of other penalties or sanctions; (l) remorse; and (m) remoteness of prior violations of the MLRPC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">(Brackets, citations, footnote, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Here, as to the duty violated and Basinger\u2019s mental state, Basinger violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by intentionally mailing to Keys letters in which he called her, among other things, \u201cA TRUE C[* *]T[.]\u201d As to the potential or actual injury that Basinger\u2019s misconduct caused, Basinger\u2019s misconduct was so egregiously unprofessional and demeaning to Keys that, viewed objectively, it would negatively impact the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">We note three aggravating factors: (1) a pattern of misconduct, as Basinger engaged in a pattern of numerous insults <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>that spanned three letters; (2) refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the misconduct; and (3) substantial experience in the practice of law, as Basinger has been a member of the Bar of Maryland for more than thirty years. We note one mitigating factor: the absence of prior attorney discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">We agree with the Commission that the appropriate sanction for Basinger\u2019s misconduct is a reprimand, which should suffice to deter other lawyers from communicating with their clients in the egregiously unprofessional manner that Basinger employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">For the above reasons, we reprimand Basinger.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761(b), FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST CARL STEPHEN BASINGER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-6\">. The record contains Basinger's second letter, in which he also accused Keys of having a \"pathetic and dysfunctional world.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b742-7\">. At the hearing, Basinger testified that he was instrumental in directing Keys and her daughter to the funeral chapel. In a letter that was dated February 28, 2012 and addressed to the funeral chapel\u2019s director, Basinger \"guarantee[d] full payment of [the funeral chapel's] reasonable bill.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b745-9\">. In his response to the Commission\u2019s filing, Basinger contended that this Court would violate the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution by sanctioning him for his statements. At oral argument, Basinger\u2019s counsel withdrew that contention in light of <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Frost, </em>437 Md. 245, 262, 85 A.3d 264, 273 (2014) (\u201cRespondent's statements are not entitled to protection under the First Amendment.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b745-10\">. The Commission also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Basinger did not violate MLRPC 8.4(d) in allegedly continuing to act on Keys\u2019s behalf after the representation's termination. The Commission, however, does not except to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Basing-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>er did not violate MLRPC 1.16(a)(3) (Terminating Representation); thus, we do not address the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\">. In fact, the hearing judge found that Basinger dictated his first two letters three days before mailing them to Keys.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b749-6\"><em>. </em>Keys\u2019s testimony seemingly undermines the hearing judge\u2019s finding. Specifically, Keys testified that she \"didn\u2019t care about [Basinger\u2019s first letter\u2019s] first page[,]\u201d in which Basinger accused Keys of engaging in dishonesty, \"defamation[,]\u201d and \u201cabsolute evil behavior[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). Keys added that the first page \"didn\u2019t bother [her] at all\u201d because \"that\u2019s just [Basinger], that's just how he is.\u201d By contrast, Keys was \"bothered\u201d by \u201cthe second page[,]\u201d in which Basinger called Keys \u201cA TRUE C[\u00ae \u00ae]T[.]\" (Emphasis added). Keys added: \"It angered [her] that anyone should ... use that kind of language, especially an attorney on his letterhead, that he signed.... No woman deserves to be called that.\" (Emphasis added). Additionally, it is undisputed that Basinger\u2019s statements prompted Keys to file a complaint against Ba-singer with the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b751-5\">. Ultimately, it does not matter whether the lawyer's conduct was publicized before this Court considers the attorney discipline proceeding. By issuing an opinion that will become available to anyone with an internet connection, this Court will effectively inform the public of the lawyer\u2019s conduct. It would be ironic if we issued a publicly available opinion in which we recited the lawyer's conduct, then concluded that the lawyer\u2019s conduct could not have negatively impacted the public's perception of the legal profession because the public did not actually know of the lawyer's conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
