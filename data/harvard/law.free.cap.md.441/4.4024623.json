Code Ann., Crim. Law (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.) (\u201cCR\u201d) \u00a7 8-611\u2014which prohibits, among other things, the willful display of goods that have \u201cretail value\u201d and bear a counterfeit mark\u2014is facially overbroad or facially void-for-vagueness. Analyzing CR \u00a7 8-611\u2019s plain language, we hold that CR \u00a7 8-611 is neither facially overbroad nor facially void-for-vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The State, Respondent, charged Bernard Delaney McCree, Jr. (\u201cMcCree\u201d), Petitioner, with numerous crimes, including violating CR \u00a7 8-611. In the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d), McCree moved to dismiss the charges for violating CR \u00a7 8-611 on the ground that CR \u00a7 8-611 is unconstitutional, arguing that the statute is facially overbroad and facially void-for-vagueness. The circuit court denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">At trial, a trooper of the Maryland State Police testified that, during a traffic stop of a vehicle that McCree had been driving, 206 DVDs were found in the vehicle. Dennis Supik, an investigator with the Content Protection Office of the Motion Picture Association of America, testified as an expert in the field of the identification of counterfeit DVDs that all 206 DVDs contained \u201cnumerous counterfeit marks\u201d and thus were \u201ccounterfeit reproductions\u201d of movies on DVD. On his own behalf, McCree testified that he was a licensed vendor whom the State had authorized to sell the DVDs; McCree denied that he had manufactured the DVDs or that he knew whether the DVDs were counterfeit.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">A jury convicted McCree of violating CR \u00a7 8-611. The circuit court sentenced McCree to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, with all but one year suspended, for the violation of CR \u00a7 8-611, consecutive to other sentences, followed by three years of supervised probation. McCree appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>See McCree v. State, </em>214 Md.App. 238, 76 A.3d 400 (2013). McCree filed a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>which this Court granted. <em>See McCree v. State, </em>436 Md. 501, 83 A.3d 779 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">McCree contends that CR \u00a7 8-611 is facially over-broad because it criminalizes conduct that the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>tion protects. Specifically, McCree argues that CR \u00a7 8-611 broadly applies to the display or distribution of goods (such as signs or pamphlets) that include trademarked words or labels, terms, devices, designs, or words that are not registered with any government entity. McCree asserts that CR \u00a7 8-611 is substantively identical to a previous version of Pennsylvania\u2019s trademark counterfeiting statute, which the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania struck down as overbroad. The State responds that CR \u00a7 8-611 is not facially overbroad because it applies only to goods that a defendant intends to sell, and thus is distinguishable from the previous version of Pennsylvania\u2019s trademark counterfeiting statute. In reply, McCree contends that CR \u00a7 8-611 applies to goods that a defendant displays or distributes, even if the defendant does not intend to sell the goods; and, alternatively, even if CR \u00a7 8-611 applies only to goods that a defendant intends to sell, the Free Speech Clause protects such commercial speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">An appellate court reviews without deference a trial court\u2019s conclusion as to whether a statute is unconstitutional. <em>See generally Corbin v. State, </em>428 Md. 488, 498, 52 A.3d 946, 951 (2012) (\u201c[W]e review the ultimate question of constitutionality de novo[.]\u201d (Citation omitted)). In interpreting a statute, a court first considers the statute\u2019s language, which the court applies where the statute\u2019s language \u201cis unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose[.]\u201d <em>State v. Weems, </em>429 Md. 329, 337, 55 A.3d 921, 926 (2012) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">An overbroad statute criminalizes conduct that the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> protects. <em>See Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 114-15, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>(1972) (\u201cA clear and precise enactment may nevertheless be \u2018overbroad\u2019 if in its reach it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct.... The crucial question ... is whether the ordinance sweeps within its prohibitions what may not be punished under the First ... Amendment ].\u201d (Footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Even if a statute is not overbroad as applied to a particular defendant\u2019s actions, the defendant may contend that the statute is facially overbroad \u201cbecause of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute\u2019s very existence may\u201d chill third parties\u2019 speech. <em>Hill v. Colorado, </em>530 U.S. 703, 731-32, 120 S.Ct. 2480, 147 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000) (citation omitted). Such a facial challenge succeeds if and only if \u201cthe statute is substantially <em>overbroad\u201d\u2014i.e., </em>there is \u201ca realistic danger that the statute [] will significantly compromise\u201d third parties\u2019 speech. <em>N.Y. State Club Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. City of New York, </em>487 U.S. 1, 11, 108 S.Ct. 2225, 101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>553 U.S. 285, 292, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 (2008) (\u201c[A] statute\u2019s overbreadth [must] be substantial ... relative to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d (Citations and emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">CR \u00a7 8-611 states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">(a) Definitions.\u2014(1) In this section the following words have the meanings indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">(2) \u201cCounterfeit mark\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">(i) an unauthorized copy of intellectual property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">(ii) intellectual property affixed to goods knowingly sold, offered for sale, manufactured, or distributed, to identify services offered or rendered, without the authority of the owner of the intellectual property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">(3) \u201cIntellectual property\u201d means a trademark, service mark, trade name, label, term, device, design, or word adopted or used by a person to identify the goods or services of the person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-12\">(4) \u201cRetail value\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>(i) a trademark counterfeiter\u2019s selling price for the goods or services that bear or are identified by the counterfeit mark; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">(ii) a trademark counterfeiter\u2019s selling price of the finished product, if the goods that bear a counterfeit mark are components of the finished product.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">(5) \u201cTrademark counterfeiter\u201d means a person who commits the crime of trademark counterfeiting prohibited by this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">(b) Prohibited.\u2014A person may not willfully manufacture, produce, display, advertise, distribute, offer for sale, sell, or possess with the intent to sell or distribute goods or services that the person knows are bearing or are identified by a counterfeit mark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">(c) <em>Penalty\u2014Value at least </em>$1,000.\u2014If the aggregate retail value of the goods or services is $1,000 or more, a person who violates this section is guilty of the felony of trademark counterfeiting^]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">(d) <em>Penalty\u2014Value less than </em>$1,000.\u2014If the aggregate retail value of the goods or services is less than $1,000, a person who violates this section is guilty of the misdemean- or of trademark counterfeiting^]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">(g) <em>Evidence of trademark or trade </em>name.\u2014State or federal registration of intellectual property is prima facie evidence that the intellectual property is a trademark or trade name.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmU\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Reviewing CR \u00a7 8-611 and the applicable authorities, we conclude that CR \u00a7 8-611 is not facially overbroad. Read in its entirety, CR \u00a7 8-611 criminalizes the \u201cdisplay [or] distribution of] goods ... that ... bear[ ] or are identified by a counterfeit mark[,]\u201d CR \u00a7 8-611(b), only if the goods have \u201cretail value[.]\u201d CR \u00a7 8\u2014611(c), (d). Specifically, by their plain language, the penalty provisions delineate that, \u201c[i]f the aggregate retail value of the goods ... is $1,000 or more, [the defendant] is guilty of [a] felony[,]\u201d CR \u00a7 8-611(c), and, \u201c[i]f the aggregate retail value of the goods ... is less than $1,000, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>[the defendant] is guilty of [a] misdemeanor\u00ae\u201d CR \u00a7 8-611(d). \u201cRetail value\u201d means a \u201cselling price\u00ae\u201d CR \u00a7 8-611(a)(4)\u00ae, (ii). In other words, CR \u00a7 8-611 does not criminalize the display or distribution of goods that have no retail value and are not meant to be sold. Accordingly, CR \u00a7 8-611 does not criminalize conduct that the Free Speech Clause indisputably protects\u2014for example, the mere display of signs or distribution of pamphlets.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Our conclusion is supported by the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis </em>(\u201cit is known from its associates\u201d), under which \u201cthe meaning of a word is ... known from the accompanying words so that ... general and specific words, capable of analogous meaning, when associated together, take color from each other, so that general words are restricted to a sense analogous to less general\u00ae\u201d <em>Emmert v. Hearn, </em>309 Md. 19, 25, 522 A.2d 377, 380-81 (1987) (citation omitted). CR \u00a7 8-611 criminalizes the \u201cmanufacture, production], display, advertise[ment], distribution], offering] for sale, [sale], or possession] with the intent to sell or distribute goods or services that [a defendant] knows are bearing or are identified by a counterfeit mark.\u201d CR \u00a7 8-611(b). Six of the eight types of conduct that CR \u00a7 8-611 criminalizes\u2014manufacture, production, advertisement, offering for sale, sale, and possession with the intent to sell or distribute\u2014directly relate to commercial acts or purposes. Viewed in context with these six other types of conduct, \u201cdisplay\u201d and \u201cdistribute\u201d obviously also relate to commercial acts or purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Indeed, in another statute, titled \u201cInfringement,\u201d that, like CR \u00a7 8-611, protects trademarks (specifically, by establishing an express private right of action for the misappropriation of trademarks), \u201cdisplay\u201d is one of multiple types of conduct that directly relate to commercial acts or purposes. <em>See </em>Md. Code Ann., Bus. Reg. (1992, 2010 Repl. Vol.) (\u201cBR\u201d) \u00a7 1^14(c) (\u201cA [trademark\u2019s] registrant may sue to enjoin the display, manufacture, sale, or use of a reproduction or colorable imitation of a mark of the registrant.\u201d (Emphasis added)); <em>see also Mid S. Bldg. Supply of Md., Inc. v. Guard</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>ian Door and Window, Inc., </em>156 Md.App. 445, 460, 847 A.2d 463, 471-72 (2004) (In a trademark infringement case, under BR \u00a7 1-414, \u201cthe moving party must show ... that the defendant\u2019s use of the mark occurred in commerce!.]\u201d (Citations omitted)). Simply put, it would lead to an incongruous result to interpret \u201cdisplay\u201d and \u201cdistribute\u201d to relate to noncommercial acts or purposes (such as the mere display of signs or distribution of pamphlets) where the six other types of conduct that CR \u00a7 8-611 criminalizes directly relate to commercial acts or purposes. A court must give a statute \u201ca reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical[,] or incompatible with common sense.\u201d <em>Walker v. State, </em>432 Md. 587, 615, 69 A.3d 1066, 1083 (2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">We reject McCree\u2019s contention that CR \u00a7 8-611 applies to goods that a defendant does not intend to sell. In support of his contention, McCree points out that CR \u00a7 8-611(b) (the subsection that prohibits trademark counterfeiting) does not mention \u201cretail value.\u201d In attempting to downplay the significance of CR \u00a7 8-611(c) and (d) (the penalty provisions, which incorporate \u201cretail value\u201d), McCree essentially asks us to disregard the rule of statutory interpretation that a court considers a \u201cstatutory scheme in its entirety rather than segmenting the statute and analyzing only its individual parts.\u201d <em>Haile v. State, </em>431 Md. 448, 470, 66 A.3d 600, 612-13 (2013) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We decline to disregard this well-established rule. That CR \u00a7 8-611(c) and (d) are penalty provisions does not change the circumstance that they are part of CR \u00a7 8-611, and must be considered in interpreting CR \u00a7 8-611.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">In support of his contention that CR \u00a7 8-611 applies to goods that a defendant does not intend to sell, McCree relies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>on the circumstance that the bill file of Senate Bill 410, 1996 Reg. Sess., 1996 Md. Laws Ch. 582 (\u201cSenate Bill 410\u201d)\u2014which became Md.Code Ann., Art. 27 \u00a7 48A, which is CR \u00a7 8-611\u2019s predecessor\u2014contains copies of trademark counterfeiting bills from California and <em>North </em>Carolina.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, McCree points out that, in drafting CR \u00a7 8-611\u2019s predecessor, the General Assembly chose not to use language from the trademark counterfeiting bills from California and North Carolina. California\u2019s trademark counterfeiting bill would apply only to \u201cwillfully manufacturing], intentionally selling], or knowingly possessing] for sale\u201d a counterfeit mark. S.B. 862, 1993-1994 Reg. Sess., 1993 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 703. North Carolina\u2019s trademark counterfeiting bill would apply only to counterfeit marks on goods that are \u201cintended for sale[.]\u201d H.B. 311, 1995 Reg. Sess., 1995 N.C. Laws Ch. 436. To be sure, in drafting CR \u00a7 8-611\u2019s predecessor, the General Assembly chose not to use specific language from the trademark counterfeiting bills from California and North Carolina. That said, the General Assembly did not need to include such language; instead, the General Assembly drafted CR \u00a7 8-611\u2019s predecessor so that it (like CR \u00a7 8-611) applied only to goods that had a \u201cselling price[J\u201d Md.Code Ann., Art. 27 \u00a7 48A(A)(4)(I), (II); CR \u00a7 8-611(a)(4)(i), (ii). Plainly put, CR \u00a7 8-611 is not overbroad simply because the General Assembly did not copy-and-paste the trademark counterfeiting bills from California and North Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>McCree\u2019s contention that CR \u00a7 8-611 is substantively identical to a previous version of Pennsylvania\u2019s trademark counterfeiting statute, which the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania struck down as overbroad in <em>Commonwealth v. Omar, </em>602 Pa. 595, 981 A.2d 179, 189 (2009) is not persuasive. The previous version of Pennsylvania\u2019s trademark counterfeiting statute criminalized the \u201cdisplay! ]\u201d or \u201cdistribution]\u201d of \u201citems\u201d that bore, 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 4119(a) (1996), \u201c[intellectual property ... without the authority of the owner of the intellectual property.\u201d 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 4119(i) (1996). Nothing in the previous version of Pennsylvania\u2019s trademark counterfeiting statute, including its penalty provision, required an intent to sell or a selling price. <em>See </em>18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 4119(c)(1) (1996) (\u201cExcept as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), a violation of this section constitutes a misdemeanor of the first degree.\u201d). By contrast, as discussed above, CR \u00a7 8-611 applies only to goods that have a \u201cselling price[.]\u201d CR \u00a7 8-611(a)(4)(i), (ii). Tellingly, since <em>Omar, </em>602 Pa. 595, 981 A.2d 179, Pennsylvania\u2019s legislature has amended Pennsylvania\u2019s trademark counterfeiting statute so that it applies only where a defendant \u201cinten[ds] to sell or to otherwise transfer for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain[.]\u201d 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 4119(a) (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The parties are correct in agreeing that CR \u00a7 8-611 applies to labels, terms, devices, designs, or words that are not registered with any government entity. It is accurate that nothing in CR \u00a7 8-611 requires that the labels, terms, devices, designs, or words at issue be registered with any government entity. Indeed, CR \u00a7 8-611(g) (\u201cState or federal registration of intellectual property is prima facie evidence that the intellectual property is a trademark or trade name.\u201d) indicates that the labels, terms, devices, designs, or words at issue need not be registered with any government entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">That said, we disagree with McCree\u2019s position that CR \u00a7 8-611 is facially overbroad because it applies to unregistered labels, terms, devices, designs, or words. In assessing McCree\u2019s contentions concerning vagueness, the Court of Special Appeals determined that, \u201c[s]ubsections (a)(3) and (g), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>taken together, convince us that a fair reading of the statute is that a person\u2019s use of a \u2018term\u2019 or \u2018word\u2019 is criminally actionable [ ] if the word or term used has been registered or is subject to registration by a third party.\u201d <em>McCree, </em>214 Md.App. at 256, 76 A.3d at 410. This point is equally well taken in an overbreadth analysis. At the federal level, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051(a)(3) provides that, in an application for use of a trademark, the applicant must specify that, among other things, \u201cthe person making the verification believes that he or she ... to be the owner of the mark sought to be registered[,]\u201d and that \u201cto the best of the verifier\u2019s knowledge and belief, no other person has the right to use such mark in commerce either in the identical form thereof or in such near resemblance thereto as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods of such person, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive^]\u201d Similarly, BR \u00a7 1-406(c)(8) provides that an application for registration of a mark must contain a statement that \u201cthe applicant owns the mark[,]\u201d \u201canother person does not have the right to use the mark in the State[,]\u201d and \u201cthe mark is not deceptively similar to a mark that another person has a right to use in the State.\u201d As such, the requirements for federal and State registration of a trademark are consistent with the definitions of counterfeit mark and intellectual property as set forth in CR \u00a7 8-611. So, although CR \u00a7 8-611 does not explicitly require registration, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that CR \u00a7 8-611 describes labels, terms, devices, designs, or words that would be subject to federal or State registration as trademarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">More importantly, to violate the Free Speech Clause, a statute\u2019s alleged overbreadth must be substantial relative to what the statute may constitutionally prohibit. <em>See Williams, </em>553 U.S. at 292, 128 S.Ct. 1830; <em>Galloway v. State, </em>365 Md. 599, 640, 781 A.2d 851, 875 (2001). It is undisputed that individuals and businesses depend on trademarks \u201cto identify\u201d their goods and services \u201cand to distinguish them from\u201d others\u2019 goods and services. BR \u00a7 l-401(c)(l), (2). Thus, the exclusive right to use a trademark \u201cis a valuable property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>right[.]\u201d <em>Dodds v. Shamer, </em>339 Md. 540, 549, 663 A.2d 1318, 1322 (1995) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). It is extremely doubtful that in modern times with the ability to register a trademark so well-known that a substantial number of individuals or businesses use unregistered labels, terms, devices, designs, or words to identify their goods or services; and it is even more doubtful that the number of instances in which people misappropriate such unregistered labels, terms, devices, designs, or words is substantial relative to the number of instances in which people misappropriate registered labels, terms, devices, designs, or words. <em>See Williams, </em>553 U.S. at 292, 128 S.Ct. 1830 (\u201c[A] statute\u2019s overbreadth [must] be substantial ... relative to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d (Citations and emphasis omitted)); <em>Galloway, </em>365 Md. at 640, 781 A.2d at 875 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">McCree contends that even if the terms \u201cgoods\u201d and \u201cservices\u201d refer only to items that are purveyed for commercial purposes, \u201cthat fact would not resolve the First Amendment concerns, for commercial speech, too, is protected by the\u201d Free Speech Clause. McCree\u2019s contention is wrong. Although the Free Speech Clause partially protects commercial speech, that protection has never been interpreted as applying to criminal or unlawful activity. In <em>Va. State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Va. Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., </em>425 U.S. 748, 749-50, 770, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976), a case involving a statute that banned the advertisement of prescription drug prices by licensed pharmacists, the Supreme Court held that \u201ccommercial speech, like other varieties, is protected,\u201d but that \u201c[s]ome forms of commercial speech regulation are surely permissible.\u201d The Supreme Court \u201cmention[ed]\u201d a few forms of permissible commercial speech regulation \u201cto make clear that they are not before [the Court] and therefore are not foreclosed by this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 770, 96 S.Ct. 1817. One such example was as follows: \u201c[T]here is no claim that the transactions proposed in the forbidden advertisements are themselves illegal in any way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 772, 96 S.Ct. 1817 (citations omitted). After listing several examples, the Supreme Court concluded: \u201cWhat is at issue is whether a State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>may completely suppress the dissemination of concededly truthful information about entirely lawful activity, fearful of that information\u2019s effect upon its disseminators and its recipients. Reserving other questions, we conclude that the answer to this one is in the negative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 773, 96 S.Ct. 1817 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). Later, in <em>Posadas de P.R. Associates v. Tourism Co. of P.R., </em>478 U.S. 328, 330, 340, 106 S.Ct. 2968, 92 L.Ed.2d 266 (1986), a case involving \u201cthe facial constitutionality of a Puerto Rico statute and regulations restricting advertising of casino gambling aimed at the residents of Puerto Rico[,]\u201d the Supreme Court squarely held that \u201ccommercial speech receives a limited form of First Amendment protection so long as it concerns a lawful activity and is not misleading or fraudulent.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Thus, to be sure, McCree is correct that the Free Speech Clause partially protects commercial speech. It is readily apparent, nonetheless, from <em>Va. State Bd. of Pharmacy </em>and <em>Posadas de P.R. Associates </em>that this protection does not extend to commercial speech concerning illegal activity, such as the sale or display of counterfeit items in violation of CR \u00a7 8-611. Stated otherwise, regulation of commercial speech concerning illegal activity is entirely permissible and does not infringe upon any protections provided by the Free Speech Clause. In short, selling or displaying counterfeit items intended for sale, while perhaps commercial activity, is unlawful activity that the Free Speech Clause does not protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">For the above reasons, we hold that CR \u00a7 8-611 is not facially overbroad. As the Court of Special Appeals concluded, the circuit court was correct in determining that CR \u00a7 8-611 is not facially overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">McCree contends that CR \u00a7 8-611 is facially void-for-vagueness because CR \u00a7 8-611(a)(3)\u2019s definition of \u201cintellectual property,\u201d which is incorporated into CR \u00a7 8-611(a)(2)\u2019s definition of \u201ccounterfeit mark,\u201d \u201cis almost limitless\u201d because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>it includes any \u201clabel, term, device, design, or word adopted or used by a person to identify the goods or services of the person.\u201d The State responds that CR \u00a7 8-611 is not facially void-for-vagueness because CR \u00a7 8-611(a)(3) clearly defines \u201cintellectual property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">A statute is void-for-vagueness where the statute\u2019s \u201cprohibitions are not clearly defined[,]\u201d thus violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>City of Mesquite v.

People of common intelligence need not guess at a statute\u2019s meaning \u201cif the meaning of the words in controversy can be fairly ascertained by reference to judicial determinations, the common law, dictionaries, treatises or even the words themselves, if they possess a common and generally accepted meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615, 781 A.2d at 860 (citations, emphasis, and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[A] statute does not become unconstitutionally vague merely because it may not be perfectly clear at the margins.

CR \u00a7 8-611(a)(3) makes clear that \u201cintellectual property\u201d is something that is adopted or used by a person to identify the person\u2019s goods or services. CR \u00a7 8-611\u2019s prohibitions of certain acts involving \u201cintellectual property\u201d are clearly defined, and there is no need to guess at CR \u00a7 8-611\u2019s meaning or differ as to CR \u00a7 8-611\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">We are unpersuaded by McCree\u2019s reliance on \u201cthe last antecedent rule\u201d for the contention that, in CR \u00a7 8-611(a)(3), \u201cadopted or used by a person to identify the goods or services of the person\u201d applies only to \u201cword.\u201d Under the last antecedent rule, \u201ca qualifying clause ordinarily is confined to the immediately preceding word or phrase!.]\u201d <em>Davis v. </em>State, 426 Md. 211, 229 n. 6, 43 A.3d 1044, 1054 n. 6 (2012) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The last antecedent rule does not apply \u201c[w]here the sense of the entire [statute] requires that a qualifying [clause] apply to several preceding\u201d words. <em>Emp\u2019t Sec. Admin. v. Weimer, </em>285 Md. 96, 102, 400 A.2d 1101, 1105 (1979) (citation omitted). Here, it is clear that the sense of CR \u00a7 8\u2014611(a)(3) as a whole requires that \u201cadopted or used by a person to identify the goods or services of the person\u201d apply to each word in the preceding list. Indeed, it would be illogical for \u201cadopted or used by a person to identify the goods or services of the person\u201d to apply to the word \u201cword,\u201d but not the extremely similar word \u201cterm.\u201d Thus, the Honorable Christopher B.

Bob circulates copies of \u201cBob\u2019s Cookbook,\u201d the cover of which contains a \u201cB\u201d in a distinctive font. Bob has not registered the \u201cB\u201d with any government entity. Chris asks Bob for permission to make copies of \u201cBob\u2019s Cookbook,\u201d sell them, and split the proceeds. Bob declines.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">As the State points out, it is clear that Chris would violate CR \u00a7 8-611 by selling copies of \u201cBob\u2019s Cookbook\u201d without Bob\u2019s authority, if the \u201cB\u201d is a \u201clabel\u201d or a \u201cdesign\u201d that Bob has adopted or used to identify \u201cBob\u2019s Cookbook,\u201d which is a \u201cgood.\u201d It is not dispositive that Bob has not registered the \u201cB\u201d with any government entity; as discussed above in Part I, CR \u00a7 8-611 applies to unregistered labels, terms, devices, designs, or words adopted or used by a person to identify the person\u2019s goods or services.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">To the extent that McCree contends that the Free Speech Clause protects the misappropriation of unregistered labels, terms, devices, designs, or words that are used to identify goods and services\u2014and thus protects Chris\u2019s making and selling copies of \u201cBob\u2019s Cookbook\u201d without Bob\u2019s authority\u2014 such a contention is not in accord with case law concerning facial vagueness. In determining whether a statute is facially void-for-vagueness, a court considers only whether the statute\u2019s \u201cprohibitions are ... clearly defined.\u201d <em>Aladdin\u2019s Castle, </em>455 U.S. at 289, 102 S.Ct. 1070 (citation, emphasis, and internal quotation marks omitted). As discussed above, CR \u00a7 8-611\u2019s prohibitions of certain acts involving \u201cintellectual property\u201d are precisely defined, and there is no need to guess at CR \u00a7 8-611\u2019s meaning or reason to differ as to CR \u00a7 8-611\u2019s application. A statute is not facially void-for-vagueness simply because a party disapproves of the statute\u2019s proscriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>For the above reasons, we hold that CR \u00a7 8-611 is not facially void-for-vagueness.
