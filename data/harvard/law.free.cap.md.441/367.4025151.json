Statement of the Case &amp; Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"Ab5\">In this attorney disciplinary action, the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland (\u201cPetitioner\u201d or \u201cthe Commission\u201d), acting through Bar Counsel, filed a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action (\u201cPDRA\u201d) against Eugene Alan Shapiro, Esquire (\u201cRespondent\u201d or \u201cShapiro\u201d), charging him with violations of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) arising from his representation of Diana Wisniewski (\u201cWisniewski\u201d). Respondent was charged with violating MLRPC 1.2(a) (Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority Between Client and Lawyer),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1.3 (Diligence),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.4 (Communication),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1.8 (Conflict of Interest: Current Clients),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>1.16 (Declining or Terminating Representation),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 8.4(a), (c), and (d) (Misconduct).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commission served Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>on 24 January 2014 with a copy of the PDRA, Writ of Summons, and Order for Hearing under Maryland Rule 16-752(a). Respondent filed timely an Answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The case was assigned to a hearing judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to conduct an evidentiary hearing and render findings of fact and recommended conclusions of law with regard to the charges. The hearing was conducted on 16 May 2014. Respondent was the sole witness called by Petitioner, and testified on his own behalf as well. At the conclusion of the hearing, the parties submitted proposed written findings of fact and conclusions of law. In addition, Petitioner responded to Respondent\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. In the hearing judge\u2019s opinion, the following factual findings were made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">The Respondent was admitted to the Maryland Bar on 14 December 1973. He currently maintains a personal injury practice in Baltimore, Maryland, which consists of one other practicing attorney and an administrative assistant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">In the summer of 2004, the complainant, Diane Wisniewski, underwent knee surgery at St. Agnes Hospital, which allegedly resulted in an infection. On 16 September 2005, Wisniewski retained the Respondent as counsel in order to pursue a medical malpractice suit against the hospital. The Respondent agreed to represent Wisniewski in accordance with the following fee arrangement: the Respondent would receive 33.333% of any recovery by settlement without litigation and 40% of any recovery awarded following litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">Respondent acquired Wisniewski\u2019s medical records and sought an expert for the purpose of filing a Certificate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Merit. Respondent testified that he forwarded Wisniewski\u2019s medical records to several doctors; however, none \u201cseemed to be interested in getting involved.\u201d Respondent admits that he did not inform Wisniewski of the difficulty he encountered in obtaining an expert to file the Certificate of Merit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">On 13 July 2007, Respondent filed a Statement of Claim with the Health Claims Arbitration Office on behalf of Wisniewski in an effort to protect her claim from being barred by the applicable statute of limitations date. At this time, the Respondent still had not secured an expert to file the Certificate of Merit. Wisniewski\u2019s claim was subsequently dismissed by the Health Claims Arbitration Office, as no Certificate of Merit was ever submitted in support of the claim. By the time the Statement of Claim was dismissed, the statute of limitations concerning Wisniewski\u2019s claim had expired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">Respondent admits that he failed to inform Wisniewski that the Health Claims Arbitration Office had dismissed her claim and that the statute of limitations on the claim had expired. Respondent concealed this information for a period of five years following the dismissal of the claim and expiration of the statute of limitations, leading Wisniewski to believe that her claim was still active. Respondent admits that he continued his representation of Wisniewski during this time, failing to inform her of the conflict of interest that existed and her right to seek independent counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">By the fall of 2012, Respondent had still failed to inform Wisniewski of the actual status of her case and instead told her that a settlement had been reached. Respondent could not recall the amount of money for which he reported the case had settled. Respondent then met with Wisniewski regarding the fictional settlement, at which time he informed her that he did not have the money she was to receive from the settlement. As a result, Wisniewski filed a complaint with the Petitioner in late October 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Respondent revealed the true status of the medical malpractice claim to Wisniewski at some point after Wisniewski filed her complaint with the Petitioner. Respondent then entered into a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d with Wisniewski in December of 2012. In a handwritten note, signed by the Respondent and witnessed by the Respondent\u2019s business partner and wife, Ruth M. Schaub, the Respondent agreed to pay Wisniewski a lump sum of $12,500.00, to be followed by monthly payments of $2,000. The monthly payments were set to begin on 10 January 2013 and to continue until the total of $66,000.00 was paid as \u201cfull and final settlement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\">Respondent testified that, at the time of the settlement agreement, he orally informed Wisniewski of her right to seek independent counsel and offered to provide information regarding his malpractice insurance. The written agreement, however, lacks any indicia that Wisniewski gave her informed consent concerning the essential terms of the settlement agreement, Respondent\u2019s role in the agreement, or the desirability of retaining independent counsel prior to the execution of the agreement. To the extent that any informed consent may have been obtained in this regard, it was not confirmed by Wisniewski in writing anywhere in this written agreement or in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">Respondent testified that the $66,000.00 settlement amount is what Wisniewski would have netted had the case against St. Agnes settled for $100,000.00 (accounting for the Respondent\u2019s 1/3 attorney\u2019s fee). According to the Respondent, $66,000.00 represents what Wisniewski would have accepted as a settlement had she been successful in litigating her claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">Respondent testified that all payments to Wisniewski have been made timely and in accordance with the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">(minor alterations added) (citations omitted). Based on his analysis, the hearing judge concluded that the Commission proved, by clear and convincing evidence, that Shapiro violated MLRPC 1.2(a), 1.3,1.4(a) and (b), 1.8(a)(2), 1.16, and 8.4(a), (c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>and (d). The hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law with respect to each of the claimed violations will be discussed in turn below.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Petitioner filed with us a single written exception to the hearing judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. In its exception, Petitioner argued that the hearing judge should have concluded that Petitioner proved by clear and convincing evidence that the terms of the settlement agreement were unfair or unreasonable, leading to a violation of MLRPC 1.8(a)(1). Respondent filed no exceptions, timely or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction over attorney discipline matters. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Kremer, </em>432 Md. 325, 334, 68 A.3d 862, 867 (2013). Accordingly, we \u201cconduct an independent review of the record.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Garfield, </em>369 Md. 85, 97, 797 A.2d 757, 763 (2002). \u201cWe determine, ultimately, whether an attorney has committed the misconduct charged by the Attorney Grievance Commission.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Maignan, </em>390 Md. 287, 292, 888 A.2d 344, 347 (2005). In accordance with Maryland Rule 16-752, we refer petitions for disciplinary action to a circuit court judge to act as our hearing officer, for that judge to receive evidence and thereafter present to the Court findings of fact and recommended conclusions of law. <em>See Maignan, </em>390 Md. at 292-93, 888 A.2d at 347. Exceptions may be taken by the parties to the findings of fact, proposed conclusions of law, or both. If no exceptions are filed with respect to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, we may \u201ctreat the findings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions, if any.\u201d Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A). If exceptions are filed, we must determine whether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 16\u2014759(b)(2)(B); <em>see Attorney Grievance Commission v. Stolarz, </em>379 Md. 387, 397, 842 A.2d 42, 47 (2004) (\u201cWe ... accept[ ] the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>When assessing the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, we \u201cgive due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(B). We review the judge\u2019s recommended conclusions of law without deference, a standard referred to sometimes as <em>de novo. </em>Md. Rule 16\u2014759(b)(1); <em>see Attorney Grievance Commission v. Greenleaf, </em>438 Md. 151, 156, 91 A.3d 1066, 1069 (2014) (\u201cIn an attorney discipline proceeding, this Court reviews for clear error the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and reviews without deference the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Moeller, </em>427 Md. 66, 73, 46 A.3d 407, 411 (2012) (\u201cWith respect to a hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, no deference applies and we review those conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d); Attorney Grievance Commission v. Patterson, </em>421 Md. 708, 724, 28 A.3d 1196, 1205 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Inasmuch as no party filed exceptions to the factual findings of the hearing judge, we accept them as established. We turn then to consideration of the recommended conclusions of law and sanction, if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\n<em>A. MLRPC 1.2 (Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority Between Client and Lawyer)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">MLRPC 1.2(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">(a) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d), a lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of the representation and, when appropriate, shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued. A lawyer may take such action on behalf of the client as is impliedly authorized to carry out the representation. A lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decision whether to settle a matter....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">The hearing judge concluded, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated Rule 1.2 \u201cbecause Respondent\u2019s failure to inform [Wisniewski] that her claim before the Health Claims Arbitration Office had been dismissed and that the statute of limitations had expired deprived [Wisniewski] of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>her ability to make an informed decision as to the objectives of the representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">In order for a lawyer to abide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of the representation, the client must be able to make informed decisions as to the objectives of the representation. In order for a client to make informed decisions as to the objectives of the representation, an attorney must give the client honest updates regarding the status of his or her case. In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Sperling, </em>an attorney violated MLRPC 1.2 when he failed to inform (for several years) a client that her case had been dismissed. 432 Md. 471, 493, 69 A.3d 478, 491 (2013). In that matter, an associate attorney in a law firm was assigned responsibility for a client\u2019s case and tasked with attending pretrial conferences, drafting discovery, and engaging and interacting with a process server. <em>Sperling, </em>432 Md. at 475, 69 A.3d at 480. The defendant in the matter was never served with the initial complaint, resulting in dismissal of the suit. <em>Id. </em>Two years later, Sperling\u2019s father, a partner in the law firm, filed a Motion for Reconsideration of Dismissal, which was granted. <em>Id. </em>The defendant, yet to be served, failed to appear at three pre-trial conferences. <em>Id. </em>The case was dismissed again. <em>Sperling, </em>432 Md. at 475-76, 69 A.3d at 480. The attorney did not inform his client of either dismissal. <em>Id. </em>Eight years after the second dismissal\u2014and almost ten years after the firm took the case originally\u2014the client emailed Sperling to inquire about the status of her case. <em>Sperling, </em>432 Md. at 476, 69 A.3d at 480. He responded by assuring his client that the case was \u201cstill making its rounds with the [court] clerk and she assures me she is working on it,\u201d but did not tell her that her case had been dismissed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The attorney argued that this conduct did not violate MLRPC because any alternative or choice that the client would have had after the case had been dismissed would not have led to a successful outcome for her. <em>Sperling, </em>432 Md. at 493, 69 A.3d at 491. We held that MLRPC 1.2(a) \u201cdoes not require that a client\u2019s decision regarding the objectives of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>representation necessarily result in a successful outcome. It was [the client\u2019s] choice that was offended by [Sperling\u2019s] failure to inform her of the dismissal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we found that MLRPC 1.2(a) was violated. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">In at least three other modern cases, attorneys violated MLRPC 1.2(a) by failing to inform clients of the status of their cases. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Davy, </em>435 Md. 674, 80 A.3d 322 (2013); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Brown, </em>426 Md. 298, 44 A.3d 344 (2012); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. 209, 892 A.2d 533 (2006). In <em>Reinhardt, </em>the attorney took a case, and filed a complaint on behalf of his client, but failed to serve the defendant with the summons. <em>Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 215, 892 A.2d at 536. Approximately six months later, the client inquired as to the status of her case. <em>Id. </em>The attorney did not respond, but instead put the file in a briefcase, and later put the briefcase in a closet, not realizing that he had left the file in the briefcase. <em>Id. </em>He did not respond to the client\u2019s repeated inquiries, nor did he take any actions to prevent the dismissal of the lawsuit. <em>Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 215-16, 892 A.2d at 536-37. The attorney did not conduct an \u201caggressive\u201d search for the lost file for approximately four years. <em>Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 216, 892 A.2d at 537. When he located the file, he did not tell his client that he had misplaced it and took no action on her case in four years, but rather indicated in a letter to the client that there was an \u201cissue\u201d securing service on the Defendants. <em>Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 216-17, 892 A.2d at 537. We concluded that this behavior constituted a violation of Rule 1.2(a) as the attorney \u201cfailfed] to follow the client\u2019s instruction to pursue [her] case and inform her of the status of the case.\u201d <em>Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 220, 222, 892 A.2d at 539-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The misconduct in <em>Brown </em>\u201cmirrorfed] closely\u201d the misconduct in <em>Reinhardt. Brown, </em>426 Md. at 320, 44 A.3d at 357. In <em>Brown, </em>two cases were dismissed for lack of prosecution. <em>Id. </em>The attorney failed to inform his clients of those dismissals and ignored their repeated requests for information. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>In <em>Davy, </em>an attorney filed a complaint on behalf of a client in the after-hours filing box at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 685, 80 A.3d at 328. The federal court mailed a rejection of the complaint to the attorney, explaining that the complaint was rejected because the attorney failed to renew her membership in the federal court\u2019s bar, and also failed to include a cover sheet, summons, and disc with the complaint. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 686, 80 A.3d at 328. The attorney called the federal court about the rejection of the complaint and spoke with three people regarding the rejection, but nonetheless emailed her client telling her that the complaint had been filed on time and suggested further that the summons was about to be issued and would be served subsequently. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 686-87, 80 A.3d at 329. A few weeks later, the client visited the federal court personally, and was told that there was no case pending in her name. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 687, 80 A.3d at 329. The attorney continued to work on the matter even though the client accused the attorney of breaking their agreement and requested her money back. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 688-89, 80 A.3d at 329-30. Such behavior violated MLRPC 1.2(a). <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 699, 80 A.3d at 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">We agree with the hearing judge that Shapiro\u2019s conduct violated MLRPC 1.2(a) as he failed to keep Wisniewski informed as to the status of her case and, accordingly, deprived her of the opportunity to make informed decisions as to the objective of the representation. In our view, his sustained deceit surpasses the grievous MLRPC 1.2 violations of the attorneys in <em>Reinhardt, Brown, </em>and <em>Davy </em>and rivals that of the attorney in <em>Sperling.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\n<em>B. MLRPC 1.3 (Diligence)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">MLRPC 1.3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">The hearing judge concluded, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated Rule 1.3</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>as a result of his failure to promptly act after learning that the Health Claims Arbitration Office dismissed Wisniewski\u2019s claim and that the statute of limitations had run. While the Respondent could have attempted to reopen the case, researched whether there were means of legally circumventing the running of the statute of limitations, investigated whether there was a basis for asserting that the statute of limitations had not tolled, or at the least, informed Wisniewski of the situation, he instead chose to do nothing but hide the true status of the case from Wisniewski, a clear violation of Rule 1.3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">(minor alterations added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The \u201cdecision to do nothing promptly when [an attorney] learn[s] the case was dismissed\u201d violates MLRPC 1.3. <em>Sperling, </em>432 Md. at 491, 69 A.3d at 489. In <em>Sperling, </em>when an attorney learned that his client\u2019s case had been dismissed, he failed to file immediately a motion to reopen; neither did he research whether there were means to circumvent legally the running of the statute of limitations, nor investigate whether there was another basis for arguing that the statute of limitations had not tolled. <em>Id. </em>His failure to take those steps constituted a violation of MLRPC 1.3. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, a failure to protect against the expiration of the statute of limitations regarding a client\u2019s claim may violate MLRPC 1.3. <em>Brown, </em>426 Md. at 321, 44 A.3d at 358. In <em>Brown, </em>two clients\u2019 law suits were dismissed due to the attorney\u2019s \u201claggard representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Prior to the dismissal of their suits, the applicable statute of limitations expired on the claims. <em>Id. </em>The failure to take active steps to protect against such an outcome constituted a violation of MLRPC 1.3. <em>Id. </em>Aso, in <em>Kremer, </em>where clients were unable to learn of the status of their case after repeated attempts to reach their attorney, we held that the failure to keep one\u2019s client informed of his or her case violates MLRPC 1.3 and 1.4. 432 Md. at 335-36, 68 A.3d at 868-69; <em>see Attorney Grievance Commission v. Walker-Turner, </em>428 Md. 214, 229, 51 A.3d 553, 562 (2012) (\u201cWalker-Turner violated MLRPC 1.3 also by failing to ascertain the status of his clients\u2019 case after he missed the trial.\u201d); <em>Attorney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>Grievance Commission v.

Respondent did not protect adequately Wisniewski\u2019s claim from expiring due to the running of the applicable statute of limitations. Finally, Respondent failed to advise Wisniewski of his apparent inability to find a willing doctor, such that Wisniewski could make decisions or assist with regard to locating a willing doctor before her claim lapsed. These shortcomings violate MLRPC 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\n<em>C.

Kwarteng, </em>411 Md. 652, 658, 660, 984 A.2d 865, 868-69 (2009). The misrepresentation of the status of a case to a client constitutes a violation of MLRPC 1.4(a). <em>Sperling, </em>432 Md. at 494, 69 A.3d at 491; <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v.

The attorney in <em>Sperling </em>concealed from his client the fact that her case had been dismissed, instead misrepresenting to the client that her case was being pursued. <em>Sperling, </em>432 Md. at 494, 69 A.3d at 491. Such behavior violated MLRPC 1.4(a). <em>Id.; see Brown, </em>426 Md. at 321-22, 44 A.3d at 358 (violating MLRPC 1.4(a) by failing to notify various clients of discovery sanctions and the dismissal of a claim, as well as by failing to respond to case-status requests). MLRPC 1.4(b) is violated similarly by a lack of communication, as clients are unable to make informed decisions regarding their cases if their attorney has not communicated fully with them. A failure to inform a client about a pending or granted motion to dismiss violates MLRPC 1.4(b), as clients are denied the opportunity to make informed decisions regarding the best course of conduct for their claims. <em>Sperling, </em>432 Md. at 494, 69 A.3d at 491; <em>see Attorney Grievance Commission v.

MLRPC 1.8 (Conflict of Interest: Current Clients: Specific Rules)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">MLRPC 1.8(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">(a) A lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">(1) the transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\">(2) the client is advised in writing of the desirability of seeking and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel on the transaction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">(3) the client gives informed consent, in a writing signed by the client, to the essential terms of the transaction and the lawyer\u2019s role in the transaction, including whether the lawyer is representing the client in the transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">With regard to MLRPC 1.8, the hearing judge concluded, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afs\">violated Rule 1.8 as a result of his settlement arrangement with Wisniewski. While the Respondent was not prohibited outright from entering into this kind of arrangement with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Wisniewski, Respondent was required to inform Wisniewski in writing of the desirability of seeking independent counsel prior to entering into a settlement agreement with Respondent. While Respondent testified that he orally advised Wisniewski, there is no indication in the record, nor does Respondent anywhere assert, that Wisniewski was ever given written notice. The record is similarly lacking indicia that Wisniewski gave her informed consent in writing, as required by paragraph (a)(3) and in accordance with Rule 1.0(f).[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] ... [N]o writing exists in which Wisniewski gives her informed consent to the agreement.

The hearing judge felt (appropriately) that it was not necessary to address that issue, as there was, in fact, no disclosure in writing of any kind. Thus, we are not compelled to define here the lowest threshold for what may constitute an appropriate disclosure. What is appropriate for us to iterate (or reiterate, put more correctly) as guidance is that the transaction and terms of such a business transaction must be \u201cfair and reasonable ... [and] fully disclosed and transmitted in writing in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the client.\u201d MLRPC 1.8(a)(1); <em>see Attorney Grievance Commission v.

Lawson, </em>428 Md. 102, 115, 50 A.3d 1196, 1203 (2012). In <em>Lawson, </em>an attorney and his client entered into a settlement agreement concerning a disputed attorney\u2019s fee, which gave the attorney a lien on the proceeds of the client\u2019s marital property settlement. <em>Id. </em>The client had poor eyesight and was unable to understand the relevant law or \u201clegalese\u201d of the agreement itself. <em>Id. </em>The client was not advised of the desirability of seeking independent counsel, nor was he given an opportunity to do so and, accordingly, the client did not give informed consent, written or otherwise, to the \u00e9ssential terms. <em>Id. </em>Lawson violated MLRPC 1.8 as a result. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Steinberg, </em>an attorney violated MLRPC 1.8 when he sought to have his client, without the assistance of independent counsel, execute a release of any legal malpractice claims against the attorney. 395 Md. at 365, 910 A.2d at 445. He neither advised her of the desirability of obtaining counsel, nor did he allow her to do so: when she entered the room for a meeting with counsel a \u201cRelease in Full\u201d was sitting on the table, ready to be signed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We agree with the hearing judge that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.8 by not advising Wisniewski in writing of the desirability of seeking independent counsel prior to entering into the agreement with Respondent. Any advice that may have been given orally by Respondent falls well short of satisfying the clear requirements of MLRPC 1.8(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\n<em>2. MLRPC 1.8(a)(l)\u2019s \u201cFair and Reasonable\u201d Requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Petitioner argued implicitly in its proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law that the facial terms of the settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>agreement were a violation of MLRPC 1.8(a)(1). The hearing judge declined to conclude that the terms of the settlement agreement constituted an additional, independent violation of MLRPC 1.8(a)(1). He refrained from reaching such a conclusion of law because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\">[Tjhere is insufficient information on the record from which to evaluate whether the terms of the settlement agreement were unfair or unreasonable to Wisniewski. Petitioner offered no evidence as to the specific nature or potential value of Wisniewski\u2019s medical malpractice claim against St. Agnes Hospital, and therefore, the Court has no objective basis on which to make its determination on this theory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">(minor alterations added).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Petitioner took exception to the judge\u2019s conclusion that Bar Counsel failed to meet its burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the terms of the settlement agreement were unfair or unreasonable to Wisniewski, in violation of MLRPC 1.8(a)(1). Petitioner based its exception on \u201cthe inherent unfairness concerning the benefit Respondent received from the settlement of a claim that arose from his mishandling of that client\u2019s case.\u201d Bar Counsel argues that there was sufficient evidence to compel the hearing judge to conclude that the terms of the settlement agreement were unfair patently in a way that violated MLRPC 1.8(a)(1). Bar Counsel rests its argument on three facts: (1) Respondent took a 1/3 attorney\u2019s fee from the settlement for services that, according to Petitioner, he did not perform; (2) the agreement capped Respondent\u2019s liability to Wisniewski as a \u201cfull and final settlement,\u201d without including provisions as to the payout period for interest or other consideration for interest-free repayments; and (3) the lack of written evidence of Wisniewski\u2019s informed consent, confirmed in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Petitioner argues in its exception that it satisfied the initial burden of making a prima facie showing that the Respondent entered into an unfair business transaction with his client and, thus, it became Respondent\u2019s burden to demonstrate in his case-in-chief at trial that, notwithstanding the facts and provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>sions mentioned above, the settlement was fair and reasonable. As Petitioner sees it, because no such evidence was produced at trial by Respondent, the hearing judge was wrong not to have concluded that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.8(a)(1) based on the terms of the settlement agreement alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757(b), Petitioner \u201chas the burden of proving the averments of the petition by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d We have not had much occasion previously to discuss in any depth, with regard to MLRPC 1.8(a)(1), the burdens of production and proof regarding whether agreements between attorneys and clients are fair and reasonable. We have noted that, when attorneys and clients enter into contracts, \u201c \u2018the law makes a presumption against the attorney and in favor of the client. In such cases the <em>onus </em>is on the attorney to prove the entire <em>bona fides </em>and fairness of the transaction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Korotki </em>318 Md. 646, 666, 569 A.2d 1224, 1234 (1990) (quoting <em>Merryman v. Euler, </em>59 Md. 588-90 (1883)). In questions regarding whether the transaction and terms of a business transaction with a client are fair and reasonable to the client:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">[T]he attorney has the burden of showing, not only that he used no undue influence, but that he gave his client all the information and advice which it would have been his duty to give if he himself had not been interested, and that the transaction was as beneficial to the client as it would have been had the client dealt with a stranger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-6\"><em>Attorney Grievance Commission v.

Snyder, </em>368 Md. 242, 265-66, 793 A.2d 515, 529 (2002)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The attorney bears also \u201ca significant burden to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>prove the fairness of an agreement concerning fees made with his client after services have been rendered in the course of the confidential relationship of attorney and client.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Eisenstein, </em>333 Md. 464, 478, 635 A.2d 1327, 1334 (1994). In situations where the client has not been \u201cadvised in writing of the desirability of seeking and [was not] given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel on the transaction,\u201d MLRPC 1.8(a)(2), we presume that the agreement between the attorney and client is not a fair and reasonable one. Respondents may overcome this presumption by adducing a prima facie case that the agreement is fair and reasonable, despite the lack of a written disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">In this matter, the hearing judge was disinclined to find a separate violation of 1.8(a)(1) based on the state of the record before him. Based on the record and in light of the guidance provided above, we need not determine here whether the terms and conditions of the agreement between Respondent and Wisniewski were fair and reasonable. Petitioner\u2019s exception is moot, as the hearing judge concluded previously\u2014and we agree\u2014that Respondent violated clearly MLRPC 1.8(a)(2) by not providing Wisniewski with an appropriate written disclosure. This became a violation of MLRPC 1.8(a), in and of itself, as the sub-parts of MLRPC 1.8(a) are expressed in the conjunctive. Thus, as charged in the PDRA, Shapiro was found to have violated MLRPC 1.8(a). The unit of prosecution under MLRPC 1.8(a) is but a single unit as regards a single transaction, regardless of whether all or any one of sub-parts (1), (2), and/or (3) are proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\n<em>E.

After he discovered the mistake, and realized that the applicable statute of limitations expired actually, he failed to inform her of his mistake. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, he continued to represent the client on other matters. <em>Bleecker, </em>414 Md. at 173, 994 A.2d at 943. We concluded that the attorney \u201cwas obligated to withdraw from the representation, when he became aware that the statute of limitations had expired,\u201d and he was also \u201cobligated to advise [his client] to seek independent counsel concerning a potential malpractice claim.\u201d <em>Id.; see Attorney Grievance Commission v.

Like the attorneys in <em>Bleecker </em>and <em>Pennington, </em>Respondent failed to withdraw immediately after learning of the potential cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>action that Wisniewski may have had against him.

The hearing judge concluded further that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(c) and (d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-12\">By his own admission, Respondent concealed from Wisniewski the true status of her medical malpractice case from late 2007 until late 2012.

Respondent went even further in misleading Wisniewski in the fall of 2012, when he informed her that the case had been settled when no such settlement had occurred. Such action constitutes a clear violation of paragraph (c) of the Rule. Finally, ... Respondent violated Rule 8.4(d) by neglecting to keep Wisniewski informed about the status of her case and to perform his duty as counsel with promptness and diligence.

Sperling made material misrepresentations to the court when he told a judge that he had contacted the court clerk several times to discover the status of the case when he in fact had not. <em>Sperling, </em>432 Md. at 491-92, 69 A.3d at 490. He submitted motions and affidavits to the court repeating these misrepresentations. <em>Id. </em>We determined that the respondent made those misstatements to the court in an attempt to mislead the court into granting the motions to reopen. <em>Id. </em>We noted several aggravating factors in <em>Sperling: </em>the attorney-lied to the court in order to \u201cplace blame on others [the court clerk],\u201d he lied multiple times to multiple parties, he testified falsely during an evidentiary hearing before the circuit court, and he downplayed consistently the significance of his misrepresentations to his client and the court. <em>Sperling, </em>432 Md. at 496-97, 69 A.3d at 492-93. We concluded that an indefinite suspension was the appropriate sanction. <em>Sperling, </em>432 Md. at 498, 69 A.3d at 494. (\u201c[The respondent\u2019s] misconduct involved one case and one client, but was marred by his lack of competence, diligence, and lack of candor with his client and the court, certainly grievous actions.\u201d); <em>see Attorney Grievance Commission v.

In the present case, Shapiro misrepresented to Wisniewski the true status of her case for five years before telling her that her case had \u201csettled.\u201d Although Shapiro violated also MLRPC 1.8, his misrepresentations to Wisniewski were for a shorter period of time than those in <em>Sperling; </em>he made no misrepresentations to a court; and has not attempted to downplay the significance of his violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We deemed indefinite suspension appropriate also where an attorney acted dishonestly and made misrepresentations to his client out of \u201cabsolute embarrassment.\u201d <em>Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 223-24, 892 A.2d at 541. Reinhardt told his client that he was working on the client\u2019s case when actually he had lost the file and had taken no action on the matter. <em>Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 222, 892 A.2d at 540. Four years passed before the attorney found the file and concealed the delay by indicating to the client that there had been an \u201cissue\u201d securing service on the defendants. <em>Reinhardt, 391 </em>Md. at 216-17, 892 A.2d at 537. We characterized his actions as \u201cdishonest,\u201d in the sense that the \u201crespondent exhibited a lack of probity, integrity and straightforwardness.\u201d <em>Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 222, 892 A.2d at 540. We noted at the outset that \u201clying to a client reflects most negatively on the legal profession. It goes without saying that a lawyer should not lie to the client about the status of the client\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 225, 892 A.2d at 542. Reinhardt\u2019s sanction was an indefinite suspension, however, because he cooperated fully with Bar Counsel, negotiated a restitution plan, and worked with the client to settle the underlying matter. <em>Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 224, 892 A.2d at 541. Even though there was an aggravating consideration, i.e., Reinhardt had been suspended indefinitely previously, we concluded that disbarment was not warranted as there was \u201cno evidence that he acted out of fraudulent or selfish motive.\u201d <em>Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 223-24, 230 n. 4, 892 A.2d at 541, 545 n. 4. Because no misappropriation of funds nor criminal conduct were implicated, and the misconduct related to but one client in a single case context, we deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>mined that an indefinite suspension was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>In the present matter, Shapiro\u2019s misrepresentations similarly related to one client and one case, although spread over several years. Respondent\u2019s settlement with Wisniewski, although handled improperly, indicated a willingness to attain some sort of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">Even when an attorney\u2019s misconduct is committed with respect to more than one client, an indefinite suspension is sometimes appropriate. In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Harrington, </em>an attorney failed to pursue two matters that he undertook, failed to comply with reasonable requests for information from one client, and failed to keep the other informed reasonably regarding the status of the case. 367 Md. 36, 47-48, 785 A.2d 1260, 1266-67 (2001). He terminated also a client relationship without taking steps to protect the client\u2019s interests, and was very uncooperative with Bar Counsel. <em>Id. </em>And even though he led one of his clients to believe that he filed a suit on her behalf when in fact he had not, we concluded that an indefinite suspension was appropriate. <em>Harrington, </em>367 Md. at 51, 785 A.2d at 1269. In comparison, Respondent in the present case failed to file a Certificate of Merit, failed to keep Wisniewski informed as to the true status of her case, and violated MLRPC 1.8, but cooperated with Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Because we \u201cevaluate every attorney grievance matter on its own merits, taking into account the facts and circumstances involved,\u201d <em>Bleecker, </em>414 Md. at 176, 994 A.2d at 945, we have not aspired to set out or suggest a formula or rubric to determine what an attorney\u2019s sanction will be based on various combinations of violations of the MLRPC. Such an aspiration would be unrealistic, given the need to tailor a sanction to the particular facts and circumstances of each case. We observe generally, however, that we tend to favor disbarment when attorneys\u2019 misrepresentations and deceitful actions are committed against multiple clients, are paired with violations of the rules pertaining to the proper handling of client or third party money or property, or are joined with a large number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>other violations (whether of the MLRPC or the Maryland Code).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The respondent in <em>Lane, </em>whose misconduct was committed against two clients, committed himself to a snowballing lie of \u201cthe most egregious nature.\u201d <em>Lane, </em>367 Md. at 647, 790 A.2d at-629. Lane took no action on a client\u2019s case and filed no pleadings of any kind, yet told his client that a summons had been issued for the opposing party. <em>Lane, </em>367 Md. at 638-39, 790 A.2d at 623-24. He met his client at the courthouse and told his client that the opposing party failed to appear. <em>Id. </em>Lane then took his leave by pretending to have a meeting with the judge, and returned to inform falsely his client that the judge would rule in his favor. <em>Id. </em>He claimed later that the opposing party had filed a \u201cstay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>With respect to another client, the respondent did not communicate properly the terms of their fee arrangement, paid some of the client\u2019s bills from his own funds, and did not file appropriate pleadings in order to secure an injunction against a utility threatening to turn off the client\u2019s water service. <em>Lane, </em>367 Md. at 639-40, 790 A.2d at 624. Instead, he claimed to have filed a motion for sanctions against the water company for turning off the client\u2019s water ultimately, and then paid his client a sum of money that he said came from the company as a result of the sanctions action, but in reality came from his own pocket. <em>Id. </em>Finally, he told the same client that he filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted, resulting in an award to her of over 11 million dollars. <em>Lane, </em>367 Md. at 640, 790 A.2d at 625. She was told to come to the courthouse with a suitcase and personal security to carry the cash home. <em>Id. </em>When she arrived at the courthouse, he confessed that he had misled her completely regarding the status of her lawsuit and that no money was forthcoming. <em>Id. </em>It is of little surprise that Lane was disbarred. <em>Lane, </em>367 Md. at 647-48, 790 A.2d at 629. Although the lies of the Respondent in the present case are serious, they are not as extreme as those uttered by the attorney in <em>Lane.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In <em>Brown, </em>the attorney committed various acts of misconduct with respect to four clients. 426 Md. at 305-06, 44 A.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>at 349. He failed to pursue a client\u2019s claims in a timely manner, which resulted in the statute of limitations expiring before the case was dismissed for a failure to prosecute. <em>Brown, </em>426 Md. at 320-21, 44 A.3d at 358. The attorney failed also to answer discovery requests and incurred sanctions in another client matter. <em>Id. </em>Brown did not inform his clients about the dismissal or the sanctions and further ignored repeated requests for information from another client. <em>Brown, </em>426 Md. at 320-22, 44 A.3d at 357-59. Brown did not return documents in his case file to a client in a timely manner, and also did not respond to two information request letters from Bar Counsel. <em>Brown, </em>426 Md. at 322-23, 44 A.3d at 359. Such conduct violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16, 3.2, and 8.1(b). <em>Brown, </em>426 Md. at 326, 44 A.3d at 361. We held also that the manner in which Brown misled his client violated MLRPC 8.4(c), as Brown told one of his clients that the case was pending in arbitration, when in reality it had been dismissed two years previously. <em>Brown, </em>426 Md. at 324, 44 A.3d at 359-60. Given the \u201cgravity and pervasiveness\u201d of Brown\u2019s misconduct, we concluded that the appropriate sanction was disbarment. <em>Brown, </em>426 Md. at 328, 44 A.3d at 362; <em>see also Kremer, </em>432 Md. at 335-36, 340-41, 68 A.3d at 866-69, 871 (disbarring an attorney where he committed misconduct with respect to four clients, failed to cooperate with Bar Counsel, failed to file bankruptcy petitions for multiple clients, missed hearings, caused a case to be dismissed, failed to respond to clients, abandoned cases before completion, and failed to return to clients documents and unearned fees). In comparison, Shapiro\u2019s misrepresentations were limited to one case with one client.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">When an attorney\u2019s misrepresentations are paired with violations of the MLRPC provisions regarding financial or other property matters, the sanction is most often disbarment. In <em>Lawson, </em>an attorney was disbarred for violations of MLRPC 1.5, 1.8, 1.15, and 8.4(c) and (d). 428 Md. at 117, 50 A.3d at 1204. Lawson was dishonest with a client about whether an attorney grievance matter was pending against him. <em>Id. </em>The attorney also charged his client an unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>fee and mishandled a subsequent fee dispute by inducing a client to enter into a settlement agreement that gave the attorney a lien on the client\u2019s settlement proceeds regarding a marital property dispute. <em>Lawson, </em>428 Md. at 115, 50 A.3d at 1203. The terms of the settlement agreement were not communicated in a way that the client could understand, and the client did not give informed consent, written or otherwise, as to the essential terms of the transaction. <em>Id. </em>Because Lawson created and then mismanaged client fee disputes, and was motivated by a desire to obtain fees to which he wasn\u2019t entitled from an elderly man in poor health with limited means, we disbarred him. <em>Lawson, </em>428 Md. at 117-19, 50 A.3d at 1204-05; <em>see also McLaughlin, </em>372 Md. at 500-02, 505-06, 813 A.2d at 1164-66, 1168 (disbarring an attorney who received over $70,000 from various clients, but did almost no work for them, and created an improper plan for returning unearned fees to clients (creating a loan relationship), but did not advise them to seek independent counsel). Although Shapiro also entered into an agreement in violation of MLRPC 1.8, nothing in the record in this matter indicates that he was motivated by a desire to obtain fees to which he was not entitled. Moreover, MLRPC 1.15 is not implicated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Pennington, </em>387 Md. 565, 876 A.2d 642, is also instructive. In that matter, a client\u2019s case was dismissed, but rather than communicating the dismissal to the client, Pennington presented a \u201csettlement\u201d of their claims (which included false documents) to her clients with the intent that they not learn of the suit\u2019s dismissal. <em>Pennington, </em>387 Md. at 589-90, 876 A.2d at 656. Instead of disclosing the dismissal of the claim, the respondent attempted to make her clients whole by paying them out of her personal funds what she thought they would find agreeable and what she perceived to be a fair sum. <em>Pennington, </em>387 Md. at 572-73, 876 A.2d at 646. Also, Pennington denied repeatedly any dishonesty on her part and misrepresented intentionally matters in negotiations with a third party health care provider. <em>Pennington, </em>387 Md. at 595, 596, 876 A.2d at 660. That respondent\u2019s \u201cattempt to purchase a plenary indulgence with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>her own money is more indicative of a selfish plan to conceal than of a praiseworthy desire to \u2018make the client whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pennington, </em>387 Md. at 597-98, 876 A.2d at 661. We determined that, regardless of whether she intended to prevent her clients from finding out that they had a potential legal malpractice claim against her or whether she acted out of a desire to spare her clients further anguish, \u201cthe profession is harmed when an attorney intentionally misrepresents matters to a client and behaves in the manner as did respondent,\u201d and that such behavior warrants disbarment. <em>Pennington, </em>387 Md. at 598, 876 A.2d at 661-62. By contrast, Shapiro lied to his client about the status of her claim, and told her that the case had settled when it had not; yet, his misrepresentations were limited to one case and one client and he since took responsibility for his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The attorney in <em>Davy </em>was disbarred for multiple violations of MLRPC (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.15, 1.16, and 8.4) where her misconduct involved dishonesty, multiple clients, unreasonable fees, and mishandling of client funds. 435 Md. at 683, 711, 80 A.3d at 326, 343. In that matter, the respondent attempted to file a complaint in federal court, but it was rejected for being incomplete. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 685-86, 80 A.3d at 328-29. The suit was dismissed ultimately. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 689, 80 A.3d at 330. When the client learned through other channels that the complaint had been dismissed, she asked the respondent for return of her retainer. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 687-88, 80 A.3d at 329. Without the client\u2019s permission, at a time months later when the attorney should have known that the representation was over, she filed a corrective motion in federal court and asked the client for more money. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 688, 80 A.3d at 330. The respondent led falsely her client to believe that the case had been filed, although the attorney knew the complaint had been rejected, yet still asked for more retainer payments. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 706, 80 A.3d at 340. She told another client that a summons had been issued by the court when in fact it was not. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 687, 80 A.3d at 329. Even after her client learned of the truth of matters and confronted the attorney, Davy attempted to deflect blame by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>telling the client that she discovered a technical error with the filing. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 688, 80 A.3d at 329. She lied further to the client about what corrective services for which she would charge. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 687-88, 80 A.3d at 329. In another client matter, it took the respondent four months to file a petition for bankruptcy after being retained, and thereafter failed to correct deficiencies in that petition until the bankruptcy court issued a third deficiency notice. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 691, 80 A.3d at 331. Finally, the respondent mishandled client funds. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 702-03, 704-05, 80 A.3d at 338-339.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">When considering the appropriate sanction for that attorney, we noted that she committed misconduct with respect to two clients, was intentionally dishonest on at least six occasions, refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of her conduct, and had been suspended indefinitely previously. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 708-10, 80 A.3d at 341-43. We noted further that the respondent showed a dishonest or selfish motive involving the receiving and keeping of money, mislead her clients as to the quality of her representation, and continued to act on the client\u2019s behalf after the representation had ended so as to justify continuing to demand payments from the client. <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. at 711, 80 A.3d at 343. Davy was disbarred. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Davy, </em>434 Md. 246, 74 A.3d 727 (2013). Although Shapiro misrepresented to Wisniewski the status of her claim, he confessed ultimately his lie to his client and cooperated with Bar Counsel. As noted earlier, Shapiro\u2019s misconduct does not implicate MLRPC 1.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In <em>Steinberg, </em>395 Md. 337, 910 A.2d 429, the respondent\u2019s misconduct was committed with respect to three different parties (two clients and an attorney colleague). Steinberg failed to file a petition for bankruptcy on behalf of a client and then failed to forestall a foreclosure sale that was the reason for seeking the protection of the bankruptcy court. <em>Steinberg, </em>395 Md. at 367-68, 910 A.2d at 447. When asked by the client for a status update, he responded dishonestly by saying that he had filed the petition (he filed later one without her consent or signature). <em>Steinberg, </em>395 Md. at 368-69, 910 A.2d at 447-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>48. In another client matter, Steinberg entered into an agreement that limited his liability for professional negligence when his client was not represented independently and did not have an opportunity to consider the document or obtain advice of counsel. <em>Steinberg, </em>395 Md. at 365, 910 A.2d at 445. Steinberg failed to appear at client meetings, and was unprepared during a mediation session. <em>Steinberg, </em>395 Md. at 362, 910 A.2d at 444. He did not return a file to a client when asked and refused to withdraw after a client terminated representation, brought a frivolous suit, and engaged in a pattern of delay by not cooperating or complying with discovery agreements with opposing counsel. <em>Steinberg, </em>395 Md. at 365-66, 910 A.2d at 445-46. Because Steinberg violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5(c), 1.8, 1.16, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, and, accordingly, 8.1, we disbarred him. <em>Steinberg, </em>395 Md. at 371, 376, 910 A.2d at 449, 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The misrepresentations of Shapiro, on the other hand, were limited to one client, although his misrepresentations and the improper agreement were similar to those in <em>Steinberg. </em>The Respondent did not violate MLRPC 1.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 4.1 as did the respondent in <em>Steinberg.

Petitioner suggests that factors (a), (b), (c), (d), (h), and (i) are implicated here. First, Respondent was the subject of a previous disciplinary action. The Attorney Grievance Commission reprimanded Respondent on 24 February 2012 for negligently failing to maintain and remit timely withholding taxes to the IRS and the Maryland Comptroller for five quarters beginning 31 December 2007 and ending 31 December 2008. <em>But see Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 223-24, 230 n. 4, 892 A.2d at 541, 545 n. 4 (determining that an indefinite suspension was appropriate even though the respondent had been suspended indefinitely previously). Second, Petitioner argues that Respondent\u2019s lies to Wisniewski stem from a dishonest and selfish motive. The hearing judge did not make a specific finding as to Respondent\u2019s motives here, but we note for comparison that in <em>Reinhardt </em>we concluded that there was \u201cno evidence that he acted out of fraudulent or selfish motive\u201d when an attorney made misrepresentations to his client out of \u201cabsolute embarrassment.\u201d <em>Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 223-24, 230 n. 4, 892 A.2d at 541, 545 n. 4. Not wishing to admit his mistakes to her, Shapiro created a lie that snowballed over time. Third, Respondent\u2019s continued misrepresentations to Wisniewski over a period of several years constitute undoubtedly a pattern of misconduct. Fourth, Respondent\u2019s conduct involved several distinct violations of the MLRPC. He failed to communicate with Wisniewski regarding his difficulty in obtaining an expert, the dismissal of her case, and the expired statute of limitations. He failed to withdraw from the case when he realized that she may have had a cause of action against him. He lied to her about the existence of a fictitious settlement.

It is his actions, in actively misrepresenting the status of a case to his client for five years, constituting a violation of Rule 8.4(c), which propel his sanction into the realm of disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Intentional violations of MLRPC 8.4(c) constitute \u201cmost egregious misconduct.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v.

In cases where an attorney\u2019s repeated material misrepresentations constitute a pattern of deceitful conduct, as opposed to an isolated instance, the appropriate sanction, as a general rule, is disbarment. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Steinberg, </em>395 Md. 337, 373, 910 A.2d 429, 450 (2006) (\u201cWe long have held that repeated acts of dishonest, fraudulent, or misleading behavior may warrant a sanction of disbarment.\u201d).

Disbarment ordinarily should be the sanction for intentional dishonest conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\"><em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463, 488 (2001). \u201cWhen attorneys engage in dishonest and deceitful conduct for personal gain, this Court does not hesitate to sanction such conduct with disbarment[.]\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Levin, </em>438 Md. 211, 231, 91 A.3d 1101, 1113 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\"><em>Attorney Grievance v. Pennington, 387 </em>Md. 565, 876 A.2d 642 (2005), is instructive. In that matter, the clients\u2019 case was dismissed, but rather than communicating the dismissal to the clients, Pennington presented a \u201csettlement\u201d of their claims (which included false supporting documents) to her clients with the intent that they not learn of the suit\u2019s dismissal. Instead of disclosing the dismissal of the claim, the respondent attempted to make her clients whole by paying them out of her personal funds what she thought they would find agreeable and what she perceived to be a fair sum. Also, Pennington denied repeatedly any dishonesty on her part and misrepresented intentionally matters in negotiations with a third party health care provider. We described the circumstances as the respondent\u2019s \u201cattempt to purchase a plenary indulgence with her own money [which was] more indicative of a selfish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>plan to conceal than of a praiseworthy desire to \u2018make the client whole.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598, 876 A.2d at 661. The Court concluded that, regardless of whether she intended to prevent her clients from finding out that they had a potential legal malpractice claim against her or whether she acted out of a desire to spare her clients further anguish, \u201cthe profession is harmed when an attorney intentionally misrepresents matters to a client and behaves in the manner as did respondent\u201d and that such behavior warrants disbarment. The facts of the present case are similar to those in <em>Pennington. </em>Here, Shapiro did not communicate to Wisniewski the true status of her medical malpractice claim, but instead, to hide the facts, told her that he had secured a settlement on her behalf. When Wisniewski met with Respondent to learn more about the terms of her settlement, he told her that he did not have the money. Although the hearing judge did not determine if Respondent intended to \u201ccome clean\u201d at the latter meeting with Wisniewski, or if he would have paid her from his own funds had he the cash on hand, Respondent\u2019s deceit is in the same church (if not exactly the same pew) as that of the attorney in <em>Pennington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In <em>Steinberg, </em>395 Md. 337, 910 A.2d 429, the respondent\u2019s misconduct was committed with respect to three different parties (two clients and an attorney colleague), yet elements of this case are reminiscent of Shapiro\u2019s case. Steinberg failed to file a petition for bankruptcy on behalf of a client and then failed to forestall a foreclosure sale that was the reason for seeking the protection of the bankruptcy court. When asked by the client for a status update, Steinberg responded dishonestly by saying that he had filed the petition (he filed later one without her consent or signature). In another client matter, Steinberg entered into an agreement that limited liability for his professional negligence where his client was not represented independently and did not have an opportunity to consider the document or obtain advice of counsel, in violation of MLRPC 1.8. These actions, in addition to other misconduct (including violations of MLRPC 1.1, 1.4, 1.5(c), 1.16, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 4.1), warranted disbarment. As in <em>Steinberg, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Shapiro failed to file a necessary document, in this case, a Certificate of Merit, and then misled his client as to whether he had done so. Further, Shapiro entered into a settlement agreement with Wisniewski, in violation of MLRPC 1.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">The attorney in <em>Davy, </em>435 Md. 674, 80 A.3d 322, was disbarred for violations of MLRPC 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.15, 1.16 and 8.4, where her misconduct involved dishonesty, multiple clients, unreasonable fees and the mishandling of client funds. In that matter, the respondent attempted to file a complaint in federal court, but it was rejected for being incomplete. The suit was ultimately dismissed. When the client learned through other channels that the complaint had been dismissed, she asked the respondent for return of her retainer. Without the client\u2019s permission, at a time months later when the attorney should have known that the representation was over, she filed a corrective motion in federal court and asked the client for more money. The respondent led her client to falsely believe that the case had been filed, although the attorney knew the complaint had been rejected, yet still asked for more retainer payments. She told another client that a summons had been issued by the court when in fact it was not. Even after her client learned of the truth of matters and confronted the attorney, Davy attempted to deflect blame by telling the client that she discovered a technical error with the filing. She lied further to the client about what corrective services for which she would charge. In another client matter, it took the respondent four months to file a petition for bankruptcy after being retained, and thereafter failed to correct deficiencies in that petition until the bankruptcy court issued a third deficiency notice. Finally, the respondent mishandled client funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">When considering the appropriate sanction, we noted that the respondent showed a dishonest or selfish motive involving the receiving and keeping of money, mislead her clients as to the quality of her representation and continued to act on the client\u2019s behalf after the representation had ended to justify continuing to demand payments from the client. Davy was disbarred. Unlike Davy, Shapiro was not charged with fiscal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>misconduct. Nonetheless, Respondent, like Davy, failed to file appropriate pleadings and did not take responsibility immediately for his failures, but instead misled Wisniewski into thinking that her claim was alive and, further, that a settlement had been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The misconduct in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Bleecker, </em>414 Md. 147, 994 A.2d 928 (2010), resembles the misconduct in Shapiro\u2019s matter. In <em>Bleecker, </em>the respondent did not file timely in court his client\u2019s claim and ultimately missed the statute of limitations deadline. Once he became aware of the \u201cblown\u201d statute of limitations deadline, a conflict of interest existed between himself and his client, such that he should have withdrawn from representation and told his client to seek independent counsel, which he did not. Moreover, he failed to inform his client that her case was dismissed and that the statute of limitations expired. Bleecker failed also to correct a material mistake on filed pleadings, and later, to respond to three letters from Bar Counsel seeking information regarding the client complaint. Violations of MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16, 3.3, 8.1 and 8.4 were found. We concluded that the \u201cgravamen of the misconduct\u201d was the respondent\u2019s concealment from his client of the statute of limitations bar, which precluded her from any possible recovery. Bleecker\u2019s failure to correct the misrepresentation to the court and his failure to respond to Bar Counsel were also significant to the Court in its sanction analysis. The appropriate sanction was disbarment. The \u201cgravamen\u201d of Shapiro\u2019s misconduct is also his concealment of the true status of Wisniewski\u2019s claim from her and his direct misrepresentations to that effect, and the improperly obtained settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The respondent in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Lane, </em>367 Md. 633, 647, 790 A.2d 621, 629 (2002) found himself caught in a snowballing series of lies, similar to that of the Respondent in this matter, although the cumulative lies of the attorney in <em>Lane </em>were of \u201cthe most egregious nature\u201d and the misconduct was committed against two clients. Lane took no action on a client\u2019s case and filed no pleadings of any kind, yet told his client that a subpoena had been issued for the opposing party. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>He met his client at the courthouse and told his client that the opposing party had failed to appear. Lane then took his leave by pretending to have a meeting with the judge, and returned to inform falsely his client that the judge would rule in his favor. He claimed later that the opposing party had filed a \u201cstay.\u201d With respect to another client, Lane did not communicate properly the terms of their fee arrangement, paid some of the client\u2019s bills from his own funds, and did not file the appropriate pleadings in order to secure an injunction against a utility threatening to turn off his client\u2019s water service. He then said that he filed a motion for sanctions against the water company for turning off his client\u2019s water, and paid his client a sum of money that he said came from the company as a result of the sanctions action, but, in reality, came from his own funds. Finally, he told the same client that he filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted, resulting in an award to her of over 11 million dollars. She was told to come to the courthouse with a suitcase and security to carry the cash home. When she arrived at the courthouse, he confessed that he had misled her completely regarding the status of her lawsuit and that no money was forthcoming. It was little surprise that Lane was disbarred. Like the attorney in <em>Lane, </em>Shapiro misrepresented to Wisniewski the status of her claim, and then concocted a fictional \u201csettlement\u201d of her claim against the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Brown, </em>426 Md. 298, 44 A.3d 344 (2012), the respondent committed various acts of misconduct with respect to four clients. He failed to pursue a client\u2019s claims in a timely manner, which caused the statute of limitations to expire before the case was dismissed for a failure to prosecute. The attorney failed also to answer discovery requests and incurred sanctions in another client matter. Brown did not inform his clients about the dismissal or the sanctions and ignored repeated requests for information from another client. Further, Brown did not return documents in his case file to a client in a timely manner, and also did not respond to two letters from Bar Counsel requesting information regarding the client\u2019s complaint. Such conduct violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>MLRPC 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16, 3.2 and 8.1(b). We held also that the manner in which Brown misled his client violated MLRPC 8.4(c), as he told one of his clients that the case was pending in arbitration, when, in actuality, it was dismissed two years previously. Given the \u201cgravity and pervasiveness\u201d of Brown\u2019s misconduct, we concluded that disbarment was the appropriate sanction. <em>Id. </em>at 328, 44 A.3d at 362; <em>see also Attorney Grievance v. Kremer, </em>432 Md. 325, 335-36, 340-41, 68 A.3d 862, 866-69, 871 (2013) (disbarring an attorney who committed misconduct with respect to four clients, failed to cooperate with Bar Counsel, failed to file bankruptcy petitions for multiple clients, missed hearings, caused a case to be dismissed, failed to respond to clients, abandoned cases before completion, and failed to return documents and unearned fees); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Park, </em>427 Md. 180, 196, 46 A.3d 1153, 1162 (2012) (\u201c[DJisbarment is the appropriate sanction when an attorney abandons a client by failing to pursue the client\u2019s interests, failing to communicate with the client, ignoring a client\u2019s repeated requests for status updates, terminating the representation without notice by failing wholly to provide effective services, and failing to return unearned fees. Respondent did all of this and failed to cooperate with Bar Counsel\u2019s lawful demands for information, in violation of MLRPC 8.1.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">When an attorney\u2019s misrepresentations are paired with violations of the MLRPC provisions regarding unreasonable fees or client or third party property (and especially money), the appropriate sanction is most often disbarment. In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Lawson, </em>428 Md. 102, 117, 50 A.3d 1196, 1205 (2012), an attorney was disbarred for violations of MLRPC 1.5, 1.8, 1.15 and 8.4(c) and (d). Lawson was dishonest with a client about whether an attorney grievance matter was pending against him. The attorney also charged his client an unreasonable fee and mishandled a subsequent fee dispute by inducing the client to enter into a settlement agreement that gave the attorney a lien on the client\u2019s settlement proceeds of a marital property dispute. The terms of the settlement agreement were not communicated in a way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>that the client could understand, and the client did not give informed consent, written or otherwise, as to the essential terms of the transaction. Because Lawson created and then mismanaged client fee disputes, and was motivated by a desire to obtain fees to which he was not entitled from an elderly man in poor health with limited means, we disbarred him. The Respondent in the present case executed an agreement with Wisniewski that violated the MLRPC in the same critical way as the agreement in <em>Lawson: </em>Respondent did not give Wisniewski a written disclosure of the desirability of seeking independent counsel prior to entering into the agreement with Respondent. By the same token, there is no MLRPC 1.15 violation in Shapiro\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Although Shapiro\u2019s violations do not involve multiple clients and cases, his misconduct spans a multiple-year period. He actively misrepresented the status of the case to Wisniewski for five years and failed to inform her of the difficulties he had in finding a doctor to execute a Certificate of Merit. Not only did Respondent lie to Wisniewski about the status of her case, his lies spiraled: he told her that the case had settled when no such settlement had occurred, but ultimately he did not have the money available to fund the \u201csettlement.\u201d Respondent only told Wisniewski the truth about her case\u2014-that it had been dismissed, that the statute of limitations had passed, and that no settlement occurred\u2014after she filed a complaint with the Attorney Grievance Commission. Respondent violated additional MLRPC by settling a potential legal malpractice claim with Wisniewski without advising her in writing of the desirability of seeking the advice of independent counsel or obtaining her informed consent, confirmed in writing, to the essential terms of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Accordingly, I would order Respondent\u2019s disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Judge Watts authorizes me to state that she joins the views expressed in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
