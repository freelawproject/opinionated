Defendant was sentenced to a split sentence of incarceration and probation and was subsequently adjudicated a level three sex offender <em>(see People v Wheeler, </em>59 AD3d 1007 [2009], <em>lv denied </em>12 NY3d 711 [2009]). Pursuant to condition No. 5 of his probation, defendant is required to obtain \u201csuitable employment\u201d or \u201cpursue a course of study or vocational training.\u201d Pursuant to condition No. 16 of his probation, which was imposed based on his status as a sex offender, defendant is not permitted to \u201cown, possess or have under [his] control items deemed by the probation officer or treatment provider to be pornographic or sexually stimulating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">During defendant\u2019s period of probation, defendant\u2019s probation officer and other members of the probation department conducted a search of defendant\u2019s home. During the search, the probation officers discovered a laptop computer with 113 images of prepubescent girls in various explicit poses and stages of undress stored therein (images). Defendant\u2019s probation officer filed an information for delinquency alleging that defendant violated condition No. 16 of his probation based on defendant\u2019s possession of the images on his computer. The officer also alleged that defendant violated condition No. 5 of his probation based on his failure to be suitably employed or enrolled in school. Following a hearing, Supreme Court determined that defendant violated his probation, revoked his probation and sentenced him to a determinate term of incarceration. Defendant appeals. All of the contentions addressed herein are contained in defendant\u2019s main brief unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">\u201cA violation of probation proceeding is summary in nature and a sentence of probation may be revoked if the defendant has been afforded an opportunity to be heard\u201d <em>(People v Perna, </em>74 AD3d 1807, 1807 [2010], <em>lv denied </em>17 NY3d 716 [2011] [internal quotation marks omitted]; <em>see People v DeMarco, </em>60 AD3d 1107, 1108 [2009]). The People are required to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant violated the terms and conditions of his probation <em>(see </em>CPL 410.70 [3]; <em>People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number><em>v Pringle, </em>72 AD3d 1629, 1629 [2010], <em>lv denied </em>15 NY3d 855 [2010]; <em>People v Bergman, </em>56 AD3d 1225, 1225 [2008], <em>lv denied </em>12 NY3d 756 [2009]), and \u201cthe decision to revoke his probation will not be disturbed, [absent a] \u2018clear abuse of discretion\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Barber, </em>280 AD2d 691, 694 [2001], <em>lv denied </em>96 NY2d 825 [2001]; <em>see Bergman, </em>56 AD3d at 1225).</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-3\">Defendant contends in his main and pro se supplemental briefs that the People failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he violated condition No. 5 <em>(see People v Garner, 56 </em>AD3d 951, 952 [2008], <em>lv denied </em>12 NY3d 783 [2009]; <em>People v Green, 255 </em>AD2d 923, 923 [1998], <em>lv denied </em>93 NY2d 853 [1999]; <em>see generally Bergman, </em>56 AD3d at 1225). That contention lacks merit. We defer to the court\u2019s determination crediting the testimony of defendant\u2019s probation officer, who testified that defendant failed to obtain \u201csuitable employment\u201d or \u201cpursue a course of study or vocational training\u201d despite his ability to do so <em>(see Perna, </em>74 AD3d at 1807; <em>DeMarco, </em>60 AD3d at 1108).</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Defendant further contends in his main and pro se supplemental briefs that the court erred in refusing to suppress the evidence recovered by the probation officers when they searched his home and computer. We reject that contention. While on probation, a defendant still retains the constitutional right to be free from \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d <em>(People v Huntley, </em>43 NY2d 175, 181 [1977]; <em>see People v Hale, </em>93 NY2d 454, 459 [1999]). Nevertheless, pursuant to a condition of his probation, defendant consented to warrantless searches by probation officers of, inter alia, his home in order for those officers to monitor his compliance with the conditions of his probation, and defendant further consented to \u201cseizures of any items found to be in violation\u201d of those conditions <em>(see Hale, </em>93 NY2d at 460). Condition No. 16 of his probation, which as noted prohibits defendant from owning, possessing or having under his control \u201cpornographic\u201d or \u201csexually stimulating\u201d items, was \u201cindividually tailored\u201d to defendant\u2019s underlying sex offense and \u201creasonably related\u201d to his rehabilitation and supervision <em>(id. </em>at 462; <em>see People v Wahl, </em>302 AD2d 976, 976 [2003], <em>lv denied </em>99 NY2d 659 [2003]; <em>People v Schunk, </em>269 AD2d 857, 857 [2000]). \u201cAs such, [those conditions] provided an appropriate basis for the search and seizure of [defendant\u2019s home and computer]\u201d <em>(Hale, </em>93 NY2d at 462). Further, the record establishes that defendant violated the terms of his probation on two prior occasions by failing to participate in a sex offender treatment program, and we thus conclude that the decision of defendant\u2019s probation officer to search his home and computer was \u201c \u2018ratio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>nally and reasonably related to the performance of the [probation] officer\u2019s duty\u2019 \u201d to monitor the terms of defendant\u2019s probation <em>(People v Johnson, </em>49 AD3d 1244, 1245 [2008], <em>lv denied </em>10 NY3d 865 [2008], quoting <em>Huntley, </em>43 NY2d at 181; <em>see Hale, </em>93 NY2d at 462).</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\">Defendant also contends that the term \u201csexually stimulating\u201d as used in condition No. 16 is unconstitutionally vague and unenforceable. Preliminarily, we note that defendant does not challenge the term \u201cpornographic\u201d as used in that condition as being unconstitutionally vague and unenforceable. Consequently, even assuming, arguendo, that the term \u201csexually stimulating\u201d is unconstitutionally vague, we conclude that reversal is not required because, as discussed <em>infra, </em>the court properly determined that the images were pornographic in nature and thus condition No. 16 is enforceable <em>(see People v Tucker, </em>302 AD2d 752, 753 [2003]). In any event, we conclude that the term \u201csexually stimulating\u201d as used in condition No. 16 \u201cis sufficiently explicit to inform a reasonable person of the conduct to be avoided\u201d and therefore is not unconstitutionally vague <em>(id.; see People v York, </em>2 AD3d 1158, 1160 [2003]; <em>People v Howland, </em>108 AD2d 1019, 1020 [1985]; <em>see generally People v Stuart, </em>100 NY2d 412, 420-421 [2003]). Given the nature of defendant\u2019s underlying sex offense and his status as a level three sex offender, we conclude that defendant could not have reasonably believed that his possession of the images, which depict prepubescent females in various states of undress and sexually suggestive poses, was permitted by condition No. 16 <em>(see People v Bologna, </em>67 AD2d 1004, 1004 [1979]; <em>see also Farrell v </em>Burke, 449 F3d 470, 491 [2006]; <em>see generally Stuart, </em>100 NY2d at 420-421).</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">Defendant next contends that the images are not \u201cpornographic\u201d or \u201csexually stimulating\u201d and that the People thus failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he violated condition No. 16 <em>(see </em>CPL 410.70 [3]; <em>Pringle, </em>72 AD3d at 1629; <em>Bergman, </em>56 AD3d at 1225). We reject that contention, although we note in any event that sufficient evidence of the violation of condition No. 5 alone provided a proper basis for the court to conclude that defendant violated his probation. Here, because the images depicted children, we must consider the definition of \u201cchild pornography\u201d in resolving the issue whether the images are \u201cpornographic.\u201d In determining whether the images were \u201cpornographic,\u201d the court considered the federal definition of the term \u201cchild pornography,\u201d and we agree that federal law provides guidance under these circumstances <em>(see generally People v Horner, </em>300 AD2d 841, 842-843 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>[2002]). Federal law provides that \u201cthe lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a minor constitutes child pornography\u201d <em>(United States v Hill, </em>459 F3d 966, 969 n 2 [2006], <em>cert denied </em>549 US 1299 [2007]; see 18 USC \u00a7 2256 [2] [B] [iii]; [8]). The question whether a visual depiction of a minor constitutes a \u201clascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area\u201d is determined by consideration of the following factors: \u201c1) whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child\u2019s genitalia or pubic area; 2) whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity; 3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child; 4) whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude; 5) whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity; [and] 6) whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer\u201d <em>(United States v Dost, </em>636 F Supp 828, 832 [1986], <em>affd </em>812 F2d 1239 [1987], 813 F2d 1231 [1987], <em>cert denied </em>484 US 856 [1987]; <em>see Horner, </em>300 AD2d at 842-843). Notably, \u201call of the aforementioned factors need not be present\u201d in order to determine that materials constitute child pornography where, as here, there is no statutory provision to the contrary, and nothing in <em>Dost </em>requires that \u201cthe genitalia be uncovered\u201d <em>(Horner, </em>300 AD2d at 843). \u201cHence, one must consider the combined effect of the setting, attire, pose and emphasis on the genitals and whether it is designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer, \u2018albeit perhaps not the \u201caverage viewer,\u201d but perhaps in the pedophile viewer\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>quoting <em>Dost, </em>636 F Supp at 832).</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-3\">Based on the foregoing, we agree with the court that the images are \u201cpornographic\u201d inasmuch as the focal point of many of the images is on the child\u2019s genitalia or pubic area. Further, although no child\u2019s genitalia is actually uncovered in the images, many of the children are in unnatural poses and are dressed in age-inappropriate attire; most of the children are only partially clothed; many of the images suggest sexual coyness or willingness on the part of the child to engage in sexual activity; and, most importantly, the \u201ccombined effect\u201d of the foregoing factors appears to have been \u201cdesigned to elicit a sexual response\u201d in defendant, who was convicted of sexually abusing a five-year-old girl <em>(id.). </em>We further agree with the court in any event that the images were \u201csexually stimulating\u201d based on the common meaning of that term <em>(see </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2082, 2244 [2002] [defining \u201csexually\u201d as \u201cin a sexual manner\u201d or \u201cwith regard to or by means of sex\u201d and defining \u201cstimulate\u201d as \u201cto excite to activity or growth or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>greater activity or exertion\u201d or \u201cstir up,\u201d as in to \u201canimate,\u201d \u201cliven\u201d or \u201carouse\u201d]), particularly given the age, dress, and poses of the children depicted in the images and considering the nature of defendant\u2019s underlying conviction and his status as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-4\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s further contention in his main and pro se supplemental briefs, the People were not required pursuant to condition No. 16 to prove that he \u201cknowingly possessed\u201d the images and instead were required to prove only that he \u201cown[ed], possess[ed] or [had them] under [his] control.\u201d The testimony at the hearing establishes that the probation officers discovered the computer during their search of defendant\u2019s home and that defendant admitted to the probation officers at the time of the search that the computer belonged to him. We therefore conclude that the court properly determined that the People met their burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant owned, possessed, or controlled the images in violation of condition No. 16 <em>(see Pringle, </em>72 AD3d at 1629; <em>Tucker, </em>302 AD2d at 753; <em>see generally Bergman, </em>56 AD3d at 1225). We further conclude that the sentence is not unduly harsh or severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">Finally, we have reviewed the remaining contentions in defendant\u2019s pro se supplemental brief and conclude that none requires modification or reversal of the judgment.
