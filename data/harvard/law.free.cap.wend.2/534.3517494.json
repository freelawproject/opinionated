The action is slander. In the commencement of the declaration it is averred that the defendant had become possessed of a promissory note, hearing \u00bf[ate the 27th August, 1825, made by William Erwin and James Erwin, payable to William McMurray or order, for payable four months after date, <em>v&gt;ith interest from </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>\u00abIate, </em>(the latter words being interlined,) which had been endorsed to the plaintiff, and who had collected the amount. In the <em>second </em>count of the declaration it is alleged that in a \u25a0certain discourse which the defendant had with Elias R. Par-melee and divers other citizens of and concerning the plaintiff, and of and concerning the note and the interlineation therein made, the defendant, after shewing the note, spoke and published these words : \u201c The note is in Edward A. Cook\u2019s hand writing, and the words at the end of the note, <em>\u2018 </em>with interest from date,\u2019 are,in a different hand writing; the note has only passed through the hands of Cook, McMurray and Gorham, and these words must have been put there by one of them. The signers of the note say the words were put there since they signed, and I have shewn the note to a number of persons, Reid and others;\u201d and then addressing Elias R. Parmelee, proceeded : \u201c Do not you think it is Gorham\u2019s hand writing <em>1\u201d </em>and that Parmelee having asked the plaintiff to explain himself, and what he meant, the defendant replied, \u201c time will show.\u201d In the <em>third </em>count of the declaration it is alleged, that in a certain other discourse the defendant, after taking from his pocket the note set forth in the commencement of the declaration, and shewing the same to sundry citizens, spoke these words: \u201c This note has been altered after it was signed;\u201d and on being asked by one of the by-standers if he knew by whom it had been done, he replied that \u201c I do not, but I have shewn it to some persons, and they said that the addition at the end of the note was in Shubael Gorham\u2019s hand writing,\u201d and added, \u201c that one of the signers would swear that the note that he signed was not written payable with interest, for he refused to sign such an one;\u201d and on being asked by one of the persons present, \u201c if Gorham would commit forgery,\u201d the defendant, holding out the note, replied, \u201c You can see for yourselves.\u201d To these counts the defendant <em>demurred.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-6\"><em>H.

The words used by the defendant necessarily imply, when taken in connection with the colloquium, that the words <em>with interest from date </em>had been forged and added to the note after its signature; and the inquiry by the defendant in the 2d count of Parmelee, \u201c If he did not think the addition was in Gorham\u2019s hand writing,\u201d and his declaration in the 3d count that he had shewed it to some persons who\"said \u201c-the addition was in Shubael Gorham\u2019s hand writing,\u201d leave no reasonable doubt that it was the intention of the defendant to impress upon the minds of the persons whom be addressed, the belief that the forgery had been committed by Gorham. The charge need not be couched in direct and positive terms. The imputation of crime may be as effectually made by way of interrogation as by an affirmative allegation. The only inquiry is whether, according to the natural and fair construction of the language used by the defendant, (taken in connection with the preliminary circumstances stated by way of colloquium,) the persons in whose pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>ence and hearing the language was used had a right to believe that it was the intention of the defendant to charge the plaintiff with the commission of a criminal offence. Such was obviously the intention of the defendant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">Judgment for plaintiff on demurrer, with leave to defendant to plead on payment of costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
