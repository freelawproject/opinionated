Had a sale been had under the first execution, it would have been subject to the partnership debts ; and the property having been exhausted in the payment of such a debt, the plaintiff in this case lost nothing by the omission of the sheriff to sell under the first execution. The sheriff was therefore authorized to make the return of <em>nulla </em>bona. (16 <em>Johns. R. </em>102. 1 <em>Wendell, </em>48 and 92.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b551-7\"><em>S.

(1 <em>East, </em>367. <em>Salk. </em>392. 15 <em>Johns. R. </em>180. 2 <em>Johns. Ch. R. </em>548.) Had the sheriff done so in this case, the partner of Goulding might have become the purchaser, rather than to have admitted a stranger as a tenant in common or partner with him. The sheriff ought to have sold, and by the sale ascertained whether the interest of Goulding, subject to the partnership debts, would not have produced enough to satisfy the execution. A creditor of the firm is entitled to no preference over the creditor of the individual members; and the court will not stay proceedings on an execution against one of the members of a firm, on the application of a creditor of the firm.

R. </em>320. 3 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul. </em>288, 9.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b552-6\"><em>By the Court, </em>Savage, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ0\">This demurrer raises the precise question which was decided at the last October term of this court, in the case of <em>Crane </em>v. <em>French </em>&amp; <em>Wilkins, </em>(1 <em>Wendell, </em>311.) The sheriff could only sell the interest of Goulding in the partnership property; but neither the sheriff nor the purchaser would have any right to the possession of the property; the other partner, Smith, would have a right to retain possession till the partnership debts were paid, and Goulding\u2019s interest, which was subject to be sold, was merely the surplus, after liquidating the partnership debts. But before any sale was had on the plaintiff\u2019s execution, another execution came against this property, which was liable, in the first instance, to the partnership debts. On this execution, the whole partnership property levied on was sold. There remained, nothing, therefore, in the sheriff\u2019s bailiwick from which he could make the plaintiff\u2019s money. This is precisely what the sheriff has said by his return. The return is therefore true.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">All the plaintiff could ask would be to have had the interest of Goulding first sold under his execution. Had he done so, the purchaser would have purchased nothing but a right to the <em>surplus; </em>the sheriff could not deliver possession of any thing. But the second execution coming, the sheriff must have sold the same property on that execution, and having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>exhausted the whole of it, the first purchaser would have had nothing from his purchase, except, perhaps, a suit in chaneery. The plaintiff\u2019s situation would have been no better than it is now.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">We think the course pursued by the sheriff the proper one, first, to sell the property for satisfaction of the debt which is entitled to preference, and if any part had remained, then he should have sold Goulding\u2019s interest therein; but, as the whole was exhausted,.he was justified in making the return which he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In my opinion, the defendant is entitled to judgment on the demurrer to the third count of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
