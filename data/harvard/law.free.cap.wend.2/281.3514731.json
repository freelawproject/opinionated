A suit was commenced on this bond by Spencer Kellogg, in the name of <em>the people, </em>and in his declaration, he assigned for breaches, that three judgments had been obtained by him against one Allen, be- , . . . . lore a justice of the peace, on which executions had issued, which had been delivered to Holmes, as a constable, to execute, and that Holmes had become liable for the same.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AY6\"><em>B.

(1 <em>Johns. R. </em>311. 1 <em>Cowen, </em>189. 1 <em>Tidd, </em>470.) It was also insisted that the statute, (2 <em>R.

Any person to whom the constable has become responsible on <em>account </em>of <em>an </em>execution delivered to him for collection, is entitled to commence a suit on the bond or instrument in writing, (in the language of the statute,) executed by him to ensure the faithful discharge of his duties, and previous leave to prosecute is not necessary to be obtained.
