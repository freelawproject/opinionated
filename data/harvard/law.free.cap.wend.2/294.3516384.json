The <em>defendant </em>pleaded the <em>general issue </em>alone, and now applied for leave to add a plea of the statute of limitations, on an excuse offored by the attorney .in the cause that he had been advised by counsel to put in such plea, without regard to the , \u201e , . <em>. </em>. 1 , , . plea o\u00ed the statute of limitations.

The plea here would operate only as a bar to all beyond six years ; and, as the defendant could recover back from his grantor only for that time, it was equitable and just that he should be permitted to add the plea of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-19\"><em>D.

We do not think so. The rule is uniform, that if a party neglects to plead the statute of limitations, he loses his plea. The statute of limitations is a strict defence, and if the party lets it slip, the court will not relieve him. The motion is denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
