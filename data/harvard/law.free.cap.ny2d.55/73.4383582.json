III. Absent a demonstration of racial prejudice or racism, no claim of implied bias can be made.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b116-8\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b116-9\">Chief Judge Cooke.</author>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">After a jury trial, defendant Herbert X. Blyden was convicted of assault in the first degree (Penal Law, \u00a7 120.10). The Appellate Division affirmed the conviction. On appeal to this court, defendant, who is black, argues that the trial court committed reversible error when it refused to discharge for cause a prospective juror who voiced hostility to racial minorities. Because the juror <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>never expressly and unequivocally stated that his feeling toward minorities would not affect his verdict and that he could render an impartial verdict based on the evidence, this court reverses defendant\u2019s conviction and remits for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Defendant\u2019s trial began on December 4,1979. During an early phase of the jury selection process, a prospective juror responded to a general question by the Judge regarding racial prejudice by indicating that he wished to speak to the Judge. At proceedings in chambers, the juror was questioned by the Judge and attorneys about his feelings toward minorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">When asked by the Judge to \u201cstate your feelings\u201d, the juror responded, \u201cI\u2019m against minorities. Now, not colored, not Indian, but what the government considers minorities. I work on construction, and when that comes up, I get up tight, that is all.\u201d He stated that the cause of his feelings was that \u201cthe government says you got to have a certain amount of people, minorities, on a job that is federally funded. And I think I pay taxes the same as anybody else, and that is why I get up tight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Upon the Judge\u2019s first inquiry as to whether the juror\u2019s feelings would affect his deliberations, the juror replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if it would or not, and I wouldn\u2019t want to jeopardize this guy\u2019s case, because of that. That is why I came forward.\u201d The juror repeated these misgivings under questioning by the prosecutor. He then told defense counsel that \u201cI have been known to flip my wig when minorities come into [a conversation]. This summer I wasn\u2019t allowed to go on a job because the next person that went on was a minority. It turned out to be an Indian, they had to put a minority on the next \u2014 the next construction.\u201d He added, \u201cI bet a lot of minorities made a lot more money than I did this year. That is what I mean, why I got up tight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Finally, in response to the court\u2019s thrice-repeated question whether he could put aside his feelings about minorities, the juror stated, \u201cYes, I think I could,\u201d \u201cI think I could,\u201d and, \u201cYes, I think I could.\u201d He also stated \u201cabsolutely not\u201d when asked by the Judge if he had made up his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>mind \u201cabout this case on the sketchy information that I gave you\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Defense counsel challenged the prospective juror for cause, but the Trial Judge denied the challenge. Defendant\u2019s attorney then used a peremptory challenge to remove the juror. Because defendant \u00e9xhausted his peremptory challenges before the completion of jury selection, the claimed error in denying his challenge for cause may be considered on this appeal (see CPL 270.20, subd 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In determining whether the trial court erred in refusing to discharge the challenged juror for cause, it is necessary to look first to CPL 270.20 (subd 1, par [b]), which authorizes a challenge for cause where the juror \u201chas a state of mind that is likely to preclude him from rendering an impartial verdict based upon the evidence adduced at the trial\u201d.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This provision reflects the long-standing recognition of \u201cthe fundamental rule that an accused person is entitled to be tried by a fair and impartial jury\u201d <em>(People v McQuade, </em>110 NY 284, 300; <em>see People v Branch, </em>46 NY2d 645, 652; <em>Reynolds v United States, </em>98 US 145, 155). Questioning of prospective jurors on voir <em>dire, </em>of course, is crucial to the selection of- an impartial jury (see <em>Ham v South Carolina, </em>409 US 524; <em>Aldridge v United States, </em>283 US 308).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In light of the prospective juror\u2019s initial comments, the Trial Judge in this case appropriately permitted further <em>voir dire </em>and took part himself in the exploration of the subject. The question to be resolved is whether the juror\u2019s answers to these subsequent questions overcame the clear indication of bias in the juror\u2019s previous statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">At common law, a prospective juror\u2019s expression of an opinion or impression bearing on the guilt or innocence of a defendant was conclusive grounds for disqualification (see <em>People v McQuade, supra). </em>In 1872, however, the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>ture enacted the predecessor of the current Criminal Procedure Law provision (L 1872, ch 475, \u00a7 1). Codified as subdivision 2 of section 376 of the old Code of Criminal Procedure, the statute provided that a previous expression of opinion or impression indicating \u201cactual bias\u201d could be overcome if the prospective juror \u201cdeclare on oath, that he believes that such opinion or impression will not influence his verdict, and that he can render an impartial verdict according to the evidence, and the court is satisfied, that he does not entertain such a present opinion or impression as would influence his verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">When the Criminal Procedure Law superseded the old code in 1971, all references to the \u201cexpurgatory oath\u201d were deleted (see CPL 270.20). The District Attorney asserts that the oath maintains its vitality, while defendant contends both that it is no longer applicable and that even if it was applicable, it was not satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In <em>People v Culhane </em>(33 NY2d 90, 104, n 2) this court, although dealing with a case falling under the old Code of Criminal Procedure, noted that under the Criminal Procedure Law \u201cthe talismanic expurgatory oath has been abandoned, so that there is no longer any facile method for purging a prima facie showing of bias\u201d and that \u201cthe new law gives the Trial Judge greater flexibility and a greater responsibility in determining which veniremen should be excused for cause.\u201d This flexibility is also reflected in the language of the new provision (CPL 270.20, subd 1, par [b]), which focuses on whether the juror \u201chas a state of mind that is likely to preclude him from rendering an impartial verdict\u201d without reference to any mechanical procedure for purging the taint of a prior expression of opinion about the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Thus, to the extent that the old code\u2019s expurgatory oath may have been used as a mere <em>pro forma </em>recitation, it is no longer available.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">This is not to say that the rationale underlying the expurgatory oath has no continuing validity (see <em>People v Branch, </em>46 NY2d 645, 651, <em>supra). </em>To the contrary, it is an effective means of resolving doubt about a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality. When a question is raised regarding a prospective juror\u2019s ability to render an impartial verdict, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>is still necessary that the prospective juror in unequivocal terms \u201cmust expressly state that his prior state of mind concerning either the case or either of the parties will not influence his verdict, and he must also state that he will render an impartial verdict based solely on the evidence\u201d <em>(People v Biondo, </em>41 NY2d 483, 485). Furthermore, in considering whether such statements are unequivocal, the juror\u2019s testimony should be taken as a whole. \u201cIt is not enough to be able to point to detached language which, alone considered, would seem to meet\u201d the oath\u2019s requirements <em>(People v McQuade, </em>110 NY 284, 301, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In conclusion, it is essential that all elements of the required statements be voiced, and that they be voiced with conviction. The mere words themselves, however, have no talismanic power to convert a biased juror into an impartial one, although they do nonetheless provide a minimum level of protection. They must be taken in context. A hollow incantation, made without assurance or certitude, is not enough. Where there remains any doubt in the wake of such statements, when considered in the context of the juror\u2019s over-all responses, the prospective juror should be discharged for cause. The costs to society and the criminal justice system of discharging the juror are comparatively slight, while the costs in fairness to the defendant and the general perception of fairness of not discharging such a juror are great. As this court stated in <em>People v Branch </em>(46 NY2d 645, 651-652, <em>supra), </em>\u201cthe trial court should lean toward disqualifying a prospective juror of dubious impartiality, rather than testing the bounds of discretion by permitting such a juror to serve. It is precisely for this reason that so many veniremen are made available for jury service.\u201d Even if, through such caution, the court errs and removes an impartial juror, \u201cthe worst the court will have done * * * is to have replaced one impartial juror with another impartial juror\u201d <em>(People v Culhane, </em>33 NY2d 90, 108, n 3, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Turning to the facts of the instant case, it is clear that the prospective juror\u2019s initial statements indicated a hostility to racial minorities that cast serious doubt on his ability to render an impartial verdict. Throughout the further questioning, however, the juror never unequivo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>cally stated that his bias would not influence his verdict' or that he could render an impartial verdict based on the evidence presented. To the Judge\u2019s questions, the juror merely responded that he thought he could put aside his personal feelings and keep an open mind. These answers fall short of the required express and unequivocal declarations. In addition, although the juror\u2019s use of the word \u201cthink\u201d might not in every case render his or her statements inadequate (see <em>People v Martell, </em>138 NY 595), in the context of this juror\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>his responses can be considered nothing other than equivocal and uncertain. The fundamental importance of a defendant\u2019s right to trial by an impartial jury requires more than this.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">For these reasons, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Meyer concur; Judge Jones taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\"> Defendant also, argues that the prospective juror should have been discharged under CPL 270.20 (subd 1, par [c]) because his relationship to defendant was \u201cof such nature that it is likely to preclude him from rendering an impartial verdict\u201d. It is true that \u201c[i]n the case of any of the relationships covered by subdivision (c) an expurgatory oath is not available to purge the taint of bias implied by law from the existence of the relationship\u201d <em>(People v Provenzano, </em>50 NY2d 420, 424; see <em>People v Branch, </em>46 NY2d 645, 651). The expressions of animosity toward racial minorities by the juror in this case, however, do not constitute a \u201crelationship\u201d as envisioned by subdivision (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
