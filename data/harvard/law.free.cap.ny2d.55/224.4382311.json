The master arbitrator\u2019s decision to reverse the expedited arbitrator\u2019s award was based upon factual issues and therefore, beyond the scope of authority conferred upon the master arbitrator by the Insurance Law and the regulations promulgated thereunder. III. The \u201crational basis\u201d test should apply when a master arbitrator reviews a compulsory arbitration award of an expedited arbitrator which is claimed to be infected by errors of law. <em>(Matter of Shand [Aetna Ins.

The decision of the expedited arbitrator is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>founded upon a reasonable hypothesis sufficient to support the questioned interpretation even though there may be grounds for differences of opinion, and therefore, must be affirmed by the Court of Appeals. <em>(Chess v Colonial Penn Ins.

Co.) </em>(54 NY2d 207), regarding the scope of a master arbitrator\u2019s powers when reviewing an arbitrator\u2019s award made in compulsory arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">In Matter of Smith (Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co.), the first of these appeals, petitioner Smith sustained personal injuries when he exited from the passenger side of a vehicle while it was being driven by his then spouse at a speed of 3\u00d3 miles per hour. His claim for first-party benefits under a no-fault automobile policy was denied by respondent Firemen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Insurance Company on the basis of its determination that Smith had caused his own injuries (a permissible policy exclusion under Insurance Law, \u00a7 672, subd 2, par [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Petitioner sought expedited arbitration of his claim pursuant to section 675 of the Insurance Law and the related regulation (11 NYCRR 65.16). The arbitrator found that Smith had intentionally left the vehicle, but that there was no indication that he intended to harm himself when he did so (there was testimony that Smith had military training in jumping and had jumped from a car at least once before, apparently without injury to himself). The arbitrator relied on <em>McGroarty v Great Amer. Ins. Co. </em>(36 NY2d 358, 364), where it was said: \u201cit is not legally impossible to find accidental results flowing from intentional causes, i.e., that the resulting damage was unintended although the original act or acts leading to the damage were intentional\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The respondent insurance company appealed the adverse decision to a master arbitrator, pursuant to section 675 of the Insurance Law and the related regulation (11 NYCRR 65.17). The master arbitrator vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award, finding that there was no rational basis on which the arbitrator could find Smith\u2019s injury to have been caused unintentionally and that the arbitrator\u2019s finding was therefore erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Smith then commenced this proceeding to have the master arbitrator\u2019s award vacated and the arbitrator\u2019s award reinstated. Special Term granted this relief, holding that the master arbitrator had made a factual determination which was beyond his power of review. The Appellate Division reversed, concluding that the master arbitrator\u2019s determination was within the broad power of review granted him and that a rational basis existed for the master arbitrator\u2019s determination that the arbitrator\u2019s finding was erroneous as a matter of law. We agree that the master arbitrator did not exceed his power in this case. There should be an affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">In Matter of Mott (State Farm Ins. Co.), the second of the two appeals before us, petitioner Mott sustained personal injuries in a one-car accident. His claim for first-party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>benefits was denied by respondent insurance company on the basis of Mott\u2019s intoxication at the time of the accident (a permissible exclusion from coverage under Insurance Law, \u00a7 672; subtj 2, par [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">An expedited arbitration hearing was held at Mott\u2019s instance. The arbitrator awarded Mott first-party benefits finding that there was insufficient proof that Mott was intoxicated at the time of the accident. A blood test which showed Mott\u2019s blood alcohol level to have exceeded the point of legal intoxication was disregarded by the arbitrator as \u201cinsufficient to qualify as probative evidence under [section] 1192 of the [Vehicle and Traffic] Law\u201d. The arbitrator further found it relevant that Mott had not been convicted for driving while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The master arbitrator vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award, making the following findings: that the arbitrator should have considered the blood test results; that a conviction for driving while intoxicated is not a prerequisite to denial of first-party benefits; that other proof regarding the accident and surrounding circumstances was sufficient to prove Mott\u2019s intoxication; and, finally, that Mott was injured as a result of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Mott then brought this article 75 proceeding to have the master arbitrator\u2019s award vacated on the basis that he exceeded his powers of review and to have the arbitrator\u2019s award reinstated. Special Term granted the requested relief, without prejudice to the insurance company to again pursue the statutory master arbitration proceeding, finding that the master arbitrator had made findings of fact and conclusions of law beyond the authority granted him by the applicable Insurance Law and regulations. The Appellate Division reversed, holding that the master arbitrator did not exceed his authority inasmuch as a rational basis existed to support his finding that the arbitrator\u2019s award was incorrect as a matter of law. We conclude, however, that the master arbitrator\u2019s vacatur was based upon a review of procedural and factual matters outside his powers of review, and that the order of the Appellate Division should therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>In <em>Matter of Petrofsky (Allstate Ins. Co.) </em>(54 NY2d 207, <em>supra) </em>we explained the principle that judicial review of a master arbitrator\u2019s authority to vacate an award under section 675 of the Insurance Law (and related regulations) derives from CPLR 7511 (subd [b], par 1, cl [iii]) and involves the question of whether the master arbitrator has exceeded his power. We further set forth the bases upon which the master arbitrator is empowered to vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award as follows: (1) a CPLR 7511 ground for vacatur exists (held to include the question of whether the award is supported by evidence or other basis in reason, as compulsory arbitration is involved [citing <em>Mount St. Mary\u2019s Hosp. of Niagara Falls v Catherwood, </em>26 NY2d 493]); (2) the award exceeds the policy limitations; (3) the award is \u201cincorrect as a matter of law\u201d; (4) the award of attorneys\u2019 fees is improper; (5) the award is inconsistent or irreconcilable with an award rendered in Health Services Association arbitration <em>(Matter of Petrofsky [Allstate Ins. </em>Co.], 54 NY2d 207, 210-211, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The ground relied upon for the master arbitrator\u2019s vacatur of the awards involved in each of the present appeals is that the award was incorrect as a matter of law (11 NYCRR 65.17 [a] [4]). As noted in <em>Petrofsky, </em>this basis for vacatur by the master arbitrator does not include \u201cprocedural or factual errors committed in the arbitration below\u201d, by virtue of the express language of the regulation. Thus, the precise question presented by both appeals is whether the master arbitrator exceeded the proper scope of review by passing upon factual or procedural questions, or whether he properly limited his review to questioning the award\u2019s correctness as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In the Smith case, the master arbitrator determined that, as a matter of law, one who exits a car traveling at 30 miles per hour intends to cause his own injury, and that no rational basis existed to support the arbitrator\u2019s finding that the injury was unintentional. There is nothing to indicate that, in reaching this conclusion, the master arbitrator exceeded his statutory power by weighing the evidence or resolving issues such as the credibility of witnesses. Indeed, ,he explicitly concluded \u201cThe Arbitrator\u2019s finding * * * is erroneous as a matter of law, and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>therefore reversed\u201d, and nothing in his award suggests that this is not an accurate statement of the basis for his reversal. Thus, it is clear that the vacatur was based upon the master arbitrator\u2019s determination that the arbitrator had made an error of law. Such a determination is within the master arbitrator\u2019s powers of review. Having made that determination, the courts are limited in their further review of the master arbitrator\u2019s resolution of that error of law, since we generally will not vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award where the error claimed is the incorrect application of a rule of substantive law (see <em>Matter of Garcia v Federal Ins. Co., </em>46 NY2d 1040; <em>Matter of Furstenberg [Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.], </em>49 NY2d 757), unless it is so \u201cirrational as to require vacatur\u201d <em>(Cohn v Royal Globe Ins. Co., </em>49 NY2d 942, 944; <em>Matter of McKenna v County of Nassau Off. of County Attorney, </em>75 AD2d 815, affd 51 NY2d 902). There is nothing in this record to suggest that the master arbitrator\u2019s award is irrational, and, no other ground for vacatur having been urged on this appeal, the master arbitrator\u2019s award was properly reinstated, by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In the Mott case, however, a different situation is presented. Here, the arbitrator\u2019s award was vacated by the master arbitrator on the basis of conclusions which were quite clearly outside the master arbitrator\u2019s review powers. These conclusions related to the propriety of the arbitrator\u2019s refusal to consider the blood test results and to the weight of the evidence regarding Mott\u2019s intoxication at the time of the accident. The question of the admissibility of evidence involves a procedural issue, and the master arbitrator\u2019s differing view regarding this issue is an insufficient basis for vacating an arbitrator\u2019s award. Furthermore, the master arbitrator is without power to vacate an award based upon a <em>de novo </em>review of the evidence <em>(Matter of Petrofsky [Allstate Ins. Co.], </em>54 NY2d 207, 212, <em>supra). </em>His scope of review in this regard is limited to determining whether the award was incorrect as a matter of law, and this ground for vacatur was not the basis for the decision in this case. Thus, Special Term properly vacated the master arbitrator\u2019s award and reinstated the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Accordingly, in Matter of Smith (Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co.), the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>costs. In Matter of Mott (State Farm Ins. Co.), the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the matter remitted to Supreme Court, Delaware County, to be remanded to the master arbitrator for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion; this disposition being without prejudice to an application to Supreme Court, Delaware County, for counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Meyer concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In <em>Matter of Smith (Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co.): </em>Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">In <em>Matter of Mott (State Farm Ins. Co.): </em>Order reversed, with costs, and matter remitted to Supreme Court, Delaware County, with directions to remand to the master arbitrator.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
