In order to resolve this question, we must examine the scope of permissible redirect examination in instances where a defendant has \u201copened the door\u201d to new matters on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Early in the afternoon of January 10, 1978, Mario \u201cCuba\u201d Hernandez was shot in the chest while standing in the hallway of a public housing project located in The Bronx. Hernandez died a short while later. Although the incident was overheard by several tenants, there were no witnesses to the shooting, and no one could identify any of the perpetrators who fled from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">In the months that followed, the investigation focused on defendant Israel \u201cPaleta\u201d Melendez and codefendant Robert \u201cPiro\u201d Mendez. As a result of information provided by Jesus Marrero, who was also a suspect in the shooting, defendant Melendez and codefendant Mendez were arrested in early July, 1978 by the officer conducting the Hernandez investigation, Detective Benjamin Alexis. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>defendants were thereafter indicted for, <em>inter alia, </em>murder in the second degree (Penal Law, \u00a7 125.25, subd 3) and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree (Penal Law, \u00a7 265.03).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">At trial, the evidence most damaging to the defendants came from the testimony of Jesus Marrero and Hector Camacho. Marrero, who knew both defendants for a number of years, testified that on January 12,1978, while on a 24-hour pass from a methadone treatment program, he happened to meet codefendant Mendez on the street and asked him for the $25 previously lent to him for bail in connection with a prior arrest. According to Marrero\u2019s testimony, codefendant Mendez said that \u201cthe homicide squad was looking for him for something Paleta [defendant Melendez] had done\u201d; that he, Paleta and an unidentified third person named \u201cChino\u201d had \u201ctook off a guy in the project\u201d; that defendant Melendez had shot him; and that all three escaped in Chino\u2019s car. Marrero further testified that he was with defendant Melendez, codefendant Mendez and some other individuals the following day on a rooftop. At that time, Marrero testified that he overheard defendant Melendez say to codefendant Mendez that \u201cif he would have held him right, he wouldn\u2019t have had to shoot him\u201d and that codefendant Mendez replied that \u201cit was his fault for not searching him right.\u201d Marrero also testified that he heard the deceased\u2019s nickname, \u201cCuba\u201d, mentioned in the course of this conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Marrero\u2019s story was corroborated to a certain extent by the testimony of Hector Camacho. Camacho testified that on an unspecified date in January, 1978, he had finished \u201cgetting high\u201d on the rooftop of a building and was walking down the stairs when he heard codefendant Mendez ask defendant Melendez \u201cwhat he shot him for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The arresting officer, Detective Alexis, was also called as a witness for the prosecution. On cross-examination by counsel for defendant Melendez, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">\u201cQ. Det. Alexis, when Marrero was brought down to the precinct, he was a suspect, wasn\u2019t he?</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">\u201cA. Yes, he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>. \u201cQ. And you advised him of his rights, is that what you testified before, of his constitutional rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u201cQ. And you began asking him about the homicide that occurred in January, is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">\u201cQ. Did you advise him that he was a suspect, in those words?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">\u201cA. No, I did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">\u201cQ. You were asking him about the homicide, is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">\u201cQ. Now, Detective, you were involved in filling out an arrest report, I take it, is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">\u201cA. Yes, I was.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">\u201cQ. And at that time, isn\u2019t it a fact that you indicated that Mr. Melendez had committed a crime in concert with two others, is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b491-17\">\u201cQ. And when you arrested Mr. Mendez, you indicated on there that the crime had occurred \u2014 three people involved, is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-18\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-19\">On redirect, the prosecutor asked Detective Alexis for the basis upon which he considered Marrero a suspect. Counsel for defendant Melendez immediately objected to this question on the ground that the prosecutor intended to \u201cbring out hearsay testimony regarding the police officer\u2019s investigation.\u201d The Trial Judge overruled this objection, stating that counsel for defendant Melendez had \u201copened the door\u201d by raising the question whether Marrero was a suspect on cross-examination. Counsel excepted to the court\u2019s ruling. Detective Alexis then proceeded to tell the jury that a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d had informed him shortly after the Hernandez shooting that the two individuals responsible were named \u201cPaleta\u201d and \u201cPiro\u201d; and that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>informant identified \u201cPaleta\u201d as defendant Melendez and \u201cPiro\u201d as Jesus Marrero. The detective also testified that he had learned from others that Marrero was known as both \u201cPete\u201d and \u201cPiro\u201d, but that Marrero later told him that he was \u201cPete\u201d and codefendant Mendez was known as \u201cPiro\u201d, and that they were often mistaken for one another because they looked alike. Finally, Detective Alexis, over objection by counsel for defendant Melendez, was permitted to read from his notebook the detailed physical descriptions of <em>both </em>defendant Melendez <em>and </em>the individual named \u201cPiro\u201d provided by the \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d informant two days after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The jury found both defendants guilty of murder in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant Melendez was sentenced to concurrent terms of 25 years to life on the murder conviction and 5 to 15 years on the conviction for possession of a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">On appeal, a divided Appellate Division affirmed. A majority of the court could \u201cfind no error with any portion of [the] redirect testimony since defendant\u2019s counsel consciously initiated this line of questioning and thus opened the door.\u201d According to the court below, defense counsel was attempting to impugn the credibility of Marrero by asking Detective Alexis whether Marrero was considered a suspect. As a result, the Appellate Division was of the opinion that the prosecutor could \u201cclarify the grounds upon which the detective based his suspicions\u201d and \u201cshow that there was no collaboration between his office and [Marrero] for the purpose of convicting an innocent man.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>The dissenters at the Appellate Division were of the opinion that it was error to utilize the cross-examination of Detective Alexis under the \u201copening the door\u201d theory as a vehicle for the needless introduction of incriminating hearsay evidence to the effect that defendant Melendez had been identified by a neighborhood source as one of the participants in the Hernandez shooting two days after the incident occurred. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The extent of redirect examination is, for the most part, governed by the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>(People v Zigouras, </em>163 NY 250, 255-256; <em>People v Buchanan, </em>145 NY 1, 24; <em>People v Fay, </em>270 App Div 261, affd 296 NY 510, affd <em>sub nom. Fay v New York, </em>332 US 261; see 6 Wigmore, Evidence [Chadbourn rev ed], \u00a7 1896, p 737.) Where, however, the opposing party \u201copens the door\u201d on cross-examination to matters not touched upon during the direct examination, a party has the right on redirect \u201cto explain, clarify and fully elicit [the] question only partially examined\u201d on cross-examination. <em>(People v Regina, </em>19 NY2d 65, 78; see, also, <em>Feblot v New York Times Co., </em>32 NY2d 486, 497-498.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The \u201copening the door\u201d theory has been recognized in a variety of situations. For example, apparent inconsistencies or contradictions in a witness\u2019 statements or acts brought out on cross-examination to discredit his testimony may be reconciled on redirect by relating to the jury the relevant surrounding circumstances. <em>(People v Buchalter, </em>289 NY 181, 202-203; <em>Collins v Kelly, </em>226 NY 180, 183-184; 3A Wigmore, Evidence [Chadbourn rev ed], \u00a7 1044, p 1062.) Similarly, where cross-examination raises the inference that the witness\u2019 testimony was the product of a recent fabrication, a party on redirect can refute this allegation either by introducing consistent statements made by the witness at a time when there was no motive to lie or by having the witness explain why the information was not disclosed earlier. <em>(People v Davis, </em>44 NY2d 269, 277-278; <em>Crawford v Nilan, </em>289 NY 444, 450-451; <em>Ferris v Sterling, </em>214 NY 249, 254; <em>People v Buchanan, </em>145 NY 1, 24-25, <em>supra.) </em>In addition, in situations where only a part of a statement has been brought out on cross-examination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the other parts may be introduced on redirect examination for the purpose of explaining or clarifying the statement. <em>(People v Torre, </em>42 NY2d 1036, 1037; <em>People v Schlessel, </em>196 NY 476, 480-481; 7 Wigmore, Evidence [Chadbourn rev ed], \u00a7 2113; see, generally, Richardson, Evidence [10th ed], \u00a7 523; Fisch, New York Evidence [2d ed], \u00a7 344.)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The \u201copening the door\u201d theory must necessarily be approached on a case-by-case basis. As a result, this principle is not readily amenable to any prescribed set of rules. (See McCormick, Evidence [2d ed], \u00a7 57.) Nonetheless, it does have its limitations. By simply broaching a new issue on cross-examination, a party does not thereby run the risk that all evidence, no matter how remote or tangential to the subject matter opened up, will be brought out on redirect. Rather, the trial court must limit the inquiry on redirect to the \u201csubject-matter of the cross-examination [which] bear[s] upon the question at issue.\u201d <em>(People v Buchanan, </em>145 NY 1, 24, <em>supra.) </em>Moreover, the court should only allow so much additional evidence to be introduced on redirect as is necessary to \u201cmeet what has been brought out in the meantime upon the cross-examination.\u201d (6 Wigmore, Evidence [Chadbourn rev ed], \u00a7 1896, p 737; accord <em>People v Schlessel, </em>196 NY 476, 481, <em>supra; People v Lewis, </em>18 AD2d 277, 279-280.) The \u201copening the door\u201d theory does not provide an independent basis for introducing new evidence on redirect; nor does it afford a party the opportunity to place evidence before the jury that should have been brought out on direct examination. The principle merely allows a party to explain or clarify on redirect matters that have been put in issue for the first time on cross-examination, and the trial court should normally \u201cexclude <em>all evidence which has not been made necessary by the opponent\u2019s case in reply.\u201d </em>(6 Wigmore, \u00a7 1873, p 672 [emphasis in original].)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In this case, it was error to permit the prosecutor to elicit from Detective Alexis the hearsay testimony that a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d had informed him two days after the shooting that defendant Melendez was one of the participants in the crime. Defense counsel merely cross-examined the detective as to whether he considered Marrero a suspect. True, this line of questioning afforded the prosecutor an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>opportunity to amplify on redirect the basis for the detective\u2019s suspicions as to Marrero. This cross-examination did not, however, clear the way for the prosecutor to explore the entire ambit of the officer\u2019s investigation, including all information connecting the defendant with the homicide. In short, although defense counsel may have partially \u201copened the door\u201d by asking whether Marrero was a suspect, the passageway thus created was not so wide as to admit the hearsay testimony directly implicating the defendant in the crimes charged. The door was opened only as to whether the witness considered Marrero a suspect. Thus, it was error to broaden the scope of inquiry to include all the hearsay information the detective had learned frtim other people as part of his investigation of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, although legally sufficient, was far from overwhelming. The only proof linking the defendant to the shooting was provided by Marrero and Camacho, and the credibility of these witnesses was questionable. Both were confessed drug addicts and both admitted that they were using drugs when they overheard the conversations in question. Camacho had been arrested on at least four previous occasions. Marrero had ah extensive criminal record and, in fact, was a suspect in the Hernandez murder at the time he incriminated the two defendants. Under the circumstances, we cannot say that the erroneous admission of hearsay testimony to the effect that a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d identified the defendant two days after the homicide as the one who shot Hernandez was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Meyer concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\">. Codefendant Mendez\u2019 convictions were subsequently affirmed by the Appellate Division (74 AD2d 1006). The propriety of that affirmance is not before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\">. The Appellate Division also expressed the view that the hearsay testimony of Detective Alexis on redirect was admissible because it was only introduced to show how the detective formed his belief that Marrero was a suspect and not to establish defendant\u2019s guilt. (See Richardson, Evidence [10th ed], \u00a7 205, p 182.) Yet, that reasoning does not justify the admission of that part of Alexis\u2019 redirect testimony which related solely to defendant Melendez. The portion of the testimony inculpating defendant Melendez in no sense demonstrated how Detective Alexis arrived at the conclusion that <em>Marrero </em>was a suspect and could only have been considered by the jury as evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt. As such, this part of the redirect testimony clearly was inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
