He then swore that such help was not his duty, nor his custom, since (except in rare instances when called on by the station master) he had not given such help to defendant\u2019s servants in handling express matter. His own testimony must be accepted as true, and therefore must be decisive of his action. A mere volunteer, when he went to this express car, as plaintiff conceded that he was, could not afterwards face about and turn himself into an emergency helper by such outside testimony as plaintiff produced at the later trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As the complaint should have been dismissed below, this court, oh reversal, may render a final judgment of dismissal.
