Having been overruled, and an exception taken, and the ordinances received, he moved to strike out the ordinances, on the ground that they were incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">In his charge the learned court said, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-11\">\u201cAnd they complain that the defendant\u2019s driver turned that corner at a high rate of speed on the south or the lower corner of the street, when the plaintiff\u2019s claim is it is the regulation of the city, the ordinance of the city, that the horses and wagon should have gone to the upper side of Twenty-Seventh street and turned at the uptown corner. They say that he violated that ordinance; and the ordinance has been put in evidence in this case. The violation of the ordinance is not proof of negligence; it is not conclusive proof of negligence; it is only evidence which you may take into consideration with all the other evidence in the case when you are trying to arrive at the question as to whether or not the defendant\u2019s driver was guilty of negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">There were no requests or exceptions to the charge. There was presented by the evidence a fair question of fact, both as to the defendant\u2019s negligence and the plaintiff\u2019s freedom from contributory negligence, and we find no reason to interfere with the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">The only question which we deem it necessary to consider is that growing out of the receipt in evidence of the ordinances, which were not pleaded. The general rule is that when observance of an ordinance is a condition precedent to a right of actipn, or where an action is based upon an ordinance, it must be alleged, as well as proved. But the action at bar is not to enforce an ordinance or to recover a penalty for the violation thereof. It is an action in negligence for reckless and careless driving in the public streets. The allegation in the complaint is general, and thereunder any evidence tending to show such negligent and careless driving was admissible. The ordinances and tire breach thereof were offered and received, not as conclusive evidence of negligence, but as some evidence which the jury might take into consideration. Upon principle it would seem that, as mere evidence, it would have been improper to have pleaded the ordinances, as ultimate facts, and not evidence, should be set forth in a complaint. Upon authority we find the following :</p>\n<p id=\"b956-14\">In Jetter v. New York &amp; Harlem R. R. Co., *41 N. Y. 154, in an action for negligence, plaintiff put in evidence the ordinance of the city forbidding cars from turning a corner faster -than a walk or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>travel in the street faster than six miles an hour. Defendant excepted to so much of the charge as referred to the rate of speed of the car when turning the corner, and the defendant\u2019s liability consequent upon the turning of a corner at a greater speed than allowed by the ordinance. The Court of Appeals said, in referring to the charge in regard to the city ordinance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-5\">\u201cEvery person traversing the streets of the city of New York has a right to feel that its municipal laws are to some extent a protection to his person through the obedience they exact' and will receive from others. And although he has no right to place a blind reliance on such obedience and put himself in positions of danger, regardless of personal risk, yet, where no danger is manifest, and none can arise without a violation of an ordinance, it is not negligence to assume that nobody will bring it upon him by a breach of the ordinance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">In Beisegel v. N. Y. C. R. R. Co., 14 Abb. Prac. (N. S.) 29, an ordinance of the city of Rochester prohibiting the running of engines by any railroad company at the place where the injury was received at any greater speed than eight miles an hour, and imposing a penalty of $50 for each offense, was received in evidence. The trial judge in substance charged the jury that if they were satisfied from the evidence that the engine was so running at the time, and this excessive speed beyond what the ordinance permitted contributed to the injuries received by the plaintiff, it was some evidence of negligence of defendant. Judge Grover of the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-7\">\u201cThe exceptions taken by the defendants\u2019 counsel to this part of the charge, and to the competency of the ordinance as evidence, present the question whether this part of the charge was correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">After considering Brown v. Buffalo &amp; State Line Railroad Co., 22 N. Y. 191, and showing that it was substantially overruled in the Jetter Case, supra, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-9\">\u201cOrdinances passed by municipal corporations, pursuant to the powers of local legislation conferred upon them by the Legislature, have the same effect as laws in the localities where thus adopted, as if enacted by the Legislature, * * * \u201d and hold that the act, being forbidden hy ordinance, was unlawful. \u201cThe question then is whether the unlawfulness of the act by which another receives an injury is any evidence against the party committing the act. Thus stated, the question can only be answered in one way. That answer shows that the charge in this respect was not erroneous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">I have examined the record on appeal in the following cases in negligence; in none does the complaint, where the plaintiff offered the ordinance to show the negligence of the defendant, or the answer, where the defendant offered it to show plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence, contain any reference to the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">The ordinance was offered by plaintiff, and received without objection, in Massoth v. Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Co., 64 N. Y. 524, Rainey v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 68 Hun, 495, 23 N. Y. Supp. 80, and Cushing v. Metropolitan Street Railway Co., 92 App. Div. 510, 87 N. Y. Supp. 314. In each case on appeal the ordinance was held properly admissible as some evidence of negligence. In Reed v. Mayor, 31 Hun, 311, the ordinance was offered by defendant, objected to, and excluded by the trial court. Held error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>In McCambley v. Staten Island Midland R. R. Co., 32 App. Div. 346, 52 N. Y. Supp. 849, defendant offered an ordinance, which was received without objection. The court refused the charge asked by defendant, based on the violation of this ordinance. The Appellate Division in the Second Department reversed the judgment for the plaintiff saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-5\">\u201cThe charge of the court was erroneous in failing to give the defendant the full benefit of the ordinance. The effect of such a municipal ordinance is settled by the decision in Knupfle v. Knickerbocker Ice Co., 84 N. Y. 488. Itswiolation is not negligence per se as a matter of law, and conclusive evidence on the question; but it is competent evidence, and sufficient to justify the jury in finding, as a fact, that its violation was negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">In McCarragher v. Proal, 114 App. Div. 470, 100 N. Y. Supp. 208, the defendant offered an ordinance as to the right of way and speed, which was admitted over objection and exception. This court, Mr. Justice Laughlin writing, reversed a judgment for the plaintiff for error in the charge, which left to the jury the question of whether the ordinance was applicable, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-7\">\u201cIt is evident, therefore, that the <em>ordinance was applicable. </em>* * * The validity of this ordinance, and of similar ordinances and statutes, has been sustained by the courts, and it has\" been held that the rights of the traveler to whom the right of way is given are superior.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">In McGrath v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 63 N. Y. 522, the ordinance offered by the plaintiff was objected to and excluded under exception. Defendant had a verdict. Reversed, and new trial ordered, for error in excluding the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">In Briggs v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 72 N. Y. 27, complaint alleged that plaintiff\u2019s icehouse was destroyed by fire caused by negligence of the defendant. Plaintiff offered in evidence an ordinance of the city of Buffalo providing that no pipe of any stove should be put up unless it be conducted into a chimney made of brick or stone, with other provisions. Objected to as irrelevant and incompetent. Overruled, and exception. The court charged, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-10\">\u201cThat putting up the stovepipe in the switchhouse in a manner forbidden by the city ordinances was evidence of negligence by the defendant which the jury had a right to take into consideration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">Excepted to. In its brief in the Court of Appeals the defendant elaborately argued that the ordinance was improperly received in evidence. Held no error in allowing the jury to take the violation of the ordinance into consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">In Knupfle v. Knickerbocker Ice Co., 84 N. Y. 488, plaintiff offered an ordinance, which was objected to as incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial. Overruled, and exception taken. The defendant also excepted to the refusal of the court to charge that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-13\">\u201cUnder the facts of this case the section of the city ordinance read in evidence by plaintiff has nothing to do with the case and must be disregarded by the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">The General Term affirmed, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-15\">\u201cThere is no force in the exception to the admission of the ordinance. * * * Such evidence is always admissible on the question of negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>In its brief on appeal to the Court of Appeals defendant urged its-exception to the admission of the city ordinance. That court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-5\">\u201cWe think there is no question as to the admissibility of such testimony. * * * The result in the decisions, therefore, is that the violation of the ordinance is some evidence of negligence, but not necessarily negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">In Cumming v. Brooklyn City Railway Co., 104 N. Y. 669,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> tried before Mr. Justice Cullen, the ordinance was offered by the plaintiff, and received over objection and exception. The judgment for the plaintiff was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">In Donnelly v. City of Rochester, 166 N. Y. 315, 59 N. E. 989, plaintiff slipped and fell into an area way 6 feet wide and 12 feet deep in a public street, guarded by'a rail about 2% feet high. He sued the owner, who had constructed and maintained it, and the city, which had knowledge of the condition. The plaintiff offered an ordinance which required a railing at least 3% feet high. Objected to as immaterial,, irrelevant, and incompetent. The trial court dismissed the complaint. The Court of Appeals reversed; Cullen, J., saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-9\">\u201cThis action is not brought to impose liability upon the city for failing to enforce its ordinances, but for default in its own primary duty to maintain its streets reasonably safe and secure for travelers thereon. * * * The gist of this action is negligence, and the case was so treated in the trial court. * * * The presence of a deep excavation along the line of the sidewalk, unless sufficiently guarded, necessarily created danger. The defendants own ordinance prescribed <em>3y2 </em>feet as a proper height for such railings. Though a violation of the ordinance is not negligence per se, it is some evidence of negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">The precise question involved on this appeal arose in Biot v. Brooklyn Heights Railroad Co., 23 App. Div. 625, 48 N. Y. Supp. 1100. That was an action in negligence, and an ordinance was admitted over the objection that it was not pleaded. The judgment for the plaintiff was unanimously affirmed, without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">Buys v. Third Avenue Railroad Co., 45 App. Div. 11, 61 N. Y. Supp. 113, was an action in negligence. Plaintiff, a physician, was seated in an ambulance and was injured as the result of a collision with a car of the defendant. An ordinance providing fo.r right of way was offered, and was objected to as incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial, and not pleaded, and was admitted over exception. The point that the ordinance was not pleaded, and hence inadmissible, was-fully argued in the brief on appeal. In affirming a judgment for' the plaintiff, Mr. Justice Woodward said: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-13\">\u201cA careful examination of the matters called to the attention of this court by the defendants counsel leads to the conclusion that there was no reversible error on the part of the learned trial court. It had been held that a violation of a municipal ordinance was some evidence of negligence (citing cases), and it was proper on this trial to place before the jury the ordinance of the city of New York, giving to ambulances the right of way, as that was one of the restrictions under which the defendant company operated its cars. * * * The duty to give the right of way is not absolute; it must \u2018yield the right of way where possible\u2019 (section 370 of the Ordinances of the City of New York); and it was proper that the jury should have this ordinance in view when determining the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-15\">It thus appears that since 1865, in actions for negligence, upon pleadings containing no reference to the ordinance, our courts have received. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>municipal ordinances and proof of the violation thereof as some evidence of negligence, when offered by either plaintiffs or defendants, first, without objection; second, over general objection; third, over objection to their competency, relevancy, and materiality; and, fourth, over the objection that they were not pleaded. It is too late to question this long-established rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs to the respondent. Order filed. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b959-16\"> 10 N. E. 855.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
