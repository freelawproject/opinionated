Although the relator did not solicit contributions, and gave no intimation that failure to pay might affect the employ\u00e9\u2019s future position, the law is against payments, even unsought, if made and taken in a state or municipal office, especially if paid to an official superior. The influence of such position is not less effective if silently exerted. The limits by these statutes to contributions asked or payments made within the building or room of the city or state are presumably due to what were deemed the reasonable and constitutional freedom of citizens when in private life. The Legislature of New York, following various federal statutes, aimed to check a political abuse in taking party tribute from officers when within their office surroundings. In such official relations, the call and pressure to pay for political purposes are felt without express demand or any open threats. Our statutes, therefore, would keep such contributions purely voluntary, as from citizens in private life, which character they cannot have, if paid over at official desks in city bureaus.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">The determination of the president of the borough of Queens removing the relator, is therefore confirmed, and the writ dismissed, with $50 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
