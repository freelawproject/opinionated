From an order of Special Term, dismissing the writ and remanding relator, he appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1011-14\">The opinion below of Bijur, J., was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1011-15\">The relator, having been held by a magistrate to answer to the Court of Special Sessions, applies for a writ of habeas corpus. He was charged with practicing medicine unlawfully in violation of section 174 of the Public Health Law. Subdivision 7 of section 160 of that act defines the practice of medicine, and indicates in substance that it consists in holding one\u2019s self out as being able to diagnose or treat human diseases, and offering or undertaking such treatment. This factor of holding, out apparently underlies all the important cases in which the defendant has been held for violation of the law. There have been laid before me, without objection, by the respective counsel, extracts from the record in these cases. In People v. Woodbury Dermatological Institute, 192 N. Y. 454, 85 N. E. 697 the advertisements announced that \u201cthe Woodbury method succeeds, because it entirely removes these dead cells;\u201d \u201cwe perfect baggy skin;\u201d \u201cwe correct unshapely noses,\u201d etc.; \u201cwe remove freckles,\u201d etc.; \u201cby methods of our own, we extract these dead cells;\u2019\u2019 \u201call remedies prescribed by us are scientifically prepared in our private labora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>tories.\u201d In the case of People v. Doctor Weeks Medical Institute, 126 App. Div. 950, 111 N. Y. Supp. 1134, in which the judgment against the defendant below was affirmed on the authority of the Woodbury Case, 124 App. Divj 877, 109 N. Y. Supp. 578, the advertisements read: \u201cWe treat all private and chronic diseases\u201cwe cure by the best of medical ability\u201cDr. Weeks\u2019 Medical Office, specialist for nervous and chronic diseases;\u201d \u201cwe cure all cases we undertake.\u201d In People v. Samuel Gross, decided in the Court of Special Sessions in November, 1911, the defendant was the proprietor of an institution known as the Workingmen\u2019s Medical Aid Society. One of the circulars contained the statement: \u201cIt is the object of the Workingmen's Medical Aid Society to furnish reliable medical service to members and their families.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1012-5\">These various institutions therefore plainly held themselves out to diagnose and treat diseases just as do hospitals and dispensaries, but without the authority which such establishments expressly enjoy. As pointed out in the opinion in the Woodbury Case in the Court of Appeals, at page 458 of 192 N. Y., at page 699 of 85 N. E., the statute expressly provides that they may specify in their certificate of incorporation \u201cthe systems of medical practice or treatment to be used or applied.\u201d The Woodbury, Weeks, and Gross institutions announced that they themselves undertook to diagnose and to treat. The question therefore arises whether the relator is properly chargeable with the same offense. The evidence on which he was held is uncontradicted. He transacted business under the duly adopted trade-name \u201cThe Standard Pharmacy Co.\u201d The testimony is that a lady called at the office of this \u201ccompany,\u201d inquired whether the doctor was in, and on receiving an affirmative answer, was referred to him. He is a duly licensed physician. He examined her, gave her a prescription, refused to receive any compensation, she had the prescription filled at the desk and paid therefor, and was again told that no charge would be made for the medical service.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1012-6\">In addition to this evidence the record contains copies of the inscriptions on signs around the relator\u2019s establishment, a booklet of advertisements, and a \u201ccard for free examination.\u201d The signs are perhaps fairly beyond the purview of the statute. They read as follows: (a) \u201cStandard Pharmacy Co.\u201d (b) \u201cDoctor\u2019s Office. Examination of urine. Electrical treatment. X-ray examination and other modern scientific methods.\u201d (c) \u201cStandard Pharmacy Co. Medical Office. Entrance through Drug Store.\u201d (d) \u201cManufacturers of Standard Remedies.\u201d (e) \u201cExamination of urine in order to determine the nature of the disease, and also to show a complete and reliable cure by our consulting specialist, free to our patrons who are using our valuable, well-tried, reliable and guaranteed prescriptions. The celebrated Standard Remedies.\u201d These signs may be interpreted as indicating merely that the relator is engaged in the manufacture of certain remedies; that he employs a physician, to whom patrons of his establishment may go for free medical advice, although the phrase \u201cStandard Pharmacy Co. Medical Office,\u201d is rather suggestive. It might, however, be claimed that a medical office imported no more than a place where medicines might be obtained. The same may be said of the contents of the booklet. One page contains, among others, the statement: \u201cCoupon. Free medical advice to patrons. * * * Consultation, examina-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1012-7\">tion, and advice free by the consulting specialist of the Standard Pharmacy Go.\u201d This might be regarded as unobjectionable, but the same cannot be said so clearly of the further recital: \u201cThe medical office of the Standard Pharmacy Co. is fitted up in the most complete manner with all the latest scientific medical and surgical apparatuses.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1012-8\">Without reviewing further extracts from this booklet, it may be said, however, that the doubts which I entertain as to the legal propriety of the advertisements might properly be resolved in plaintiff\u2019s favor, were it not for the card for free examination above referred to. This reads as follows: \u201cCard for free examination. Medical and surgical office of the Standard</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1012-9\">Pharmacy Co., 321-323 Bowery, corner 2d Street, New York, ...... 191...

Per</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOPTK\">Make no charge to holder of card.\u201d On the reverse side: \u201cOffice hours\u2014Daily, 12:30 to 2; evenings, 5 to 6:30 and 8 to 9; Sundays, 12 to 2.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>I cannot regard this card as other than an announcement that the Standard Pharmacy Company maintains a medical and surgical office, in charge o\u00a3 its doctor, who gives its patrons examination and medical advice on its behalf. I think that the relator holds himself out' under his trade-name as being able to diagnose and treat diseases and offers and undertakes to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1013-5\">The writ is therefore dismissed, and relator remanded.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1013-6\">Argued before INGRAHAM, P.
