It is further alleged that at the time of her death said Eva Gerber had on deposit in defendant, and said defendant owed her, a sum of money, which plaintiff seeks to recover in his own right by virtue of his jus mariti; no administrator having been appointed. The defendant demurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-20\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is the settled law in this state'that upon the death of a wife, intestate and without descendants, the title of her personal property of all kinds at once passes to and vests in her surviving husband, and this notwithstanding our Married Woman\u2019s Acts, which have secured to a wife during coverture the same rights to her separate property and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>the disposition thereof that she would have enjoyed if unmarried (Gittings v. Russel, 114 App. Div. 405, 99 N. Y. Supp. 1064; Robins v. McClure, 100 N. Y. 328, 3 N. E. 663, 53 Am. Rep. 184; Ransom v. Nichols, 22 N. Y. 110); and that this title is derived solely from the jus mariti is now also well settled. In Barnes v. Underwood, 47 N. Y. 351, it was intimated that in such a case the husband\u2019s title was derived through his right to administer, but this view was distinctly repudiated in later cases. Robins v. McClure, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The only question in the case is whether or not, as to a chose in action like the debt owed by defendant to plaintiff\u2019s deceased wife, the husband must, in order to recover, take out administration, or may, as he seeks to do here, recover in his individual capacity without administration. This precise question does not appear to have been passed upon in this state, although the authorities are numerous in other states to the effect that, having failed to reduce the property into possession during coverture, it becomes a part of the wife\u2019s estate, to be recovered through administration. See cases collated in 21 Cyc. p. 1179. The rule was formulated in Allen v. Wilkens, 85 Mass. (3 Allen) 321. That was an action upon a promissory note given to the wife and held by her at her death. It was held that it was a chose in action, and, since the husband had omitted to reduce it to possession during coverture, the property passed at the wife\u2019s death to her legal representatives ; the court saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">\u201cThe rule is well settled that choses in action belonging to a married woman can be recovered after her death by her administrator, and that the husband cannot maintain an action upon them, unless he sues in that capacity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">This appears, also, to have been the rule at common law. Blackstone thus expresses it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">\u201cBut in case the husband survives the wife, the law is very different with respect to chattels real and choses in action, for he shall have the chattel real by survivorship, but not the chose in action. * * * But the chose in ac-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">tion shall not survive to him, because he never was in possession of it at all during coverture, and the only method he had to gain possession was by suing in his wife\u2019s right; but as, after death, he cannot bring an action in her right, because they are no longer one and the same person in law, therefore he can never recover the possession. But he still will be entitled to-be her administrator, and he may in that capacity recover such things in action as became due to her during the coverture.\u201d Book 2, page 435; Sharswood\u2019s Ed. vol. 1, p. 434.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">So, also, Chancellor Kent expresses the same rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">\u201cAs to debts due to the wife at the time of her marriage or afterwards, by bond, note, or otherwise, and which are termed choses in action, they are not vested absolutely in the husband, but the husband has power to sue for and recover or release or assign the same; and when recovered and reduced to possession, <em>mi\u00e9 not otherwise, </em>it is evidence of the conversion of the same to his own use, and the money becomes, in most cases, absolutely his own. * * * y his wife dies and he survives her before' he has reduced the chose in action to possession, it does not strictly survive to him; but he is entitled to recover the same to his own use by acting as her administrator.\u201d 2 Kent\u2019s Commentaries (14th Ed.) p. 135.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">See, also, Schouler, Domestic Relations, \u00a7 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">That, in case of the death of a wife owning choses in action not reduced to possession by the husband during coverture, it may be nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>essary for the husband to take out letters of administration in order to collect, is distinctly recognized in Olmsted v. Keyes, 85 N. Y. 602, in which Judge Earl, writing for the court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-3\">\u201cAll the choses of the wife not reduced to possession during the joint lives, by the common law, passed to the husband upon her death. * * * He may then release them, or take payment of them without administration, <em>if he cam, get payment. </em>* * * If administration is needed to reduce the choses to possession, he is entitled to it, and if there are no debts the administration is solely for his benefit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">We are of opinion that, in a case like the present, where the debtor to the wife at the time of her death is unwilling to make voluntary payment to the husband, the latter can enforce p. yment only by taking out letters of administration in due and orderly course. This may serve to protect the debtor if, as may happen, it shall hereafter be found that the wife was in debt at the time of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Determination appealed from affirmed, with costs. Order filed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
