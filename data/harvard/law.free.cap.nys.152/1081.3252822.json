Rodin testified that he discharged the plaintiff because the delegates, Lubin and Schuster, directed him to do so, as by reason of his membership in his association he was required to obey its orders. Plaintiff showed that up to the time of the trial he had been idle for about eight weeks; that during his employment with Rodin he had earned not to exceed $20 per week; that during the time between his discharge by Rodin and the time of trial he had endeavored to obtain work, but, owing to the fact that he was not a union member, he could not secure a position. The court below upon this testimony gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $500, and the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">It is impossible to sustain this judgment upon any legal basis. The plaintiff has not shown that he was employed for any definite time by Rodin. If his hiring was for an indefinite term, Rodin had a right to discharge him at any time for cause, or without cause. He evidently was discharged by reason of the statements made by Lubin and Schuster, the latter representing the defendant. But these statements were not false or untrue. On the contrary, they were true, and were merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>to the effect that, according to the existing agreement between members of the two associations, Rodin could not, in consonance with that agreement, longer continue plaintiff in his employ. If plaintiff had been employed for a definite time, and discharged for the reason that he was not a union man, in an action brought against Rodin for a wrongful discharge, it could have been determined whether or not this was a sufficient reason therefor. No action will lie, however, against this defendant for requesting an employer to discharge an employ\u00e9, for the reason that such employ\u00e9 is not one of its members, or for any other reason, if such statement is true. The responsibility of such discharge rests entirely upon the employer, and he alone must respond in damages to such discharged employ\u00e9, if the discharge is wrongful. There is also no evidence that the defendant in any way attempted to prevent the plaintiff from obtaining employment elsewhere, and it is perfectly clear that the plaintiff has no cause of action against the-defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
