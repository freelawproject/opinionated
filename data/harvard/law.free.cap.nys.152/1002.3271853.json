In other words, it is within the theory of the case as tried. But the amount of the verdict, $400, is plainly excessive upon the same theory. The court charged the jury that plaintiff \u201ccannot recover 'smart money\u2019 * * * unless the defendant, as distinguished from the agents themselves, was responsible for the wantonness and maliciousness [of the force alleged to have been used to eject plaintiff from the place she occupied].\u201d There is no testimony that defendant was responsible for these wanton or malicious acts of the ushers, even if such .were proved. For the actual injury to plaintiff, $100 would be liberal compensation. If plaintiff will stipulate that the amount of the judgment be reduced to that sum, with appropriate costs, the judgment may be modified to that effect, and, as modified, affirmed; otherwise, reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-11\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event, unless the plaintiff will stipulate to reduce the amount of the recovery to the sum of $100, such stipulation to be served within six days after entry of the order and notice thereof, in which event the judgment, as so modified, is affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
