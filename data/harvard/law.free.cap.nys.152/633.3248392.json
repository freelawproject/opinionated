The nature of the claim as stated in the complaint is that neither the plaintiff nor its successors or assigns can erect, or cause or permit to be erected, upon said property, any building or buildings except of brick, stone, or iron, with roof of slate or metal, not less than four stories in height, of which the fourth story may be represented by a mansard roof, to be used and occupied exclusively for private dwelling houses, such building or buildings to stand upon or cover the whole front of the lot upon which it is built, without an alley or passageway leading into the rear of said lot for an entrance thereto as distinct from said dwelling house or houses, and that neither the plaintiff, nor its successors in interest or assigns, can erect, suffer, or permit upon any part of the said real property any tenement house or flats.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-16\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> The nature of the defendants\u2019 claim is not that they, or any of them, have any title to plaintiff\u2019s property, or lien thereon, or any right themselves to use or enjoy it, but that they have the right to exercise dominion over it to the extent that plaintiff may not, without their consent, use and enjoy it in any manner and for any purpose that it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>see fit, or otherwise than in accordance with respondents\u2019 claim of domination.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">It is argued with much learning and force that this right which the defendants claim is not technically an easement over plaintiff\u2019s property, and that defendants\u2019 claim as stated in the complaint cannot be a true easement, because not alleged to have arisen in grant or by presumption of a grant. It is not necessary to pass upon this contention (see Simmons v. Crisfield, 197 N. Y. 365, 367, 90 N. F. 956, 26 L. R. A. [N. S.] 663), for if it be conceded still it does not follow that the claim is not one which may be litigated in an action brought under the above-mentioned sections of the Code. The language of section 1638 is that the action may be brought to compel the determination of any claim adverse to that of the plaintiff, \u201cincluding any claim in the nature of an easement therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The claim which the defendants admit that they make, whether or not technically an easement, is certainly a claim \u201cin the nature of an easement,\u201d for it includes the elements of a claim to domination over plaintiff\u2019s property for the benefit and advantage of the defendants. For this reason, such a claim, although created by covenant, and not by grant,' is frequently spoken of judicially -as an \u201ceasement,\u201d and is held to be such an incumbrance upon land as to justify the refusal of a vendee to accept the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The objection that it is insufficient to allege in the words of the Code that defendants \u201cunjustly\u201d make a claim, and that the plaintiff should state facts showing wherein the unjustness consists, seems to be answered by King v. Townshend, 78 Hun, 380, 29 N. Y. Supp. 181. Nor is it necessary that the plaintiff should undertake to set forth the source and basis of defendants\u2019 claim. It is sufficient that the defendant makes a claim; its source and validity is for him to assert, if he stands upon his claim. We are of opinion that the complaint states a good cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The judgment appealed from must therefore be affirmed, with costs, with leave to appellants to withdraw their demurrers and answer within 20 days, upon payment of costs in this court and in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
