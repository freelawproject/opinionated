The complaint annexed is in the ordinary form of a complaint in an action for goods sold and delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Although defendants make a number of objections to the complaint and affidavit, the learned judge below apparently found no merit in any except one, namely, that the allegation of nonresidence was insufficient. This is to be inferred from the citation of two authorities at the foot of the order, namely, Dain\u2019s Sons Co. v. Thomas McNally Co., 137 App. Div. 857, 122 N. Y. Supp. 964; also Pettit v. United States Motor Co., 77 Misc. Rep. 277, 136 N. Y. Supp. 260. This court has, however, had occasion to point out in Geduld v. B. &amp; O. Co., 70 Misc. Rep. 495, 127 N. Y. Supp. 317, that an allegation of non-residence made by a principal in the transaction, and not by his assignee, is presumed to be made upon knowledge, and is sufficient proof, though standing, alone, of the fact to sustain an attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As to the lack of merit in the other points urged by the defendant, we agree with the learned trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
