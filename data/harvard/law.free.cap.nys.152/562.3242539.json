But a gift of securities by a father to a child non sui juris imposed on her no such duty. This was not only from her incapacity, but because the duty was laid on the person making the sale, transfer, or agreement (Tax Law, \u00a7 272), who was the father and plaintiff\u2019s natural guardian. Should such a trust fail in equity because of the father\u2019s omission to stamp the papers he had made? The state law declares a rule excluding the receipt in evidence of such unstamped transfer, but does not annul it. Bean v. Flint, 204 N. Y. 153, 97 N. E. 490. Strong grounds must be shown to move the judicial discretion to force an infant to carry on a litigation which is clearly against her interests to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Where no testimony has been taken, no costly preparation for trial incurred, and no hearing has been had on the merits, we cannot say that the learned court below, in granting the infant leave to withdraw, violated any rule of equity practice, or abused its discretion. Defendant had sought no affirmative recovery. Instead of joining in the relief asked, she stood in an attitude of resistance, and urged that plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law. With an infant so confronted, a court of equity would forget its traditions of care and protection of its infant wards if it denied leave to discontinue. If the infant had the requisite citizenship, her suing in the federal courts is by virtue of a right conferred by Congress, which this court cannot stop, abridge, or impair.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">The order refusing to vacate the ex parte order of discontinuance is therefore affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
