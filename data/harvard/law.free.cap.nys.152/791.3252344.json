The plaintiff proved the flooding of his loft, and the resulting damage to his goods. He attempted to prove previous notice to the agent of the landlord of the defective condition of the pipes, but was not allowed to prove either the agency or the notice. Just why he was not allowed is not made very clear, except that the court, on what was doubtless a hasty reading of the answer, assumed that the fact of defendant\u2019s ownership of the property had been denied, and that it was incumbent upon plaintiff to prove such ownership. The fact is that her ownership was admitted, having been alleged, and not denied. That fundamental error as to the contents of the pleadings affected the whole trial and led the court into the error complained of. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel was apparently so taken by surprise that he failed to ask to be allowed to go to the jury. This is unimportant, however, since the exceptions are ample to warrant a reversal. It is true that plaintiff did not make it clear that the pipe which leaked was under the landlord\u2019s control, but it is possible that he might have been able to do so, if an opportunity had been afforded him. We feel that, under the circumstances of the trial as disclosed in the case on appeal, justice requires that there be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-15\">Judgment appealed from reversed, and new trial granted, wth costs to appellant to abide the event. Settle order on notice. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
