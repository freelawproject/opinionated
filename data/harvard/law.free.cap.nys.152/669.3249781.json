Supp. 52.</seealso>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b704-19\">Plaintiffs were in occupation of a saloon at No. 139 Mt. Vernon avenue, in Mt. Vernon, N. <em>Y. </em>They alleged that, having an agreement with the landlord for a further period of five years, at the plaintiffs\u2019 request he had made a lease to one Schwartz in trust tor the plaintiffs. The complaint also averred that without the plaintiffs\u2019 consent said Schwartz had assigned this lease to the Westchester County Brewing Company, the defendant, who paid therefor $400, and that it took such assignment knowing that plaintiffs were the true owners, and that Schwartz had no right to make such assignment. The complaint offered to pay defendant the $400 which it had advanced, and further alleged that plaintiffs were engaged in the liquor traffic on the premises, so that, if ejected therefrom, they would suffer irreparable damage. The complaint asked that such assignment of the lease be declared void and be canceled. The complaint was served on June 1, 1912.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b704-20\">As auxiliary to their main brief, plaintiffs moved upon affidavits for an injunction restraining defendant from interfering in any manner with the possession- of the leased premises pending the suit. After a hearing, an order was made on July 16, 1912, restraining defendant from interfering with the premises on condition that plaintiffs give an undertaking in the sum of $5,000. On August 1st plaintiffs filed such undertaking, under section 620 of the Code of Civil Procedure, with a surety company, to secure any damages which defendant may sustain by such injunction \u201cif the court finally decides that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>plaintiffs were not entitled thereto.\u201d Issue had already been joined by defendant\u2019s answer served on July 10th. It appears that in October there was a local Special Term at which the cause could be tried. The defendant, however, on July 19th, had appealed from the injunction order. The appeal coming on for the term beginning September 30th resulted in an affirmance on November 1st. 153 App. Div. 907, 137 N. Y. Supp. 1128. Application for re-argument was denied. 153 App. Div. 915, 138 N. Y. Supp. 1128.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b705-3\">The cause was brought on for trial at the ensuing January Westchester county Special Term. Plaintiffs recovered a judgment entered on May 19, 1913, in which it was decreed that the assignment of the lease in question should be set aside, upon condition that plaintiffs pay $400 and interest. On defendant\u2019s appeal to this court, this judgment was reversed, and the complaint dismissed. 161 App. Div. 933, 146 N. Y. Supp. 52. The defendant then obtained an order of reference to ascertain its damages by this injunction. There were reported as damages $1,450 for counsel fees, with other damages, besides taxable costs. Upon plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions to this report, the learned Special Term reduced the counsel fees and disallowed various items of damages. From this order defendant alone has appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b705-4\">Argued before JENKS, P.

The injunction was sought merely as incidental relief, so as to retain possession of the saloon pending the judgment. \u25a0 The judgment for plaintiffs merged in it this preliminary injunction. Thereafter the judgment itself, and not any provisional or collateral remedy, entitled plaintiffs to possession, and excluded any interference by defendant. Hence this occupation and the exclusion of defendant from enjoyment under the lease after the judgment did not constitute a damage by reason of the injunction, recoverable from plaintiffs or their surety. High on Inj. (4th Ed.) \u00a7 1686; Joyce on Inj. \u00a7\u00a7 207, 208, 216; Disbrow v. Garcia, 52 N. Y. 654; Newton v. Russell, 87 N. Y. 527, 531; Granulator Soap Co. v. Haddow, 159 App. Div. 563, 144 N. Y. Supp. 610; 22 Cyc. 1055. The learned justice at Special Term therefore rightly excluded any loss of profits or rental after entry of judgment. By his correction, the stipulated figures for the pro rata value of the lease, and the estimated profits of traffic in beer, were adjusted to the actual period under the injunction,' which was no departure from the basis of these damages as stipulated upon the reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> He, however, allowed $150 counsel fees rendered and incurred in connection with the temporary injunction, also $150 for counsel\u2019s services about the trial, with $150 counsel fee upon this reference. For the reasons stated, he disallowed fees on appeal from the judgment, since that appeal concerned plaintiffs\u2019 equitable rights under the pleadings, which sought neither permanent injunctive relief nor to continue any temporary injunction. In this we think the learned court was supported by authority. Strong v. De Forest, 15 Abb. Prac. 427; Hovey v. Rubber-Tip Pencil Co., 50 N. Y. 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The appellant, however, urges that it should have had counsel fees upon the unsuccessful appeal from the injunction order. This \u2022court being always loath to interfere with the discretion of the Special Term in granting or refusing injunctions (Heim v. New York Stock Exchange, 138 App. Div. 96, 122 N. Y. Supp. 872), the quicker and surer way to test the restraining order was to proceed to trial in October, rather than to remain under the injunction, with the doubtful prospect of its reversal by appealing from the order. Furthermore, the expenses of an unsuccessful motion to dissolve an injunction have not generally been recoverable. Allen v. Brown, 5 Lans. 511, 514; Randall v. Carpenter, 88 N. Y. 293; Lyon v. Hersey, 32 Hun, 253. Hence we see no ground to vary this part of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It is further maintained that the. learned court allowed counsel too small fees. But the injunction was merely auxiliary to the main contest, and the fees here recoverable are not for the successful defense of a hard-fought litigation, but only for such legal services as related strictly to this provisional remedy. The fee to counsel at the trial was not for the entire preparation and the conduct of that hearing, but for those services necessary therein, in so far as that labor was increased by the injunction. This is the limit of the liability of plaintiffs and their surety. See Littleton v. Burgess, 18 Wyo. 58, 91 Pac. 832, 16 L. R. A. (N. S.) 49, 66. Outside the letter of this undertaking, there is no such recovery, since taxable statutory costs are all the legal expenses that the successful party may impose on its adversary. Such liability of the surety is confined stricti juris to the direct effect of the injunction, regardless of the general merits of the controversy.The court has therefore to be vigilant to see to it that such liability is kept within just and reasonable bounds, so that, in enforcing it, the court itself is not made the instrument of injustice and oppression. Cook v. Chapman, 41 N. J. Eq. 152, 159, 2 Atl. 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The order modifying the report of the referee should therefore be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
