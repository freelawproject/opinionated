Defendants denied the promise to pay $200, and claimed the promise was to pay such sum as should be realized on a.sale of property over and above a sum of $400, due defendants from plaintiffs, and alleged that, in fact, less than $400 had been realized on the sale. The verdict of $100 is inconsistent with either claim, and cannot be reconciled to any view of the evidence. Plaintiff was entitled to recover the full amount of $200, or nothing, and the verdict should have been set aside. - \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b228-15\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
