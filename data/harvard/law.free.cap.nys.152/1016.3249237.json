Plimpton, 55 N. Y. 480), because until tender there is no breach; but where, before the time fixed, one party notifies the other that he will not perform, then an action may be brought at once, and neither a tender, nor allegation of a readiness and willingness to per.form, is required. In Howard v. Daly, 61 N. Y. 362, 19 Am. Rep. 285, it was held that in a contract to employ at a future date, on a rejection before the date, plaintiff may sue for damages, without alleging a readiness and willingness to perform at the time fixed; and in Allen v. Glen Creamery Co., 101 App. Div. 306, 91 N. Y. Supp. 935, it was held that, in an action for wrongful discharge, no allegation of readiness and willingness to perform after the discharge is necessary. The principle of these cases is that, where the act charged is in itself a breach, nothing more is necessary. The distinction between the case of a plaintiff suing for a failure to employ at a future date and cases of a wrongful anticipatory notice of intention not to perform and of a wrongful discharge before the expiration of the contract is that in the former there is no breach until a tender, or, at least, readiness and willingness to perform, while in the latter the wrongful act is in and of itself a complete breach of the contract, and anything in the way of justification is matter of defense. Linton v. Unexcelled Fireworks Co., 124 N. Y. 533, 27 N. E. 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to appellant to abide the event.
