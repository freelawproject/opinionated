He merely showed that the defendant and Morris Lawton, who died on the 24th of October, 1907, leaving his father his sole heir at law and next of kin, were copartners, and as such had accumulated five parcels of real estate, concerning which there was no accounting between them; that after the death of Morris Lawton, and on the 11th day of December, 1907, the defendant \u201cby trick and device and fraudulent representations\u201d induced plaintiff\u2019s testator and his wife \u201cto sign over\u201d to defendant the five parcels of real estate which the defendant and Morris Lawton held as copartners, \u201ctogether with two other pieces,\u201d and to execute an agreement to the effect that there was nothing due and owing from the defendant to the estate of Morris Lawton; that the deeds of conveyance and agreement which were so executed by the plaintiff\u2019s testator \u201care the basis of another action now pending in the Supreme Court of this county, brought by the heirs to remove a cloud on title\u201d; that the defendant, ever since said conveyance to him, has managed and controlled the real estate, and has had possession \u201cof all of the personalty\u201d; and that the plaintiff has no knowledge with respect to the extent or value of the same. No partnership between the plaintiff\u2019s testator and the defendant is shown or claimed. If, on any theory, plaintiff has a cause of action against the defendant for an accounting, he would not need or be entitled to an examination to frame a complaint. Matter of Gardner, 124 App. Div. 654, 109 N. Y. Supp. 95; Pierce v. McLaughlin Real Estate Co., 121 App. Div. 501, 106 N. Y. Supp. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">But plaintiff\u2019s counsel insists that this is not a suit in equity for any purpose. With respect to the copartnership between defendant and Morris Lawton, the property rights of the parties should be determined in an action for an accounting brought by or against the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>sonal representative of Morris Lawton. In other words, the plain--\" tiff, as the executor of the father of Morris Lawton, is not vested with any cause of action for an accounting with respect to that co-partnership. The assets which the plaintiff seeks to recover, with the exception of the income therefrom arising subsequent to the conveyance, were conveyed to the defendant by tlie; plaintiff\u2019s testator; and it appears that at the same time a settlement agreement was executed, by which the plaintiff\u2019s testator, in effect, released the defendant from accounting to the estate of his son. It is manifest that neither the property thus conveyed, nor the income therefrom since the conveyances, can be recovered until the conveyances are set aside in an appropriate action therefor. It is not shown that any of the personal property of the plaintiff\u2019s testator was assigned to the defendant; but it appears to be claimed that some of the personal property of Morris Lawton came into the possession of the defendant. That property, however, did not vest in the plaintiff\u2019s testator, but in the personal representative of Morris Lawton, deceased, for the purpose of administration, and the plaintiff, therefore, would have no cause of action therefor; and, if he could maintain a cause of action therefor, it could not be maintained without setting aside the settlement agreement. It is evident, therefore, that the plaintiff fails to show that there are any assets of <em>his </em>testator in the hands of the defendant which he is entitled to recover in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">It follows that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate the order for the examination granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">INGRAHAM, P. J., and McLAUGHLIN, SCOTT, and DOWLING, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
