The court appointed a referee to take testimony and report his conclusions. From the order confirming said report this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">The alleged service was made by a person who testified that he knew the defendant, and that the circumstances of the service were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-11\">\u201cI says, \u2018How are you Mr. Levinson?\u2019 and he says, \u2018All right;\u2019 and I says, T got a little paper for you;\u2019 and he said, T don\u2019t want it;\u2019 and he started to walk away, * * * and as he did so I pushed it in his outside pocket, and I says, \u2018It is all right?\u2019 and he said, \u2018It\u2019s all right.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">The referee held that service, if made as described, was ineffectual, because the nature of the papers was not disclosed to defendant, nor was he in any way informed that service of process was intended, or that the paper had in fact been put into his pocket. This view was adopted by the court below; I think this was error. As was said by Judg\u00e9 Earl, in Hiller v. B. &amp; M. Ry. Co., <em>70 </em>N. Y. 223, <em>227:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-13\">\u201cThe object of all service of process is said to be to give notice to the party on whom service is made, that he may be aware of and resist what is sought of him, and it is a general rule that any service must be deemed sufficient which renders it reasonably probable that the party proceeded against will be apprised of what is going on against him, and have an opportunity to defend.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">This common-sense rule has been adopted in a number of cases, and wherever service by means other than personal delivery has been held ineffectual, it has been because the circumstances were such as to show that the defendant did not come into actual possession of the papers, and that his attention was not drawn to their character, or that he had not willfully ignored them and refused to ascertain their nature for the purpose of evading service. In the present case, if the papers were placed in the defendant\u2019s pocket, and particularly if such a conversation with reference to them took place as testified to, the service was as effectual as if the papers had been handed to and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>retained by defendant and their nature fully explained to him. It is not to be presumed that, after the papers had been placed in his pocket and that fact acknowledged by him, he subsequently failed to ascertain their contents. The defendant claimed that no service whatever had been made, and attempted to prove an alibi; but I think the preponderance of proof shows that service was in fact made.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, and the judgment reinstated, with $10 costs and disbursements of this appeal, together with $10 costs on the motion below to vacate the judgment, and such sums as the plaintiff was obliged to pay as part of the expenses of the reference, with leave to defendant to apply at Special Term to open his default and answer, on showing merits and on payment of all costs awarded by this order. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
