Laws, c. 12) \u00a7 3, relative to assignments by a debtor to his assignee for creditors, was not inadmissible under the answer, which alleged that the attachment debtor was unable to pay its debts, and called a meeting of its creditors, at which a committee was appointed, and that the attachment debtor assigned to the interpleaded defendant its claim to the sum due, to apply it on the debts of the attachment debtor; the allegations of the answer not necessarily calling for an assignment of the class covered by the statute, as it did not show that the assignment was a general assignment, and it did not appear therefrom that the assignor was insolvent; there being a difference between \u201cinsolvency\u201d and an inability to pay debts.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1069-14\">[Ed.

The defendant paid the money into court and interpleaded an alleged assignee of the debt, who has appeared and is the appealing defendant, and he now claims the debt was assigned to him before the levy by the sheriff under the attachment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>The defendant on the trial offered in evidence an assignment to him of the debt in question in writing by the defendant in the attachment suit, dated long prior to the levy under the attachment, after evidence of delivery and of notice thereof to the debtor. This was excluded, and the court directed judgment for plaintiffs, holding that the debt had not been assigned. The ground of the refusal to admit the assignment in evidence, as given by the court, was that \u201cit had not been served\u201d on the Sicilian Asphalt Company, the debtor (folio 152, printed case).</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\"><bracketnum>[1-3]</bracketnum> It is very clear that the reason given is untenable. Notice even of the assignment to the debtor is unnecessary (Columbia Bank v. Equitable Assur. Soc., 61 App. Div. 594, 70 N. Y. Supp. 767); but, if it were, the evidence (Exhibit B) shows such notice. Plaintiffs\u2019 objection to the paper was not confined to the reason given by the court, and the ruling is now sought to be sustained on the ground that the assignment did not conform to the requirements of section 3 of the Debtor and Creditor Law relating, to assignments commonly known as insolvent general assignments for the benefit of creditors. The question is presented in a twofold aspect: Eirst, that the assignment offered is inadmissible under the pleadings, because nothing less than an assignment in accordance with the statute would satisfy the allegations of the answer; and, second, that the assignment offered was invalid or ineffective as an assignment as against plaintiff, because not made in the form prescribed by said statute. Neither ground is well taken. The allegations of the answer do not necessarily call for, nor do the circumstances require, an assignment of the class covered by that statute. Conformity with the statute was required neither by the allegations of the answer nor the facts. That statute relates to general assignments by insolvents of all their property to an assignee for the benefit of creditors, to be administered by the assignee in accordance with the rules of law applicable to such proceedings. The assignment in question was not a general assignment of property, but only of the debt in question and some other claims. It is not alleged in the answer, nor does it appear that the assignor was insolvent. There is a vast difference between insolvency and inability to pay debts. It was not made to an assignee for creditors, such as is contemplated in the statute, but apparently to a committee in accordance with some special plan agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It was unnecessary, therefore, either to conform to allegations of the answer or to establish the validity of the assignment that it should be shown to conform to the requirement of the statute in question. Moreover, assignments of choses in action, even if voidable as to creditors, are valid as against the assignor and attaching creditors. They cannot be called in question, except by a judgment creditor\u2019s action. Throop Grain Cleaner Co. et al. v. Smith, 110 N. Y. 83, 17 N. E. 671; Thurber v. Blanck et al., 50 N. Y. 80. Although judgment had been rendered in the attachment suit, this was an action in aid of the attachment, and not a judgment creditor\u2019s action, as execution had riot been returned <em>unsatisfied\u2014-a. </em>necessary prerequisite to such a judgment creditor\u2019s action (section 1871, Code).</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">The refusal to admit the assignmerit in evidence was error, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>judgment must be reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
