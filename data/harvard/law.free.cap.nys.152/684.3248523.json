We now have no such opportunity as he had to weigh their credibility and to find on which side was the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-21\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Furthermore, the natural probabilities seem to favor the plaintiffs, especially on the issue as to which party should bear defendant\u2019s share of the administrative expenses to be incurred by the reinsurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>committee. Neither can defendant now defeat recovery on the ground that this was not a suit in equity, because plaintiffs had a remedy at law. The relief sought was that the court should pronounce and declare broken a subsisting contract, and enjoin paying over certain moneys subject to plaintiffs\u2019 claims. This power to adjudge such a breach, and to free one party from going on further under the contract, with an injunction against removal of the funds from the state, rests \"in equity. 16 Cyc. 102. That, after suit had been begun and injunction issued, the parties themselves by mutual stipulation terminated the contract, did not detract from the original character of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> After consenting to refer all the issues, and without raising such a point before the referee, defendant cannot now be heard to say that plaintiffs\u2019 remedy was at law, triable only by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
