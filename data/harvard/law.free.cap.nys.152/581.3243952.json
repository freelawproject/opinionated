The affidavits seem to support this allegation of the complaint, but the defendant contends that because the plaintiff left her home and brought a suit for support and maintenance, which was dismissed because both parties were at fault, she is not entitled to return to her husband and resume the marital relation, or maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-20\">\" [1] We are not prepared to assent to that view. That contention is based largely upon the decision in Silberstein v. Silberstein, 156 App. Div. 689, 141 N. Y. Supp. 376. We need not now discuss the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>that decision. If the facts are as plaintiff here contends, they are sufficient to require a trial and the question to be passed upon as to whether she is entitled to any relief; and, if so, the order requiring the husband to provide for her support in the meantime and to furnish her with funds to carry on her suit is proper, she being without means of her own and entirely destitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The.point is made that the order, if otherwise correct, is erroneous in requiring the defendant to pay the counsel fee to plaintiff\u2019s attorney, mentioning him by name. We think that point is well taken, and' the order should be modified by requiring the payment to her, and not to a designated attorney, and, as so modified, the order should be affirmed, without costs. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
