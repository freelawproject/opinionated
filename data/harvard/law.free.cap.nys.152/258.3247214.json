Spitz v. Heinze, 77 App. Div. 317, 79 N. Y. Supp. 187. There is, however, the same authority for requiring a bill of particulars of an affirmative defense as for requiring one of a plaintiff\u2019s claim. Spitz v. Heinze, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"A61\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The first demand for a bill of particulars is of the times and occasions, including dates and places, and the names of the persons from whom defendant claims that plaintiff accepted for his own use any consideration or benefit as a condition of approving and passing merchandise purchased by him for defendant. The material part of that demand is, of course, with respect to the names of the persons; and they are required to be given, not on the theory that the plaintiff is entitled to a discovery with respect to the defendant\u2019s evidence, but that it is necessary in order that the plaintiff may not be taken by surprise and put to needless preparation for the trial, and may be prepared to meet the evidence adduced in support of the charge, which, on the pleadings, stands denied. Taylor v. Security H. Life Ins. Co., 73 App. Div. 319, 76 N. Y. Supp. 671; Spitz v. Heinze, supra. These are serious charges, and for the same reason, the defendant should be' required to state, so far as it is able to do so, the times and places, and in order that the plaintiff may be prepared to show, if it be the fact, that, he was elsewhere, or that he may call other witnesses to contradict the testimony offered by the defendant. American Woolen Co. of New York v. Altkrug, 137 App. Div. 621, 122 N. Y. Supp. 394; Knickerbocker Trust Co. v. Packard, 109 App. Div. 421, 96 N. Y. Supp. 412; Smith v. Anderson, 126 App. Div. 24, 110 N. Y. Supp. 191; Spitz v. Heinze, supra; Sundheimer v. Barron &amp; Co., 62 Misc. Rep. 263, 114 N. Y. Supp. 804. The plaintiff is for like reason entitled to know the names of the employes of the defendant, whose services it claims he used during business hours for himself or for others, and the times and places, as near as may be, of those performed elsewhere than at defendant\u2019s place of business; but we are of opinion that it would be unreasonable to expect defendant to be able to specify the particular days and hours when plaintiff exacted from its employ\u00e9s services performed at its place of business for his account. The second and third demands of the plaintiff, therefore, should have been granted to the extent herein stated; but the nature of the services is immaterial, as is also the length of time devoted thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The fourth demand is that the defendant specify the times when it claims he failed and neglected to devote his entire time to its business by absenting himself therefrom, and he asks that days and hours be given. This demand was too broad, and was properly denied, for it is manifest that the employer should be at due liberty to show that the employ\u00e9 neglected his duties, generally or from time to time during the course of the employment, without being confined to precise days and hours, and we so held in Spitz v. Heinze, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">It follows that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted to the extent herein indicated, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
