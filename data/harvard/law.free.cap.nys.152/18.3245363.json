The city ordinance (section 13), however, prohibits such a show on Sunday, and declares that every person violating this section shall \u201cforfeit a penalty of not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) in the discretion of the magistrate convicting.\u201d The relator has been arrested for violation of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-14\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> A license may be conditionally granted. It may be given subject to certain reasonable hours of opening and other limits upon its exercise. But the derivative power of a municipality to fine and imprison can only exist under and in the due enforcement of authority clearly committed to the municipality. The intent that municipal corporations by ordinance can supersede the state law will not be inferred from general grants of power, nor will such authority be held to exist as an implied or incidental right. Dillon, Municipal Corporations, (5th Ed.) \u00a7 632. As all municipal authority comes from the Legislature, the provisions of municipal charters, however broad, are subject to such restrictions as may be imposed by general laws. Lechner v. Village of Newark, 19 Misc. Rep. 452, 454, 44 N. Y. Supp. 556. The additional powers by chapter 247, Laws of 1913, amending the General City Law (chapter 21, Consol. Laws), giving authority to enforce ordinances by affixing penalties, forfeitures, and imprisonment (section 20, subdiv. 22), did not, and could not, surrender the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>power to legislate against criminal offenses, which remains in the Legislature. People v. Jarvis, 19 App. Div. 466, 46 N. Y. Supp. 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The Legislature alone may command how Sunday shall be kept. Neuendorff v. Duryea, 69 N. Y. 557, 25 Am. Rep. 235; People v. Dunford, 207 N. Y. 17, 20, 100 N. E. 433; People v. Moses, 140 N. Y. 215, 35 N. E. 499. Hence the city of Yonkers cannot independently compel and enforce Sunday closing, by means of fine or imprisonment, unless such prohibition is part of the law and policy as declared by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">It follows that the writ should be sustained, and the relator discharged. All concur; BURR, J., in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"Aon\"> Laws 1908, c. 452, art. 3, \u00a7 1, subd. 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
