Gleason against a bailee of certain apples, in which the Growers\u2019 &amp; Shippers\u2019 Exchange was substituted as defendant, 'and in which thereafter Seth J. T. Bush, trustee in bankruptcy of the Exchange, was substituted as defendant. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals. Reversed, and new trial granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-19\">The action was in replevin, brought by plaintiff, Gleason, against a bailee of certain apples to recover possession thereof. Thereafter by an order of the court the original bailor of the apples, Growers\u2019 &amp; Shippers\u2019 Exchange, was substituted as defendant in the action in the place of the original defendant, pursuant to the provisions of section 820 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The substituted defendant, Growers\u2019 &amp; Shippers\u2019 Exchange, was after its substitution as defendant adjudicated a bankrupt, and the defendant Bush, after his appointment as trustee in bankruptcy of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, was substituted as defendant in the place of the bankrupt corporation. The answer interposed by the defendant trustee among other things alleged as a counterclaim his right as trustee to recover the apples, or the value thereof, as property of the bankrupt transferred by it to plaintiff within four months next preceding the date of the adjudication of its bankruptcy without receiving from plaintiff any consideration therefor; he then knowing the company was insolvent and that the transfer was so made to enable him to secure a larger percentage upon his claim against it than other creditors in like situation with himself.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Argued before KRUSE, P.

Clark v. Mosher, 107 N. Y. 118, 14 N. E. 96, 1 Am. St. Rep. 798. Had the action been tried as one in equity, there could be little doubt that defendant should have been permitted to prove his alleged counterclaim that the transfer to plaintiff of the apples in question constituted a preferential transfer of the property of the bankrupt, voidable at his election. \u201cWhen a court of equity obtains jurisdiction, and all the facts are before it by supplemental pleading, as they are here, it may and generally does adapt the relief to the situation existing at the close of the litigation.\u201d Dammert et al. v. Osborn et al., 140 N. Y. 30, 43, 35 N. E. 407, 411, citing Peck v. Goodberlett, 109 N. Y. 181, 16 N. E. 350, Madison Ave. Bap. Ch. v. Oliver St. Bap. Ch., 73 N. Y. 83. See, also, Sherman v. Foster, 158 N. Y. 587, 53 N. E. 504; Hunt v. Provident Savings Life Assur. Soc., 77 App. Div. 338, 343, 79 N. Y. Supp. 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Though, because of the order of interpleader, the action was changed from one at law to one in equity, yet the parties to the litigation could still treat it as a common-law action, in which all the issues were triable by a jury. Voss v. Smith, 87 App. Div. 395, 84 N. Y. Supp. 471. In the present case the parties seem by consent to have chosen to try the action as one at law. The case under these circumstances should then be tried precisely in the same way as any other common-law action. Voss v. Smith, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> We shall therefore consider the case as one at common law. The counterclaim above referred to, which defendant sought to interpose\u2014i. e., the right of the trustee to attack plaintiff\u2019s title to the apples as obtained because of a preferential transfer thereof voidable at the trustee\u2019s option\u2014did not exist at the time the action was begun. A cause of action may be interposed as a counterclaim, though it arose after the commencement of the action, if, as provided by subdivision 1 of section 501 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it is one \u201carising out of the contract or transaction set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, or connected with the subject of the action.\u201d Caspary v. Hatch, 157 App. Div. 679, 142 N. Y. Supp. 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was based upon his alleged title to the apples in question. His title depended upon the fact that the Growers\u2019 &amp; Shippers\u2019 Exchange\" had transferred its title to the goods to him. But the title thereby acquired was subject to the possibility that the transfer might be avoided as preferential, at the instance of a trustee in bankruptcy of the seller, provided the petition in the bankruptcy proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ings, in which such trustee was thereafter appointed, was filed within four months after the transfer. Such right of action given by Bankr. Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544, to the trustee, as between the trustee and the transferee, is quasi contractual in substance and effect. Cohen v. Small, 120 App. Div. 211, 105 N. Y. Supp. 287, affirmed 190 N. Y. 568, 83 N. E. 1123. As was said in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">\u201cThe Bankruptcy Law enters into the contract between a debtor and a creditor, and gives a right to the trustee in bankruptcy to recover from the creditor any payment made in violation of the Bankruptcy Law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The right of the trustee in such case to avoid the transfer would thus seem to be, as the section of the Code above referred to phrases it, \u201cconnected with the subject of the action,\u201d which plaintiff seeks to maintain. It follows that, even if the action is to be treated as one at common law, the counterclaim was properly interposed, and the defendant was entitled on the trial to have the issues raised thereby submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
