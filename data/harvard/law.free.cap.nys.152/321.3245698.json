Riley, payee in the instrument in suit, acting with a Mr. Hill and a Mr. ICenny, sought a builder to enter into a contract with the United States government for the erection of a post office building. Riley, plaintiff\u2019s assignor, found the defendant Price, who put in a bid for the erection of the building. Riley, plaintiff\u2019s assignor, told Price that Price would have to pay a commission of $400, $250 of which was to be paid to Hill and $75 each to ICenny and Riley. Riley procured a contract for the purchase of a piece of property at Fifth avenue and Ninetieth street, borough of Brooklyn, on which the proposed post office building was supposed h&gt; be erected. No building was erected. During the negotiations Hill and Riley asked the defendant Price for notes representing the $400 \u201ccommission,\u201d and after some discussion Price gave his note for $250 to Hill, a note for $75 to Kenny, and a note for $75 to Riley, which last note is the one in suit. At the time of the delivery of the notes, Price said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-16\">\u201cRemember, this is an accommodation, and you cannot bind anybody until the government has actually paid us the money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-17\">The note delivered to Riley reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-18\">\u201c$75.00 New York, August 10, 1913.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-19\">\u201cNinety (90) days after date I promise to pay to the order of Edward F. Riley seventy-five dollars ($75.00), at 363 Fulton street, Jamaica, L. I. Value received. This note is payable when Post Office Department accepts my building from me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-20\">\u201cNo. -. Due. Henry E. Price.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>The answer admitted the making and delivery of the note as alleged, denied that plaintiff was an innocent holder for value before maturity, and, as a separate defense, alleged want of consideration. The sole question is whether this note was rendered nonnegotiable by the addition at the end of the note, before the maker\u2019s signature, of the words \u201cThis note is payable when Post Office Department accepts my building from me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">It is claimed by respondent that the note must be construed to be a promise to pay absolutely in 90 days from date, and before 90 days <em>if </em>defendant received payment for his work from the government, citing McCarty v. Howell, 24 Ill. 342, Walker v. Woollen, 54 Ind. 164, 23 Am. Rep. 639, and Cota v. Buck, 7 Metc. (Mass.) 588, 41 Am. Dec. 464. In the Illinois case the wording of the note was, \u201cfour months after date, or as soon as I shall be able to collect a certain note,\u201d etc. In the Indiana case the wording was, \u201cSix months after date, or before,\u201d etc. In the Massachusetts case the wording was, \u201cAs soon as *' * * realized from the sale of property which is to be paid for in the course of the season * * * coming.\u201d None of these cases supports respondent\u2019s contention. In the Indiana and Massachusetts cases it is very plain that a definite time of payment was fixed\u2014in the one case by the end \u201cof the season coming,\u201d and in the other \u201csix months after date or before.\u201d In the Illinois case the court construed the note to be payable absolutely in four months, and at an earlier date if A. Davis should pay his note before that time. The wording of the note was susceptible of the construction put on it by the court, and that construction was the natural one.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">In the note iff suit, the sentence added at the end of the note saying, ,rThis note is payable when Post Office Department accepts my building from me,\u201d is distinct from the 9Q-day clause in the beginning of the note. The paragraph at the end, standing, as it does, by itself, evinces an intent on the part of both maker and payee that the concluding sentence should take the place of, or at any rate control, the 90-day clause at the beginning. That this construction is not only reasonable, but correct, is strongly fortified by the evidence in the case already outlined.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">There are two other cases, not cited by respondent, that are worthy of mention. One is Stevens v. Blunt, 7 Mass. 240, where the form of the note was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">\u201cThis may certify that I do agree to pay unto Solomon Stevens, or order, <em>140 by the 20th day </em>of May, or when he completes the building according to contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">The lower court held that it was not a negotiable instrument. The appellate court reversed,- holding that the note was payable absolutely at a day certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Another cas\u00e9 is Ernst v. Steckman, 74 Pa. 13, 15 Am. Rep. 542, where the note which was held negotiable, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-12\">\u201cTwelve months after date (or before, if made out of the sale of W. S. Coffman\u2019s Improved Broadcast Seeding Machine) I promise to pay,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">This case cites Alexander v. Thomas, 16 Q. B. 333, as a case holding a contrary theory; Lord Campbell there holding that a bill pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>able \"ninety days after date or when realized\u201d was not a negotiable instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">It will be observed, however, that in the cases' where the note was held negotiable the definite time clause and the future event clause are connected by the particle \u201cor,\u201d whereas, in the note in suit, as pointed out above, the clauses are entirely separate.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">PENDLETON, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b357-8\">GUY, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AQu\">Defendant appeals from a judgment entered by direction of the court in favor of plaintiff in an action on a promissory note, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">\u201c$75.00 New York, August 10, 1913.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">\u201cNinety (90) days after date I promise to pay to the order of Edward F. Riley Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) at 363 Fulton street, Jamaica, L. I. Value received. This note is payable when Post Office Department accepts my building from me. \u25a0 [Signed] Henry E. Price.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">The answer admits the making and delivery of the note as alleged, denies that plaintiff was an innocent \"holder for value before maturity, and, as a separate defense, alleges want of consideration. The evidence clearly establishes that plaintiff was an innocent purchaser for value before maturity, and is entitled to recover if the note is a negotiable instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">I am of the opinion that the note must be construed to be a promise to pay absolutely in 90 days from date, and before 90 days if defendant .received payment for his work from the government. See McCarty v. Howell, 24. Ill. 342; Walker v. Woollen, 54 Ind. 164, 23 Am. Rep. 639; Cota v. Buck, 7 Metc. (Mass.) 588, 41 Am. Dec. 464. It is therefore a negotiable instrument, and the defenses set forth in the answer are not available to defendant as against plaintiff, an innocent holder for value.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
