Vernon. The case was tried before the court without a jury. The contentions of the respective parties arise from the following undisputed facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b827-14\">On September 5, 1899, Albert W. Mott was the owner in fee of the premises in question, and on that day executed a mortgage thereon to one William M. Denman, in which his wife joined. Denman died in November following, and by his will bequeathed such mortgage to his wife, Jennie A. Denman. The defendant, on March 22, 1900, recovered a judgment against Mott in the City Court of Mt. Vernon, which was docketed in the office of the clerk of Westchester county on March 24, 1900, and became a general lien upon the realty owned by Mott in that county. On June 7, 1902, Mrs. Denman commenced an action to foreclose her mortgage, making Mott and his wife and the defendant parties thereto. The latter appeared by attorney and waived the service of all papers other than notice of sale and of surplus money proceedings. Mott was at that time a nonresident, and, although an attempt was made to serve the summons in said action upon him by publication, the papers, upon which the order for such service was made, were defective. Such proceedings were had and taken in such action that on December 6, 1902, a judgment of foreclosure and sale was entered, in form against all of the defendants named therein, under the provisions of which the premises were sold to Mrs. Denman; and, through several mesne conveyances, such title as she had passed to the plaintiff by deed on April 13, 1908. Subsequently, and on June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>12, 1909, Mott executed and delivered to her a quitclaim deed, conveying to her all of his interest in said premises, which deed was recorded in the office of the clerk of Westchester county on July 10, 1909. Before the expiration of ten years after the docketing and entry of its judgment, defendant obtained leave to issue execution against Mott, and the sheriff of Westchester county, under such execution, attempted to levy upon, and on May 6, 1910, sold at public auction and attempted to convey to it, all the right, title, and interest which Mott had in the premises involved on March 29, 1900, or at any time thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> We think that the difficulty in this case has arisen from confusing the interests of defendants in a foreclosure action who have an estate in the land with defendants who have only a lien thereon by way of judgment. As to the former, the effect of the judgment is to transfer such estate or interest. As to the latter, its effect is to bar and extinguish the lien. Continental Insurance Co. v. Reeve, 135 App. Div. 737, 119 N. Y. Supp. 901; Hope v. Shevill, 137 App. Div. 86, 90, 122 N. Y. Supp. 127, 130. In the latter case, Mr. Justice Thomas says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">\u201cThe purpose of an action to foreclose a mortgage is to <em>extinguish Hens </em>and transmit through the mortgage to the purchaser on the sale the fee of the land.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-7\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> The Putnam Foundry &amp; Machine Company is such a lienor. As its lien was subsequent to the mortgage, it was a proper party defendant ; and a general allegation of lien, such as was made in this case, is sufficient. Drury v. Clark, 16 How. Prac. 424; Albany City National Bank v. Hudson River Brick Mfg. Co., 79 Hun, 387, 29 N. Y. Supp. 793. The relief asked for against it, was not the sale and transfer of its estate or interest in the land for it had none, but that it be barred and foreclosed of all lien thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> A conveyance upon a sale, made pursuant to a judgment of foreclosure, is \u201can entire bar * * * against each party to the action who was duly summoned.\u201d Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1632. Defendant\u2019s appearance in said action was equivalent to due personal service. The judgment in express terms provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-10\">\u201cBach and all of the defendants * * * be and they are hereby barred and foreclosed of all * *. * lien * * * in the said mortgaged premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">Under that judgment, a sale was had and a conveyance given, under which plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title entered into possession of the property, and she and such predecessors have been in constant possession of- the same since that time. The court had jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the action and of the person of the defendant Putnam Foundry &amp; Machine Company. The judgment, and the sale under, it, cut off and extinguished any lien that it had upon the land. Flannery &amp; Co. v. Baldwin Fertilizer, Co., 94 Ga. 696, 21 S. E. 587; Youker v. Treadwell, 4 N. Y. Supp. 674;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Montgomery v. Tutt, 11 Cal. 307, 316. A junior lienor cannot avail himself of defective serv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>ice upon the mortgagor. Semple v. Lee, 13 Iowa, 304; Fergus v. Tinkham, 38 Ill. 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><bracketnum>[5,6]</bracketnum> If it should be urged that by collusion between a mortgagor,' against whom are several judgments, and a mortgagee, an action for the foreclosure of a prior mortgage may be brought, to which the mortgagor and his judgment creditors are parties defendant, and in which the judgment creditors only are served, and thereafter a judgment of foreclosure and sale is entered, barring the latter from any interest or lien upon said premises, and that thus the mortgagor might be put in a position where he could hold said premises subject only to the mortgage itself, it is a complete answer to the suggestion: First, that the court should not grant such a judgment; second, if it inadvertently did, the judgment was not void, but only voidable; and, until set aside, it is conclusive. Goebel v. Iffla, 111 N. Y. 170, 18 N. E. 649; Jenkins v. Fahey, 73 N. Y. 355, 357. The judgment creditor had it within his power, by timely appearance in the action, to see that only a proper judgment was entered; and if erroneously an improper tine was granted, to move promptly to set it aside. The judgment of foreclosure and sale here attacked was rendered in December, 1902, and no motion has been made respecting the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\"><bracketnum>[7, 8]</bracketnum> But, if we are entirely wrong about this, the court has found that the plaintiff, who succeeded to the interests of the mortgagee, who was the purchaser at the foreclosure sale, is a mortgagee in possession. And, at least since the quitclaim deed from Mott, this finding is in accordance both with the evidence and the law. Howell v. Leavitt, 95 N. Y. 617; Townshend v. Thomson, 139 N. Y. 152, 161, 34 N. E. 891. The equitable estate which has existed, at least since June, 1909, could not be sold under an execution which was not issued until March, 1910. Bates v. Ledgerwood Mfg. Co., 130 N. Y. 200, 29 N. E. 102; German National Bank v. Queen, 159 App. Div. 236, 144 N. Y. Supp. 195. The sheriff\u2019s deed, given in pursuance of such an attempted sale, is such a cloud upon plaintiff\u2019s title that an action will lie to remove the same. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1638.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">We think that the judgment should be reversed on the facts, as well as the law, and judgment should be directed in favor of the plaintiff, with costs and disbursements of the action and of this appeal. The findings of fact numbered XII and XIII, respectively, are reversed and set aside. Plaintiff may submit findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">JENKS, P. J., and STAPLETON and RICH, JJ., concur. THOMAS, J., concurs in result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-13\"> Reported in full in the New York Supplement; reported as a memorandum decision without opinion in 51 Hun, 638.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
