At that time appellant declined to accept a gross sum in lieu of her-then inchoate right of dower, and the sum of $24,371.94 was deposited in court to protect said inchoate right. The judgment contained the customary provision that any party to the action might at any time thereafter \u201capply to the court for further direction, judgment, or order in the premises.\u201d The husband is now dead, and appellant\u2019s right to dower has become consummate. She now applies for an order that a gross sum be awarded to her in lieu of her dower right.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">We think that the motion should have been granted. The fact that she declined a gross sum in lieu of her inchoate right is no reason why her present application should be denied. The fund stands in the place of the land, and her right to a gross sum by way of admeasurement has become absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">Order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted. Order filed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
