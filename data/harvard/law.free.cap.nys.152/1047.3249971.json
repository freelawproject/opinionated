The father has some right to the custody of his child; the grandmother has none. The father is, like the grandmother, of good character; the father, by reason of his income, is better able to care for the child. There is no consideration related to the child\u2019s welfare that requires that the grandmother be preferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">The order is reversed, and the plaintiff\u2019s motion granted, with a-provision that the grandparents should not be denied reasonable opportunity to see the child.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
