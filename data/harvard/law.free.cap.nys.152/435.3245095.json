The question is different as to the time within which either the printed papers or the briefs must be filed. The objection is taken by the respondent that no order should be made here extending the plaintiffs' time to file the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">The motions are therefore denied, without costs, and without prejudice to an application to the Special Term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
