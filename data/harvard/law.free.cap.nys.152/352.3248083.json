Ireland for $1,000, payable four months after date. The complaint alleges that defendants Robert L. Ireland, the payee of the note, and John De C. Ireland, before the maturity of the said note, for value, indorsed and delivered the same to the plaintiff, who is now the owner and holder thereof. The complaint further alleges nonpayment thereof. The maker of the note interposed an answer in the following form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-15\">\u201cFirst. This defendant has no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the allegations contained in the \u2018third\u2019 paragraph of the complaint, that the plaintiff is now the owner and holder of the note in the complaint mentioned, or that the same was delivered to her for value, as in said paragraph \u2018third\u2019 of the complaint set forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-16\">\u201cSecond. Further answering said complaint, and as a further separate and distinct defense thereto, this defendant alleges, on information and belief, that this plaintiff is not the real and lawful holder and owner of said note in due course, nor the real party in interest, hut that Arthur O. Townsend and A. H. Ferber are the real parties in interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">Plaintiff demurred to the \u201cfurther separate and distinct defense\u201d for insufficiency, and moved for judgment on the pleadings, and also moved to set aside an ex parte order directing the trial of the issues in said action. Her motion was denied, and she now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-18\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The second paragraph of the answer, which is stated as a separate and distinct defense, is bad. Each separate and distinct defense must be complete in itself. By failure to deny, the allegation of the complaint, that the payee of the note, before maturity and for value, indorsed and delivered the same to plaintiff, stands admitted. In the face of such admission, the allegation in this clause of the answer that \u201cthis plaintiff is not the real and lawful holder and owner of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>note in due course, nor the real party in interest, but that Arthur O. Townsend and A. H. Ferber are the real parties in interest,\u201d states only a conclusion of law. Twelfth Ward Bank v. Brooks, 63 App. Div. 220, 71 N. Y. Supp. 388; Wenk v. City of New York, 82 App. Div. 584, 81 N. Y. Supp. 583. In Twelfth Ward Bank v. Brooks, supra, the third defense in the answer, after attempting, but failing, to properly allege payment of the note, did allege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">\u201cThat the plaintiff is not the real party in interest, that the action is not brought for the benefit of the plaintiff, that the defendant Quincy was and is the owner and holder of the note, and that the action is brought for the benefit of said Quincy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The court in its opinion said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">\u201cBy not denying, the defendant admits that the title to the note was transferred to the plaintiff, and without setting up facts to avoid the effect of such an admission, and to show the transfer of the note from the plaintiff to the defendant Quincy, he cannot raise an issue \u00f3f fact by the affirmative statement of conclusions of law. The facts must be alleged from which such conclusions of law could have been drawn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-8\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> For a like reason\u2014that is, failure to deny the transfer of the note to plaintiff-\u2014the denial in the first paragraph of the answer that \u201cplaintiff is now the owner and holder of the note in the complaint mentioned\u201d is insufficient. If it were true that the note was not transferred for value, this would constitute no defense. Ireland, as owner and holder of the note in due course, as between plaintiff and defendant, the maker thereof, had a perfect right to transfer the same without consideration. Ludlow v. Woodward, 117 App. Div. 525, 102 N. Y. Supp. 647; Queen City Bank v. Hudson, 8 App. Div. 27, 40 N. Y. Supp. 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">We think, therefore, that the demurrer to the separate defense of the answer should have been sustained, and the motion of plaintiff for judgment on the pleadings should have been granted, and the order directing the trial of the issues raised by the answer should have been set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">The order denying this relief must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for judgment on the pleadings, and to vacate the order directing the trial of the issues, must be granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
