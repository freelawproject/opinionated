Reversed, and judgment ordered for plaintiff.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1013-17\">Argued March term, 1915, before LEHMAN, HENDRICK, and COHALAN, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1013-18\">Harry A.

He made a deposit of $50 and agreed to sign a formal lease. After the lease was presented, plaintiff refused to sign it, claiming defendant did not make certain repairs agreed to. He sues to recover his deposit. Defendant resists the suit, claiming plaintiff failed to live up to his contract, to defendant\u2019s damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-21\">The trial justice\u2019s finding in favor of the defendant on the facts is supported by the evidence and should not be disturbed. He, however, erred in granting judgment to defendant for $47.50. The nature of the deposit was conceded by both counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-22\">\u201cThat the plaintiff deposited the sum of $50 * * * as security on the lease. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>It was therefore only a deposit as security for any damage defendant suffered by reason of plaintiff\u2019s failure to carry out his agreement, and defendant was not entitled to retain it as a penalty.

The only evidence in the record of defendant\u2019s damage is fhe payment by defendant to the broker of $22.50 commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Judgment reversed, without costs of the appeal to either party, and judgment ordered for the plaintiff for $27.50 and appropriate costs in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
