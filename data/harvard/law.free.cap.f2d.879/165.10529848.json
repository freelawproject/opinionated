SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">The Bywater Neighborhood Association (\u201cBywater\u201d) seeks the removal of two structures it considers inconsistent with the character of its neighborhood, a national historic district. The two structures are a 200-foot television microwave tower, owned and built by Crescent City Communications Company, Inc. (\u201cCrescent City\u201d), and a satellite earth station, owned and built by Notel Inc. (\u201cNotel\u201d), a firm related to Crescent City. The Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d), together with local authorities, is the regulatory body with authority to issue licenses for the operation of both facilities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The FCC has already issued a license for the' satellite earth facility, now constructed and operational. However, it has \u201cdeferred\u201d action on the operating license for the television transmitter, although the tower itself has been built under the \u201cone-step\u201d licensing procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">The gravamen of Bywater\u2019s complaint is that the FCC failed to adhere to the dictates of the National Historic Preservation Act (\u201cNHPA\u201d) and to its own regulations, which require it to consult with the NHPA Advisory Council with regard to the potential effect the structures might have upon the Bywater National Historic District. Bywater contends that the FCC\u2019s failure in this regard was, in part, the result of Crescent City and Notel\u2019s having withheld important facts concerning the area in which they were to build. Bywater brought this suit against the FCC, Crescent City, and Notel under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Declaratory Judgment Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the National. Historic Preservation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the Mandamus and Venue Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court dismissed the suit for want of subject-matter jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Bywater correctly observes that the NHPA expressly permits private suits outside the APA review process; it points to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 470w-4, which provides that attorneys\u2019 fees, expert witness fees, and other costs may be awarded.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Vieux Carre Property Owners, Residents &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Brown, </em>875 F.2d 453, 457-58 (5th Cir.1989), we held that section 470w-4 does in fact create a private right of action that can be brought by any interested person, but only against the agency, since the NHPA, by its terms, can be violated only by an agency.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Bywater seeks to compel the FCC\u2019s compliance with the following NHPA provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4N\">[T]he head of any Federal ... agency having authority to license any undertaking shall, ... prior to the issuance of any license, ... take into account the effect of the undertaking on any district, site, building, structure, or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register. The head of any such Federal agency shall afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment with regard to such undertaking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-18\">16 U.S.C. \u00a7 470f.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-19\">Here, however, it is the FCC which Bywater accuses of neglecting its NHPA duties, and in suits against that agency, special rules apply. Those rules are found in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which vest <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction over appeals from the FCC\u2019s final orders in the respective circuit courts of appeals<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and, in the case of licensing decisions, in the District of Columbia Circuit alone.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has declared that \u201c[ljitigants may not evade these provisions by requesting the District Court to enjoin action that is the outcome of the agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>order.\u201d <em>FCC v. ITT World Communications, Inc., </em>466 U.S. 463, 468, 104 S.Ct. 1936, 1939, 80 L.Ed.2d 480 (1984) (citing <em>Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, </em>400 U.S. 62, 69, 91 S.Ct. 203, 208, 27 L.Ed.2d 203 (1970)). Yet that is precisely the purpose of Bywater\u2019s suit. The association\u2019s plea before this court is that we \u201cmaintain District Court jurisdiction over both facilities so that, in the event that the FCC denies and/or revokes permits for their operation, their removal from the Historic District can be assured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In <em>ITT World Communications, </em>ITT brought its claim against the FCC under the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> arguing that the court of appeals was an inadequate forum because the record had not been fully developed. The Court, rejecting that argument, observed that the court of appeals could remedy any deficiencies in the record with a remand to the agency. 466 U.S. at 469. Hence, the Court declared, the APA was not a proper vehicle for circumventing the special statutory review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">That is not the last word for this case, however, since the private right of action arising under the NHPA might be an alternative basis for Bywater\u2019s suit in district court. Thus, some tension exists between section 470w-4, as construed in <em>Vieux Carre, </em>and the specific statutory provisions governing appeals of FCC decisions. We resolve that tension in favor of Congress\u2019s specific and obvious intent to restrict to the circuit courts any appeals from rulings of the FCC. Though we have construed section 470w-4 to create a private right of action that may be brought in \u201cany U.S. District Court,\u201d <em>Vieux Carre, </em>875 F.2d at 458, we find no intent in the legislative history of that section to override the special provisions concerning the FCC.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We follow the lead of the court in <em>City of Rochester v. Bond, </em>603 F.2d 927, 931 (D.C.Cir.1979), in recognizing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">Congress, acting within its constitutional powers, may freely choose the court in which judicial review may occur.... If ... there exists a special statutory review procedure, it is ordinarily supposed that Congress intended that procedure to be the exclusive means of obtaining judicial review in those cases to which it applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">Indeed, any doubts we might have about Congress\u2019s intent in these matters is resolved in the APA, which states, \u201cThe form of proceeding for judicial review is the special statutory review proceeding relevant to the subject matter in a court specified by statute.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">For similar reasons, we must also reject the Mandamus and Venue Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act as independent predicates for district court jurisdiction in this case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Aside from our adher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>ence to the general principle that Congress\u2019s exclusive and specific review procedure should be followed, we observe that the Mandamus and Venue Act also fails to confer jurisdiction in that \u201cit is an extraordinary remedy that is not available when review by other means is possible.\u201d <em>Telecommunications Research &amp; Action Center v. FCC, </em>750 F.2d 70, 78 (D.C.Cir.1984) (citing <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 2124, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976)). Likewise, where Congress has created a specific mode of judicial review of administrative orders, declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 is not available to those who have not pursued that remedy. <em>See American President Lines, Ltd. v. Federal Maritime Bd., </em>235 F.2d 18 (D.C.Cir.1956). Our courts \u201crecognized early in the development of administrative agencies that coordination between traditional judicial machinery and these agencies was necessary if consistent and coherent policy were to emerge.\u201d <em>Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n, </em>400 U.S. at 68, 91 S.Ct. at 208 (citing <em>Texas &amp; Pac. Ry. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., </em>204 U.S. 426, 27 S.Ct. 350, 51 L.Ed. 553 (1907)).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AxC\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"A7p\">For specified litigants appealing FCC orders, courts have interpreted 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b) to allow venue only in the District of Columbia Circuit. <em>See FCC v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys., </em>311 U.S. 132, 136, 61 S.Ct. 152, 153, 85 L.Ed. 87 (1940); <em>Campos v. FCC, </em>650 F.2d 890, 892 (7th Cir.1981). Bywater\u2019s complaint falls within category (6) of section 402(b), which provides that appeals may be taken before the District of Columbia Circuit \u201c[b]y any other person who is aggrieved or whose interests are adversely affected by any order of the Commission granting or denying any application described in paragraphs (1H4) of this subsection.\u201d In Bywater\u2019s prayer to this court, it admits that it would be \u201cpremature,\u201d because Bywater has not yet exhausted its administrative remedies, for this court or the district court <em>a quo </em>to act until the FCC has issued an order with respect to Crescent City\u2019s application and a final order, after entertaining Bywater\u2019s petition to revoke, with respect to Notel\u2019s license. Instead, Bywater asks that we \u201cmaintain jurisdiction\u201d until these events have occurred. But if and when those events occur, Bywater\u2019s complaint will fall squarely within section 402(b)(6), and venue will lie only in the District of Columbia Circuit. Hence, any order from our court requiring the district court to \u201cpreserve\u201d jurisdiction pending issuance of the FCC\u2019s final orders would be futile. The district court therefore properly dismissed Bywa-ter\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahr\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"A3H\">The district court correctly determined that it was without jurisdiction to hear this complaint against the FCC. When the FCC\u2019s final orders have been issued, Bywa-ter must follow the path Congress has laid out for judicial review of those decisions. We note that our ruling should in no way be read as a comment on the merits of Bywater\u2019s claims against the FCC.</p>\n<p id=\"A56\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-11\">.The FCC explains that it also requires a license for the <em>construction </em>of certain types of facilities. However, for both facilities at issue here, \"streamlined\" application processes were available: Notel was able to submit one application for both the construction and operation of the satellite earth station. For the television microwave tower, Crescent City took advantage of an available \u201cone-step\u201d process under which there is no requirement that the applicant receive a construction permit, although the applicant cannot operate the facility without a license. Applicants that, like Crescent City, use this procedure take the risk that the license will be denied and the structure thereby will become useless for transmitting purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-17\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b246-18\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201. <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\">. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 470 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b247-8\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\">.

If no special statutory review proceeding is applicable, the action for judicial review may be brought against the United States, the agency by its official title, or the appropriate officer.

Nothing precludes Bywater from obtaining immediate remedies from the District of Columbia Circuit. <em>See Tennessee Dep\u2019t of Employment Sec. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>Secretary of Labor, </em>801 F.2d 170, 175 n. 8 (6th Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"A_h\">.
