An alien who files a \u201cnon-frivolous application for asylum\u201d is entitled to employment authorization while the asylum application is pending. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.l2(c)(8). The INS found Lo-zano\u2019s application frivolous, relying upon standards set out in a 1987 memorandum authored by INS Associate Commissioner Richard Norton.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-6\">Lozano then filed suit in federal district court for the Northern District of Texas, seeking a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order. The INS contended that Lozano had introduced new evidence before the court which the INS had not yet considered, and sought a remand. The remand was granted, and after considering the new evidence, the INS decided that Lozano\u2019s application had become non-frivolous. The suit was dismissed as moot, Lozano having received the relief he was seeking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-7\">Lozano and Hallman sought $12,000 in attorneys fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). The district court denied them fees on two grounds. First, the district court found that Lozano and Hall-man could have received the relief they requested without judicial process had they submitted the new evidence to the INS with Lozano\u2019s original application. For this reason the district court concluded that Lozano and Hallman were not prevailing parties for purposes of the EAJA. <em>See Iranian Students Ass\u2019n v. Sawyer, </em>639 F.2d 1160, 1163-64 (5th Cir.1981) (to have prevailing party status for purposes of attorneys fees statute, party must show a causal connection between the lawsuit and relief received) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 case). Second, the district court found that the INS\u2019s position was \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d so that no attorneys fees award could be imposed. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-9\">The parties dispute whether the district court applied the correct standard for determining whether the litigation \u201ccaused\u201d a settlement, and also dispute the proper interpretation of the Norton memorandum. We find it unnecessary to resolve either of these issues, for we find that the INS\u2019s position was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d under the law, regardless of whether the agency\u2019s interpretation of the Norton memorandum correctly specifies the meaning of \u201cfrivolous\u201d for purposes of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.l2(c)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-11\">Lozano\u2019s original application sought asylum largely on the ground that his village in El Salvador had been the target of a government bombing raid, and that his village had been selected for the attack because the government suspected that the village\u2019s inhabitants were sympathetic to the anti-government guerillas. The INS found this application frivolous. The district court, to deny attorneys fees, need not have found that the application was indeed frivolous; the court need only have determined that the government was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d in thinking it so. <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 2550, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988). On review, we apply an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>108 S.Ct. at 2546-49. Both the underlying government conduct giving rise to the lawsuit and the government\u2019s conduct of the lawsuit are to be assessed in determining whether the government conduct was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B). <em>See also S.E.C. v. Fox, </em>855 F.2d 247, 250-52 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-14\">We have noted that Congress, when it passed the statute governing asylum applications, \u201cdid not intend to confer eligibility for asylum on all persons who suffer harm from civil disturbances \u2014 conditions that necessarily have political implications.\u201d <em>Campos-Guardado v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 285, 290 (5th Cir.1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>826, 108 S.Ct. 92, 98 L.Ed.2d 53 (1987). We went on to say that when an alien seeks refuge from political persecution, the \u201cissue reduces to whether the political implications underlying an alien\u2019s fear of harm rise to the level of \u2018political opinion\u2019 within the meaning of the statute or whether those conditions constitute the type of civil strife outside the intended reach of the statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-4\">Here the INS deemed Lozano\u2019s petition frivolous because, after in-depth questioning by the INS, he had not been able to specify any of five recognized grounds for persecution \u2014 race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a social group \u2014 and because Lozano had not shown unusual circumstances that would suggest he was in danger of persecution despite his inability to identify a basis for it. The INS found no evidence to suggest anything other than that the bombing raid upon Lozano\u2019s village was a battlefield tactic designed to eliminate a source of security and support available to guerillas in a war zone. In other words, the INS saw no evidence to suggest that the raid was conducted to eliminate particular persons viewed unfavorably by the government. The INS called the bombing \u201ctragic,\u201d but concluded it did not provide any non-frivolous ground for asylum. Because asylum is not available to every victim of civil strife, but is restricted to those persecuted for particular reasons, we find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the INS was substantially justified in regarding Lozano\u2019s original application as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">In the district court, Lozano intro: duced testimony that soldiers had entered the village after the bombing raid in an effort to wipe out all survivors. The INS contended that this was new evidence it had not heard before, and the district court so found. We find no basis for Lozano\u2019s contention on appeal that the record lacked any evidence to support the INS\u2019s characterization of this testimony as new. The district court\u2019s finding with respect to newness of the evidence is factual, and we do not believe it clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">On remand, the INS determined that the new evidence established \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d even if it did not identify any particular statutory basis that would make Lozano\u2019s claim of persecution cognizable. The INS apparently concluded that the follow-up raid indicated that the government might have a persecutorial animus against the particular individuals within the village. Again, the INS\u2019s change in position finds support in the reasoning of <em>Campos-Guar-dado, </em>and, again, we find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the INS\u2019s changes in response to the new evidence were \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-8\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the government\u2019s position was \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d and so that no attorneys fees should be awarded. The decision of the district court is therefore in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
