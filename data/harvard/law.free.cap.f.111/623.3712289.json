The question of fault depended upon which of these two sailing vessels was under the obligation to keep out of the way of the other. Under article 17, International Rules for Preventing Collisions at Sea, Aug. 19, 1890 (1 Supp. Rev. St. 781), and Proclamation of the President, Dec. 31, 1896 (29 Stat. 885), their respective rights and duties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>depended upon which was closehauled and which was sailing free, and the finding of that fact depended upon the direction of wind, as to which there was irreconcilable conflict of testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\">The -libelant\u2019s vessel was so injured that she sank \u2018in about 40 minutes, but her crew were all rescued by the claimant\u2019s vessel, and at the hearing the masters and crews of both vessels were examined, and testified in the presence of the court, as did also the independent witnesses, whose testimony tended to establish the direction of the wind.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The experienced district judge before whom the case was tried, as \u25a0 appears from the opinion filed by him, gave it even more than his usual careful attention, and in his opinion examines and discusses the testimony and the pivotal facts and the surrounding circumstances with painstaking analysis. 103 Fed. 886. He comments upon the impression made by the witnesses in respect to intelligence and apparent truthfulness, and upon their opportunities of knowing the facts they undertake to state. He finds in the result that the libelant failed to establish the facts which would cast the fault of the collision upon the claimant; and, further, he finds affirmatively that the preponderance of credible testimony and the inherent probabilities to be deduced from the angle at which the vessels collided, and the nature of the blow and its consequences, lead to the conclusion that the claimant\u2019s vessel was closehauled on the starboard tack, and that the libelant\u2019s vessel was either running free or was closehauled on the port tack,- in either of which cases the obligation rested upon the libelant\u2019s vessel to keep out of the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">We have -gone over the record with care, and, notwithstanding the very able and closely reasoned argument and briefs of the learned counsel for the appellant, we are satisfied that the conclusions of the district judge are well founded. The argument of the appellant\u2019s counsel, based upon the probable course and location of the claimant\u2019s vessel at points on her voyage from New York along the coast, may, perhaps, raise a doubt as to some of her master\u2019s testimony, but is not sufficient to overcome the many probative facts and circumstances immediately connected with the collision, upon which the district judge rightly, as we think, based his conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The case involves solely findings of fact, and it would serve no useful purpose to discuss the testimony, which is clearly and fairly set out in the opinion filed in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">\u25a0 The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
