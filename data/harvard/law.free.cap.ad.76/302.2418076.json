To that end all evidence before the board upon which it acted and which was material to the determination of those questions should be returned. But no statements made to the board, either in executive or open session, as to the financial ability of the promoters to build the road or as to the <em>bona fides </em>of the enterprise, can have any relation to or bearing upon either the question of public convenience or the question of the necessity for the road. Those are entirely different questions, and for their determination the board could not properly consider any evidence, statements or information as to the financial condition or good faith of the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The fact that the board has made a standing rule relating to applicants for a certificate of this character requiring them to make proof before it of the <em>bona fides </em>of the enterprise and of the financial ability of the projectors to build the road, cannot alter or affect the question. The rule may be a proper one to aid the board in the discharge of a public duty, yet under the law the only questions for it to pass upon are the questions of public convenience and necessity, and in order to review under this writ the correctness of its determination it is not essential that it should be required to make return of matters which are entirely foreign to those questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Sasjes DETERMINED IN THE SECOND DEPARTMENT IN THE APPELLATE DIVISION, l|0mmlxer, 1902.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
