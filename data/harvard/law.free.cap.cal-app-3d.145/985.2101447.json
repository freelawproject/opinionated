J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANH\">Defendant appeals following conviction after jury trial of attempting to prevent a witness from testifying by means of threat (Pen. Code, \u00a7 136.1). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Defendant and two others were engaged in a preliminary hearing on 16 felonies, mainly robberies and burglaries. When Alvin Scott, who had turned state\u2019s evidence, finished his testimony, he was directed to a jury room. Scott was standing in the hall doorway of this room when, the proceedings having been adjourned for the day, defendant Ford and his codefendants exited the courtroom and were being escorted down the hall by the bailiffs, away from Scott, toward the elevator. Ford turned and looked at Scott and yelled, \u201cYou punk mother fucker, we\u2019ll get you, you\u2019ve got kids.\u201d Defendant was 50 to 60 feet from Scott when he made the threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">The bailiff who was escorting the defendants to the elevator, the sheriff\u2019s detective who was the investigating officer and who had just testified, and an officer in a room off the hall on an unrelated matter, all heard the defendant yell. There was no testimony that any one else was in that hallway other than the defendants, the bailiffs and Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Scott, who had returned from out of state to testify at the preliminary hearing, had a child living in Fresno County. Scott had known the defendant for over six years and, as a result of defendant\u2019s statement, felt threatened and feared defendant\u2019s relatives might try to carry out defendant\u2019s threat. Some of defendant\u2019s relatives were at the preliminary hearing when Scott testified. Scott did eventually testify at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>II. Should Defendant\u2019s 995 Motion Have Been Granted Because of His Lack of Notice of the Charges Against Him?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">III. Was the Amendment to the Information Improper?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">IV. Was Defendant\u2019s Conviction Supported by Sufficient Evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Defendant contends the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict. There is no merit to this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">The test on appeal is not whether the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt but whether the evidence could persuade <em>any </em>reasonable jury to have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 576 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738].): \u201c[T]he court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014 that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (At p. 578.) Furthermore, to reverse a conviction for insufficiency of the evidence it must \u201c \u2018clearly appear that upon no hypothesis whatever is there substantial evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Frederick G. </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 353, 363 [157 Cal.Rptr. 769].)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">The uncontradicted testimony of Scott and the three sheriff\u201d s officers establish that defendant made the threat to Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">Defendant claims the information charges him with preventing Scott from testifying in the municipal court proceedings. Since Scott did in fact testify in municipal court, defendant asserts he cannot be guilty of preventing testimony which was actually given.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">Defendant\u2019s contention has been considered and rejected in <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 511, 513, footnote 3 [148 Cal.Rptr. 52]: \u201cThat [the witness] had been called and [testified in municipal court on the day preceding the threat], does not, as [defendant] contends, compel the conclusion that she was not going to be called as a witness or that she had been excused as a witness. Thus [defendant\u2019s] argument that she \u2018could not be \u201cpersuaded or dissuaded\u201d from doing what she had already done\u2019 is based upon the false premise that she was not a potential future witness.\u201d Similarly, in this case, Scott also was a potential future witness. There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>no indication on the record that he was excused from giving further testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Defendant\u2019s main thrust goes to the temporal nature of the threat. Defendant claims the threat was made in retaliation for the testimony Scott gave at the preliminary hearing and was not made to prevent Scott from further testifying. Defendant bases this interpretation on the fact that at no time did he say \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you in court again,\u201d or any other such statement. In his reply brief, defendant asserts his \u201clanguage could only be understood to mean that he was making these statements against the witness for the witness\u2019 prior activities of turning him in and testifying at the preliminary examination. There is nothing in the plain meaning of the words to indicate that anything further was intended.\u201d The words \u201cYou punk mother fucker, we\u2019ll get you, you\u2019ve got kids,\u201d have more than a plain meaning, as do all words. These words also carry with them an inherent baggage of connotation which plainly suggests to the auditor, \u201cYou are in trouble for testifying so do not let it happen again or things will only get worse.\u201d The jury could interpret defendant\u2019s remarks to Scott as a warning or threat not to testify in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">V. Should the Trial Court Have Instructed That Threatening a Witness Is a Specific Intent Crime?</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">The jury was instructed on general intent. There was no request for an instruction on specific intent, but defendant argues that the court had a <em>sua sponte </em>duty to so instruct. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">The terms \u201cspecific intent\u201d and \u201cgeneral intent\u201d are difficult to define and apply as pointed out in <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 857, 860 [122 Cal.Rptr. 872, 537 P.2d 1232]. In <em>Daniels, </em>the court emphasized \u201can important temporal difference\u201d between the two terms and observed: \u201c \u2018When the definition of a crime consists of only the description of a particular act, without reference to intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence, we ask whether the defendant intended to do the proscribed act. This intention is [general intent]. When the definition refers to a defendant\u2019s intent to do some further act or achieve some additional consequence, the crime is deemed to be one of specific intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">Penal Code section 136.1, subdivision (c)(1), proscribes one from (among other things) using a threat of violence in an attempt to dissuade a witness from testifying. Unless the actions or statements are meant to achieve the consequence of affecting a potential witness\u2019 testimony, no crime has been committed. The statement, \u201cYou punk mother fucker, we\u2019ll get you, you\u2019ve got kids,\u201d can be interpreted as a simple angry statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>of impending revenge: \u201cYou did this to me and you will pay for it. \u201d If this is the proper interpretation, the crime was not committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">On the other hand, the proper interpretation could be: \u201cYou did this to me and if you do it again you will pay. You better not testify in the future or we\u2019ll get your kids.\u201d If the jury found this interpretation, defendant has violated the section. Thus, in the words of <em>Daniels, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 857, \u201cthe definition refers to a defendant\u2019s intent to . . . achieve some additional consequence,\u201d and is therefore a specific intent crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Once the crime has been committed, it makes no difference whether the witness does or does not testify. In this respect it is like a charge of bribery. The various forms of bribery require specific intent. (See 2 CALJIC (4th ed. 1979) appen. D, pp. 352-354.) The crime of bribery is complete when the defendant makes the offer with a corrupt intent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brigham </em>(1945) 72 Cal.App.2d 1, 6, 7 [163 Cal.Rptr. 891].)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Likewise, it is analogous to solicitation to commit murder. Such crime requires specific intent and is complete when the solicitation is made. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bottger </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 974, 981 [191 Cal.Rptr. 408].)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">The failure to instruct on specific intent was error. The error mandates reversal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wickersham </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 307 [185 Cal.Rptr. 436, 650 P.2d 311].) The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">Woolpert, J., and Martin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 19, 1983.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b874-11\">See footnote 1, <em>ante, </em>as to parts II and III.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b874-12\">See footnote 1, <em>ante, </em>as to parts II and III.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
