Carroll (\"Carroll\") appeals from the motion court's denial of his Rule 29.15 motion seeking post-conviction relief. A jury found Carroll guilty of multiple felonies after he robbed and sodomized Victim during a home invasion. Carroll presents three points on appeal. Point One contends that the motion court erred in denying Carroll's request on remand to reappoint post-conviction counsel and permit amendment of his Rule 29.15 motion. Point Two asserts that the motion court clearly erred in rejecting Carroll's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim because defense counsel failed to impeach Victim with Victim's medical records. Point Three challenges the sufficiency of the motion court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and find no error of law. No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum opinion for their information only, setting forth the facts and reasons for this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in accordance with Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
