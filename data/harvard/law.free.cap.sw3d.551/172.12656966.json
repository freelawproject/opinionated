We conclude that the phrase \"prohibited from marrying\" is composed of common words, such that a person of ordinary intelligence would be put on fair notice of what conduct violates the statute. The language \"prohibited from marrying\" is not vague as applied to Senn because, as a person of ordinary intelligence, he knew that he was forbidden or enjoined from marrying his biological daughter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

NO JURY INSTRUCTION ON BIGAMY IS REQUIRED HERE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In his fourth issue, Senn argues that the trial court reversibly erred by failing to include in the jury charge any instructions on bigamy or a reference to section 25.01. Senn argues that even if we hold under his first issue that section 22.011(f) does not require proof of bigamous conduct, the jury instructions still contain reversible error because the jury instructions authorized the jury to find in the affirmative on the special issue if it found that Senn could not marry Brenda on any basis, not just his existing marital status. Specifically, Senn argues that the jury could have concluded that Senn could not marry Brenda because he was her father instead of because he was currently married to another and that this possibility negates the finding of bigamous conduct that Senn contends is required to trigger enhancement under section 22.011(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Senn's arguments under his fourth issue attempt to rephrase arguments that we have addressed above under his first and second issues. Because we have held that proof of bigamy was not required in this case and because we have held that the section 22.011(f) is not vague as applied to Senn, the trial court was not required to include an instruction on bigamy or section 25.01, nor was it required to instruct the jury that it could find in the affirmative on the special issue only if it found that Senn was currently married to another.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Feagins v.
