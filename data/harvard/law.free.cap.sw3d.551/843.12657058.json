Alvarez, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On January 12, 2017, Appellant Ernest Villarreal was convicted by a Bexar County jury of two counts of aggravated sexual assault and five counts of indecency with a child. The trial court subsequently assessed punishment at forty-years' confinement in the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and a fine in the amount of $2,000.00 on each count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In July of 2013, Villarreal moved in with his niece Jennifer, her boyfriend Ernest, and her four children. Villarreal slept in a bedroom with his niece's three daughters. Villarreal slept on the bottom bunk, two of his nieces slept on the top bunk, and one niece slept on the couch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   P.G., who was ten-years-old at the time, testified that on a few occasions she fell asleep on the bottom bunk after watching a movie. P.G. testified that, on three occasions, Villarreal laid behind P.G. and pulled her waist towards him. He then pulled down her pajama shorts and underwear, and touched \"her butt.\" P.G. further testified that Villarreal touched her first on the outside and then inside her anus with what \"[a]t first, it felt like a finger. And then it changed.... it felt bigger.\" Additionally, P.G. described how after Villarreal was inside her anus, he would \"rub\" on her by grabbing her legs towards him and rub on her thighs while her pants and his pants were down. P.G. stated that this, or something similar, occurred about three times over the period of a few days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the girl's bunkbed was moved to a different room, and Villarreal was in his own room, P.G. broke down and told Ernest \"one night that [P.G. and Villarreal] were lying in bed and [Villarreal] had\n   pulled her panties down.\" Ernest testified that he stopped P.G. because he \"lost [his] mind after that.\" Ernest took the children to his mother's house, told his mom what P.G. said, and called Jennifer, P.G.'s mother. Ernest asked Jennifer to come home quickly \"because something really bad happened to [P.G.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, both parties agree the alleged incidents occurred on three different days. The jury was charged, and found Villarreal guilty on each of the following counts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Count I: Aggravated Sexual Assault of a Child\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Count II: Aggravated Sexual Assault of a Child\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Count III: Indecency with a Child by Sexual Contact\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Count IV: Indecency with a Child by Sexual Contact\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Count V: Indecency with a Child by Sexual Contact\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Count VI: Indecency with a Child by Sexual Contact\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Count VII: Indecency with a Child by Sexual Contact\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The State concedes the evidence only supports six counts in the indictment; and, that this court should reform the judgment to enter a judgment of acquittal as to count VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Villarreal does not contest the sufficiency of the State's evidence on counts one and two, the aggravated sexual assault charges. Villarreal also does not contest the sufficiency of the State's evidence to support count III, indecency with a child. Therefore, the only questions before this court are whether the indecency with a child charges, alleged in counts IV, V, and VI, are subsumed in aggravated sexual assault and indecency charges, alleged in counts I, II, and III, and thus barred by double jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We turn first to Villarreal's contention that the indecency charges alleged in counts IV, V, and VI are subsumed in counts I, II, and III and thus barred by double jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    DOUBLE JEOPARDY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Additionally, in accordance with the parties' agreement that count VII is barred by double jeopardy, we reverse count VII of the trial court's judgment. We therefore reform the trial court's judgment and enter an acquittal on counts IV, V, VI, and VII. We affirm the guilty verdicts on counts I, II, and III of the trial court's charge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    TEXAS PENAL CODE SECTION 21.11(a)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In count III, all parties agree Villarreal was charged and convicted of indecency with a child pursuant to section 21.11(a)(1) of the Texas Penal Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.
