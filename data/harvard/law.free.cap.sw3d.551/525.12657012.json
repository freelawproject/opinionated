BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Movant was charged with nine sex offenses involving two victims (Counts I-IX). The indictment alleges Counts I, II, and III (two counts of first-degree statutory sodomy and one count of incest, respectively) were all committed by Movant on or between April 21, 2000 and December 31, 2001. In all three counts, Movant was alleged to have had deviate sexual intercourse with J.K. by engaging in hand-to-genital contact; Count I alleged Movant touched J.K.'s genitals with his hand, Count II alleged Movant put J.K.'s hand on Movant's penis, and Count III alleged Movant placed his hand on J.K.'s genitals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Movant was also charged with Counts IV-IX (one count of first-degree statutory sodomy, four counts of first-degree child molestation, and one count of incest, respectively). Those six counts pertained to Movant's alleged sexual contact with victim J.J.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Movant's Guilty Plea and Sentencing Hearings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 6, 2013, Movant appeared with plea counsel (\"Counsel\") to enter guilty pleas to Counts I-IX without any plea bargain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Movant stated he believed it was in his best interest to plead guilty to all of the offenses, he had sufficient time to speak with Counsel, and he had no complaints as to how Counsel handled his case. Further, Movant told the court he understood his constitutional right to a trial and he would be giving up that right and corresponding rights by pleading guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The prosecutor then explained if Movant's case had gone to trial, the evidence would have shown the following. For Counts I, II, and III relating to victim J.K., the charged conduct occurred between April 21, 2000 and December 31, 2001, J.K. was approximately eight years old during that timeframe, and the charged conduct constituted deviate sexual intercourse. The prosecutor explained the State would have proven that during the aforementioned timeframe: Movant touched J.K.'s genitals with his hand (the act of first-degree statutory sodomy charged in Count I); Movant put J.K's hand on Movant's penis (the act of first-degree statutory sodomy charged in Count\n   II); and Movant placed his hand on J.K.'s genitals, at a time when Movant knew J.K. was his stepchild by virtue of a marriage creating the relationship (the act of incest charged in Count III). The prosecutor also explained the State would have proven each of the specific types of alleged sexual contact underlying Counts IV-IX pertaining to victim J.J. Finally, the prosecutor further stated J.K. told the police Movant touched her in the sexual manner alleged in Counts I-III, and J.J. told a professional at the Children's Advocacy Center that Movant touched her in the sexual manner alleged in Counts IV-IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Movant stated he did not disagree with anything the prosecutor said, and that the prosecutor did not say anything that was not true or leave anything out. Movant then admitted he committed the conduct set forth by the prosecutor and stated he was \"pleading guilty because [he] did those things[.]\" Movant also stated he wanted to plead guilty and nobody was making him do it. Then, Movant acknowledged he faced up to life imprisonment for the first-degree statutory sodomy charges in Counts I, II, and IV, up to four years of imprisonment for the incest charges in Counts III and IX, and up to fifteen years of imprisonment for the first-degree child molestation charges in Counts V-VIII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Based on the foregoing information and discussion, the court found there was a factual basis for Movant's guilty pleas to Counts I-IX, accepted the pleas, and found Movant made the pleas voluntarily and knowingly. The court ordered a sentencing assessment report and continued the matter for sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Movant's sentencing hearing took place on December 19, 2013. The court entered a judgment finding Movant guilty of Counts I-IX and sentencing him to a total of nineteen years of imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Movant's Rule 24.035 Motion, the Evidentiary Hearing, and the Motion Court's Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Movant subsequently filed a pro se Rule 24.035 motion for post-conviction relief. The motion court did not appoint post-conviction counsel. However, an attorney from the Missouri State Public Defender's office (\"post-conviction counsel\") entered an appearance on behalf of Movant on December 10, 2014. The transcript of Movant's guilty plea and sentencing hearing was filed with the motion court on October 3, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Post-conviction counsel timely filed an amended motion for post-conviction relief on January 21, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging Movant was denied his right to effective assistance of\n   counsel. Specifically, Movant asserted Counsel was ineffective for failing to properly advise Movant that the hand-to-genital contact charged in Counts I-III did not fall within the applicable statutory definitions of \"deviate sexual intercourse\" for the entire time period alleged in those charges, and as a result, he was entitled to have his guilty pleas to Counts I-IX and his sentences for those counts vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The motion court granted Movant an evidentiary hearing regarding Movant's claim. Movant testified via a deposition admitted into evidence during the evidentiary hearing, and Counsel testified at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Thereafter, the motion court granted in part and denied in part Movant's Rule 24.035 motion. The motion court's judgment granted Movant some post-conviction relief with respect to Counts I and II (the two counts of first-degree statutory sodomy involving victim J.K.); specifically, the court modified the underlying judgment to find Movant guilty of the lesser-included offenses of first-degree child molestation, vacated the sentences for Counts I and II, and ordered resentencing as to those two counts. The motion court's judgment denied Movant post-conviction relief in all other respects. Before resentencing occurred on Counts I and II, Movant filed this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We initially note this case involves a unique procedural posture because Movant filed his appeal before resentencing occurred on Counts I and II.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Movant raises one point on appeal, asserting the motion court's judgment was clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In both counts, Movant was alleged to have had deviate sexual intercourse with J.K. by engaging in hand-to-genital contact; Count I alleged Movant touched J.K.'s genitals with his hand, and Count II alleged Movant put J.K.'s hand on Movant's penis.

The crux of Movant's claim is that at the time of his guilty pleas, he was unaware the factual allegations contained in Counts I-II of the indictment would have been insufficient to support a conviction for the first-degree statutory sodomy offenses charged therein within the preceding time period. Movant further contended that as a result of Counsel's ineffectiveness, he was entitled to have his guilty pleas and sentences for all nine of his offenses vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The motion court's judgment granted Movant some relief on his claim with respect to Counts I and II, finding the appropriate\n   remedy was to modify the underlying judgment to find Movant guilty of the lesser-included offenses of first-degree child molestation, vacate the sentences for Counts I and II, and order resentencing as to those two counts.

The State also concedes \"[t]he motion court apparently was mistaken in [finding] that the facts to which [Movant] admitted constituted incest throughout the relevant time period.\" Based upon our discussion in the previous subsection, we agree with the State's concessions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Moreover, Movant was entitled to some relief on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim pertaining to Count III, because Movant demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that Counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and as a result, Movant was prejudiced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12133833\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/501/531/#p534\">\n    501 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   534-35 ;\n   <em>\n    Neal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7117973\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/379/209/#p215\">\n    379 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   214-15 ; Rule 24.035(i). With respect to Counsel's performance, Counsel testified he did not advise Movant the alleged hand-to-genital contact in Count III of the indictment could not constitute deviate sexual intercourse or incest for the charged timeframe. The motion court found Counsel's testimony to be credible, and we defer to this determination.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12376283\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/516/447/#p450\">\n    516 S.W.3d at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Movant adequately demonstrated Counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Movant also sufficiently established he was prejudiced, i.e., that but for Counsel's unreasonable conduct, there was a reasonable probability the result of the guilty plea proceeding would have been different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12133833\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/501/531/#p534\">\n    501 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   535 ;\n   <em>\n    Neal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7117973\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/379/209/#p215\">\n    379 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   215-16 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 687, 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Counsel testified that had he known Movant's alleged hand-to-genital contact did not constitute deviate sexual intercourse or incest for the charged timeframe, he would not have advised Movant to plead guilty to Count III. The State even concedes, \"[a]s for Count III, incest, it admittedly appears unlikely that [Movant] would have pleaded guilty if his conduct did not constitute incest or any lesser-included offense to that charge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In sum, the facts Movant admitted to at the plea hearing with respect to Count III do not establish the commission of the crime of incest, and Movant established Counsel was ineffective for failing to properly advise him as to Count III. Accordingly, the motion court clearly erred in failing to give Movant any post-conviction relief with respect to Count III.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Snow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6865042\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/461/25/#p29\">\n    461 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   31-32 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12133833\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/501/531/#p534\">\n    501 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   534-35 ;\n   <em>\n    Neal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7117973\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/379/209/#p215\">\n    379 S.W.3d at 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, as discussed in detail with respect to Movant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim pertaining to Counts I and II, Movant did not meet his burden to show he would not have pled guilty to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of his offenses but for any ineffectiveness on the part of Counsel, and the motion court found Movant's claim in this regard was not credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Based on the foregoing, and because there is no lesser-included offense of incest, we hold Movant is entitled to have his guilty plea and sentence for Count III only vacated and set aside.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Snow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6865042\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/461/25/#p29\">\n    461 S.W.3d at 31-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (granting a movant similar relief where the facts he admitted to at the plea hearing did not establish the crime with which he was charged);\n   <em>\n    Cason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11588955\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/987/357/#p358\">\n    987 S.W.2d at 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[a] person cannot be convicted of a crime with which the person was not charged\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   it is a lesser-included offense of a charged offense\") (emphasis in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Parkhurst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9993049\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/845/31/#p35\">\n    845 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   35 and citing section 556.046 RSMo 2000 ). In sum, Movant's point on appeal is granted to the extent he claims the motion court clearly erred in failing to grant him any relief for Count III, but Movant's point is denied to the extent he\n   contends he is entitled to have his guilty pleas and sentences for all of his offenses vacated as a result of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim pertaining to Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

We reverse the portion of the motion court's judgment denying Movant post-conviction relief with respect to Count III, and we remand with instructions for the motion court to vacate and set aside Movant's guilty plea and sentence as to that count only and to resentence Movant as to Counts I and II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Gary M.

For purposes of this appeal, the only difference between the two versions is the age of the victim; section 566.067.1 RSMo Supp. 1995 made it a crime to subject a person less than twelve years of age to sexual contact, whereas section 566.067.1 RSMo Supp. 2001 made it a crime to subject a person less than fourteen years of age to sexual contact.
