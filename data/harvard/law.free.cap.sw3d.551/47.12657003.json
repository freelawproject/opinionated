She challenges the trial court's findings on timesharing with the parties' minor son and a portion of its classification and division of marital and nonmarital assets. Following a careful review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Jeanette and Sam married in 2008 and separated in 2014. A son was born of the union. Sam filed for divorce in September 2014. After an extensive period of discovery and motion practice, the matter came on for final hearing on March 21, 2016. The trial court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law and decree of dissolution of marriage on May 12, 2016. The decree granted the parties joint custody of their son with a \"2-2-3\" visitation schedule,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   designated neither party as primary residential parent, restored the parties their nonmarital assets, and divided the marital estate. Dissatisfied with the division of assets and the timeshare arrangement, Jeanette moved to alter, amend or vacate the decree pursuant to CR 2 59.05. The trial court denied the motion, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As an initial matter, Sam has moved to dismiss the appeal for Jeanette's failure to appeal from a final order. Jeanette did not respond. CR 73.03(1) provides that \"[t]he notice of appeal shall ... identify the judgment, order or part thereof appealed from.\" Sam contends Jeanette's notice of appeal references only the order denying her CR 59.05 motion, an inherently interlocutory and non-appealable order. He argues dismissal is required, citing\n   <em>\n    Hoffman v.

First, she contends the visitation schedule is improper and should be set aside. Second, she argues the trial court erred in classifying three parcels of real estate as nonmarital. Next, Jeanette challenges the trial court's division of personal property as being inequitable. Finally, she argues the trial court erred in awarding Sam a nonmarital interest in another parcel of real estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In a dissolution action, the well-settled standard of review of a trial court's legal findings is\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.

Dissension is not uncommon, emotions are heightened, and the proffering of conflicting evidence is a virtual certainty.

With these standards in mind, we address each allegation of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For her first allegation, Jeanette asserts the trial court's decision to set a \"2-2-3\" timesharing schedule and not designate a primary residential parent should be set aside. However, apart from reciting the law applicable to setting aside a trial court's factual findings and reviewing a trial court's custody determination, nothing of substance is advanced in support of her contention. We will not search the record to construct Jeanette's argument for her, nor will this Court undergo a fishing expedition to find support for underdeveloped arguments. \"Even when briefs have been filed, a reviewing court will generally confine itself to errors pointed out in the briefs and will not search the record for errors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Milby v. Mears\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9948050\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/580/724/#p727\">\n    580 S.W.2d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 727 (Ky. App. 1979). While she is obviously dissatisfied with the trial court's decision, threadbare recitals of the elements of a legal theory, supported by mere conclusory statements, form an insufficient basis upon which this Court can grant relief. Nevertheless, substantial evidence was presented before the trial court that equal timesharing would be in the minor child's best interest. We discern no clear error or abuse of discretion in the trial court's timesharing order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, Jeanette argues the trial court erred in determining three parcels of real estate were nonmarital. She appears to contend an agreement existed between the parties to \"gift\" each other an interest in what was otherwise nonmarital property, thereby converting those assets to marital in nature. As before, her argument consists mainly of a recitation of theories of law\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and little else. Further, a review of the record reveals she challenged the classification of only one of the parcels before the trial court and not on the same grounds as argued before this Court. This is fatal to her argument on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   It has long been this Court's view that specific grounds not raised before the trial court, but raised for the first time on appeal will not support a favorable ruling on appeal. Most simply put, \"[a] new theory of error cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Springer v.

No further discussion is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Next, Jeanette argues the trial court's division of marital personal property was not equitable. She believes Sam was awarded a disproportionate share of the marital estate. This argument is afflicted by the same flaws as her previous ones as it again consists of little more than citation to general authority and bald assertions of fact and unsupported beliefs. While it appears the bulk of her challenge is centered on the failure of the trial court's order to include dollar amounts for each individual asset, she cites no authority requiring a trial court to do so. Further, the rationale underlying her challenge was never presented or argued to the trial court. These flaws are again fatal to her argument. No further discussion is necessary or warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, Jeanette argues the trial court erred in awarding Sam a $45,000 nonmarital interest in a farm purchased after the date of marriage. The trial court concluded Sam utilized nonmarital funds to remodel and rehabilitate the residence located on the farm and awarded him the amount of the increase in value of the real estate due to the work as his nonmarital share. Jeanette contends marital funds were used to renovate the residence and Sam's attempted tracing of the repayment of those funds to a nonmarital source was unclear and incomplete. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Tracing\" is defined as \"[t]he process of tracking property's ownership or characteristics from the time of its origin to the present.\" In the context of tracing nonmarital property, \"[w]hen the original property claimed to be nonmarital is no longer owned, the nonmarital claimant must trace the previously owned property into a presently owned specific asset.\" The concept of tracing is judicially created and arises from KRS 403.190(3) 's presumption that all property acquired after the marriage is marital property unless shown to come within one of KRS 403.190(2) 's exceptions. A party claiming that property, or an interest therein, acquired during the marriage is nonmarital bears the burden of proof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Sexton v.

It is also undisputed that shortly thereafter Sam received an inheritance following the death of his mother and those funds were deposited into the marital account. Sam testified as to the source of funds and introduced bank records detailing the transactions, revealing the purpose of depositing the inheritance money was to reimburse the marital account for the cost of renovations. He further testified he was aware the inheritance was impending at the time the work was completed, and the improvements would not have been accomplished without the inheritance. We are directed to no evidence contradicting Sam's testimony. Contrary to Jeanette's assertion, nothing about the evidence was incomplete or unclear. The evidence presented was sufficient to require a finding the increase in the value of the farm was due to Sam's expenditure of nonmarital funds and should be assigned to him. Thus, we discern no error in the trial court's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Pulaski Circuit Court, Family Division, is AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   ALL CONCUR.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    According to the decree,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    parent \"one\" shall enjoy Monday and Tuesday of week one and the weekend beginning Friday until Sunday; and parent \"two\" shall enjoy Wednesday and Thursday of week one. Beginning week two parent \"two\" shall receive Monday and Tuesday and the weekend beginning Friday until Sunday and parent \"one\" shall receive Wednesday and Thursday of week two and so forth.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    In contravention of CR 76.28(4)(c), the primary legal theory advanced is based on an unpublished Opinion of this Court. Citations to other unpublished Opinions are utilized to bolster her discussion. Jeanette did not attach a copy of the unpublished decisions to her brief as required by the rule, but more importantly, a published Opinion adequately addresses the narrow issue presented, thereby rendering use of the unpublished decisions wholly improper. We have disregarded the offending portions of her brief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
