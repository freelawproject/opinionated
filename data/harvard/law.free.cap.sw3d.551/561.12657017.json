The first piece of property, designated S21, is situated on the lakeside of Lake Shore Drive and has been developed as a private residence. The S21 property has four docks registered with the Lake Lotawana Home Association (\"the Association\") and title was held by the Dean Family Lotawana Trust (\"DFL Trust\"). The second property, designated SA3B, is located across the street from the S21 property and had not been developed at the time of sale. Title to the SA3B property was held by the Lester M. Dean, Sr. Self-Declaration of Trust (\"LD Trust\"). Both the DFL Trust and the LD Trust share two individuals as trustees: Lorelei M. Dean and Melanie A. Dean (collectively the \"joint trustees\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 2, 2014, the joint trustees entered into a contract (\"the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract\") with the Costello Family Trust (\"CF Trust\") who agreed to purchase the S21 property for $875,000.00 with a closing date \"on or before 10/31/2014.\" The October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract included several additional provisions, two of which are of considerable importance to this case. First, the contract stated that \"[u]pon any improvement to [SA3B], the far west dock on S21 (covered dock) would go to [SA3B].\" Second, the contract noted that \"[t]his offer is for the 1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   tier commonly known as S21, Buyer and Seller agree to complete sales agreement for 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   tier lot ( [SA3B] ) prior to closing of this contract for purchase within one year of closing of this contract for S21 in the amount of $100,000.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract was subject to the terms of the Association's deed restrictions which include the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [n]o sale, contract to sell, or conveyance of the real estate herein described shall be made or consummated without first giving at least fifteen (15) days written notice to [the Association], and to the owners of the two side adjoining lots, of the proposed sale price and terms thereof; and thereupon the [Association] and/or either of the side adjoining lot owners shall have the first and prior right, option, and privilege during said period of fifteen (15) days to buy said real estate at the same price and upon the same terms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In accordance with this provision, notice of sale property waivers were sent to the neighbors adjoining the S21 property on October 3, 2014. These were followed by a second set of notice of sale property waivers that were sent to the owners of the land adjoining SA3B on October 8, 2014. This second set of waivers provided notice for a proposed sale of lot SA3B to the CF Trust and stated the terms of the sale as follows: \"\n   <strong>\n    Sale Price:\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    100,000\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <strong>\n    Closing Date:\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    prior to 10/31/15\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <strong>\n    Terms:\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    as is, cash vacant lot.\n   </em>\n   \" (bold text computer generated, italicized text handwritten).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Richard and Hallie Pals (collectively the \"Pals\") owned one of the lots adjoining the SA3B property. On October 10, 2014, (two days after receiving notice of the proposed sale) the Pals, through their representative, provided verbal notice that they intended to exercise their option to purchase lot SA3B. On October 12, 2014, the joint trustees and the CF Trust executed an amendment to the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract that eliminated the term relating to the transfer of the covered dock and declared that all four dock sites belonged exclusively to S21.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The existence of this amendment was never communicated to the Pals or any other neighbors entitled to notice under the Association's deed restrictions. On October 14, 2014, the Pals formally reduced to writing the previously communicated\n   decision to exercise their option to purchase the SA3B property by signing the appropriate section of the notice of sale property waiver sent to them on October 8\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , which they then delivered to the joint trustees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 16, 2014, (two days after the Pals formally exercised their option to purchase the SA3B property on the terms of the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract) two trustees of the LD Trust entered into a new contract (\"the October 16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   contract\") to sell lot SA3B to the CF Trust for $100,000.00 with closing to occur on or before October 30, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This new contract specifically stated the property came with no dock rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 30, 2015, the day the sale of lot SA3B was scheduled to close, the Pals were presented with an amendment that the joint trustees purported to relate back to the October 16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   contract. The joint trustees intended to use this amendment, in combination with the October 16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   contract itself, as the terms for closing on the sale. Among other things, this amendment proposed to replace the CF Trust with the Pals as the purchasers of lot SA3B and introduced a new term that stated \"[a]ll parties understand the same terms of the original contract apply including no dock as stated in the contract and sold as is.\" In addition, the Pals were also presented with a new notice of sale property waiver for the SA3B property, which was identical to the one sent to them on October 8, 2014, except for the Pals being listed as the purchasers instead of the CF Trust. The Pals protested both of these documents claiming that they intended to close on the terms of the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract. However, after being told that representatives of the CF Trust were present and prepared to close on the terms of the October 16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   contract if the Pals failed to sign the documents presented (and would file suit should the Pals seek to prevent them from closing), the Pals signed both the amendment and the new notice of sale property waiver. The Pals maintain that they were prevented from making any changes to the two documents and claim they signed under duress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 15, 2015, a little over two weeks before the sale of SA3B closed, the CF Trust filed a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, against the DFL Trust, the joint trustees, Stephen W. Crider, and the Estate of Lester Dean, who was by then deceased, seeking a declaration that lot SA3B retained no rights to any of the four docks associated with the S21 property that by then had been purchased by the CF Trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   A month later, on November 12, the Pals filed an action against the trustee of the CF Trust, the joint trustees, and the Association seeking a judgment declaring that the rights to the covered dock referenced in the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   Contract be transferred to them upon improvements being made to lot SA3B and an order for specific performance of the same.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   These two cases were consolidated in February of 2016. The CF trust subsequently filed an amended petition naming as defendants the DFL Trust, the LD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Trust, the joint trustees, and Stephen W. Crider. This was followed by a third amended petition in which they added the Pals as a defendant and introduced a claim against them for abuse of process. The CF Trust and the joint trustees thereafter moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the CF Trust on August 31, 2017. After the Pals noted that two judgments were necessary based on the cases having been consolidated, the trial court entered separate judgments in favor of the CF Trust and the joint trustees. In both cases, the trial court certified the issue as ripe for appeal under Rule 74.01.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Pals now appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe Run Resources Corp. v.

Specifically, the Pals maintain that the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract established an enforceable agreement for the sale of the SA3B property, which included a provision regarding the transfer of dock rights upon improvements being made to the property. They further assert that, because the Association's deed restrictions provided adjacent neighbors of a parcel being sold an option to purchase \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     upon the same terms\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" as the proposed buyer, their exercise of that option entitled them to enforce the dock transfer provision of the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract regardless of whether the sellers included that provision in the notice of sale property waiver sent on October 8\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   . Finally, the Pals argue that neither the purported amendment of October 12, 2014, nor the documents they signed on October 30, 2015, invalidated their claim as the former was an ineffective attempt to modify an\n   irrevocable option to purchase the property and the latter were signed under duress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Validity of the October 2, 2014 Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Before we can address the effects of the amendment made on October 12\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   or the language of the two notice of sale property waivers and the October 30, 2015, amendment signed by the Pals, we must first determine whether the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract did indeed constitute an agreement for the sale of the SA3B property. Missouri law clearly states that the essential elements of any contract are offer, acceptance, and bargained for consideration.\n   <em>\n    Baker v. Bristol Care, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6896330\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/450/770/#p774\">\n    450 S.W.3d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 774 (Mo.banc 2014).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, there is no real dispute that the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract met all three of these requirements. Indeed, the sale of the S21 property was consummated on the terms of this contract and none of the parties now argue that the contract was unenforceable with regard to the sale of that property. Further, an examination of the specific language from the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract regarding the sale of the SA3B property-which was clearly offered and accepted by the parties-demonstrates the existence of consideration for that particular transaction in the form of a promise to pay $100,000.00. Therefore, the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract meets all the requirements necessary to constitute a contract for sale of the SA3B property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   While the CF Trust appears to concede that the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract contained an enforceable agreement for the sale of the SA3B property, the joint trustees attempt to avoid this conclusion by arguing that the \"seller\" listed in the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract had no legal authority to contract for the sale of SA3B because the two parcels belonged to separate trusts. However, this argument is unpersuasive given that the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract was not executed in the name of either trust, but rather, by the joint trustees themselves. Moreover, because the joint trustees were trustees of both the DFL Trust and the LD Trust, they possessed the legal capacity to enter into contracts for the sale of both parcels.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. Koenen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093443,7093461\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/396/429/\">\n    396 S.W.3d 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 435 (Mo. App. W.D. 2013) (\"The trustee is the legal owner of the trust property, in which the beneficiaries have equitable ownership.\");\n   <em>\n    US Bank, N.A. v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839153\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/470/17/\">\n    470 S.W.3d 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 28 n. 4 (Mo. App. W.D. 2015) (stating same). In addition, the joint trustees' position is contradicted by their own actions regarding the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract. First, it was the joint trustees who drafted the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract, including the language they now claim to be unenforceable. Thus, their argument relies on establishing the invalidity of their own work. Second, the joint trustees were the ones responsible for sending the notice of sale property waivers to the owners of the lots neighboring the SA3B property on October 8, 2014. There is no reason that the joint trustees would have taken such action unless they believed at the time that the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract did form a valid agreement for the sale of the SA3B property, thus triggering their notice obligation under the Association's deed restrictions. That belief was correct. Consequently, we reject the argument raised by the joint trustees and find that the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract created an enforceable agreement for the sale of the SA3B property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Effect of the October 12, 2014, Amendment\n   </strong>\n   Having determined that the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract created an enforceable agreement for the sale of the SA3B property, we now turn to the question of whether the amendment executed on October 12, 2014, was effective in removing the provision concerning the transfer of dock rights. The Pals argue that the amendment was of no legal consequence because it was made within the fifteen-day window established in the Association's deed restrictions during which they possessed an option to purchase the property under the terms of the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract that was not subject to withdrawal or modification. The CF Trust contends that the Pals misunderstand the difference between an option contract (which prohibits withdrawal or modification) and a right of first refusal (which would permit the modification of the contract) and that the Pals only possessed the latter with regard to the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract. While the CF Trust is correct that an option contract and a right of first refusal are distinct legal concepts, their argument that the Pals did not possess an option to purchase the SA3B property is erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As this court laid out in\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

The joint trustees and the CF Trust both take the position that, because the notice of sale property waiver did not include the transfer of dock rights provision contained in the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract and instead stated that the lot was being sold \"as is vacant lot,\" the Pals were constructively on notice that they were not receiving any dock rights. We disagree. First, with regard to the term \"as is,\" both statute and case law make clear that this language constitutes nothing more than an express denial of all warranties that might otherwise attach to the sale of a parcel of real estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Missouri Revised Statutes \u00a7 400.2-316(3)(a) (\"[U]nless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like 'as is', 'with all faults' or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty.\");\n   <em>\n    Harper v.

Similarly, the description of the property as a \"vacant lot\" tells nothing regarding whether there does or does not exist conditional terms relating to the transfer of dock rights and is instead simply a description of the property. Consequently, the use of these two terms in the notice of sale property waiver has no relevance to whether the Pals' agreement to purchase lot SA3B included dock rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The only remaining argument raised by the joint trustees and the CF Trust regarding the October 8\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   notice of sale property waiver is the claim that, because the waiver did not include the transfer of dock rights provision and the Pals readily concede that they had not\n   seen the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract before exercising their option on October 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , the Pals should not be permitted to enforce that term. In essence, the joint trustees and the CF Trust argue that the failure of the joint trustees to provide the Pals with a notice of sale property waiver that included all terms listed in the underlying contract (which itself is a contravention of the requirements of the Association's deed restrictions) limited the Pals to enforcing only those terms that they were actually aware of at the time they accepted the offer. However, the Association's deed restrictions clearly state that the Pals option to purchase the SA3B property was to be \"upon the same terms\" as those agreed to by the CF Trust and joint trustees. That provision of the Association's deed restrictions was quoted in the notice of sale property waiver itself, meaning that at the time the Pals exercised their option to purchase, they were on notice that they would be purchasing \"upon the same terms\" as the proposed sale to the CF Trust. Moreover, as we have previously established, the \"terms\" for sale of the SA3B property to the CF Trust were those found in the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract, which was the only contract in existence at the time the notice of sale property waivers were sent out.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the facts of this case, by exercising their option to purchase on October 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , the Pals established a bilateral contract with the sellers on the same terms as those contained in the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract, which included the transfer of dock rights provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riddle, ex rel.

For this reason, the failure of the notice of sale property waiver sent on October 8, 2014, to include all the terms contained in the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract does not bar the Pals from enforcing those terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The Pals, by contrast, assert that these documents were signed under duress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Pals note that they made clear through an email sent by their legal representative on October 30, 2015, to the other parties that it was their intent to close on the terms contained in the original October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract. An attorney for the CF Trust responded that if the Pals failed to complete the closing on that day under the new terms, the CF Trust was prepared to do so and threatened legal action against the Pals for \"Abuse of Process and/or Tortious Interference with a Contract\" in the event they acted to prevent the CF Trust from closing on the property in their stead. The Pals assert that they were prohibited from noting on the relevant documents that they were closing on the purchase pursuant to the October 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   contract terms or that they were signing the new notice of sale property waiver and contract amendment under protest. They argue that, based on the attendant circumstances, their execution at the closing was under duress and the documents were rendered voidable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"It is the most basic principle of contract law that parties are bound by the terms of the contracts they sign and courts will enforce contracts according to their plain meaning, unless induced by fraud, duress, or undue influence.\"\n   <em>\n    LaRue v.

As such, we find that the Pals argument concerning duress was preserved.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Although the trial court's judgment makes brief reference to the notice of sale property waiver and contract amendment executed on October 30, 2015, those documents do not appear to have been part of the trial court's substantive analysis and were simply referenced to provide confirmation to its conclusion that the transfer of dock rights was not a term of the agreement the Pals accepted when they exercised their option to purchase on October 14, 2014.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
