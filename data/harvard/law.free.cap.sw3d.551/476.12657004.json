Because the determination of whether Milner was abandoned determines which post-conviction motion should be reviewed and there was no record available for review of the motion court's determination, this Court reverses the motion court's judgment and remands the case with instructions for the motion court to make an independent inquiry to determine whether Milner was abandoned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Milner pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to register as a sex offender. The circuit court sentenced Milner to four years' imprisonment for each count to run consecutively. The circuit court suspended execution of Milner's sentence, and placed him on five years' probation. Subsequently, Milner's probation was revoked, his sentence was executed, and he was delivered to the department of corrections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Milner timely filed his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for post-conviction relief, pursuant to Rule 24.035, on April 11, 2016. Post-conviction relief counsel (hereinafter, \"Counsel\") was appointed that same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The transcript from Milner's guilty plea and sentencing hearing was filed May 24, 2016. Counsel filed a motion requesting an extension of time to file the amended motion for post-conviction relief; the motion court granted this motion. Milner's amended motion for post-conviction relief was due September 22, 2016. Rule 24.035(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   However, Counsel did not file an amended motion for post-conviction relief until November 2, 2016, raising additional claims other than those asserted in the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for post-conviction relief. Counsel requested the amended motion be filed out of time because she was unable to obtain records that were destroyed by Milner's plea counsel. Prior to the motion court ruling on Counsel's request to file out of time, the state filed a motion to dismiss Milner's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for post-conviction relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The motion court did not adjudicate Milner's amended motion and entered a judgment dismissing Milner's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   post-conviction motion without an evidentiary hearing. Milner appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Appellate review of judgments disposing of Rule 24.035 motions is limited to a determination of whether the motion court's findings and conclusions are clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    Hall v.
