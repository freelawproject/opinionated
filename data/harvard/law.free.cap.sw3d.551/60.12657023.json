Smith alleges that the State failed to present evidence that he used or threatened to use physical force prior to his arrest. Based on the Missouri Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Ajak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656075\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/543/43/\">\n    543 S.W.3d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2018), we find that law enforcement officers established \"control over [Smith's] movements\" when he was handcuffed, at which point his arrest was completed for purposes of section 575.150.1(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the evidence was insufficient to show that Smith's conduct prior to his arrest being effectuated involved\n   the use or threatened use of violence or physical force or that he attempted to flee from the officers, the judgment of the trial court is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following an investigation into a traffic incident, Huntsville Officer Nathan Howard and Trooper James Rowe of the Missouri State Highway Patrol went to Smith's home to arrest him for driving while suspended and leaving the scene of an accident. When they arrived, Smith was on his front porch. Officer Howard informed Smith that he was being placed under arrest and specified the underlying offenses. Smith was not cooperative, asking, \"What's the proof?\" and informing the officers that he was recording them. Smith was commanded to stand up, turn around, and place his hands behind his back. Instead, he stood up, removed his shirt, and threw a knife to the ground while yelling statements such as \"I'm not going to jail\" and extending his arms to the side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to Trooper Rowe, Smith presented \"passive resistance\" by failing to cooperate or obey the officers' commands and having an argumentative and agitated demeanor throughout the process. In response, Trooper Rowe applied pepper spray, which allowed the officers to gain control of Smith and apply handcuffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After being handcuffed, the officers began to escort Smith to Officer Howard's patrol vehicle. Smith purposely went limp and fell to the ground. After returning Smith to his feet and descending the porch stairs, Smith again purposely went limp but was caught by the officers. As the officers continued to walk him toward the patrol vehicle, Smith threw his body weight back and forth and wrapped his legs around Trooper Rowe's legs in an effort to trip the officer as he yelled about police brutality. As the officers attempted to place him in the patrol vehicle, Smith wrapped his legs around the door and pushed against it with his foot. Once placed inside the vehicle, Officer Howard held Smith down while Trooper Rowe went to the other side to latch the seatbelt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A jury found Smith guilty of misdemeanor resisting arrest under section 575.150.

Smith alleges that this occurred at the time he was handcuffed on the porch. The State counters that Smith was not under arrest until the officers were able to secure him within the physical limits of the patrol vehicle and that, even if the arrest was effectuated at the time that Smith was handcuffed, his conduct prior to that time was sufficient to establish a threat of violence or physical force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The evidence at trial showed that Smith was pepper sprayed by Trooper Rowe because of his uncooperative behavior, which allowed the officers to gain control of Smith's movements and apply handcuffs. The totality of the circumstances compels the finding that the arrest was completed and Smith was \"completely under the officers' control\" when he was handcuffed and surrounded by two officers.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656075\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/543/43/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656075\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/543/43/\">\n    at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that defendant was under arrest at the time that he was handcuffed, the officers had control of his movements, and he was informed that he was under arrest).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Having established that the arrest was completed at the time that Smith was handcuffed, we may only consider Smith's conduct up to that point in determining whether the State proffered sufficient evidence to support a conviction for resisting arrest. The evidence showed that during this time, Smith yelled at and took a step away from the officers, removed his shirt, held his arms out, and generally failed to comply with the officers' commands. Smith also removed a knife from his pants and threw it to the ground in a direction away from the officers. Smith did not run, touch either of the officers, or verbally threaten to harm the officers, and Trooper Rowe described Smith's conduct as \"passive resistance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Even when viewed in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, Smith's conduct prior to being handcuffed did not constitute the offense of resisting arrest. Section 575.150.1(1) requires that a person resist an arrest \"by using or threatening the use of violence or physical force or by fleeing from the officer.\" Smith's general refusal to comply with the officers' commands and uncooperative attitude is not sufficient to support a conviction for resisting arrest.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
