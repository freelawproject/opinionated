Upon entering a conditional plea to preserve the issue for appeal, Appellant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance, first degree, and carrying a concealed deadly weapon. The controlled substance and the weapon were found after a canine sniff search indicated the presence of drugs. We granted discretionary review to consider whether the initial traffic stop had been impermissibly prolonged to allow the canine search to proceed. For the reasons stated below, we reverse the Court of Appeals' decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Lexington Police Officer Roman Sorrell was following a vehicle in the very early hours of a December morning. He performed a registration check on the vehicle license number and discovered that the vehicle's registration had been cancelled because it had no liability insurance coverage. Sorrell initiated a traffic stop of the vehicle at 3:35 a.m. Appellant was driving the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At Sorrell's request, Appellant provided his driver's license. He told Sorrell that the car was not his and that he could not provide proof of insurance. Sorrell described Appellant as fully cooperative but abnormally nervous and sweating at the brow. Appellant was smoking a cigarette and blowing the smoke into the vehicle's interior. He kept looking toward the right side of the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sorrell took Appellant's driver's license back to his cruiser and began writing the traffic citation. He also spent about five minutes accessing a jail website and a police database to find out more information about Appellant. That inquiry disclosed that Appellant had been charged previously with trafficking in marijuana and carrying a concealed deadly weapon; it did not indicate whether Appellant had been convicted of these charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sorrell returned to Appellant's vehicle. He told Appellant that he knew about the prior charges. He asked if Appellant had drugs or weapons in the vehicle. Appellant said he did not. Sorrell asked for consent to search the vehicle, and Appellant declined. Sorrell acknowledged that at that point in the usual traffic stop, he would have given the driver a citation and let him leave. However, because Appellant seemed nervous, was sweating, blew his cigarette smoke into the vehicle instead of toward the officer, kept looking to the right side of the car, and had prior charges, Sorrell decided that he would detain Appellant further while he called for a canine unit to conduct a sniff search of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The canine handler, Officer Jones, arrived with the dog within a few minutes. After speaking to Sorrell and Appellant, Jones retrieved the dog and conducted a sniff search of the car. The dog alerted to indicate the presence of drugs on the driver's side of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sorrell and yet another officer who had arrived on the scene then searched Appellant's vehicle. In the glove compartment (not on the driver's side of the car as the dog indicated), they found a cigarette box containing cocaine and methylone, a controlled substance they thought was heroin. They also found a handgun under the driver's seat. Appellant was arrested at 4:20 a.m., some forty-five minutes after the initial stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellant was indicted on two counts of trafficking in a controlled substance (heroin\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and cocaine); receiving stolen property (the firearm); and carrying a concealed deadly weapon. He moved to suppress the incriminating evidence on the basis that he was detained by the sniff search beyond the time reasonably required to complete the traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the trial court denied the suppression motion, Appellant preserved his right to appeal by entering a conditional guilty plea to one count of possession of a controlled substance, first degree, cocaine, and carrying a concealed deadly weapon. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's denial of Appellant's motion to suppress. We granted discretionary review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   Court noted that officers may slightly extend the stop with \"certain negligibly burdensome precautions\" needed to assure their safety.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1616. No constitutional violation occurs because those precautionary measures are directly connected to the mission of the initial traffic stop. \"On-scene investigation into other crimes, however, detours from that mission.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court specifically noted that a dog sniff search to find drugs lacks a close connection to the legitimate purpose of the traffic stop; the sniff search \"is not fairly characterized as part of the officer's traffic mission.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1615.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In short, in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court issued a blunt rejection of the argument that a \"\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   \" extension of the time taken for the stop does not offend the Fourth Amendment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   As we said in\n   <em>\n    Caballes\n   </em>\n   and reiterate today, a traffic stop 'prolonged beyond' that point is 'unlawful.'

First, he argues that Sorrell's legitimate mission-issuing traffic citations for the vehicle registration and insurance violations-was impermissibly extended without good cause when Sorrell diverted his attention from writing the traffic citation and spent several minutes searching online databases for information pertaining to Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, Appellant contends that, even if Sorrell's time spent searching the online databases was part of his diligent pursuit of the traffic citation, deferring the traffic citation to call in the canine unit and waiting for the dog sniff unconstitutionally prolonged his detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We note at this point that\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   identifies as one of the routine tasks associated with a proper traffic stop a check for any outstanding warrants that may be pending against the driver.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1615 (citing\n   <em>\n    Caballes,\n   </em>\n   543 U.S. at 408,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Delaware v.

The officer did not clearly identify the \"jail website,\" but he admitted that it only provides a \"charge record.\" He said: \"\n   <em>\n    I don't have access to convictions.\n   </em>\n   \" He described the police database as \"AS-400\" and as containing more detailed information than the jail website, but he makes no reference to outstanding warrants. Significantly, the officer\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   says that he used these websites to see if Appellant was wanted on outstanding warrants, and the Commonwealth never argues that the officer spent any time at all checking for outstanding warrants. Nevertheless, we will indulge in the presumption that at least a portion of the officer's time spent on the online sites can be justified as a check for outstanding warrants, although the Commonwealth does not assert as much. Faced with a silent record, we can presume no more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court acknowledged that Sorrell's justification for delaying the traffic citation to search computer databases was \"certainly not overwhelming,\" but concluded that Appellant's nervousness and sweaty brow at 3:30 a.m. and \"blowing smoke in a rather strange way\" justified an extension of the stop to conduct the additional investigation on the computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Next, the trial court acknowledged that calling in a canine search was \"a little bit unusual when you get stopped for no license tag, no valid license tag, and just having no insurance.\" Nevertheless, the trial court concluded that the fact that Appellant was nervous, sweating, and blowing smoke in the car, and additionally had \"charges of carrying a concealed deadly weapon and marijuana,\" established reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify the prolonged detention of Appellant until the dog could arrive and complete his search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court of Appeals agreed, concluding that after seeing Appellant and getting his driver's license, Sorrell had reasonable and articulable suspicion to return to the cruiser and check for Appellant's name on computer databases because Appellant: 1) was nervous; 2) had sweat on his brow; 3) was blowing cigarette smoke toward the car's interior; and 4) was looking around and over his shoulder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Commonwealth agrees that Sorrell extended the traffic stop beyond the time necessary to resolve the traffic violation. The question is whether the officer had a reasonable articulable suspicion of other ongoing illegal activity when he prolonged the stop for the time needed to retrieve the dog and conduct the sniff search. We consider the totality of the circumstances to determine whether a particularized and objective basis existed for suspecting Appellant of illegal activity.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Strange,\n   </em>\n   the suspect stood late at night in a public area known for criminal activity near a public pay phone that had been occasionally used for drug transactions. As officers approached, he walked quickly to a van parked nearby. We rejected the notion that being present in a high crime area at night, near a pay phone, apparently opting to avoid police contact\n   suggested criminal activity. The fact is that many honest, decent, law-abiding citizens live in high-crime areas under similar circumstances and would behave the same way. We held that there was insufficient evidence to justify an investigatory stop and seizure. In\n   <em>\n    Sanders,\n   </em>\n   the suspect was a pedestrian out late in a neighborhood known for drug activity. She was seen following someone, and sometime later, she returned to the street walking in the opposite direction and she appeared nervous.

Unlike\n   <em>\n    Strange\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sanders,\n   </em>\n   each of the cited cases involved facts beyond the demeanor or behavior of the driver in the vehicle that allowed a rational inference to be made that the driver was engaging in criminal activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, Officer Sorrell articulated nothing about Appellant's behaviors, individually or collectively, to connect him to criminal behavior beyond what may be ordinarily expected of a driver stopped for a traffic violation. Heightened nervousness is common among drivers detained by a police officer for a traffic violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Wood,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7652586\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/106/942/#p948\">\n    106 F.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 948 (10th Cir. 1997). Sweating is a symptom of nervousness in some people. Sorrell saw no indication that Appellant was intoxicated or otherwise impaired. Moreover, he was fully cooperative and coherent. He made no \"furtive gestures\" to indicate he was trying to hide anything. The Commonwealth\n   hints that blowing smoke into the car's interior could have been an attempt to mask an incriminating odor. However, even the trial court was indifferent to the significance of that conduct. The trial court noted that perhaps Appellant was being \"courteous and not blowing smoke in the officer's face. Or was he trying to cover up the smell of marijuana?\n   <em>\n    Who knows\n   </em>\n   ?\" No marijuana or aromatic contraband was found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Simply put, Appellant's behavior during the traffic stop as articulated by the officer on the scene and the prior charge information obtained during the database search do not create a reasonable suspicion that Appellant was then and there engaged in illegal behavior beyond the apparently obvious traffic violations for which he was stopped. The dissent believes we have not considered some circumstances that might be factored into the reasonable suspicion calculation. We examined all the facts relied upon by the officer as the basis for his suspicion, as well as those cited by the trial court as meaningful. The fact that Appellant was permissibly driving someone else's uninsured car does nothing to raise suspicion that criminal activity was afoot or that Appellant was transporting illegal drugs, which was the object of the canine sniff search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The dissent misconstrues the principle that \"criminal history contributes powerfully to the reasonable suspicion calculus.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Santos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9021044\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/403/1120/#p1132\">\n    403 F.3d 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1132 (10th Cir. 2005). As noted above, the officer claimed only that Appellant had been previously\n   <em>\n    charged\n   </em>\n   with carrying a concealed weapon and trafficking in marijuana; he admitted he had no knowledge of any prior convictions. Mere charges do not constitute a \"criminal history\" upon which one might reasonably suspect future criminal behavior. Even the prosecutor at the suppression hearing, after mentioning Appellant's \"criminal history,\" immediately corrected himself and said that Appellant had a \"law enforcement history.\" The Commonwealth never claims that the officer acted upon knowledge of Appellant's criminal history because the record clearly shows he did not. If Appellant even had a criminal history, it was not part of the \"calculus\" used to determine reasonable suspicion in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We are satisfied that even with the additional information obtained from the online databases that Appellant had been previously charged with trafficking in marijuana and carrying a concealed deadly weapon, the officer had no reasonable suspicion to believe that Appellant was then and there engaged in criminal activity beyond the traffic offenses for which he was legitimately stopped. It follows that the dog sniff which followed was unreasonable and constitutionally impermissible. Evidence discovered during the subsequent canine search must be suppressed as the product of an unconstitutional seizure and should have been suppressed.\n   <em>\n    Segura v.

He has pleaded guilty and has already served out his prison sentence for these crimes. We render this opinion for the untold numbers of innocent Kentucky citizens who have had \"criminal charges\" and may become nervous and sweaty and look around when confronted by police at a traffic stop at night, and if smoking at the time, would reasonably direct the smoke away from the officer. They have the right to live their lives unfettered by police having no reasonable articulable suspicion to interfere.

The officer returned to the vehicle, obtained the passenger's driver's license and questioned him. The officer returned to his patrol car and ran a record's check on the passenger. Finally, the officer issued a written warning and returned all documents to the occupants. These record checks took approximately 30 minutes. Only at that point did the officer begin questioning about drugs.
