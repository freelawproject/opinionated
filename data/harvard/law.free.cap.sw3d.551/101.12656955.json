A jury found Holmes guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action. Holmes charges the motion court with error for denying his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims because trial counsel did not object when the trial court allowed the jury to view State's Exhibit 2 during deliberations and did not seek to have a sleeping juror removed from the jury panel and replaced with an alternate juror. Because Holmes did not establish the requisite prejudice by the jury's viewing of State's Exhibit 2 during deliberations, and because trial counsel exercised reasonable trial strategy in not seeking to remove the juror in question, we affirm the motion court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and find no error of law. No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum opinion for their information only, setting forth the facts and reasons for this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in accordance with Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
