We take Movant's points out of order for ease of analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Point 1-Informing the Jury Panel during Voir Dire that Movant had Prior Domestic Violence Convictions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Movant's first point argues \"[t]he motion court clearly erred in denying ... [Movant's] Rule 29.15 post-conviction motion claim that trial counsel were ineffective for informing the venire panel during voir dire that [Movant] had prior domestic assault convictions[.]\" Movant claims he demonstrated that counsels' voir dire on the topic of his prior convictions was not supported by any reasonable trial strategy, and there is a reasonable probability that but for counsels' ineffective assistance, Movant would have been acquitted on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During voir dire, trial counsel Callie Moench (\"Moench\") conducted voir dire for the defense. She talked to the venire panel about Movant's right to choose whether to testify, and said that Movant had not yet decided what he would do.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Moench later asked the following question of the panel:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   If knowing that [Movant] has two misdemeanor convictions for domestic assault, as well as one prior felony conviction for domestic assault, does knowing that make you-and nothing else-make you think he's more likely to be guilty right now?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I see one hand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Any other hands?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   So I'll rephrase that to be a little more clear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Does knowing that [Movant] has past domestic assault convictions make anyone think he's more likely-as it stands right now, not knowing any other evidence, it's more likely that he's guilty of these charges?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Okay. I see a whole lot of hands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The prosecutor then objected that the question did not call for a response that\n   would disqualify any jurors, because the jury could, technically, hold Movant's prior convictions against him \"in terms of his credibility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After extensive discussions with the court about whether the question as worded was designed to identify strikes for cause, Moench was permitted to rephrase the question as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Okay. We had kind of an abrupt break, and I'm going to go back to the topic we were talking about. So we were talking about [Movant's] past domestic assault convictions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   At the end of the trial, the Judge is going to instruct you that you have to consider all the evidence presented.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Knowing that [Movant] has past domestic assault convictions, is that going to prevent anyone from being able to consider all the evidence before coming to a decision? Are you going to be able to consider everything, not just his past convictions, before you come to a decision about his guilt?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   I see some heads nodding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Would anybody not be able to consider all the evidence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Juror No. 38? And, ma'am, I think we've spoken about this a bit.

MOENCH: Okay. Thank you. Anyone else; did I miss anyone? Anybody that would not be able to consider all the evidence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The record does not reflect any responses to the last question set forth above, and Moench moved on to another line of questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Co-counsel Stephanie Bullard (\"Bullard\") announced at the close of the State's case that Movant had chosen not to testify. Movant affirmed that decision under questioning by the court. After the court asked whether he understood that his attorneys could only offer advice and that the final decision on whether or not to testify was his to make, Movant had an off-the-record discussion with counsel. He did not testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Movant's amended motion alleged that Bullard and Moench were ineffective for informing the jury panel during voir dire that Movant had two prior misdemeanor convictions for domestic assault and a prior felony conviction for domestic assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Bullard and Moench both testified at the evidentiary hearing on the amended motion. Bullard testified that she had conversations with Movant prior to trial about whether he would testify at trial; that she did not know at the time voir dire was conducted whether or not Movant would testify; that Movant did not decide if he would testify until seconds before he announced that decision in open court; and, even during questioning from the trial court, Movant vacillated in his decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Bullard stated that if Movant had decided to testify, his prior convictions \"definitely would have come in[.]\" When asked if it was part of the trial strategy to voir dire for that possibility because they did not know if Movant would testify at that point, Bullard answered that she could not \"recall specifically.\" However, she added that for jury trials, that strategy was certainly something she and co-counsel discussed. She recalled from past trials that if she knew the defendant was going to testify, she would broach the topic of past convictions during voir dire. She concluded that asking about prior convictions during voir dire \"would have been something I would have done.\" Moench testified that she had performed the voir dire for the defense in consultation with Bullard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The motion court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   At the time of voir dire Movant's counsel was unsure whether he would testify or not. During the evidentiary hearing Ms. Bullard stated that given [sic] Movant repeatedly changed his mind on whether he would testify. Because the jury would hear Movant's convictions if he testified, Ms. Bullard believed they should be addressed on voir dire. Trial counsel exercised reasonable trial strategy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Referencing prior convictions during voir dire for the purpose of inoculating the jury to a defendant's criminal past or removing for cause members of the venire panel who indicate that they would hold those prior convictions against him at trial have long been accepted as reasonable trial strategy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Williams v. State\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386007\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/524/553/#p561\">\n    524 S.W.3d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 561, 563 (Mo. App. W.D. 2017) (collecting cases to support that proposition). Movant did not decide whether he would testify until pressed by the Court after the State rested, so counsel raised the issue during voir dire in the event Movant decided to testify. Indeed, the only juror who exhibited any predisposition on the issue was struck for cause and did not serve on the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Movant's arguments ask us to reweigh the evidence before the motion court. Movant testified he had always maintained he would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   testify at trial. The motion court obviously believed trial counsels' testimony to the contrary, and we may not second-guess that credibility determination.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Arata v. State\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373594\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/509/849/#p853\">\n    509 S.W.3d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 853 (Mo. App. S.D. 2017). Movant also argues that because Bullard stated that in the past she had conducted voir dire on prior convictions when she\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   the defendant would testify, and Bullard testified that she\n   <em>\n    did not know\n   </em>\n   whether Movant would testify, the motion court could not have found that Bullard conducted voir dire on past convictions in the event Movant testified. This attempt to cherry-pick portions of Bullard's testimony is misleading and violates our standard of review. On appeal, \"we view the record in the light most favorable to the motion court's judgment, accepting as true all evidence and inferences that support the judgment and disregarding evidence and inferences that are contrary to the judgment.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hardy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094797\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/387/394/#p399\">\n    387 S.W.3d at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Bullard was asked whether she might discuss prior convictions during voir dire when she was unsure if a defendant would testify. She responded \"that would have been something I would have done.\" Granting all reasonable inferences from the evidence in the motion court's favor, it was not clear error for the motion court to find counsel had employed a strategy of inoculating the jury to Movant's prior domestic assault convictions had he chosen to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Point 1 is denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Point 3-Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Movant's third point claims that the motion court clearly erred in denying Movant's claim that appellate counsel, Samuel Buffaloe (\"Buffaloe\"), was ineffective for failing to request that this Court reverse and remand his convictions for both Count 1 (second-degree domestic assault) and Count 3 (attempted victim tampering), rather than just Count 1, due to the trial\n   court's failure to submit self-defense with the verdict-directing instruction on Count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As relevant here,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [a] person commits the crime of \"victim tampering\" if, with purpose to do so, he ... attempts to prevent or dissuade any person who has been a victim of any crime ... from ... [c]ausing a complaint, indictment or information to be sought and prosecuted or assisting in the prosecution thereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00a7 575.270.2(2). \"[V]ictim tampering is a class C felony if the original charge is a felony. Otherwise, ... victim tampering is a class A misdemeanor.\" \u00a7 575.270.3. \"[T]he State must prove that the target of tampering was in fact the victim of a crime\" and that requirement applies even when the defendant has been charged with attempted victim tampering.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v.

App. W.D. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Movant was charged by an amended information with two counts that might have served, in \u00a7 575.270.3 terms, as the \"original charge\": Count 1 for domestic assault in the second degree for an incident that occurred on March 12, 2013, and Count 2 for domestic assault in the third degree for an incident that occurred on February 6, 2013. The amended information charging Count 3, attempted victim tampering, asserted that Movant had attempted to prevent Victim from assisting in the prosecution of \"domestic assault in the second-degree,\" just as the jury instructions later posited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Buffaloe asserted instructional error as to Count 1 in his direct appeal brief because the trial court failed to instruct the jury on self-defense, but Movant now claims that Buffaloe should have requested that, if that point was granted on appeal, the accompanying charge of attempted victim tampering should have been reversed. Movant argues that under the amended information and jury instructions at trial, his conviction for victim tampering as to second-degree domestic assault was contingent upon there being a victim of second-degree domestic assault, an issue which could no longer be determined by a jury upon the reversal of his conviction in Count 1. Movant goes on to argue that a reasonably competent appellate counsel under similar circumstances would have raised this issue, and that a reasonable probability exists that had appellate counsel requested and explained the need for that relief, Movant's conviction for attempted victim tampering, Count 3, also would have been reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In response, the State concedes that \"[b]ecause the charge of amended [sic] victim tampering was based on the charge of domestic assault in the second degree, the tampering charge should have been reversed when this Court reversed the assault charge due to instructional error.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State argues that Buffaloe should have requested that relief on direct appeal, but he failed to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree, but will proceed to review the motion court's findings and conclusions because \"[i]t is the existence of clear error, not the state's mere concession that it exists, which permits appellate relief.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v.

Here, unlike\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Dooley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the verdict director for attempted victim tampering was based\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on Movant's attempt to prevent Victim from assisting in the prosecution of second-degree domestic assault, not the third-degree domestic assault that Movant was also charged with, so Movant's conviction for third-degree domestic assault was not the type of \"underlying charge\" that the Court referenced in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Dooley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As to Buffaloe's performance, the motion court found, without further comment, that Buffaloe \"made a strategic decision not to include the claim.\" Appellate strategy, however, is still subject to the objective standard of reasonableness under the circumstances.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Baumruk v.

Nothing in the record reflects any reasonable basis for Buffaloe's decision not to request reversal of the attempted victim tampering conviction where Buffaloe had requested reversal of the second-degree domestic assault conviction. Buffaloe did not offer a basis,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor did the motion court, nor the State on appeal. Here, the claimed error was sufficiently serious that it created a reasonable probability that had it been raised, the outcome of the appeal would have been different. Buffaloe's failure to raise this issue under these circumstances was not a reasonable legal strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We find that the motion court clearly erred in denying Movant's claim for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.

Movant requests that we reverse his conviction for attempted victim tampering and remand for a new trial. Because Movant requests the same relief under this point as he did under point 3, extended discussion of this point is unnecessary.
