Even after recognizing that the evidence showed that the defendant and his fellow gang members acted in concert in killing the victims, the Court of Appeals nevertheless improperly held that absent proof of why the gang attacked and killed the victims, the evidence was insufficient to allow the jury to rationally conclude that the killings were a gang activity and that the defendant participated in the killings as a member of the gang.\n     </blockquote>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"4\">\n     <attorneys id=\"p-48\">\n      Although it is not directly at issue in the instant case, the statute also contains a statutory definition for \"combination.\" Tex.

We do note, however, that we agree with the State's arguments regarding the statutory language. Specifically, we agree that, because the statute already requires proof that the defendant was acting in his capacity or role as a member of a group of \"three or more persons having a common identifying sign or symbol or an identifiable leadership who continuously or regularly associate in the commission of criminal activities,\" it would not make logical sense to also require proof of a defendant's intent to establish, maintain, or participate as a member of a criminal street gang in addition to this requirement.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Tex.

We, therefore, hold that the evidence is sufficient to support appellant's convictions for engaging in organized criminal activity.

Background\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      In 2009, brothers Jesus and Jose Vargas were beaten, stabbed, and shot to death by a group of men outside the A &amp; M Bar in the Socorro area of El Paso. Appellant was a known member of the Barrio Aztecas street gang that is active in the El Paso-Juarez region, and he was known to frequent the A &amp; M Bar. The Vargas brothers were confirmed members of a rival gang, the Barrio Campestre Locos. Based on eyewitness reports, appellant and several other Barrio Azteca members became suspects in the offense. Because he fled to Mexico immediately following the offense, appellant was not arrested until 2012. After he was apprehended, appellant was charged in a three-count indictment with one count of capital murder and two counts of engaging in organized criminal activity, one for each Vargas brother's murder.\n      <footnotemark>\n       2\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      At trial, eyewitnesses testified that various individuals participated in the assault on the Vargas brothers and that appellant was the shooter. The State also presented testimony to establish that law enforcement had identified appellant as a member of the Barrio Aztecas as early as 2004; that several other individuals who participated in the assault on the Vargas brothers along with appellant were also Barrio Azteca members; that the A &amp; M Bar was a frequent \"hangout\" for Barrio Azteca members; that the Vargas brothers were members of a rival gang; that both gangs were involved in narcotics trafficking; and that the shooting of the Vargas brothers was consistent with Barrio Azteca activities against rival gang members. Upon hearing the evidence, the jury convicted appellant of all charges. Appellant was sentenced to a mandatory life sentence on the capital-murder charge, and he received two sixty-year sentences for the charges of engaging in organized criminal activity.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      On direct appeal, appellant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support any of his three convictions. Although it rejected his sufficiency complaint as to the capital murder charge, the court of appeals agreed with appellant's complaint that the evidence was insufficient to support his two convictions for engaging in organized criminal activity.\n      <em>\n       Zuniga v.

With respect to this matter, appellant maintains that the court of appeals correctly described the hypothetically correct jury charge here as requiring proof of three elements: (1) that appellant had the intent to establish, maintain, or participate, (2) as a member of a criminal street gang, and (3) that he committed the murders of the Vargas brothers.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Zuniga\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205121992\">\n       2016 WL 5121992\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , at *11-12 ; TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 71.02(a). The State in turn contends that the hypothetically correct jury charge would require only proof of the latter two elements-that appellant, while acting \"as a member of a criminal street gang,\" the Barrio Aztecas, committed the murders of the Vargas brothers. According to the State, by applying the rules of grammar and common usage to the statutory language, the \"intent to establish, maintain, or participate\" language pertains only to the \"in a combination or in the profits of a combination\" language that immediately follows that clause, but not to the \"as a member of a criminal street gang\" language that appears further down the sentence. In spite of this contention, the State also concedes that, even under its proposed interpretation of the statute, the \"as a member of a criminal street gang\" language would not permit conviction on a bare finding of the defendant's status as a gang member; rather, in order to prove that the defendant committed the predicate offense \"as a member of a criminal street gang,\" the statute would additionally require proof of a connection or nexus between the defendant's commission of the underlying offense and his gang membership.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-24\">\n      At the time that the court of appeals issued its decision in this case, the lower court did not have the benefit of our recent opinion in\n      <em>\n       Villa v.

We thus agree with the State's suggestion that the court of appeals erred by concluding that the statute's \"intent to establish, maintain, or participate\" language applies in a prosecution for engaging in organized criminal activity as a member of a criminal street gang. As a matter of grammar and logic, the statute's intent clause applies only to the phrase that immediately follows it-\"in a combination or in the profits of a combination\"-but not to the subsequent phrase, \"or as a member of a criminal street gang[.]\"\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      TEX.

Furthermore, we interpret the word \"as\" in the phrase \"as a member of a criminal street gang\" as requiring proof that the defendant was acting \"[i]n the role, capacity, or function of\" a gang member at the time of the offense.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      AMERICAN HERITAGE COLLEGE DICTIONARY 78 (3d ed. 1993) (defining the word \"as\").

Here, the basis for the court of appeals's reversal of appellant's convictions was its conclusion that no rational factfinder could have determined that he committed these offenses \"as a member of a criminal street gang,\" in the sense that the evidence failed to show that he committed these shootings due to his gang membership, as opposed to some other reason. After we summarize the evidence in this record in more detail, we will explain the basis for our conclusion that, viewing that evidence in the light most favorable to the verdicts, the jury was not irrational in concluding that appellant was acting in the role, capacity, or function of \"a member of a criminal street gang\" at the time that he committed the shootings of the Vargas brothers.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-30\">\n      Aide Samaniego was present in the bar on the night of the shootings and saw appellant talking to another person she knew, Jose Cordero. At around 11:30 p.m. or midnight, Samaniego saw Cordero and appellant get up from the table where they had been sitting and walk towards the bar's entrance, where they appeared to engage in a confrontation with some other individuals whom Samaniego did not know. Then they returned to the table. Later, at around 1:30 a.m., Samaniego went outside to smoke. While outside, she noticed three men walk inside the bar. Samaniego described these men as \"gangsters.\" A few minutes later, a group of men that included the three men who had just arrived, as well as appellant, Cordero, and a third person, Victor Gomez, exited the bar, and they walked towards the back of the bar to the parking area. A fight began. Samaniego walked over to see what was happening and, by the time she got there, there were ten or fifteen people kicking and punching two people who were on the ground. Someone yelled out, \"cops,\" and the men who had been fighting began to scatter. Samaniego reported that a few bystanders tried to get near the people on the ground to help them. Appellant and another person started to get into a car as if to leave, but while they were doing so, someone threw a bottle at the car, causing the windshield to shatter. Appellant then got out of his car, opened his trunk, and pulled out a gun. Samaniego saw appellant and the other person he was with begin walking back towards the fight scene. Samaniego ran away from the bar after that. Less than a\n     minute later, she heard two gunshots. Several days later, authorities contacted Samaniego. She identified appellant, Jose Cordero, and a third person, Victor Gomez, as the people in the group who had assaulted and murdered the victims.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-31\">\n      Cecilia Estrada arrived at the bar at around 10 or 11 p.m. When the fight broke out a little while after 1 a.m., Estrada ran outside to see what was happening. She saw five to seven men kicking and hitting two men who were lying facedown on the ground. She said appellant and Cordero were two of the men who were committing the assault. She recalled that someone threw a glass bottle at the person who was down on the ground. Estrada began to run away. After a moment, she heard two gunshots. When she looked back, she saw appellant holding a gun in his hand. Two days later, Estrada identified appellant and Cordero in photo lineups.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-32\">\n      Flor Reyes was working at the A &amp; M bar as a bartender and server on the night of the shooting. Earlier in the evening, before the fight broke out, Reyes saw appellant inside the bar with several unknown people. At one point, she heard appellant tell another person she knew, Sparky, that Sparky had to \"do his job.\" Sparky told appellant no. When the fight broke out, Reyes was inside the bar. Several people ran in to tell Reyes to call the police because someone outside had been shot. Reyes ran outside and saw the Vargas brothers. One was \"already on the floor facing down.\" At that point a \"young man\" was yelling to \"shoot at him some more\" or \"finish him off.\" Reyes recognized this person as Cordero. Reyes also recognized another person as being involved in the assault, Victor Gomez, whom she knew as \"Nacho.\" Reyes saw appellant along with three or four other men, waving their guns around and telling others not to get close or try to help. After a little while, some of the men from the group began to get in their cars to leave. Reyes tried to approach one of the brothers who was on the ground to help him. Appellant shoved Reyes out of the way. He then pulled his gun out of his waistband and shot the person in the head. According to Reyes, appellant then fired two more shots into the back, for a total of three shots. Appellant then walked away, got into a car, and drove off.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-33\">\n      Raul Reyes of the El Paso Sheriff's Office testified that, upon appellant's arrest for this offense, he had been classified as a member of a security-threat group, the Barrio Aztecas. Reyes testified that appellant's classification was imposed by a three-person panel at the jail that makes such determinations for the purpose of inmate safety. Reyes testified that appellant's classification was based on a multi-factor assessment, including the fact that he had been identified as a Barrio Azteca member by another gang member or informant, he had been arrested with other gang members, and he had been confirmed as a gang member by an outside law-enforcement agency. As a result of his being classified as a member of a security-threat group, appellant was placed in administrative segregation.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-34\">\n      Detective Jeffrey Gibson testified as a gang expert. In his opinion, the attack on the Vargas brothers was consistent with Barrio Azteca activities. The A &amp; M Bar was a known \"hang-out\" for Barrio Azteca members. The Barrio Aztecas are a \"very well organized\" criminal street gang that is involved in high-level narcotics trafficking and an array of other criminal activities. They claimed the entire El Paso region as their territory or \"turf\" and demanded that any other gangs selling narcotics in that region pay a \"cuota\" or fee to the Aztecas. If a person failed to pay the \"cuota,\" he would eventually be killed. Gibson testified that appellant had\n     been a confirmed member of the Barrio Aztecas since 2004, pursuant to the classification criteria in the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n      <footnotemark>\n       7\n      </footnotemark>\n      He stated that the other individuals identified as having been involved in the murders-Cordero, Gomez, and Jose Alarcon-were also all confirmed Barrio Azteca members. Gibson further testified that the Vargas brothers had been confirmed as members of the Barrio Campestre Locos, a street gang which was also involved in narcotics trafficking in that area and would have been required to pay fees to the Aztecas for the privilege of doing business.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-35\">\n      Detective Antonio Arias of the El Paso Sheriff's Department testified regarding the investigation that was conducted in this case. Among other matters, he testified that it was difficult to locate witnesses who were willing to cooperate because people \"made it clear\" that they were afraid of the Barrio Azteca gang. Detective Arias also testified that, through the investigation, law enforcement \"found out that Barrio Azteca gang members were hanging out\" at the A &amp; M Bar.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-36\">\n      The medical examiner Dr. Contin testified that each of the decedents had multiple wounds that were consistent with a group-style assault. Jesus Vargas had multiple contusions from impact with a fist or an object, multiple stab wounds, and a gunshot wound to the neck. His two front teeth had been knocked out, and he had been stabbed in the head with an icepick. Jose Vargas had blunt force injuries to the head, puncture wounds to the chest and neck, stab wounds to the back, and he had been shot in the back of the head.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-37\">\n      Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we conclude that a rational factfinder could reasonably have determined the following basic facts: (1) appellant was an established member of the Barrio Aztecas, a street gang involved in narcotics trafficking, among other illegal activities; (2) the murders took place at a location known to be frequented by Barrio Azteca members; (3) other known Barrio Azteca members participated in the assault on the Vargas brothers alongside and in cooperation with appellant; (4) the Vargas brothers were confirmed members of a rival gang that was also involved in illicit narcotics trafficking; (5) it would be consistent with Barrio Azteca activities for members to commit an assault against rival gang members who encroached upon their territory or failed to pay a fee; and (6) earlier in the evening, appellant told an individual at the bar, \"Sparky,\" that Sparky had to \"do his job,\" but Sparky declined. From these basic facts, the jury was free to draw the reasonable inference that the coordinated assault on the Vargas brothers by Barrio Azteca members was gang-related activity. Further, given the circumstances which show appellant's cooperation with other Barrio Azteca members in committing these assaults against rival gang members, it was not irrational or speculative for the jury to infer that appellant's commission of the shootings was pursuant to his role, capacity, or function as a member of the Barrio Aztecas. To the extent that the court of appeals determined that there was no evidence to support such a conclusion and that the jury's verdict was thus irrational, we reject that determination as being incompatible with the principles that a reviewing court must defer to the jury's weighing of the evidence and its drawing of reasonable inferences that are supported by facts.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Cary\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186052\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/507/750/#p757\">\n       507 S.W.3d at\n      </extracted-citation>\n      757 ;\n      <em>\n       Hooper\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8329935\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/214/9/#p16\">\n       214 S.W.3d at 16-17\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-38\">\n      Here, the flaw in the court of appeals's analysis was its implicit assumption that the record would have to provide direct evidence that appellant's motive for participating in the shootings was due to his gang membership, as opposed to some other reason independent of his gang membership.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Zuniga,\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205121992\">\n       2016 WL 5121992\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , at *13. Specifically, the court of appeals appears to have reasoned that, absent some affirmative evidence to show a gang-related dispute between the victims and the Barrio Aztecas that preceded the assaults, the evidence was insufficient to show that appellant murdered the victims pursuant to his membership in a criminal street gang.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205121992\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      As to this matter, we agree with the State's position that the court of appeals's analysis was erroneous because the statute does not require proof of the gang member's particular motivation for committing an offense. Rather, the statute merely requires proof that the defendant engaged in the underlying offense \"as a member of a criminal street gang,\" in the sense that he was acting pursuant to his role or capacity as a gang member at the time that he committed the offense.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 71.02(a). To satisfy this requirement, the evidence need only be sufficient to show some nexus or relationship between the commission of the underlying offense and the defendant's gang membership. Under the particular circumstances of this case, we agree with the State's suggestion that the jury was permitted to reject the possibility that appellant was acting due to independent impulse or for some reason independent of his gang membership, and it was permitted to draw the reasonable inference that appellant was acting in his capacity as a gang member when he participated in the murders of the Vargas brothers. The fact that it was theoretically possible that there was some non-gang related motive for the murders is not the proper inquiry in a sufficiency review, in which we are bound to defer to the factfinder's weighing of the evidence and its drawing of reasonable inferences.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Wise v.
