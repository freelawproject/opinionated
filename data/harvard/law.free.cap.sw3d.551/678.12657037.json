Wheeler alleges that his convictions for first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer and armed criminal action should be vacated due to ineffective assistance of counsel. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have instead provided a memorandum of law to the parties. Finding no error, we affirm. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
