In the underlying lawsuit, Appellee Ethelvina I. Felan filed a petition seeking an election to roll back the 2016 tax rate. Felan also filed a petition for writ of mandamus and injunction seeking to compel the government officials of Maverick County to hold the roll back election. In this appeal, Appellants\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   challenge the trial court's order denying their plea to the jurisdiction and motion for summary judgment. We reverse the trial court's order denying the plea to the jurisdiction and dismiss Felan's underlying lawsuit against Appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    MAVERICK COUNTY TAX RATES AND THE APPLICABLE TAX CODES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After preparing a budget sufficient to pay its debts and meet its maintenance and operation needs, a local taxpaying unit adopts a property tax rate to support that budget.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. TAX CODE ANN. \u00a7 26.05(a) (West Supp. 2017). The Texas Constitution requires local taxing units to apprise taxpayers of tax rate proposals and afford taxpayers the opportunity to \"roll back\" or limit property tax increases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CONST. art. VIII \u00a7 21 (a). Maverick County is a taxing unit pursuant to chapter 26 of the Texas Tax Code and article VIII, section 21(a) of the Texas Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

Adopting a Tax Rate under Texas Tax Code Chapter 26\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before a local taxing unit adopts a tax rate, the tax assessor (or other designated officer or employee), calculates the \"rollback tax rate\" and the \"effective tax rate\" based on formulas set forth in the Tax Code.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 26.04(c), 26.041. The rollback tax rate places a cap on the tax rate a local taxing unit can adopt in any given year.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 26.04(c). The effective tax rate is the rate at which the properties on the tax roll must be taxed so that that amount collected in the current fiscal year will equal the revenue collected in the previous year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the tax assessor calculates the rollback tax rate and the effective tax rate, these rates are delivered to the local taxing unit and published with an explanation of how the tax rates were calculated, the fund balances, a schedule of debt obligations, and anticipated tax revenue.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 26.04(e). The local taxing unit then adopts a tax rate for the current year sufficient to fund both the unit's debt service and the maintenance and operating procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 26.05(a). If the adopted tax rate exceeds the rollback tax rate, the qualified voters may petition for an election to determine whether to reduce\n   the adopted tax rate for the current year to the rollback tax rate.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 26.07(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedure Undertaken by Maverick County Commissioners' Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant to calculations and recommendations made by the Maverick County tax assessor, the tax assessor published, in a newspaper of general circulation in Maverick County, the proposed effective rate and rollback rate and how each was calculated. Additionally, public hearings were held on August 25, 2016, and September 1, 2016, at which taxpayers were urged to attend and express their views and any concerns regarding the proposed tax rate. On September 12, 2016, the Maverick County Commissioners' Court approved a 2016 rollback tax rate of $0.586535 per $100.00 of property value and an effective tax rate of $0.542309 per $100.00 of property value. The Commissioners' Court adopted a tax rate for 2016 of $0.586535 per $100.00 of property value.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 24.07(a). This resulted in a 2016 adopted tax rate equal to the 2016 rollback tax rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shortly after the 2016 tax rates were established, the tax assessor discovered that $3 million in sales tax revenue was not included in calculating the 2016 rollback tax rate. Although the proper statutory formula was applied, the calculations were in error due to the tax assessors' failure to reduce the current debt rate by the total amount of the sales tax revenue. The tax assessor immediately notified Commissioners' Court. On September 29, 2016, the Commissioners' Court rescinded the 2016 adopted tax rate, but did not adopt a new tax rate. Maverick County was thus left without an adopted 2016 tax rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Understanding the importance of a taxing unit's ability to sufficiently budget to pay its debts and meet its maintenance and operation needs, the Legislature set forth an adopted rate for any taxing unit that failed to adopt a tax rate by the specified deadline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. TAX CODE ANN. \u00a7 26.05(c) (providing if no tax rate is adopted by a taxing unit before the required date, the adopted rate \"is the lower of the effective tax rate calculated for that tax year or the tax rate adopted by the taxing unit for the preceding tax year.\"). Because Maverick County failed to timely adopt a tax rate, and Maverick County's 2016 effective tax rate was lower than the 2015 adopted tax rate, Maverick County's 2016 effective tax rate became the 2016 adopted tax rate.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   As previously noted, the 2016 effective tax rate was $0.542309 per $100.00 of property value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 3, 2016, the Maverick County Commissioners' Court ratified the 2016 adopted tax rate of $0.542309 per $100.00 of property value. The 2016 rollback tax rate, adopted by the Commissioners' Court on September 12, 2016, remained unchanged, despite the discovery of the erroneous calculations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Proceedings before the Trial Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 22, 2016, Felan filed her petition seeking an election to roll back the tax rate. On February 21, 2017, Felan also filed a petition for writ of mandamus and injunction seeking to compel Maverick County officials to properly calculate the 2016 rollback tax and hold the requested roll back election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Appellants filed a plea to the jurisdiction and motion for summary judgment asserting that Felan's failure to timely file an injunction pursuant to section 26.04(g) of the Texas Tax Code deprived the court of jurisdiction to consider her claims. Felan filed a competing motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied Appellants' plea to the jurisdiction and summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of Felan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal, Appellants raise three issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (1) Because the statute required the petition be filed prior to the Commissioners' Court's adoption of the tax rate, the trial court was without jurisdiction to hear the request for an injunction;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (2) Felan's delay in seeking relief prevented the roll back election from being held pursuant to Tax Code section 26.07 ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (3) Felan failed to meet her evidentiary burden to prove the validity of her roll back petition after the Commissioners' Court found the petition invalid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We first address Appellants' plea to the jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    PLEA TO THE JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Section 26.04 authorizes a taxpayer to seek an injunction to prohibit a taxing unit from adopting a tax rate if the tax assessor has failed to properly compute the rollback rate and effective tax rate and such failure was in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11982211\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/944/18/#p21\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because Felan failed to seek an injunction under section 26.04, prior to the Commissioners' Court's adoption of the 2016 tax rate, Appellants argue the trial court was without jurisdiction to consider Felan's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11982211\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/944/18/#p21\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Felan counters that section 26.04 is not applicable to this case because she is not seeking to prevent Maverick County or any official from adopting the 2016 tax rate. Instead, Felan asserts that she is seeking a roll back election under section 26.07, which provides a remedy any time a taxing unit's adopted tax rate exceeds the taxing unit's rollback tax rate as calculated by the statutory formula.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11982211\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/944/18/#p21\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 26.07. In her pleadings, Felan requested that the trial court recalculate the 2016 rollback tax rate in accordance with the statutory formula, using the corrected numbers provided by the tax assessor.

Because standing to bring suit against Maverick County and its officers is a statutory cause of action, this court strictly construes the language\n   contained within the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hairgrove\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11447993\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/80/703/#p706\">\n    80 S.W.3d at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In the instant case, Felan's complaint rests on the miscalculation of the rollback tax rate. Absent a recalculation of the rollback tax rate, Felan could not allege or establish the 2016 adopted tax rate exceeded the 2016 rollback tax rate. As a result, Felan's only cause of action against Maverick County and its officers is provided by section 24.06(g), and her exclusive remedy was the ability to seek an injunction prohibiting Maverick County from\n   <em>\n    adopting the tax rate. See\n   </em>\n   TEX. TAX CODE ANN. \u00a7 24.06(g) (emphasis added). Standing under section 24.06(g), however, requires the taxpayer to file the injunction prior to adoption of the tax rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11447993\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/80/703/#p706\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By her own admission, prior to the County's adoption of the tax rate, Felan knew about the miscalculation and that the temporary injunction was the proper avenue in which to challenge the miscalculation, but she chose not to act. Because Felan failed to comply with section 24.06(g), which was her exclusive remedy for challenging Maverick County's miscalculation of the rollback tax rate, the trial court was without jurisdiction to hear her claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's order and dismiss Felan's underlying lawsuit for want of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Appellants include Maverick County, David Saucedo, in his Official Capacity as Maverick County Judge, Teodoro Roy Schmerber, in his Official Capacity as Maverick County Elections 2 Administrator, Jerry Morales, in his Official Capacity as Maverick County Commissioner, Pct. 1, Rosy Cantu, in her Official Capacity as County Commissioner Pct. 2, Pete Venegas, in his Official Capacity as Commissioner Pct. 3, and Roberto Ruiz, in his Official Capacity as Commissioner Pct. 4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
