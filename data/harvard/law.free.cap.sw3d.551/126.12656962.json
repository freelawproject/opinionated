An Oklahoma court first entered an order approving and incorporating the parties' agreements. When the husband later filed for divorce in Texas, the wife filed the Oklahoma order in the Texas court. The Texas court granted the divorce, incorporating the parties' agreements as approved in the Oklahoma order, and later issued various post-divorce orders to enforce the former husband's obligations. The former husband argues that the court cannot enforce his spousal-support obligation by wage withholding or by an assignment of his retirement benefits to his former wife. The court of appeals rejected both arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We agree with the former husband on both points. We reverse the court of appeals' judgment and render judgment that the wage-withholding order and the order assigning retirement benefits to enforce unpaid spousal support are void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For 150 years, the State of Texas rejected post-divorce alimony as contrary to public policy.\n   <em>\n    Francis v.

The Oklahoma order approved the Daltons' agreements regarding child custody and support, division of their marital property and debts, spousal support, attorney's fees, and costs. Regarding spousal support, the Oklahoma order required Bart to pay Carol \"support alimony\" of $6,060.25 per month until he had paid $1,309,014.00. Regarding property division, the order assigned \"all right, title, and interest\" in one-half of Bart's 401(k) and profit-sharing plans to Carol. After the Oklahoma court entered the agreed order, Bart and Carol separated, Carol moved to Texas, and Bart later followed. Bart filed for divorce in a Texas court. Carol filed a counterpetition for divorce and filed the Oklahoma order with the Texas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before the Texas court rendered a final divorce decree, it entered a summary-judgment order declaring that the Oklahoma order constitutes \"a final judgment entitled to full faith and credit by the Texas Courts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also found that Bart was in arrears on his support obligations and held him in contempt. The court issued a wage-withholding order requiring Bart's employer to withhold some of his earnings to satisfy his monthly child-support and support-alimony obligations. It later entered a \"qualified domestic relations order\" (commonly called a \"QDRO\") making up for some of Bart's arrearages by assigning Carol an additional interest in Bart's retirement accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Bart and Carol's divorce was made final in 2011. Consistent with the earlier summary judgment, the Texas court's final divorce decree incorporated the Oklahoma order approving the parties' agreement. Neither Bart nor Carol challenged the final divorce decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Soon after the final decree, Carol alleged that Bart continued to fall short on his support-alimony obligations. In response to Carol's post-divorce motions, the Texas court entered an additional QDRO to enforce Bart's spousal-alimony obligations, assigning Carol additional interests in Bart's retirement accounts. The court also denied and dismissed Bart's motions to terminate and vacate the earlier wage-withholding order. Ultimately, the court again found Bart in contempt and\n   entered a judgment awarding Carol $269,665.19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Bart appealed, challenging (1) the order finding him in contempt, (2) the final QDRO, and (3) the order dismissing his motion to vacate the wage-withholding order. While his appeal was pending, the trial court conducted an additional hearing, ordered Bart to forty-five days' confinement if he did not pay the arrearages, and entered a first-amended QDRO increasing the amount awarded to Carol from Bart's retirement accounts. Bart supplemented his notice of appeal to include both of these orders. The court of appeals modified the judgment to reduce the amount of Bart's arrearages but otherwise affirmed.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20104639\">\n    2017 WL 104639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Tex.

We agree that the trial court erred because Texas law does not permit wage withholding in this case, and the fact that an Oklahoma court first entered the agreed support order does not change that result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Texas Constitution prohibits the garnishment of current wages for personal service, \"except for the enforcement of court-ordered\" child-support payments or \"spousal maintenance.\" TEX.

Here, the Oklahoma order neither orders spousal maintenance nor approves an agreement to pay spousal maintenance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Carol argues that Bart's support-alimony obligation constitutes spousal maintenance because section 8.001(1) defines \"maintenance\" as an award of payments by one spouse \"for the support\" of the other. TEX. FAM. CODE \u00a7 8.001(1). Bart agreed to pay alimony under Oklahoma law, and according to Carol, \"there is no real difference between 'alimony,' as ordered here by the Oklahoma court, and 'spousal maintenance' within the meaning of the Texas constitution,\" because both involve a\n   spouse's payments \"for the support\" of the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We have explained, however, that although Chapter 8 \"broadly define[s]\" the term maintenance, an order requiring spousal support does not award \"spousal maintenance\" under Chapter 8 unless it complies with the statute's eligibility, duration, termination, and other requirements.\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311616\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/645/#p647\">\n    221 S.W.3d at 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

CODE \u00a7 8.051 (describing eligibility requirements). Carol never argued to the trial court-when registering the Oklahoma order in Texas, filing her counterpetition for divorce, or moving for enforcement-that she was eligible to receive spousal maintenance. To the contrary, when questioned on the applicability of Chapter 8, Carol testified that her agreements with Bart regarding support never \"even touched on the possibility\" that she was eligible for Chapter 8 spousal maintenance. Bart likewise testified that Carol never indicated an \"intent at any time to have anything to do with the maintenance statutes in Texas.\" And Carol has not argued to this Court that she could have qualified under Chapter 8 or that she has not been afforded the opportunity to claim eligibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We conclude that neither the Oklahoma order nor the Texas trial court's decree required Bart to pay spousal maintenance; instead, they required him to provide \"support alimony\" that \"falls outside of Chapter Eight.\"\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311616\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/645/#p647\">\n    221 S.W.3d at 647-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If by this assertion Carol means to argue that Chapter 8 authorized the court to order Bart's employer to withhold wages up to the monthly amount Chapter 8 permits, we disagree. Subsection (a-2) prohibits wage withholding \"\n   <em>\n    to the extent\n   </em>\n   that any provision of an agreed order\n   <em>\n    for maintenance\n   </em>\n   exceeds the amount of periodic support the court could have ordered under this chapter or for any period\n   <em>\n    of maintenance\n   </em>\n   beyond the period of maintenance the court could have ordered under this chapter.\" TEX.

So parties may agree to a spousal-maintenance order under Chapter 8 that requires payments exceeding Chapter 8's amount and duration limits, and the court can order wage withholding to enforce the order only up to those limits. But as we have explained, nothing in the Oklahoma order indicates that the Daltons agreed to spousal maintenance under Chapter 8, and nothing in the record indicates that Carol could have established her eligibility for Chapter 8 spousal maintenance. We thus conclude that Chapter 8 does not authorize the trial court's wage-withholding order in this case, even up to the statutory limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Carol argues, however, that\n   <em>\n    Oklahoma\n   </em>\n   law authorizes the wage-withholding order, and because the Texas divorce decree is based on an Oklahoma order, we must give full faith and credit to Oklahoma law.

The full-faith-and-credit clause requires Texas to accept the Oklahoma order as a final judgment, but our Constitution and Chapter 8 allow wage withholding only to enforce spousal maintenance. Wage withholding is not available to support all spousal-support judgments in Texas.

Nothing in the federal statutes or the Family Code supports this conclusion.

CODE \u00a7\u00a7 8.101 -.305).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    In this case, we are presented with a Texas divorce decree giving full faith and credit to an Oklahoma order approving a spousal maintenance agreement between Bart and Carol Dalton. After Bart fell behind on his maintenance payments, Carol sought to enforce the order by income withholding and by an assignment of Bart's retirement benefits. The Court holds that Carol is entitled to neither of these enforcement mechanisms. While I agree with that result under the circumstances of this case, I write separately to clarify my views on a spouse's ability to enforce spousal maintenance obligations to the extent they qualify as such under chapter 8 of the Family Code.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    <strong>\n     I. Income Withholding\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    I agree with the Court that Texas law authorizes income withholding only to enforce a court-ordered obligation that qualifies as spousal maintenance under chapter 8. I also agree that in this case, Carol has made no effort, at any stage of the proceedings, to allege or prove that any portion of the ordered spousal support so qualifies. Because of that failure, the Court does not address whether a party who has been awarded agreed spousal support under another state's law, but seeks enforcement in Texas, should be given the opportunity in the enforcement proceedings to show that some or all of the ordered maintenance is eligible for income withholding. I would affirmatively recognize that the enforcing party has that opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The Family Code expressly provides that the \"court may order that income be withheld from the disposable earnings of the obligor in a proceeding in which there is an agreement for periodic payments of spousal maintenance under the terms of this chapter voluntarily entered into between the parties and approved by the court.\" TEX. FAM. CODE \u00a7 8.101(a-1). However, the \"court may not order that income be withheld ... to the extent that any provision of an agreed order for maintenance exceeds the amount of periodic support\n    the court could have ordered under this chapter or for any period of maintenance beyond the period of maintenance the court could have ordered under this chapter.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%201574\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 8.101(a-2). Implicit in this language is the directive that courts\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    order that income be withheld \"to the extent\" that the agreed spousal maintenance could have qualified under chapter 8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    This is consistent with\n    <em>\n     In re Green\n    </em>\n    , in which we analyzed similar statutory limitations on enforcing agreed spousal maintenance by contempt.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311616\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/645/#p647\">\n     221 S.W.3d 645\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 648 (Tex. 2007) (discussing TEX. FAM. CODE \u00a7 8.059(a) ). In\n    <em>\n     Green\n    </em>\n    , we held that a maintenance obligation is punishable by contempt \"only if it meets Chapter Eight's other requirements.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311616\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/645/#p647\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (emphasis removed). That is, \"one spouse's voluntary agreement to support the other,\n    <em>\n     to the extent it exceeds a legal duty\n    </em>\n    , is a contractual debt that cannot be enforced by contempt.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311616\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/645/#p647\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (emphasis added). The logical corollary to this statement is that, to the extent a spouse's voluntary agreement to support the other\n    <em>\n     does not\n    </em>\n    exceed a legal duty, it may be enforced by both contempt and income withholding.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Accordingly, I would hold that, upon proof at an enforcement hearing that a party qualified for spousal maintenance under chapter 8 at the time of the divorce, a judgment for arrearages on a maintenance agreement is enforceable by income withholding or contempt \"to the extent\" that the agreement does not exceed what could have been ordered under that chapter. In turn, I respectfully disagree with any implication that such information must be either in the decree or in the record at the time of the divorce, as I believe the parties should be given the opportunity to litigate this issue at the enforcement hearing. Otherwise, as a practical matter, a party attempting to enforce an out-of-state spousal maintenance order or agreement in Texas could never do so by income withholding or contempt because such orders or agreements are simply not entered with another state's law in mind.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <strong>\n     II. Retirement Benefits\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The Court holds that the trial court erred in entering a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) assigning Carol additional interests in Bart's retirement accounts to satisfy his alimony arrearages. Because Carol has never argued that any portion of Bart's support obligation qualifies as spousal maintenance under chapter 8, I agree with the Court that it is enforceable in Texas only as a contract and that Texas law does not authorize satisfaction of those arrearages via a QDRO. However, in so holding, the Court indicates that Texas law authorizes a QDRO\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    to effectuate the property division in a divorce decree. To the extent the Court holds that QDROs may not be used to enforce delinquent spousal maintenance and child support obligations imposed by the decree-a position contrary to that taken by family-law commentators in this State and the overwhelming majority of courts in other jurisdictions-I respectfully disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    As the Court explains, federal law generally prohibits assignment or alienation of retirement benefits and preempts state law to the contrary.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201056\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1056\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(1), 1144(a).

ERISA defines a QDRO as \"a domestic relations order\" that \"creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee's right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to,\n    receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan,\" and that meets various other technical statutory requirements.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201056\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(3)(B)(i), (C), (D). In turn, a \"domestic relations order\" is \"any judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement)\" that \"relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant\" and \"is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law).\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201056\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The Court concludes that Texas law does not explicitly authorize a QDRO for purposes other than enforcing a property division in the decree. The Court in turn implies that a Texas court's order assigning retirement benefits for any other purpose-including enforcement of child support or spousal maintenance under chapter 8-would not be made \"pursuant to a State domestic relations law\" and would not qualify even as a domestic relations order under ERISA, let alone a qualified domestic relations order. I respectfully disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    First, I disagree that the \"State domestic relations law\" to which ERISA refers is a law authorizing a QDRO. Rather, a \"State domestic relations law (\n    <em>\n     including a community property law\n    </em>\n    ),\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201056\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (emphasis added), is necessarily the law giving rise to the underlying right the party is seeking to enforce through a QDRO, i.e., child support, alimony, or property division. That is, a Texas order qualifies as a domestic relations order under ERISA so long as the order relates to child support, alimony, or property division that is authorized by state law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Stinner v.

Although retirement benefits are generally exempt from attachment for the satisfaction of debts, TEX. PROP. CODE \u00a7 42.0021, Texas treats both child support and spousal maintenance obligations as materially different from traditional debts. For example, the Texas Constitution broadly prohibits imprisonment for debts, TEX. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 18, but this prohibition does not apply to child support obligations or to court-ordered spousal maintenance obligations under chapter 8.\n    <em>\n     In re Green\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311616\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/645/#p647\">\n     221 S.W.3d at 647\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Similarly, Texas law generally exempts wages from seizure or attachment. TEX. CONST. art. XVI, \u00a7 28 ; TEX. PROP. CODE \u00a7 42.001(b)(1). But income withholding is expressly available as a mechanism to enforce child support and spousal maintenance obligations. TEX. CONST. art.

PROP. CODE \u00a7 42.0021(a). But this prohibition does not apply to a child support or spousal maintenance obligation for the same reason the prohibition against imprisonment for debts does not apply: such an obligation is not a \"debt\"; it is a \"legal duty arising out of the status of the parties.\"\n    <em>\n     Green\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311616\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/645/#p647\">\n     221 S.W.3d at 647\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Ex Parte Hall\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10008214\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/854/656/#p656\">\n     854 S.W.2d 656\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 658 (Tex. 1993) ). The Illinois Court of Appeals relied on this distinction in\n    <em>\n     In re Marriage of Thomas\n    </em>\n    , explaining that \"when a former spouse seeks the assignment of the plan participant's retirement accounts after obtaining a judgment for a maintenance and child support arrearage, the spouse is not a typical creditor as that term is used in [the Illinois version of Texas Property Code section 42.0021 ].\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2469162\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/339/214/\">\n     339 Ill.App.3d 214\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=273%20Ill.%20Dec.%20647\">\n     273 Ill.Dec. 647\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=789%20N.E.2d%20821\">\n     789 N.E.2d 821\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 831 (2003). Accordingly, the court of appeals held that the trial court could enter a QDRO assigning the participant's retirement and pension benefits to satisfy such a judgment.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=789%20N.E.2d%20821\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Courts in other jurisdictions have held similarly. For example, the Iowa Court of Appeals, finding \"no established prohibition against an assignment [of retirement benefits to satisfy past-due alimony] under state law,\" concluded that the \"question whether to permit the assignment rests with the particular facts of each case, and the equitable powers of the court in dissolution matters.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Marriage of Bruns\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10699619\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/535/157/#p162\">\n     535 N.W.2d 157\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 162-63 (Iowa Ct. App. 1995). The Indiana Court of Appeals cited\n    <em>\n     Bruns\n    </em>\n    approvingly in finding a QDRO \"to be an appropriate mechanism for enforcement of [the] support arrearage judgment.\"\n    <em>\n     Hogle v.

Ct. App. 2000).\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    I agree with these well-reasoned decisions and believe Texas law similarly allows for enforcement of child support and chapter 8 spousal maintenance obligations via a QDRO that complies with ERISA's requirements.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Any conclusion to the contrary would require us to ignore Texas's treatment of such obligations in comparison to traditional debts and would interfere with Texas policy favoring their enforcement. Again, Texas Property Code section 42.0021's exemption of retirement accounts from attachment, execution, and seizure specifically applies to the satisfaction of debts. Neither spousal maintenance nor child support is merely a debt under Texas law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    By contrast, the Court, finding no Texas statute affirmatively discussing the use of QDROs for a purpose unrelated to effectuating a property division, concludes that such orders are therefore not authorized by Texas law. The Court cites chapter 9,\n    subchapter B of the Family Code, entitled \"Post-Decree Qualified Domestic Relations Order,\" to support its position. Section 9.101 provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the court that rendered a final decree of divorce or annulment or another final order dividing property under this title retains continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to render an enforceable qualified domestic relations order or similar order permitting payment of pension, retirement plan, or other employee benefits divisible under the law of this state or of the United States to an alternate payee or other lawful payee.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n    (b) Unless prohibited by federal law, a suit seeking a qualified domestic relations order or similar order under this section applies to a previously divided pension, retirement plan, or other employee benefit divisible under the law of this state or of the United States, whether the plan or benefit is private, state, or federal.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    TEX. FAM. CODE \u00a7 9.101. The statute goes on to obligate courts to \"liberally construe this subchapter to effect payment of retirement benefits that were divided by a previous decree.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11210169\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/732/1278/#p1284\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 9.105.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The Court reads this language to limit a court's authority to enter a QDRO for a purpose other than effecting payment of previously divided benefits.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    But subchapter B contains no language limiting the authority a court may otherwise have (under both ERISA and state law) to enter an order permitting attachment of retirement benefits. That is, nothing in subchapter B prohibits a court from enforcing child support and spousal maintenance via such an attachment. Because I believe Texas law otherwise provides courts with that authority, I find the Court's reading of subchapter B overly restrictive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    It is true, as the Court notes, that Texas courts have no power to \"amend, modify, alter, or change the division of property made or approved in the decree of divorce or annulment.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11210169\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/732/1278/#p1284\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 9.007(a). But garnishment of retirement benefits awarded to the payee spouse in order to enforce a child support or spousal maintenance obligation does nothing to the decree's division of property. Indeed, almost every court to address the issue has held that using a QDRO for this purpose does not amount to an improper modification of the decree's adjudication of property rights.\n    <em>\n     E.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Hogle\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11210169\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/732/1278/#p1284\">\n     732 N.E.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1284 ;\n    <em>\n     Baird v.

That is, if Texas law affirmatively prohibited enforcement of child support and spousal maintenance orders by assigning retirement benefits, ERISA would have no effect on such a law.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-128\">\n     Of course, as a general matter, \"every court having jurisdiction to render a judgment has the inherent power to enforce its judgments. That power is part of the court's jurisdiction, and the court may employ suitable methods to enforce its jurisdiction.\"\n     <em>\n      Arndt v.

But with the exception of Idaho, none of the statutes the Court cites specifically authorize enforcement of alimony via attachment or garnishment of retirement benefits. Rather, they speak generally of paying such obligations from the property of the other spouse or utilizing the mechanisms available for enforcement of judgments.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9945075\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/633/497/#p499\">\n       id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     at nn.19-20 (citing Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Pennsylvania statutes regarding enforcement of spousal maintenance obligations).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-130\">\n     The Court recognizes that section 154.003 broadly authorizes a court to order that child support be paid by \"the setting aside of property to be administered for the support of the child as specified in the order.\" Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 154.003(4). It is not clear to me whether the Court reads this statute to authorize garnishment of retirement benefits to enforce child support arrearages, notwithstanding chapter 9.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-131\">\n     The Virginia Supreme Court decided otherwise in what has been called a \"rogue\" decision.
