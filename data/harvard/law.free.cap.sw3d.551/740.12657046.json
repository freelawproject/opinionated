Roush, Ruthie Ann Roush Dodge, and David E. Roush (collectively \"the Bryan Heirs\") and awarding them attorney's fees. The underlying dispute involves the interpretation of a nonparticipating royalty interest reserved in a 1951 warranty deed. On appeal, appellants Laborde Properties, L.P. and Laborde Management, LLC (collectively \"Laborde\"), argue the trial court erred in: (1) granting summary judgment in favor of U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs, thereby declaring the 1951 warranty deed reserved a floating nonparticipating royalty interest (\"NPRI\") as opposed to a fixed NPRI; (2) denying its motion for summary judgment regarding its counterclaims to quiet title and recover overpayment of royalties to U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs; and (3) awarding attorney's fees to U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs. We reverse the trial court's summary judgment in favor of U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs and render judgment that the reserved NPRI is a fixed interest equal to one-sixteenth (1/16) of production. We also reverse the trial court's award of attorney's fees and remand the issue of attorney's fees to the trial court for reconsideration in light of this court's opinion relating to the nature of the reservation. As we discuss below, the issues relating to Laborde's claims to quiet title and recover alleged overpayments are not before this court, having been severed and abated in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The crux of this dispute centers on the interpretation of a NPRI reserved in a 1951 warranty deed. Specifically, the parties agree a NPRI was reserved in the 1951 deed, but disagree whether the NPRI reserved therein is a fixed NPRI equal to one-sixteenth (1/16) of production or a floating NPRI equal to one-half (1/2) of royalty. Laborde asserts the NPRI is a fixed interest entitling U.S. Shale and the\n   Bryan Heirs to one-sixteenth (1/16) of production; U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs contend it is a floating interest entitling them to one-half (1/2) of royalty or one-tenth (1/10) of production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The underlying facts are not in dispute. On January 6, 1951, grantors J.E. Bryan and Minnie H. Bryan conveyed all right, title, and interest in a tract of Karnes County real property to grantee S.E. Crews. In that same deed, the grantors reserved a NPRI. The reservation provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   There is reserved and excepted from this conveyance unto the grantors herein, their heirs and assigns, an undivided one-half (1/2) interest in and to the Oil Royalty, Gas Royalty and Royalty in other Minerals in and under or that may be produced or mined from the above described premises, the same being equal to one-sixteenth (1/16) of the production. This reservation is what is generally termed a nonparticipating Royalty Reservation....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs are the successors-in-interest to the original grantors, i.e., they are current owners of the NPRI J.E. and Minnie reserved in the 1951 warranty deed. Laborde ultimately became the successor-in-interest to grantee S.E. Crews when, on July 9, 2010, it acquired a portion of the real property described in the 1951 deed. As successor-in-interest, Laborde acquired all right, title, and interest in the real property, subject to the NPRI owned by U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs. When Laborde acquired the property, the property was subject to an oil and gas lease, which provided for a twenty percent (20%) royalty. At the time the dispute arose between Laborde, U.S. Shale, and the Bryan Heirs, the oil and gas lease was held by EOG Resources, Inc. (\"EOG Resources\") and made up part of the Lake and Emerson Unit in Karnes County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After receiving a division order from EOG Resources, Laborde disputed the amount of royalty payments it was receiving. According to Laborde, EOG Resources was improperly reducing the royalty payments due to Laborde under the lease because EOG Resources was erroneously categorizing U.S. Shale's and the Bryan Heirs' NPRI as a floating interest equal to one-half (1/2) of royalty rather than a fixed NPRI equal to one-sixteenth (1/16) of production. In other words, Laborde claimed that by categorizing the NPRI as a floating as opposed to a fixed interest, EOG Resources was\n   <em>\n    over calculating\n   </em>\n   the amount of royalty payments due to U.S Shale and the Bryan Heirs because it was calculating their payment as a floating one-half (1/2) of the lease's twenty percent (20%) royalty, i.e., one-tenth (1/10) of production, rather than a fixed one-sixteenth (1/16) of production. Thus, Laborde believed its royalty payments under the lease were being reduced by the improper overpayment of one-tenth (1/10) of production to U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs as opposed to one-sixteenth (1/16) of production to U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   By letter dated January 12, 2015, Laborde notified EOG Resources of its disagreement with the EOG Resources royalty payment. In response, EOG Resources suspended payments regarding the disputed interest pending proper construction of reservation language in the 1951 warranty deed. U.S Shale and the Bryan Heirs subsequently filed suit for declaratory judgment, asking the trial court to declare the 1951 warranty deed reserved a floating NPRI, and under the current oil and gas lease, their royalty is equal to one-half (1/2) of twenty percent (20%), i.e., one-tenth (1/10) of production. Laborde counterclaimed, asking the trial court to declare the 1951 warranty deed reserved a fixed NPRI equal to one-sixteenth (1/16) of\n   production, or alternatively, to quiet title to its royalty interest. Laborde also sought recovery of the overpayment of royalty to U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs and attorney's fees. All parties filed motions for summary judgment requesting the trial court declare whether the NPRI reserved in the 1951 warranty deed was a fixed or floating interest. Laborde also sought summary judgment on its claim for recovery regarding the overpayment of royalties to U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs and its alternative claim to quiet title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs, declaring the 1951 deed reserved a floating NPRI equal to one-half (1/2) of royalty. According to the summary judgment, under the current lease, which provides for a one-fifth (1/5) or twenty percent (20%) royalty, U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs are entitled to a one-tenth (1/10) royalty, i.e., one-half (1/2) of twenty percent (20%). Subsequently, the trial court awarded U.S Shale and the Bryan Heirs attorney's fees, thereby rendering a final judgment. Laborde then perfected this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, Laborde first contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs on their declaratory judgment action, arguing the trial court misinterpreted the 1951 warranty deed by concluding the reserved NPRI was a floating as opposed to a fixed interest. According to Laborde, the 1951 deed-by its plain and unambiguous language and under the greatest possible estates rule-reserved a fixed NPRI equal to one-sixteenth (1/16) of production as opposed to a floating NPRI equal to one-half (1/2) of royalty, i.e., one-tenth (1/10) of production under the current lease. Laborde next contends the trial court erred in awarding attorney's fees to U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs under the Declaratory Judgment Act because the award was based on an erroneous grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

Laborde argues that by treating the reservation as a floating interest, the trial court failed to comply with the principles of deed construction and gave no effect to the phrase \"same being equal to one-sixteenth (1/16) of production.\" According to Laborde, the reservation provision does not contain any language indicating an intent to create a floating royalty interest. Rather, the reservation begins with language \"an undivided one-half (1/2) interest in and to the ... Royalty,\" which is indicative of reserving a fixed interest, and then ends with language clearly stating the amount and type of interest being reserved, \"same being equal to one-sixteenth (1/16th) of production.\" To support its position, Laborde largely relies on two appellate decisions. First, Laborde relies on this court's opinion\n   <em>\n    Graham v. Prochaska\n   </em>\n   , wherein we acknowledged that the phrase \"one-half of the one-eighth royalty,\" without more, is indicative of fixed royalty language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6961806\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/429/650/#p654\">\n    429 S.W.3d at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Laborde cites\n   <em>\n    Moore v. Noble Energy,Inc.\n   </em>\n   , in which the Amarillo Court of Appeals held a \"one-half nonparticipating royalty interest (one-half of one-eighth of production)\" reserved a fixed royalty because there was nothing in the deed to suggest otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7133994\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/374/644/#p647\">\n    374 S.W.3d at 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , the court made it clear its interpretation was based on the lack of language in the deed suggesting otherwise.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7133994\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/374/644/#p647\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, as we did in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , our sister court noted that the language cited by Laborde denotes a fixed interest if there is nothing in the deed (or properly referenced outside documents) to suggest otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6961806\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/429/650/#p654\">\n    429 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   661 ;\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7133994\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/374/644/#p647\">\n    374 S.W.3d at 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In response, U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs contend the 1951 warranty deed reserved a floating royalty interest equal to one-half (1/2) of royalty. They support their interpretation by pointing out the lease operator, EOG Resources, interpreted the language as reserving a floating royalty interest, explaining the additional phrase \"same being equal to one-sixteenth (1/16th) of production\" is reminiscent of oil and gas leases with a 1/8 royalty (in other words, 1/2 of 1/8 is equal to 1/16 of production). U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs also point to this court's opinion,\n   <em>\n    Graham v. Prochaska\n   </em>\n   , as well as our decision in\n   <em>\n    Hausser v. Cuellar\n   </em>\n   , for support.

This portion of the deed provides no guidance in our determination of whether the reserved interest is fixed or fractional.

Moreover, in the habendum clause, which follows the reservation clause, it specifically describes the reservation as a \"royalty reservation.\" However, like the granting clause, this portion of the reservation clause does not speak to the type of royalty interest reserved, i.e., fixed or floating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As noted, after reservation clause is a habendum clause. A habendum clause describes the duration of the interest conveyed-for a term or in perpetuity. 2 SMITH &amp; WEAVER , TEXAS LAW OF OIL &amp; GAS \u00a7 3.2[A], at 3-6.1-3-7. The habendum clause in the 1951 deed starts with the traditional \"to have and to hold\" language and then states the property described in the granting clause, subject to the royalty reservation, belongs to the grantee, his heirs, and assigned \"forever,\" and that the grantors will defend the grantee from all claims to the contrary. There is nothing in the habendum clause to assist the court in determining whether the royalty reserved was a fixed or floating interest. Thus, after looking to the other provisions in the deed pursuant to the mandate in\n   <em>\n    Hysaw\n   </em>\n   , thereby avoiding the application of a mechanical rule based merely on the disputed language in the reservation, we are left with nothing but the disputed language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808821\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/483/1/#p13\">\n    483 S.W.3d at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is the disputed language, therefore, from which we must determine whether the royalty reserved is a fixed or floating interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As set out above, the disputed language in the deed states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   There is reserved and excepted from this conveyance unto the grantors herein, their heirs and assigns,\n   <em>\n    an undivided one-half (1/2) interest in and to\n   </em>\n   the Oil Royalty, Gas Royalty and Royalty in other Minerals in and under or that may be produced or mined from the above described premises,\n   <em>\n    the same being equal to one-sixteenth (1/16) of the production.\n   </em>\n   This reservation is what is generally termed a nonparticipating Royalty Reservation....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   (emphasis added). U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs point to the first part of the paragraph above-specifically, the \"undivided one-half (1/2) interest in and to\" language, arguing the parties intended to create a floating interest. They argue, based on our prior decision in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , that the additional phrase \"same being equal to one-sixteenth (1/16th) of production\" does not change the interest to one that is fixed. In\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , this court had to harmonize the following reservation to determine whether the interest reserved was fixed or floating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   One-half (1/2) of the one-eighth (1/8) royalty to be provided in any and all leases for oil, gas and other mineral now upon or hereafter given on said land, or any part thereof ... the same being equal to one-sixteenth (1/16th) of all oil, gas, and other minerals of any nature, free and clear of all costs of production, except taxes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6961806\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/429/650/#p654\">\n    429 S.W.3d at 659-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , the reference to \"one-sixteenth (1/16th),\" which the court found was merely a mathematical calculation, did not include, as here, the phrase \"of production.\" The inclusion of the phrase \"of the production\" in the 1951 warranty deed suggests a different intent from that found in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   .

We therefore reverse the trial court's summary judgment in favor of U.S. Shale and the Bryan Heirs and render judgment in favor of Laborde that the royalty interest reserved is a fixed NPRI equal to one-sixteenth (1/16) of production. Based on the reversal and rendition relating to the reservation, we remand the issue of attorney's fees to the trial court for reconsideration in light of our decision. As to the counterclaims alleged by Laborde regarding quiet title and overpayment, we hold those issues are not before this court based on the trial court's severance order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    As we recognized in\n    <em>\n     Graham\n    </em>\n    , leases with royalties larger than one-eighth (1/8) became much more common in the mid-1970's.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6961806\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/429/650/#p654\">\n     429 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    657 (citing 1 Smith &amp; Weaver , Texas Law of Oil &amp; Gas \u00a7 2.4[B][1], at 2-64).
