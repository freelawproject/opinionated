We affirm in part, and reverse and render in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Julie Ann Howe (Wife) filed a petition for divorce from Rusty Wayne Howe (Husband) in November 2014. The couple had been married for eighteen years and had two children, aged 14 and 16, as of the date of divorce. Initial efforts to reconcile failed, and the relationship of the parties became increasingly confrontational. Following a non-jury trial, and relevant here, the decree: (1) appointed the parents joint managing conservators, but gave Wife the exclusive right to determine the primary residence of the children without geographic limitation; (2) ordered Husband to pay child support; (3) ordered Husband to pay spousal maintenance; (4) divided the assets and debts, and according to Husband, gave him little of the former and most of the latter; (5) determined that the proceeds from the sale of the marital residence were Wife's separate property; (6) ordered Husband to pay interim attorney's fees that resulted from an earlier default; (7) assessed the ad litem costs against Husband; and (8) incorporated the standard visitation order. Other than the child support order, Husband attacks each of these rulings. We elaborate on the evidence germane to each ruling in conjunction with each issue below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL POSTURE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Our first decision point is whether we are reviewing the trial court's judgment with or without findings of fact and conclusions of law. What should be a straightforward question is not based on the record before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Traditional Findings of Fact\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A request for findings and conclusions shall be filed within twenty days after the judgment is signed. Rule 296 mandates that the request be specifically entitled \"Request for Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\" TEX.R.CIV.P. 296. The request should be a separate instrument and not coupled with a motion for new trial or a motion to correct or reform the judgment. A litigant who misses the deadline waives the right to complain of the trial court's failure to prepare the findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Upon timely demand, the court shall prepare its findings and conclusions and file them within twenty days after a timely request is filed. TEX.R.CIV.P. 297. The court is required to mail a copy to each party. Deadlines for requesting additional or amended findings run from the date the original findings and conclusions are filed, as noted below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   If the trial court fails to submit the findings and conclusions within the 20-day period, the requesting party must call the omission to the attention of the judge within 30 days after filing the original request. Failure to submit a timely reminder waives the right to complain of the court's failure to make findings.\n   <em>\n    Averyt v.

Where the reminder is filed, the time for the filing of the court's response is extended to 40 days from the date the original request was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   If the court files findings and conclusions, either party has a period of ten days in which to request specified additional or amended findings or conclusions. The court shall file same within ten days after the request, and again, cause a copy to be mailed to each party. No findings or conclusions shall be deemed or presumed by any failure of the court to make additional findings or conclusions. TEX.R.CIV.P. 298.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When a party fails to timely request additional findings and conclusions, it is deemed to have waived the right to complain on appeal of the court's failure to make them.\n   <em>\n    Briargrove Park Property Owners, Inc. v.

Husband made an oral request for findings at the hearing.

On April 1, Husband filed a Notice of Past-Due Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, asking the court clerk to call the matter to the trial court's attention. The court coordinator then sent the parties the following email on April 25, 2016:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Judge Eskew has reviewed [Wife's] proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions Law, and it appears that this is a very lengthy recitation of evidence. After reviewing the Final Decree of Divorce, it\n   <em>\n    appears\n   </em>\n   that the Decree includes the necessary findings and conclusions. Both counsel should reply to the court in writing by 5:00 p.m., Thursday, April 28th regarding your position on this statement. In light of this, either of you may request any additional Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. If either of you intends to request any additional findings and conclusions, please inform the Court as soon as possible and file the requested findings no later than May 2, 2016. [Emphasis in original].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   An order dated May 5 states that neither party responded to the email and that all necessary findings were contained in the final decree of divorce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Family Code allows an oral request for some, but not all of the distinct findings of fact contemplated by the Code. For instance, a trial court is required to make findings of fact upon request for property division orders. TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 6.711 (West Supp. 2017). This request must comport with Rule 296.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9989458\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/819/900/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 6.711(b) (\"A request for findings of fact and conclusions of law under this section must conform to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\"). Yet in the context of child support, the Family Code expressly allows, \"[w]ithout regard to Rules 296 through 299,\" an oral request to trigger the trial court's duty to make certain designated findings under that provision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9989458\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/819/900/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 154.130. At the time of these proceedings, the Family Code also allowed for oral requests for findings when a trial court made a possession order at variance with the standard order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Another anomaly here is that the findings are contained within the final divorce decree. Rule 299a expressly forbids findings of fact in a judgment. TEX.R.CIV.P. 299a (\"Findings of fact shall not be recited in a judgment. ... [They] shall be filed with the clerk of the court as a document or documents separate and apart from the judgment.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   That requirement has significance for the timeline for additional findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A party must request additional or amended findings within ten days of the original findings. TEX.R.CIV.P. 298. Under that timeline, any request for additional findings would have been late by the time the trial court sent its email. Nothing in the rule allows the trial court to extend this date, or set a new deadline as occurred here. But neither did Husband raise any of these concerns below. The trial court's email as much as anything sought the parties' position on whether the final decree already contained the necessary findings, and neither party raised any Rule 299a complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Husband now contends the trial court did not make any findings despite being requested to do so, and suggests we should \"immediately reverse the trial court's judgment [and] remand\" for findings.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henry v.

With these standards in mind, we tackle Husband's nine issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    THE DEFAULTED INTERIM ATTORNEY'S FEES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In his first issue, Husband complains of a portion of the final decree that\n   incorporated an earlier award to Wife of $5,000 in interim attorney's fees. When the divorce was first filed, Wife sought various temporary orders, including an interim fee award, and she set the matter for hearing two days after Husband's scheduled answer date. Husband filed his answer a week late, which allowed Wife to obtain the temporary orders by default, including the interim fee award. Husband sought a new temporary orders hearing, arguing in part that his former attorney had miscalculated the answer date. The trial court never expressly ruled on the motion, but referred the parties to mediation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   At mediation, the parties entered into an agreement that incorporated the handwritten notes of the mediator. The parties direct us to no specific agreement abrogating the $5,000 interim fee award. Several months later, the trial court entered additional temporary orders. Those orders did not specifically address the interim fees, but they did contain the statement that \"[a]ll prior orders not in conflict shall remain in full force an[d] effect.\" At the final hearing, Wife reasserted her right to have the fee order enforced and incorporated into the judgment. Husband did not re-urge his earlier motion to set aside the default order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Instead, Husband pursues an alternate strategy by claiming that \"no record appears to have been taken\" at the hearing and therefore no evidence can support the necessity for, or amount of, interim attorney's fees. We perceive two problems with his argument. First, Wife challenges the assertion that no record was taken and nothing in our record affirmatively shows otherwise. Husband's prior lawyer requested that the court reporter transcribe the trial testimony and one post-trial hearing; we can find no specific request for the reporter's record of the default temporary orders hearing. Second, the text of the default order contains a recital that there was a hearing and the trial court heard evidence: \"The Court, after examining the record and hearing the evidence and argument of counsel, finds that all necessary prerequisites of the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has jurisdiction of this case and of all the parties.\" Husband must present some basis to challenge the recital in the order, but has not done so here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bard v.

Hall &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9987231\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/767/839/#p845\">\n    767 S.W.2d 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 845 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1989, writ denied) (record failed to overcome recital in dismissal order about what transpired at hearing);\n   <em>\n    Adamson v.

Because Husband has not demonstrated the absence of a record, or that there was no evidence presented as to the amount of attorney's fees, we overrule Issue One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDICIAL NOTICE OF INVENTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In his second issue, Husband claims that the trial court erred by taking judicial notice of the truth of factual assertions made in an inventory in the court's file. The day prior to trial, Wife filed an inventory that detailed the couple's assets and debts, and assigned values to most of the property. She also filed a separate document outlining her proposed division of property and parenting plan. During Wife's testimony, the inventory was marked as an exhibit. Husband objected based on the timeliness of the filing. Wife responded that the inventory did nothing more than summarize the 3000 pages of exchanged documents, and its contents were not a surprise. The trial court overruled Husband's objection, but the inventory was not offered into evidence at that time. Wife then marked and offered her proposed distribution of the property as an\n   exhibit.

Husband held the license for the business and had the customer contacts. Before their separation, Wife worked as the bookkeeper and owned 51% of the company shares. Wife showed that following their separation, Husband made distributions to himself as the 49% shareholder, but he made no distributions to her. He agreed, however, that any distributions to shareholders must be proportionate. Wife testified that as of October 2015, these distributions totaled $218,766.79 of which she received nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Wife also reviewed the books and records and developed a spreadsheet that documented various questionable transfers, including personal expenses, cash withdrawals, and payments for Husband's rent at his new residence, child support payments, trips, and airline tickets. She calculated that the transfers to Husband's checking account totaled $96,556.31. Including online transfers, purchase of food, and miscellaneous expenses, Husband had extracted $143,189.46 from the business during the same period. Wife claimed that the company's shares should be valued between $400,000 to $600,000, and that Husband should be required to buy her shares for half that amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The trial court, noting the improper distributions, arrived at a different solution. It awarded Husband 51% of the Wife's community property interest in her shares, and awarded the Wife 49% of the Husband's community interest in his shares. The result gave each spouse 50% of the company shares, and effectively divested the Wife of her controlling interest in the company. The decree therefore awarded Husband an intangible item of considerable worth that he does not account for in his argument: he was no longer exposed to a hostile shareholder with a controlling interest in the company. Nor does Husband's argument account for the unequal shareholder distributions or direct payments from the business.

Later, the couple took out two home equity loans secured by the house. One loan was used to pay community debts, make improvements to the residence, and to invest in the couple's business. The other was used to pay the taxes on the house. The house was sold shortly after Husband and Wife separated for $177,000. After paying off the mortgages, the sale netted $34,800.57. Those proceeds were held in trust pending trial. It is clear from the record that there was considerable confusion as to characterization of the home. Wife claimed that the house was separate property. She alternatively sought reimbursement for the separate property funds that she used to purchase\n   the house. Husband argued that the house \"became\" community property when the home equity loans were acquired. The trial court quickly dispensed with this erroneous position. Community indebtedness secured by separate property do not convert separate property to community property. Husband made no argument that the Wife had \"gifted\" a portion of the home to him when the deed was purportedly taken in joint names,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and again the trial court correctly advised counsel that had a gift occurred, the home would not be community property; a one-half interest would belong to the separate estate of each spouse.

Wife was the bookkeeper. Following their separation, she moved out of the marital home and into an apartment with her mother. The two children came with her. The rent for the apartment was $1,480 a month; her mother helped with rent but the mother's contribution was not developed in the record. Wife obtained another bookkeeping job that paid her $2,550 per month after deductions. Wife first defends the trial court's decision through the realities of what happened when she did not receive spousal maintenance. Husband was ordered to pay interim spousal of maintenance of $675 per month. He made only a partial payment in October 2015, and had not paid anything from November 2015 until the date of trial in February 2016. During that period, Wife testified that things had \"been really tight\" and the phone service was cut off for a time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Otherwise, our record is devoid of information about whether Wife lacked minimal reasonable needs without spousal support. There was no development of her monthly fixed and variable expenses. She testified that she got help from others, but did not say what. Wife's net monthly income after taxes is $2,550.00. Child support payments under the final decree total $1,462.00. If the trial court considered the addition of Wife's separate property, as the Family Code requires, the $34,800.57 from the house sale, divided over the same twenty-four month time-period as the spousal support payments, nets Wife another $1,450 per month. These three sources of income total $5,512.00 per month. Adding the spousal support to that sum would provide Wife more in monthly resources as a single woman than she shared as community property while married ($6,741 versus $6,149.41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Wife also points us to several bad acts of Husband that can be considered under Section 8.052. Those factors, however, apply only once the trial court had determined that a spouse is\n   <em>\n    eligible\n   </em>\n   for spousal support. TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 8.052. Our problem with this record is the lack of any development of the Wife's minimal reasonable needs, which is a predicate before any of the matters under Section 8.052 come into play. Based on the sparse testimony of the minimal reasonable needs for the Wife, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding spousal support from the date of the divorce decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   We sustain Issue Six and reform the final divorce decree to delete the award of spousal maintenance from the date of the final decree forward. Because our analysis considers the separate property awarded to Wife as of the date of the decree, we do not disturb the judgment for unpaid spousal support that accrued up to the date of the final decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    AWARD OF GUARDIAN AD LITEM FEES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Husband's seventh issue complains that the trial court assessed the ad litem fees against him without making a finding that it was in the best interest of the children. We overrule the issue because Husband never complained about the allocation of the fee below, either at the hearing when the final decree was\n   signed, or by post judgment motion. The trial court had actually entered an interim order in April 2015 that appointed the guardian ad litem and ordered the cost to be paid for by Husband. Husband points to no place in the record where he ever complained of that order. Accordingly, the issue is not preserved for review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simon v. York Crane &amp; Rigging Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9983016\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/739/793/#p795\">\n    739 S.W.2d 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 795 (Tex. 1987) (holding defendant waived objection to ad litem fee by failing to object at fee hearing, and then failing to make record of new trial hearing that did raise issue). We overrule Issue Seven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    RIGHT TO DESIGNATE PRIMARY RESIDENCE AND POSSESSION ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In his eighth issue, Husband contends the trial court abused its discretion by disregarding the periods of possession recommended by the guardian ad litem in favor of that preferred by the children. Over the course of their separation, the parents tried different living arrangements with the children. By the time of trial, both parents essentially agreed that on joint managing conservatorship, but each wanted to designate the primary residence. The trial court took testimony on the issue from both parents, the guardian ad litem, and interviewed the children in chambers. The final decree names Wife the joint managing conservator with the right to designate the primary residence without geographic limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Much of the trial testimony pertained to education and where the children should go to school. At the time of the final hearing, the 16-year-old was living with Wife and was enrolled as a junior at Bastrop High School. Some testimony, if credited by the trial judge, established that she was doing better academically at this school than at Cedar Creek High School where she went while she lived with Husband. The child desired to stay at Bastrop High School. The 14-year-old initially attended middle school in Cedar Creek. After having problems there, a mediated agreement allowed the younger daughter to be home schooled for the Fall semester of 2015 while residing with Wife. The home schooling option apparently failed and the ad litem claimed the girl just stayed in a bedroom logged onto the internet. A subsequent interim order directed that she would be re-enrolled into the Cedar Creek school absent an agreement of both parents in writing. But Wife unilaterally enrolled her in a school in Austin for the Spring semester of 2016, which was apparently close to Wife's work location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The younger daughter has issues with anxiety attacks, depression, and social phobias. She was on medications, and at one time was admitted to a facility under the care of a psychiatrist. The evidence conflicted over how well she was doing in the Austin school setting. She had only been in that school for a month and half by the time of trial. Nonetheless, there was some testimony that Austin schools might be better suited to handle her unique needs. While the ad litem did not agree with the decision to move the child to the Austin school, she conceded it would not be good to move the child back to Cedar Creek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The trial judge was also confronted with conflicting testimony about the spouses parenting abilities. Wife claimed that Husband had anger control issues and overreacted in the presence of the children. Husband contended that he was the stable influence in the family and that without the structure he provided, the children were regressing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The court-appointed attorney ad litem supported Husband's parenting plan. The ad litem's rationale was multi-fold. First, the ad litem did not trust Wife based on\n   specific instances where Wife had told the ad litem one thing that either could not be verified or appeared to be affirmatively untrue. Second, Wife had failed to abide by several of the ad litem's recommendations that had been incorporated into mediated settlement agreements, and had made several unilateral parenting decisions without Husband's input. Additionally, the ad litem believed that the children did better in the periods of time when they stayed with Husband, and poorer when they stayed with Wife. In her words, \"[t]hey just don't do well with their mom, she can't control them.\" The ad litem also believed that the Wife was attempting to alienate the children from their father. She acknowledged some of that same behavior with Husband as well. The ad litem had a good relationship with the older child, but the younger child was openly hostile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Over the course of the litigation, both children expressed different preferences for living arrangements. By the time of the hearing, however, both wanted to live with Wife. They were interviewed by the trial judge in chambers. With Husband's agreement, no record of the interview was taken, but there was no dispute that by the time of the final hearing, both children desired to live with Wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The best interest of the child is always the primary consideration in determining issues of conservatorship and possession. TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 153.002 (West 2014). Courts may use the non-exhaustive list of\n   <em>\n    Holley\n   </em>\n   factors to determine the child's best interest.\n   <em>\n    Holley v.

For each of the\n   <em>\n    Holley\n   </em>\n   factors that would be relevant to this dispute, the trial court was confronted with conflicting testimony. For instance, the children had expressed different preferences on where to live, but as the date of the hearing, they both desired to live with their mother. While Husband elicited evidence that the younger child was regressing in Wife's care, the record also contains evidence that the child was doing better in the new setting of the Austin school. As the fact finder, the trial court necessarily had to determine credibility, and assign the relative weight to each witnesses' testimony, including that of the ad litem. Husband has not convinced us that the presumed findings supporting the trial court's decision were so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The trial court is vested with broad discretion in designating a child's primary residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    Gardner v.

After reviewing the record, we conclude the trial court had sufficient evidence upon which to exercise its discretion and, based on the evidence concerning all the relevant circumstances, did not abuse that discretion in designating Wife as the managing conservator with the exclusive right to designate the primary residence without geographic limitation. We overrule Issue Eight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    ELECTION OF THE EXPANDED POSSESSION PERIOD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In his final issue, Husband complains that the trial court did not grant him expanded possession times provided for in Section 153.317. Under the standard possession order as entered, Wife must surrender the children to Husband at 6:00 p.m. on designated Fridays, and Husband must then return the children to Wife by 6:00 p.m. on Sunday. This and other specific times for surrendering the children are set by statute, and were incorporated into the final decree (the Standard Possession Order).

We need only address the first. Wife argues that Husband's election came too late. Section 153.317 requires the possessory conservator to make the election \"\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    at the time of\n   </em>\n   the rendition of a possession order.\" [Emphasis added].\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8350752\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/233/896/#p901\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 153.317(b). In this case, the trial court apparently discussed its resolution of the various issues with the attorneys on February 17, 2016, following the hearing. The final decree was signed at a hearing on March 2, 2016. The final decree recites that the divorce was \"judicially PRONOUNCED AND RENDERED in court at Bastrop, Bastrop County, Texas, on February 17, 2016 and further noted on the court's docket sheet on the same date, but signed on March 2, 2016.\" Husband did not contest the recitation in the final decree.
