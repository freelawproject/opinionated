Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Robison has been licensed as a general bail bond agent since 2007. A month before his license was set to expire, Robison applied to renew his license with the director of the Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions, and Professional Registration. The department filed a petition requesting the director deny Robison's license renewal application, alleging Robison was disqualified for licensure because he failed to meet the surety qualifications requiring a bail bond agent to have \"no outstanding forfeiture or unsatisfied judgment thereon entered upon any bail bond.\" Rule 33.17(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prior to submitting his renewal application, Robison submitted a number of affidavits identifying unsatisfied judgments levied against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result of the outstanding judgments, the director denied Robison's application for renewal. Included with the rejection order was a notice of Robison's legal right to file a complaint with the Administrative Hearing Commission, pursuant to \u00a7 621.120, within 30 days after the mailing of the notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rather than exercising his right to file a complaint with the Commission, Robison opted to file a petition for a writ of mandamus in the Cole County circuit court. Robison's petition alleged the director issued the order denying his application for renewal without proper notice and an opportunity to be heard. The circuit court granted a preliminary writ, but after a hearing, quashed the preliminary writ. Robison appealed and, after opinion by the court of appeals, this Court transferred pursuant to article V, \u00a7 10 of the Missouri Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Robison argues the circuit court erred when it quashed the preliminary writ and denied his request for a permanent writ of mandamus because \u00a7 374.750 unconstitutionally denied him due process by allowing the director to summarily refuse to renew his license without first giving him notice and an opportunity for a hearing. The director asserts Robison is not entitled to writ relief because Robison failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by not seeking review before the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"An appellate court reviews the denial of a petition for writ of mandamus for an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Boresi\n   </em>\n   , 396 S.W.3d at 359. \"An abuse of discretion in denying a writ occurs when the circuit court misapplies the applicable statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Contested or non-contested\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When reviewing a governmental agency's decision, this Court considers whether the matter before the agency was a \"contested\" or \"non-contested case\" to determine the scope of judicial review.\n   <em>\n    Furlong Cos., Inc. v.

The director contends the case is contested because had Robison appealed to the Commission, there would have been a proceeding in which Robison's legal rights, duties, or privileges would be determined. However, the director ignores that, even if Robison had filed a complaint with the Commission, the director would have retained her discretion to refuse his license renewal pursuant to \u00a7 374.051.1, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Any applicant refused a license or the renewal of a license by order of the director under sections 374.755, 374.787, and 375.141 may file a petition with the administrative hearing commission alleging that the director has refused the license. The administrative hearing commission shall conduct hearings and make findings of fact and conclusions of law in determining whether the applicant may be disqualified by statute.\n   <strong>\n    Notwithstanding section 621.120, the director shall retain discretion in refusing a license or renewal and such discretion shall not transfer to the administrative hearing commission\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Emphasis added). As this Court has held, when a proceeding is merely advisory and does not bind the decision-maker \"to any gauge or criteria,\" then the administrative proceeding or hearing does not make the matter a contested case, and review does not fall under \u00a7 536.100.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9148325\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/145/427/#p428\">\n    145 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   428-29 ;\n   <em>\n    Kunzie v.

Because the director retained her discretion to refuse Robison's license renewal even if Robison had pursued his administrative remedy, this is a non-contested case governed by \u00a7 536.150.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Administrative remedies must be exhausted in non-contested cases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 536.150.1 provides a right to judicial review when an agency decision is \"not subject to administrative review.\" Thus, \u00a7 536.150.1 requires exhaustion of administrative remedies before seeking judicial review of non-contested cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Impey v.

In determining \u00a7 536.150 did not require exhaustion of administrative remedies,\n   <em>\n    Strozewski\n   </em>\n   focused on subsection 3 of \u00a7 536.150, which provides, \"Nothing in this section shall be construed ... to limit the jurisdiction of any court or the scope of any remedy available in the absence of this section.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10021930\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/875/905/#p907\">\n    875 S.W.2d at 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because judicial review pursuant to \u00a7 536.150.1 is statutorily restricted to when a governmental agency decision is not \"subject to administrative review,\" aggrieved parties must exhaust all their administrative remedies before seeking judicial review in a non-contested case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Robison is not required to exhaust administrative remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Although Robinson's non-contested case would normally require exhaustion of administrative review, the overruling of\n   <em>\n    Strozewski\n   </em>\n   requires prospective application of the exhaustion prerequisite. \"This Court has the authority to determine whether a decision changing a rule of law is to be applied retrospectively or prospectively.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Pursuant to \u00a7 374.730, \"All licenses issued to ... general bail bond agents under the provisions of sections 374.700 to 374.775\n   <strong>\n    shall\n   </strong>\n   be renewed biennially.\" (Emphasis added). However, \u00a7 374.750 provides the \"department\n   <strong>\n    may\n   </strong>\n   refuse to issue or renew any license required pursuant to sections 374.700 to 374.775 for any one or any combination of causes stated in section 374.755.\" (Emphasis added). Robison contends the permissive \"may,\" in regard to refusal, and the mandatory \"shall,\" in regard to renewal, means he has a clear and unequivocal right to renewal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   When looking at the context of \u00a7\u00a7 374.730 and 374.750, and harmonizing the two statutes, it is clear, however, the mandatory \"shall\" in regard to renewal is directed to the applicant, and the permissive \"may\" in regard to refusal is directed to the department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, a general bail bond agent must or shall seek license renewal every two years, and the director may refuse to renew the license in the presence of any of the factors outlined in \u00a7 374.755. One such factor, \u00a7 374.755.1(6), gives the director discretion to refuse renewal if the person applying has been in \"[v]iolation of any provision of ... the laws of this state.\" And this Court's rules provide, \"A person shall not be accepted as a surety on any bail bond unless the person ...

In a proper case, however, the Court needs to give this question greater attention than it has received to date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States Department of Veterans Affairs v. Boresi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093286\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/396/356/#p365\">\n    396 S.W.3d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 358 (Mo. banc 2013), and\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Ashby Road Partners, LLC v. State Tax Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297396\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/297/80/#p83\">\n    297 S.W.3d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83 (Mo. banc 2009), on which\n   <em>\n    Boresi\n   </em>\n   relies, the question was not what standard of review should apply but whether, if the circuit court denied a petition for extraordinary writ following the issuing of a summons rather than a preliminary writ, the petitioner should proceed by way of appeal or by filing the petition anew in a higher court. Both cases held appeal was the proper route, and neither devoted much attention to the proper standard of review to be applied in such an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Though the resolution of this question is unnecessary in this case, it is not a trivial matter. This Court often has said that extraordinary writs are discretionary.\n   <em>\n    Ashby Road\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297396\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/297/80/#p83\">\n    297 S.W.3d at 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But unlike other matters committed to a circuit court's discretion and reviewed on appeal for an abuse of that discretion (e.g., the admission or exclusion of evidence), this Court has stressed \"there is no\n   right to have the [extraordinary] writ issued.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297396\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/297/80/#p83\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The sort of discretion referred to seems different, for example, from the discretion to admit or exclude relevant evidence. Instead, when this Court states \"there is no right to have the [extraordinary] writ issued,\" it is suggesting that, no matter how perfectly pleaded the petition, and no matter how thoroughly proved the allegations, a court always may exercise its discretion not to issue an extraordinary writ. If so, neither the abuse of discretion standard of review nor the standard suggested in the Chief Justice's concurring opinion seems appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Of course, if the Court does not mean that the discretion to deny an otherwise proper petition for extraordinary writ is different from the discretion attending ordinary matters of trial preparation and presentation, it may need to moderate this language in future cases. But if the Court intends the broader meaning, as I always have understood, the Court perhaps should consider amending its rules (and overruling the cases requiring petitioners to proceed by appeal) to allow them-in all cases in which the petition is denied, by whatever means and on whatever grounds-simply to file the petition anew in that higher court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This approach would require an unsuccessful petitioner only to convince the higher court the petition has merit and that the higher court should exercise its discretion to grant the extraordinary writ, rather than having to carry the much heavier burden of showing the lower court abused its discretion by denying the petition. Viewed from the other perspective, this new approach would allow the higher court to issue a writ without having to impugn the lower court but, instead, merely by deciding to exercise its discretion differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Though the present case is poorly suited to address them, these issues are deserving of more attention and clarity than they have received in the past. As a result, I am content for the present to merely join the Court in affirming the result reached in the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    \"An appeal will lie from the denial of a writ petition when a lower court has issued a preliminary order in mandamus but then denies a permanent writ.\"\n    <em>\n     U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs v.

If the extraordinary writ being denied by a circuit court is the writ of prohibition, regardless of whether a preliminary writ was issued by the circuit court, I would agree the only relief for the petitioner is to seek a writ in a higher court. But historically the writ of mandamus and its unique procedure are different, and when denial of the writ of mandamus produces a final judgment, review of the judgment is by appeal, but if the denial does not produce a final judgment, the only relief is to seek a writ in a higher court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    This approach also would avoid having to perpetuate largely meaningless distinctions such as those between petitions denied after summons and those denied after preliminary writ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Boresi\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093286\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/396/356/#p365\">\n     396 S.W.3d at 358\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and between denials that occur \"on the merits\" and those that occur on some other basis,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Powell v.

At the same time, it may shed light on more meaningful distinctions between and among the different extraordinary writs and the circumstances in which they are sought-differences that exist both in statute and in historical practice but that, in modern practice, often are ignored.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
