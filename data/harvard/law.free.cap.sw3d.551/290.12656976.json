At the extreme, if the City substantially deprives a landowner of all economically viable uses of the property, the City is subject to a constitutional takings claim which overcomes governmental immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the land use regulation is illegal or unconstitutional, a property owner may seek a declaration to that affect, which also overcomes immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, the owners of a parcel of land in Austin pursued two other options.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   They filed a declaratory judgment action against the city to\n   <em>\n    construe\n   </em>\n   several of its ordinances. Additionally, they sued various city officials claiming they acted\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   by misapplying city ordinances. The trial court dismissed both these claims on a plea to the jurisdiction, and further denied the land owners leave to amend their petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We agree with the trial court that governmental immunity precludes a declaratory judgment claim against the City of Austin to construe its ordinances. The holding is somewhat academic in this case, however, because we must construe the same ordinances to determine if the land owners have validly asserted an\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   claim against several City officials. In doing so, we conclude that the trial court correctly construed the ordinances (and thus correctly dismissed the\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   claims). Finally, we conclude the trial court did not err in denying leave to amend, and affirm the judgment below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises from a dispute between the Ali and Donna Tabrizi (the Tabrizis) and the City of Austin (the City) over the Tabrizis' desire to build a house on an undeveloped piece of land. The Tabrizis allege in their last live pleading that they purchased the lot in 2013, which was a .56 acre \"remainder\" lot from four subdivisions developed around it. Their lot is not itself in a subdivision, nor has it been platted. It has, however, been on the tax\n   roles for more than forty years and is zoned for residential use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When the Tabrizis investigated obtaining a building permit, they were told by the City that they would need to first obtain a plat, which required them to file a subdivision application. Title 25 of the City's municipal code governs development. Subdivision and platting regulations are found in Chapter 25-4 of that title.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Austin, Tex. Austin City Code, ch. 25-4 et. seq. (2018) (hereinafter, City Code). But as a part of that application process, the City required the Tabrizis to comply with its environmental restrictions, as found in Chapter 25-8. That chapter includes a section addressing \"critical environmental features.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-8, \u00a7 25-8-281. As it turns out, there is a \"seep\" on the back end of the Tabrizis' lot which is one type of critical environmental feature referenced in the code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Eventually, the Tabrizis' proposed a subdivision that divided their property into two lots-one that would remain undeveloped and buffer the seep-and the other to be used for their residence. Nonetheless, the City rejected their application and a further request to obtain a variance from the environmental rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Tabrizis then sought to circumvent the subdivision platting altogether. Under Chapter 25-4, a property is exempt from platting if it (1) is five acres or less, (2) existed in its current configuration on January 1, 1995, (3) was receiving utility services on January 1, 1995, as authorized under the rules of a utility provider, (4) is located on an existing street, and (5) complies with the requirements for roadway frontage.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at ch. 25-4, \u00a7 25-4-2(D). The only predicate at issue in this case was whether the lot had received utility service on January 1, 1995. The lot abuts a street with curbs and gutters. The Tabrizis contended that the curb and gutter drainage facilities qualified the lot as receiving utility service. The City disagreed and declined to grant an exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Tabrizis then filed this lawsuit against the City and three of its employees in their official capacity. The Tabrizis' last amended petition seeks a declaration that (1) the requirements of Chapter 25-8 (the environmental rules) do not apply to their subdivision application and that the actions of the several officials were\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   by applying 25-8 to their application, and (2) they meet the exception from platting as found in Section 25-4-2 because the lot was \"receiving utility service\" on January 1, 1995.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The City and its officials filed a plea to the jurisdiction supported in part with the affidavit of Charles Lesniak, the chief environmental officer for the City. The Tabrizis objected to portions of his affidavit. Eventually his entire deposition was attached to the plea to the jurisdiction record. The trial court sustained the objections to Lesniak's affidavit, but viewed the matter as a legal dispute that could be decided from the petition and the City ordinances. Based on its review, the trial court concluded that it had no jurisdiction to consider a declaratory suit against the City to construe its ordinances. The court also concluded the\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   claims failed because the City officials were acting pursuant to their authority under the development ordinance. The Tabrizis sought leave to amend their petition, which the trial court denied. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW GOVERNING LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When it applies, governmental immunity protects political subdivisions of\n   the State, including cities, from suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wichita Falls State Hospital v.

The Tabrizis' suit seeks a declaration under the Texas Declaratory Judgment Act (the\n   DJA).

The land was appropriately zoned, thus the next step they faced was obtaining a subdivision approval. The Tabrizis argue, however, that the environmental rules in Chapter 25-8 do not apply at the subdivision stage, particularly when they only seek to plat the land. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 25-4-84 addresses who may approve a plat and the criteria to be used. The decision rests, depending on the circumstances, with either the Director, the Land Use Commission, or City Council.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587134\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/988/376/#p379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 25-4-84(1),(2),(3). Either of those decision makers \"shall approve a plat that complies with the Comprehensive Plan and the requirements\n   <em>\n    of this title.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587134\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/988/376/#p379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 25-4-84 (B) [Emphasis added]. Title 25 covers development, and one chapter in the that title, 25-8, includes the environmental rules. Similarly, Section 25-4-1 (A), titled \"compliance,\" requires that a subdivision in the zoning jurisdiction \"must comply with all requirement\n   <em>\n    of this title.\n   </em>\n   \" [Emphasis added].\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587134\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/988/376/#p379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Again, the environmental rules are found in Title 25. The connection between the subdivision and environmental rules makes sense in this case. To account for the seep on their property, the Tabrizis eventually proposed subdividing their land into two lots, with one containing the seep and a buffer to protect it. That division would fit hand-in-glove with Section 25-8-281 that generally precludes residential development near critical environmental features.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587134\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/988/376/#p379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 25-8-281 (\"A residential lot may not include a critical environmental feature or be located within 50 feet of a critical environmental feature.\"). The section also includes detailed provisions for buffer zones required around critical environmental features. The specific details of their subdivision plan, and the reason it was rejected are not before us, nor essential to this appeal. It is enough to note that the environmental rules might be circumvented if they do not apply at the subdivision-platting stage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The City also calls our attention to Section 25-8-21 within the environmental chapter, titled \"Applicability.\" It states that except \"as provided in Subsection (B), this subchapter applies in the planning jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587134\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/988/376/#p379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The lot at issue is within the planning jurisdiction. More instructive language is found in the exception subsection, that covers the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction in Travis County. The exception sets out its application to \"a preliminary plan, final plat, or subdivision construction plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587134\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/988/376/#p379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 25-8-21(B). The import of the exception language is the clear inference that environmental regulations apply to all those steps in the development process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   There is an additional indication these chapters were all meant to be considered together. Section 25-1-251 sets out a procedure for \"Applications for Adjustment\" for water quality rules under Chapter 25-8. The ordinance provides that Applications \"may be considered only in connection with the review of: (1) a site plan; (2) a subdivision; or (3) other specific development project or proposal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-1, \u00a7 25-1-251(A). The Application for Adjustment procedure therefore contemplates that in the consideration of a subdivision, Chapter 25-8 environmental issues could be addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Tabrizis point out, however, that the City's chief environmental officer\n   was unable during his oral deposition to point out any authority for tying the environmental rules to the plat requirements. He also walked back some of the claims that he made in an affidavit about the requirements under the development code. \"Construction of a statute by the administrative agency charged with its enforcement is entitled to serious consideration, so long as the construction is reasonable and does not contradict the plain language of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Tarrant Appraisal Dist. v.

We are less sure, however, that an agency employee's inability to articulate the construction of a statute in a deposition, or in an affidavit, should overcome our construction of clear statutory language.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore decline to alter our construction based on the agency employee's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Tabrizis also argue that the applicable watershed protection rules in Section 25-8 only apply to \"development\" and their application to subdivision decision by itself, does not involve \"development.\" The argument overlooks that the subdivision plan is a defined predicate step towards the eventual construction of a home. In a sterile vacuum, a site plan, or even an application for a building permit, are not technically \"development\" under the ordinance's definition because by themselves, they are not the \"construction\" of a building. They are, however, critical to the process. We do not apply a construction that leads to absurd results, and therefore decline the Tabrizis' hyper-technical cabining the term \"development\" in Section 25-8-421.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, we find no support in the textual language of the ordinance for the Tabrizis' view that they only need a proper survey to plat the property. \"Plat approval, like zoning, is an exercise of the [governing entities'] police power.

The only relevant question under that exception was whether the lot was receiving \"utility service that was authorized under the rules of the utility provider\" on January 1, 1995. City Code ch. 25-4, \u00a7 25-4-2(B). The term \"utility service\" is not defined in the ordinance. The Tabrizis pleaded that the street gutter abutting the lot qualifies as \"utility service.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The City attached to its plea to the jurisdiction an informational document for those pursuing the exception. That document states, \"Utility service means that the property has an electric, water, wastewater, or gas meter. Water and wastewater tap permits without a meter or utility accounts are not acceptable.\" The trial court concluded that while the City's \"definition may be imprecise or too narrow, ... there is no ordinary meaning of 'utility' that includes a gutter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We find no ready definition of the term \"utility service.\" The word utility or utility provider is defined by statute in some technical applications, such as for the Public Utilities Commission.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pub. Util. Commn. of Texas v.

In more common parlance, the term \"utility\" means \"a service provided by a public utility\" and \"a unit composed of one or more pieces of equipment [usually] connected to or part of a structure and designed to provide a service (as heat, light, power, water, or sewage disposal).\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary,\n   </em>\n   2525 (unabridged ed. 1993);\n   <em>\n    see also Black's Law Dictionary,\n   </em>\n   1780 (10th ed.)(defining \"utility\" in part as \"[a] business enterprise that performs an essential public service and that is subject to governmental regulation\" and defining \"public utility\" as \"[a] company that provides necessary services to the public, such as telephone lines and service, electricity, and water\"). Under the common dictionary definition, a street gutter that redirects water would not intuitively qualify as a utility service provided to the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The City does charge property owners a \"drainage utility fee\" to pay for the City's operation and maintenance of its drainage infrastructure. That infrastructure includes street gutters, and the discharge culverts they feed. The fee, however, was never assessed to this property. The Tabrizis argue, however, that the City cannot consider drainage a \"utility\" for charging a fee, but consider it something else for the purposes of the grandfathering exception. The City responds in part that the drainage utility fee is charged to property that discharges storm water into the City's drainage system. From the limited record here, the property appears to slope away from the roadway, and it is unclear if storm water flows from the property to the street of vice versa. But equally important, the exemption statute already contains a condition that the grandfathered property must be located on an existing street. City Code, ch. 25-4, \u00a7 25-4-2(D)(4). If a drainage utility fee based on curbs and gutters qualified as a utility, it would be redundant to specify it again as a part of the \"utility service\" requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   An\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   claim here requires that a City official (1) acted without legal authority in denying the exemption, or (2) had a ministerial duty to grant the exemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Emmett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6875745\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/459/578/#p587\">\n    459 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   587 ;\n   <em>\n    Heinrich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301546\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/284/366/\">\n    284 S.W.3d at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Tabrizis do not claim that the City officials violated a ministerial duty. Rather, they argue the definition of a public utility is sufficiently clouded to create a fact issue, thus preventing a summary dismissal of their claim. The question then is whether the City officials acted without legal authority, which turns on whether the officials had the discretion to interpret Section 25-4-2(D) as they apparently did, thereby limiting it to electric, water, wastewater, or gas services hook-ups.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Texas Supreme Court recently clarified what it means for an official to act \"without legal authority\" in\n   <em>\n    Houston Belt &amp; Terminal Ry.

We agree, therefore, that the Tabrizis have not asserted a valid\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   claim for the denial of the exemption under Section 25-4-2(D) and we overrule Issue Three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Motion to Amend\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   After the trial court issued a letter ruling stating that it would grant the plea to the jurisdiction, the Tabrizis moved for leave to amend their petition.

First, the petition adds the factual allegation that the Tabrizis initially submitted a one-lot subdivision application. They were then told that an environmental assessment report was needed. When that\n   environmental assessment was performed, the City required the Tabrizis to resubmit their application as a two-lot subdivision to create the \"buffer zone lot\" for the seep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The second change adds an allegation that because of the approval of four subdivisions surrounding their orphaned property, the Tabrizis' lot had already been subdivided. They made this claim by adding the following italicized language to their earlier allegation: \"This property is a remainder parcel\n   <em>\n    that was subdivided from its parent property decades earlier.\n   </em>\n   Four subdivisions, all of which were approved by the City of Austin, surround the property in its entirety.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, they sought to add a third alternative claim, seeking:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (a) a declaration that they are not subdividing land within the meaning of Chapter 25-4 of the Austin City Code and (b) that the actions of the Officials were ultra vires to the extent that they required the Tabrizis to submit a subdivision application as a prerequisite for submission of an application for a building permit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The trial court concluded that none of these changes would support an\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   claim. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   By alleging that they were told to resubmit their platting request to subdivide the property, the Tabrizis only confirm that the City believed that the environmental rules pertaining to a seep applied to a platting request. We also conclude that the proper construction of the City Code supports that view. Thus, whether they originally submitted a one-lot or two-lot application is of no moment. No City official acted in an\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   fashion by insisting on enforcement of the environmental provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The additional clarification of the petition that alleges the property had been\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   subdivided years earlier also does not change our analysis. As the trial judge alluded to, the Tabrizis point to no code provision that addresses or sanctions\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   subdivisions. Without such authority, an official could hardly have a ministerial duty to recognize such a subdivision, nor be without legal authority to resist it. Moreover, the allegation claims only that the property had been subdivided, not that it had already been platted. As we point out, an express requirement for platting is compliance with the title 25, which includes the environmental chapter. City Code, ch. 25-4, \u00a7 25-4-84 (B). Thus, even is the Tabrizis claim is limited to platting, it still must meet chapter 25-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The last proposed change adds the allegation that the Tabrizis need not \"submit a subdivision application as a prerequisite for submission of an application for a building permit.\" That claim, however, is starkly at odds with the \"Order of Process\" provision that provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00a7 25-1-61-ORDER OF PROCESS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (A) An applicant must obtain approvals in the following order:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (1) zoning;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (2) subdivision;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (3) site plan; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (4) building permit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (B) An applicant may concurrently file applications for the approvals listed in Subsection (A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8350528\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/233/835/#p840\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ch. 25-1, \u00a7 25-1-61. Other than to claim that the property had already been\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   subdivided, a claim we already reject, we do not understand how the Tabrizis can simply allege that they can skip a step in the process. More importantly, we fail to see how a City official acted in an\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   fashion by failing to allow them to do so. We overrule Issues Four and Five.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As the Austin Court of Appeals wrote, \"merely asserting legal conclusions or labeling a defendant's actions as 'ultra vires,' 'illegal,' or 'unconstitutional' does not suffice to plead an ultra vires claim-what matters is whether the\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   alleged constitute actions beyond the governmental actor's statutory authority, properly construed.\" [Emphasis in original].\n   <em>\n    Texas Dept. of Transp. v. Sunset Transp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7317930\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/357/691/#p701\">\n    357 S.W.3d 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 702 (Tex.App.-Austin 2011, no pet.),\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Creedmoor-Maha Water Supply Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7325811\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/307/505/#p513\">\n    307 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   515-16 &amp; nn. 7-8. We conclude that in applying the pleaded facts to the appropriate construction of the City Code, the Tabrizis have failed to allege a viable\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   claim. Three attempts at re-pleading the claim have not changed that fact. While we sympathize with the Tabrizis' situation, we are constrained to enforce the City and its officials' governmental immunity claim.
