Alvarez, Justice\n   In this mandamus proceeding, relator complains of the trial court's order directing relator to designate one or more individuals to testify about certain matters relator alleges encompass trade secret information. Relator asserts the trial court's order allows plaintiffs access to the trade secret information without requiring plaintiffs to establish a necessity for the information. Relator also asserts the order is vague. We conditionally grant the petition for writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Ricardo Garza was involved in an automobile accident. Ricardo and his wife (hereinafter, the \"plaintiffs\") sued Daimler Trucks North America, LLC (\"relator\") asserting the accident was caused by relator's defective design and manufacture of the truck Ricardo was driving. During discovery, plaintiffs served relator with several notices of deposition, in which they asked relator to designate a person or persons to testify about a wide variety of matters. Relator designated Anthony Moore to testify on its behalf at the first deposition held in October 2017. Plaintiffs later amended their notice of deposition to list additional deposition topics or to change the date and time of a subsequent deposition. Relator moved for a protective order on the scope of this later deposition and raised several objections to plaintiffs' discovery request, including that the request sought trade secret information. In support of this objection, relator submitted the affidavit of Amer Diab in which he identified thirty matters relating to cost and profit information that he contended were trade secrets. Plaintiffs responded, arguing (1) relator failed to satisfy its burden to show the thirty matters constituted privileged trade secrets, (2) plaintiffs satisfied their burden to show the information was necessary to a fair adjudication of their case, and (3) the parties had already entered into a stipulated protective order applicable to any confidential information. Relator responded asserting it had satisfied its burden, but plaintiffs did not satisfy their burden, and the stipulated protective order did not adequately protect the cost and profit-related trade secrets requested by plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 5, 2018, the trial court conducted a hearing on the various arguments and objections described above. Following the hearing, the trial court signed the order at issue here. In its order, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Additionally, although the Court is not persuaded that [relator] has met its burden under Texas Rule of Evidence 507 (\"Trade Secrets Privilege\") as to all 30 subject matters identified in the Amer Diab affidavit (Defendant's Exhibit \"D\"), the Court nevertheless finds, as a matter of caution, (i) that those 30 subject matters encompass trade secret information, (ii) that the Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that the 30 subject matters identified in the Diab affidavit encompass information necessary to the fair adjudication of their claims, (iii) that the 30 subject matters identified in the Diab affidavit encompass competitively sensitive information and/or confidential business information covered by the Stipulated Protective Order signed by this Court on February 15, 2017, and (iv) that the dissemination of such information at the deposition, or at any time thereafter, may only take place pursuant to the Stipulated Protective Order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In this mandamus proceeding, relator does not object to the entirety of the order. Instead, relator objects only to the following decretal paragraph:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   As to the 30 subject matters identified in the Diab affidavit as encompassing trade secret information, [relator] SHALL designate one or more individuals to testify on its behalf with respect to such matters to the extent such matters are known or reasonably available to [relator], subject to [relator's] right to object to questions propounded during the deposition as provided by Rule 199.5(e), and subject also to the provisions of the Stipulated Protective Order signed by this Court on February 15, 2017, and on file among the papers of this cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After relator filed its petition for writ of mandamus, this court requested a response, stayed the above portion of the trial court's order, and granted relator's request that its petition for writ of mandamus and its mandamus record be sealed. The plaintiffs, as real parties in interest, filed a response. In its petition, relator asserts it established the trade secret nature of its cost and profit information and the plaintiffs did not refute the trade secret status. Relator then asserts plaintiffs failed to satisfy their burden to establish, by competent evidence, that the information they seek is necessary to a fair adjudication of their claims. Finally, relator asserts the order is vague and requires relator to \"create\" trade secret information. In their response to the petition, plaintiffs assert the petition is premature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a preliminary matter, we address this argument first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    IS THE PETITION PREMATURE?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs assert the petition for writ of mandamus is premature because the trial court has not yet rendered a decision on the matters for which relator seeks relief. Plaintiffs contend the trial court's order does not require relator to provide any information at the deposition. Instead, according to plaintiffs, the order only requires relator to designate a person to testify on its behalf at a deposition \"in which questions might be asked regarding matters [relator] considers to be trade secrets.\" Plaintiffs rely on Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 199.5(e) to contend relator may object during the deposition if it believes the information sought is a trade secret.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court's order states, in part, that relator \"SHALL designate one or more individuals to testify on its behalf with respect to [the 30 subject matters] to the extent such matters are known or reasonably available to [relator], subject to [relator's] right to object to questions propounded during the deposition as provided by Rule 199.5(e).\" Rule 199.5(e) provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   Objections to questions during the oral deposition are limited to \"Objection, leading\" and \"Objection, form.\" Objections to testimony during the oral deposition are limited to \"Objection, nonresponsive.\" These objections are waived if not stated as phrased during the oral deposition. All other objections need not be made or recorded during the oral deposition to be later raised with the court. The objecting party must give a clear and concise explanation of an objection if requested by the party taking\n   the oral deposition, or the objection is waived. Argumentative or suggestive objections or explanations waive objection and may be grounds for terminating the oral deposition or assessing costs or other sanctions. The officer taking the oral deposition will not rule on objections but must record them for ruling by the court. The officer taking the oral deposition must not fail to record testimony because an objection has been made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   TEX. R. CIV.

Mandamus relief is appropriate from an order that improperly requires disclosure of a trade secret.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9097941\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/113/735/#p738\">\n    113 S.W.3d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 738 (Tex. 2003) (orig. proceeding). \"If a trial court orders production once trade secret status is proven, but the party seeking production has not shown a necessity for the requested materials, the trial court's action is an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9097941\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/113/735/#p738\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, because the trial court ordered a deposition that encompasses possible trade secrets, we conclude relator's petition is not premature, and we next consider whether the parties satisfied their burden regarding the discovery of trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    TRADE SECRET'S SHIFTING BURDENS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Texas Rule of Evidence 507 provides a privilege entitling a party to refuse to disclose its trade secrets \"if the allowance of the privilege will not tend to conceal fraud or otherwise work injustice.\" TEX.

Relator asserts plaintiffs failed to satisfy their burden with competent evidence. Plaintiffs counter that evidence, such as an expert's affidavit, is not always necessary to demonstrate the need for trade secret information. To resolve this issue, we must decide whether plaintiffs were required to present evidence to satisfy their burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We begin with the elements of plaintiff's cause of action. To prove a design defect, the plaintiffs must show (1) there was a safer alternative design; (2) the safer alternative design would have prevented or significantly reduced the risk of injury, without substantially impairing the product's utility; and (3) the safer alternative design was both technologically and economically feasible when the product left the control of the manufacturer.

At the January 5, 2018 hearing, plaintiffs' attorney explained that showing the economic feasibility of a safer alternative design went \"to the core of our case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs' counsel alleged economic feasibility could only be evaluated in relation to the total costs and the total sales price of the vehicle, comparable vehicles, and the component parts. But, the plaintiffs presented no evidence or proof of their need for the information. The entirety of their \"proof\" consisted of counsel stating the above section 82.005 factors and then asserting economic feasibility went to \"the core\" of plaintiffs' case and could only be evaluated \"in relation to the total costs and the total sales price of the vehicle, comparable vehicles and the component parts.\" Counsel then argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   We've outlined in our petition what our claims are and what we have to prove via chapter 82 in order to carry the day and prevail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-32\">\n   ... If the resisting party meets its burden, the burden shifts to the party seeking the trade secret discovery to establish that the information is necessary for a fair adjudication of its claim, which we've done so by showing the Court what we've alleged and what chapter 82 requires in order for us to carry the day. And that goes to the economic feasibility, Your Honor, in chapter 82.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    In their response, plaintiffs also assert the petition should be dismissed because relator did not comply with Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 52.3(j), which provides that \"[t]he person filing the petition must certify that he or she has reviewed the petition and concluded that every factual statement in the petition is supported by competent evidence included in the appendix or record.\" Tex.

Two other components, the automatic seat pull down system and the seat integrated side airbag are known collectively as the roll tech system, they're either standard or optional features in the companion Cascadia model that Mr. Moore identified in his deposition that had been manufactured and came off the assembly line before this truck was manufactured.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    So and there again to prove economic feasibility, which is what we're required to do, we have to show the costs and the sales price of those components when they're added to a truck and the costs and sales price of the truck to which they would be added, which includes the Cascadia.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    And then lastly, Judge, the remaining two design changes, the strengthening certain features of the cab installing a roll bar, they're not presently available as options on the truck that Mr. Garza was driving, but to determine economic feasibility of strengthening the cab features, we'd have to know at the outset the cost of the features in their current condition in the tractor Mr. Garza was driving. We need to know whether Daimler attempted to strength the cab in the related Cascadia model that Mr. Moore identified. And if so, the costs of doing that in the Cascadia model. ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    But, Judge, in sum, the information identified in the Diab affidavit is necessary to a fair adjudication of the plaintiff's claim, which is what the case law tells us. And we have to get this information in order to prove our case.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Other than counsel's arguments, plaintiffs offered no witness testimony or other evidence that the information they sought from relator was necessary for a fair adjudication of their claims. Instead, plaintiffs' attorney merely pointed to the allegations in plaintiffs' petition and to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code chapter 82, and argued that because section 82.005 required certain proof, the information sought from relator was necessary to a fair adjudication of plaintiffs' case. Relator objected that the plaintiffs needed more than mere arguments from an attorney.

Plaintiffs attached Moore's deposition transcript to their motion to compel and they discussed some of Moore's testimony at the hearing, but they did not submit the deposition itself into evidence at the hearing. To the extent the trial court may have considered Moore's deposition testimony, we do not believe his testimony-as relator's corporate representative-addressed, much less showed, that relator's trade secret information was necessary to a fair adjudication of plaintiffs' claims. Furthermore, the fact that Moore testified at an earlier deposition does not waive relator's right to assert a trade secret objection about other information.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 614 (\"However, that Continental was willing to produce certain information under a protective order does not mean that Continental has waived its right to assert Rule 507 about other information\n    which it may regard as more competitively sensitive or less necessary for the plaintiffs' case.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    We conclude plaintiffs did not meet their burden to establish the information they sought is \"necessary for a fair adjudication of [their] claims.\"\n    <em>\n     Cont'lGen.
