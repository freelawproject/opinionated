Allstate filed a petition for writ of mandamus specifically complaining about only two of the rulings, as discussed further below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because we conclude the two rulings are overly broad, we conditionally grant the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Allstate issued an insurance policy on Jones's property in San Antonio. After his property sustained damage in an April 2016 hailstorm, Jones filed a claim with Allstate. After two inspections of the house, Allstate paid for some damage, but Allstate determined the roof sustained no covered damage and refused payment. Jones contended the roof should be replaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Jones later sued Allstate, alleging breach of contract and violations of the Texas Insurance Code. Jones served Allstate with requests for production and interrogatories. Allstate objected, and the trial court overruled the objections, but limited the scope of some of the requests. In this mandamus proceeding, Allstate complains about only two of these rulings. Allstate raised the same objections to both requests: the requests were irrelevant, not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, constituted a fishing expedition, and would cause great expense and burden. Below are the two complained-of discovery requests and the trial court's rulings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Request for Production 1: Produce any and all documents, relating to or arising out of any and all claims filed by your insured(s) and/or paid by you arising out of the hail storm(s) on or about April 2016, within a 5 mile radius of 103 Tabard Dr. San Antonio, Texas 78213.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Trial court ruling:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Overrules Defendant's objection(s) to Plaintiff's First Request for Production, production number 1, and compels Defendant to fully respond within 14 days. Limited to Zip Codes 78213, 78201 and 78230 only to investigation and photos and photos produced in native format.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Interrogatory 17: Please state the address, name, and telephone number of every insured of you [sic] within a 5 mile radius of 103 Tabard Dr., San Antonio, Texas 78213 in which you paid for any damage relating to the event, resulting\n   out of a litigation, mediation, claim, or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Trial court ruling:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Overrules Defendant's objection(s) to Plaintiff's First Set of Interrogatories, interrogatory number 17, and compels Defendant to fully respond within 14 days. Limited to Zip Code 78213 and produce for in camera review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the hearing on his motion to compel, Jones argued the discovery he sought was probative and not a fishing expedition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   We want to put a map. It's probative for the jury to put up a map. Here's my client's house. Allstate insured this house and this house two blocks over, a block away, a block south, three blocks north and they paid for this roof and they paid for this roof and they paid-so we can draw a diagram for the jury to look at and say, Here's the hail storm, we have radar imaging that shows it's going over my client's house, and they have accepted liability for this roof and this roof and this roof but they skipped my client's roof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   So it is absolutely probative. It is not a fishing expedition because we have weather data, scientific data from NOAA that says the hail hit in my client's location. I just don't have one that's right at his address. And if they pay for other damages or they have accepted liability-I'm limiting it in scope because I'm saying only hail damage. I'm limiting it in scope because I'm saying only this event. And I'm limiting it in scope because I'm saying, Only where you actually paid for a claim, where you've accepted liability whether through mediation or through lawsuits, you-a jury or your claims adjuster said, Yeah, we have hail damage here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ... We're limited in scope to this storm, we're limited in scope as to only hail damage, we're limited in scope as to the location of plaintiff's house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"A discovery order that compels production beyond the rules of procedure is an abuse of discretion for which mandamus is the proper remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Nat'l Lloyds Ins.

The Supreme Court continued, \"this is especially so given the many variables associated with a particular claim, such as when the claim was filed, the condition of the property at the time of filing (including the presence of any preexisting damage), and the type and extent of damage inflicted by the covered event.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902023\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/449/486/#p488\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, \"[s]couring claim files in hopes of finding similarly situated claimants whose claims were evaluated differently from Erving's\" in order to prove that National Lloyds breached the contract by underpaying her \"[was] at best an 'impermissible fishing expedition.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902023\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/449/486/#p488\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). Thus, the Supreme Court held that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the insurer \"to produce evidence related to insurance claims other than the plaintiff's.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902023\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/449/486/#p488\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902023\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/449/486/#p488\">\n    at 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We conclude the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    National Lloyds\n   </em>\n   applies here. In\n   <em>\n    National Lloyds\n   </em>\n   , the insured sought to compare the information sought in discovery for the purpose of finding similarly-situated parties whose claims were treated differently than her claim. Here, Jones seeks the discovery from Allstate for the same purpose. In\n   <em>\n    National Lloyds\n   </em>\n   , the relator argued the trial court did not abuse its discretion because its discovery order was narrowly tailored. At the hearing before the trial court here, Jones made a similar argument: \"We're limited in scope to this storm, we're limited in scope as to only hail damage, we're limited in scope as to the location of plaintiff's house.\" \"But such limits in and of themselves do not render the underlying information discoverable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902023\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/449/486/#p488\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902023\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/449/486/#p488\">\n    at 489-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude that, \"[b]ecause the information [Jones] seeks is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, the trial court's order compelling discovery of such information is necessarily overbroad.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902023\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/449/486/#p488\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 490 (citing TEX.
