Code Crim. Proc. Ann. Arts. 62.101 -.102 (West Supp. 2016). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant was charged on March 26, 2014, with failing to comply with sex offender registration requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the indictment alleged that Appellant failed to report to the Fort Worth Police Department (FWPD) within 30 days before or after his birthday.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   art. 62.058(a) (West Supp. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 6, 2014, Appellant's counsel filed a request for discovery seeking \"all business records and governmental records that are available to the prosecution or within the knowledge of the prosecution\" and \"[a]ll exculpatory evidence and facts which are known or by the exercise of due diligence should be known by the prosecution.\" On the same day, Appellant also filed a motion for discovery and inspection of evidence that included a request for \"[a]ll videotapes and tape recordings of the Defendant.\" On October 2, 2014, Appellant issued a subpoena seeking,\n   in relevant part, any video recordings showing the reception or front desk area of the FWPD's downtown location from December 23, 2013, through February 10, 2014. In response to the subpoena, the State filed an affidavit by Officer Bryan Bice stating that he was the custodian of records for the FWPD and that, after a diligent search, the FWPD had not located any such video recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellant filed a motion to dismiss the case on the basis that the State had violated article 39.14 of the code of criminal procedure and\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963), and had committed spoliation of evidence. According to Appellant, any such video would have contained exculpatory or mitigating evidence showing that he attempted to register within 30 days of his birthday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At trial, a hearing was held outside the presence of the jury. Officer Bice testified that at the time of trial he was working in the SCRAM unit and meeting with and registering sex offenders who had made appointments to meet with him. Until about two months before trial, Officer Bice was the custodian of records and prepared records in response to public information requests and subpoenas. Officer Bice testified that there was a video camera in the reception area of the FWPD's downtown location at 350 W. Belknap and that the recordings from that camera are stored on a hard drive with limited storage capacity. According to Officer Bice, the hard drive would record over previously-recorded video once it reached its storage capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When he received the subpoena from Appellant's counsel, Officer Bice looked for video recordings and was told by an IT employee, Michael Munday, that none existed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Bice testified that he based his affidavit on Munday's representation that no video recordings existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Officer William Yager of the FWPD testified that he had experience retrieving video footage from the lobby area of the FWPD downtown building.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Officer Yager, video recordings of the lobby were retained by the FWPD for approximately two to three months. He acknowledged that the FWPD contracted with another company, Sentinel, which provided the software and cameras for the recording system, but he denied that Sentinel had any access to any of the video. Officer Yager testified that he did not believe a video recorded from December 23, 2013, through February 10, 2014, would have been in existence at the time of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Matt Bryant, a vice president of Sentinel, testified that Sentinel did not store any video recordings made by the system and that all recordings were stored onsite in hardware located in the FWPD building. Bryant further testified that the storage server in the FWPD building worked on a \"first in, first out\" configuration in which old video is overwritten by new video when the storage drive reaches its capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Munday testified that he managed most of the FWPD's IT infrastructure and that the requested recordings would not have been in existence at the time they were requested in October 2014. Munday testified that it would be possible to download\n   recordings to larger hard drives in order to preserve them, but that no such protocol was in place within the FWPD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court denied Appellant's motion to dismiss and his request for a spoliation instruction. Appellant was convicted of failing to comply with sex offender registration requirements and sentenced to five years' confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Appellant brings two points on appeal. In his first point, he argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss on the basis of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and article 39.14(a). In his second point, he argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss, declining to exclude related evidence, and refusing to give the jury an adverse inference instruction because the State destroyed \"potentially exculpatory evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Brady claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addressing the State's failure to preserve evidence in a criminal trial, there is a distinction between \"material exculpatory evidence\" and \"potentially useful evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona v. Youngblood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1495598\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/51/#p57\">\n    488 U.S. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57-58,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1495598\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/51/#p57\">\n    109 S.Ct. 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1495598\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/51/#p57\">\n    102 L.Ed.2d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988) ;\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Napper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321573\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/322/202/#p229\">\n    322 S.W.3d 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 229 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). A federal due process violation occurs if the State fails to disclose material exculpatory evidence, regardless of whether the State acted in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    Illinois v. Fisher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897554\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/544/#p547\">\n    540 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 547,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897554\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/544/#p547\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1202,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897554\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/544/#p547\">\n    157 L.Ed.2d 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Thus, a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim requires proof that the sought-after evidence was both material and favorable to the defendant such that there is a reasonable probability that had the evidence been disclosed, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\n   <em>\n    Pena v.

We think that requiring a defendant to show bad faith on the part of the police both limits the extent of the police's obligation to preserve evidence to reasonable bounds and confines it to that class of cases where the interests of justice most clearly require it,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those cases in which the police themselves by their conduct indicate that the evidence could form a basis for exonerating the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1495598\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/51/#p57\">\n    488 U.S. at 57-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1495598\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/51/#p57\">\n    109 S.Ct. at 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Appellant admits that the testimony indicated that the video recordings he sought had been destroyed and were not in existence by the time they were subpoenaed prior to trial.
