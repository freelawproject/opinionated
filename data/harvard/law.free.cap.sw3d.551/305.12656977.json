TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp;REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 51.016 (West 2015) (permitting an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act). ReadyOne Industries, Inc. raises one issue contending the trial court abused its discretion in denying its motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings pending arbitration. For the reasons that follow, we\n   reverse and remand with instructions to enter an order compelling arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   ReadyOne is a garment manufacturer located in El Paso, Texas. Pursuant to a contract with the United States Government, ReadyOne manufactures and supplies apparel for the United States Military. ReadyOne's involvement in interstate commerce includes purchasing goods and services from out-of-state that are shipped to it in Texas, and manufacturing goods that are then shipped and used out of state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   ReadyOne employed Iveth Rodriguez Lopez in May 2011 as a sewing machine operator. On May 31, 2011, she signed a document entitled \"Receipt and Arbitration Acknowledgment.\" Her signature acknowledged that she received and read, or had the opportunity to read, the following documents: the Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate (MAA), the Benefits Schedule, and the Summary Plan Description (SPD) for the Employee Injury Benefit Plan. She further acknowledged by her signature that claims and disputes covered under the MAA \"must be submitted to an arbitrator, rather than a judge and jury in court;\" that she and ReadyOne were mutually \"agreeing to comply with [the] arbitration requirements;\" that all covered claims would be subject to the MAA; and that \"any decision of an arbitrator will be final and binding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The MAA signed by the parties provided that all covered claims would be exclusively resolved by binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The MAA set out all arbitration procedures, contained an integration clause providing that it constituted the complete agreement and superseded any prior agreement regarding arbitration; and indicated that any oral representations made before or after Lopez was hired did not alter the MAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In October 2013, Lopez claimed that she suffered injuries resulting from \"repetitive sewing tasks.\" In her affidavit submitted to the trial court, Lopez did not deny signing the MAA, but rather, insisted that she did not remember signing the document. She stated that she signed numerous documents related to her employment and hiring, but ultimately did not know why she was signing them. According to her affidavit, ReadyOne told her that the documents were for benefits if she got hurt on the job. She further claimed to have been misled into believing that the documents were not important and were only routine documents that ReadyOne needed to complete its paperwork for her employment. She did not know that: (1) she was signing an arbitration agreement; (2) she was waiving her rights; (3) she could seek the advice of counsel before signing the documents; or (4) she was permitted to decline to sign the documents. She also claimed that ReadyOne never told her that the arbitration agreement was a \"stand-alone\" document and she was not given any time to review the documents before signing them. Finally, Lopez contended that ReadyOne never told her that she was signing an arbitration agreement or what that meant, no one ever explained to her the contents of the documents or their effect, she was never provided with an orientation session, and no one ever translated the documents for her. She insisted that she never would have signed the arbitration agreement had she been advised that it meant she was waiving her right to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In addition to her claims concerning the MAA, Lopez's affidavit also provided the trial court with a description of several learning disorders from which she suffers, including: a dysthymic disorder, reading\n   disorder, disorder of written expression, and a language disorder. She further related to the trial court that she had a reading ability below the second grade level and experienced difficulties with her memory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Lopez filed her original petition in April 2014 and alleged that no valid MAA existed. She provided the following reasons, relevant to this appeal, as to why the MAA and Injury Benefit Plan were void and invalid:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) is inapplicable to the MAA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 The documents are procedurally and substantively unconscionable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 The MAA is unenforceable because the FAA is unconstitutional under the Tenth Amendment of the United States for hourly employees involved in a labor job.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 The MAA is void in violation of the Texas Labor Code Sections 406.033(e) and 406.035.

TEX.CIV.PRAC. &amp; REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 171.002(a)(3) (West 2011).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In response, ReadyOne filed its original answer as well as a motion to compel arbitration. In support of its motion, ReadyOne submitted the affidavit of its Director of Human Resources and Compliance, Guadalupe Madrid, and the following five documents: (1) the MAA (Exhibit A); (2) the Receipt and Arbitration Acknowledgment (Exhibit B); (3) the Employee Injury Benefit Plan (Exhibit C); (4) the Summary Plan Description (SPD) (Exhibit D); and (5) the Employee Orientation PowerPoint Presentation (Exhibit E). Following a hearing in August 2014, the trial court denied the motion to compel. ReadyOne now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DENIAL OF ARBITRATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In its sole issue, ReadyOne challenges the order refusing to compel arbitration. Lopez raised several arguments in opposition to the motion to compel arbitration and the trial court denied the motion without specifying the basis for the ruling. ReadyOne has addressed each of these arguments and defenses on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review and Relevant Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We review a trial court's decision to grant or deny a motion to compel arbitration for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Ellman v.

In\n   <em>\n    Bernhardt\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff entered into an employment contract with Polygraphic to become superintendent of the company's lithograph plant in Vermont.\n   <em>\n    Bernhardt v.

Further, ReadyOne submitted evidence that it was regularly engaged in interstate commerce in that it purchases and receives goods and services from outside the state of Texas and it manufactures goods that are shipped and used outside of the state. We conclude that the FAA applies to the MAA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Border Steel, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8401874\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/229/825/#p830\">\n    229 S.W.3d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 830-31 (Tex. App.-El Paso 2007) (orig. proceeding)(holding that the FAA applied where the defendant presented evidence that it engaged in interstate commerce and the arbitration agreement contained a provision that the FAA governed). Therefore, to the extent the trial court denied ReadyOne's\n   motion on this basis, it erred in doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The MAA is not Ambiguous or Illusory\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lopez asserted at the trial court level that the MAA is illusory and, thus, invalid because it bestows upon ReadyOne the unilateral right to terminate it at any time.\n   <em>\n    In re Odyssey Healthcare, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324640\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/310/419/#p424\">\n    310 S.W.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424 (Tex. 2010) (arbitration agreement is illusory if one party can avoid its promise to arbitrate by unilaterally amending or terminating arbitration provision). At the heart of Lopez's assertion is her contention that the MAA is incorporated by reference in the SPD and the Injury Benefit Plan. Therefore, according to Lopez, the provisions for termination and amendment in these documents apply rather than the termination provision in the MAA. She is mistaken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The MAA is a five-page, thirteen-paragraph document requiring ReadyOne and Lopez to arbitrate covered claims arising on or after October 1, 2007. Paragraph 5 addresses the scope of the agreement to arbitrate and provides: \"[t]his Agreement is mutual, covering all claims that Company or Claimant may have which arise from ... [a]ny injury suffered by Claimant while in the [c]ourse and [s]cope of Claimant's employment with Company[.]\" Paragraph 10, titled \"Termination of Agreement,\" states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Company shall have the right to prospectively terminate this Agreement. Termination is not effective for Covered Claims which accrued or occurred prior to the date of the termination. Termination is also not effective until ten (10) days after reasonable notice is given to Claimant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This provision is not illusory because it does not permit ReadyOne to unilaterally or retrospectively terminate the agreement and requires ReadyOne to provide ten days' notice to prospectively terminate.\n   <em>\n    In re Halliburton Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11446703\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/80/566/#p569\">\n    80 S.W.3d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 569-70 (Tex. 2002) (holding that language preventing an employer from retroactively applying arbitration agreement changes to claims of which it had actual knowledge, combined with a provision furnishing ten days' advance notice to employees before unilateral termination of the agreement, rendered the agreement non-illusory because it restricted the employer from \"avoid[ing] its promise to arbitrate by amending the provision or terminating it altogether\");\n   <em>\n    ReadyOne Industries, Inc. v.

In the Injury Benefit Plan, the provisions state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   12.1\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Termination and Amendment.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The Company shall have the right and power at any time and from time to time to amend this Plan, in whole or in part, on behalf of all Employers, and at any time to terminate this Plan or any Employer's participation hereunder; provided, however, that no such amendment or termination shall reduce the amount of any benefit then due and payable to, or with respect to, a Participant under the Plan in connection with an Injury occurring prior to the date of such amendment or termination. Any such amendment or termination shall be pursuant to formal written action of a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   This Plan document shall also automatically cease to be effective for all purposes as of the date of the cancellation, final expiration, or non-renewal of a Comprehensive Employers Indemnity policy issued to the Company through The Combined Group, except for purposes of the administration of any open claims occurring prior such date. Only the Company's proper adoption of another, successor benefit plan document can prevent such automatic termination of this Plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In the SPD, the provisions state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF PLAN\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The company presently intends to continue the Plan indefinitely, but the Company reserves the right to amend, modify, or terminate the Plan at any time; provided, however, no amendment or termination of the Plan will reduce the amount of any benefit then due and payable under the Plan to or with respect to you in connection with an Injury occurring prior to the date of such amendment or termination. Any such amendment or termination will be adopted pursuant to formal written action of a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The trial court could have so concluded, according to Lopez, by resolving certain latent ambiguities in her favor in unity with the pertinent rules of contract construction. Contrary to her assertion, neither the phraseology in the MAA nor the make-up of the parties' agreement is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Whether an arbitration agreement is ambiguous is a question of law subject to de novo review.\n   <em>\n    In re D.

The agreement is referred to as the \"Agreement\" throughout the MAA but it is also referred to as the \"Arbitration Program\" in Paragraph 8. The term \"Program Agreement\" is used in Paragraph 12,\n   which is titled \"Sole and Entire Agreement\" and provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   This Program Agreement constitutes the parties' complete agreement and supersedes any prior agreement regarding arbitration of Covered Claims which occur during the Term of this Agreement. Any agreement contrary to, or modifying, any of the provisions included in this Agreement must be entered into, in writing, by the chief executive officer of Company. Oral representations made before or after Employee is hired do not alter this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We disagree with the notion the parties intended the term \"Program Agreement\" to mean something other than only the MAA. The fact that the term \"Program Agreement\" is not used anywhere else in the MAA does not necessarily mean it is susceptible to more than one meaning. Paragraph 12 states the agreement supersedes any \"prior agreement regarding arbitration of Covered Claims which occur during the Term of this Agreement.\" The MAA defines \"Covered Claims\" as any and all claims included in or described by Paragraph 5(a) and it specifically excludes from its reach \"[c]laims for benefits under the Company's Employee Injury Benefit Plan.\" When Paragraph 12 is considered as part of the entire MAA, it is obvious the phrase \"This Program Agreement\" is referring only to the parties' agreement to arbitrate covered claims. Because this term has a certain or definite meaning, the MAA is not ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Lopez's illusory defense provides no basis for denying ReadyOne's motion to compel arbitration.

The evidence established that Lopez was provided with both English and Spanish language versions of the documents at issue. Lopez averred in her affidavit that she has limited ability to read and write, and that she suffered from several types of learning disorders. She also did not remember signing the acknowledgment dated May 31, 2011. She recalled going to the facilities from time to time to sign numerous documents related to her employment, but she did not know why she was required to sign them. She claimed ReadyOne did not explain the documents to her in an orientation session, and she was told by someone from Human Resources \"that the documents are for benefits if you get hurt on the job, just sign them\" or words to that effect. Lopez also asserted that she was \"misled into believing that the documents were not important and were just routine documents that the company needed to complete their paperwork on my employment and so I could receive benefits if I was hurt on the job.\" Lopez additionally stated that she did not know she was signing an arbitration agreement and she was not told that she was giving up important rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    Delfingen\n   </em>\n   , Lopez argues that the trial court could have believed her affidavit and could have concluded that the statements made in that affidavit establish procedural unconscionability. In\n   <em>\n    Delfingen\n   </em>\n   , we upheld the trial court's order refusing to compel arbitration because the evidence showed that the plaintiff was illiterate in English, Spanish language versions of the documents in question were not provided to the plaintiff, and according to the plaintiff, a representative of the defendant affirmatively misrepresented the contents of the arbitration agreement.\n   <em>\n    Delfingen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092047\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/407/791/#p797\">\n    407 S.W.3d at 801-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Because these circumstances are not present here,\n   <em>\n    Delfingen\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable. Lopez stated that she had a below second grade reading level, but did not aver that she was illiterate. Moreover, we have already determined in our\n   <em>\n    Delfingen\n   </em>\n   decision that illiteracy, standing alone, is insufficient to establish that an arbitration agreement is unconscionable.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092047\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/407/791/#p797\">\n    407 S.W.3d at 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lopez also alleged that the documents were never translated for her but ReadyOne furnished her with Spanish-language versions of the MAA and the SPD. There is no evidence that Lopez was mentally incapacitated when she signed the Receipt and Acknowledgment. To prevail on a diminished mental capacity argument, Lopez must still establish that she was incapacitated to the extent that she could not have understood and did not understand what she was signing. Mere inhibition as to comprehension and concentration does not equate to material incapacitation.\n   <em>\n    In re ReadyOne Industries\n   </em>\n   , 394 S.W.3d at 687 ;\n   <em>\n    In re ReadyOne Industries\n   </em>\n   , 394 S.W.3d at 696.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We additionally note that it was the employee's unique circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Delfingen\n   </em>\n   which allowed her to succeed in preventing arbitration.

First, she alleged that the Arbitration Agreement is unenforceable under Section 406.033(a) of the Texas Labor Code. This statute provides that a non-subscriber negligence cause of action may not be waived by an employee before the employee's injury and any pre-injury agreement by an employee to waive a cause of action is void and unenforceable. TEX.LABOR CODE ANN. \u00a7 406.033(e) (West 2015). Section 406.033(a) does not render the Arbitration Agreement void because it is not a pre-injury waiver of her non-subscriber negligence cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Odyssey Healthcare, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324640\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/310/419/#p424\">\n    310 S.W.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423 (Tex. 2010) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Golden Peanut Co., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300118\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/298/629/#p631\">\n    298 S.W.3d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631 (Tex. 2009).
