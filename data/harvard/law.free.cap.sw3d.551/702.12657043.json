The waiver of sovereign immunity became effective on July 1, 2014, and applied to USERRA claims \"accruing on or after\" that date. After passage of the statute, the plaintiff brought a USERRA claim against the defendant, an entity of the State, but his claim was based on facts that occurred prior to August 8, 2011. The trial court dismissed the claim, explaining that the claim accrued prior to July 1, 2014, and remained barred by sovereign immunity. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the claim accrued on July 1, 2014, when the plaintiff gained a judicial remedy by the enactment of the statute waiving sovereign immunity. We conclude that the claim accrued prior to July 1, 2014, and remains barred by sovereign immunity. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Court of Appeals affirmed, explaining that Mr. Smith had filed a complaint on August 8, 2011, alleging\n   that the Guard \"violated USERRA by refusing to rehire him after he returned from active duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The Court of Appeals pointed out that Mr. Smith's filing of this complaint evidenced his awareness \"that he had suffered an injury as the result of [the Guard's] conduct\"\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the complaint was filed on August 8, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the Court of Appeals explained, it was \"undisputed that [Mr. Smith's] cause of action accrued prior to July 1, 2014.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This Court denied Mr. Smith's application for permission to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Not quite four months later, on January 4, 2016, Mr. Smith filed another complaint, for the third time bringing his case before the Circuit Court for Davidson County. In his 2016 complaint, from which the present appeal arises, Mr. Smith alleged the same facts in support of his USERRA claim. In addition, Mr. Smith challenged the constitutionality of Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-20-208, arguing that it violated the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. Specifically, Mr. Smith contended that by limiting the waiver of sovereign immunity to claims accruing after July 1, 2014, the General Assembly had imposed a statute of limitations on USERRA claims in violation of a 2008 federal statute\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   prohibiting the application of statutes of limitation to such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Guard moved to dismiss Mr. Smith's complaint and also defended the constitutionality of the statute. As grounds for dismissal, the Guard again relied on sovereign immunity, arguing that Mr. Smith's claim accrued before July 1, 2014, the date the waiver of sovereign immunity became effective. The Guard also raised res judicata as a basis for dismissal, pointing to the decisions in\n   <em>\n    Smith I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith II\n   </em>\n   . Finally, the Guard denied that Section 29-20-208 imposes a statute of limitations in violation of federal law and argued that it merely specifies the effective date of the waiver of sovereign immunity for USERRA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court rejected Mr. Smith's challenge to the constitutionality of the statute and again concluded that Mr. Smith's claim accrued prior to July 1, 2014, and therefore was barred by sovereign immunity. Accordingly, the trial court again dismissed Mr. Smith's lawsuit based on sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Tenn.

Like the Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Smith II\n   </em>\n   , the dissenting judge would have affirmed the dismissal on the ground that Mr. Smith's USERRA claim accrued in July 2011, long before the July 1, 2014 effective date of the waiver of sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8, 10 (McBrayer, J., dissenting).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Guard filed an application for permission to appeal pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 11, arguing that the Court of Appeals misapplied the standards of statutory construction applicable to waivers of sovereign immunity and misinterpreted Tennessee decisions addressing when a claim accrues.

This definition of accrual has prevailed in Tennessee since at least 1974, when\n   <em>\n    Teeters\n   </em>\n   was decided. Because we presume that the General Assembly knows the state of the law on a subject under consideration at the time it acts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319779\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/340/352/#p360\">\n    340 S.W.3d at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the General Assembly is presumed to have known of the many decisions of this Court defining accrual when it used that term to limit the waiver of sovereign immunity in Section 29-20-208 to USERRA claims accruing on or after July 1, 2014. We must, therefore, interpret the term \"accruing\" as used in the waiver of sovereign immunity consistently with these prior decisions to avoid inappropriately expanding the waiver beyond its intended scope. Therefore, to decide whether Mr. Smith's claim accrued before, on, or after July 1, 2014, we need only determine when Mr. Smith actually knew he had suffered\n   an injury as a result of the Guard's allegedly wrongful conduct. The answer to this question is abundantly clear. As the Court of Appeals itself stated in\n   <em>\n    Smith II\n   </em>\n   , it is undisputed that Mr. Smith had actual knowledge that he had suffered an injury as a result of the Guard's allegedly wrongful conduct sometime before August 8, 2011, when he first filed a complaint alleging a USERRA claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203455448\">\n    2015 WL 3455448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Mr. Smith's claim accrued, therefore, long before July 1, 2014, and remains barred by sovereign immunity, as the trial court determined, because Section 29-20-208 limited the waiver of sovereign immunity to USERRA claims\n   <em>\n    accruing\n   </em>\n   on or after July 1, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In so holding, we decline to adopt the Court of Appeals' majority's interpretation of the waiver of sovereign immunity. Doing so would inappropriately extend the scope of the waiver to encompass every claim that has arisen since USERRA was enacted in 1994, in contravention of the well-settled rule \"that statutes permitting suits against the State must be strictly construed.\"\n   <em>\n    Moreno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6825855\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/479/795/#p802\">\n    479 S.W.3d at 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Auto.

The\n   <em>\n    Wyatt\n   </em>\n   Court's definition of \"judicial remedy\" is entirely consistent with other decisions of this Court, already cited herein, discussing the concept of accrual. Applying that definition, we have no hesitation in concluding that the Court of Appeals' majority erred in determining that Mr. Smith's claim accrued on or after July 1, 2014. As already explained, Mr. Smith knew of his alleged injury and USERRA claim against the Guard sometime before August 8, 2011, the date he filed his initial complaint alleging a USERRA claim. Thus, Mr. Smith's claim accrued prior to July 1, 2014, and remains barred by sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. The judgment of the trial court dismissing this action is reinstated. Costs of this appeal are taxed to David R. Smith, for which execution may issue if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Jeffrey S.
