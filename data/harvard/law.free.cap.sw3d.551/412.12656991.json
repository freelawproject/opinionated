The circuit court also found that McKinney had not complied with various provisions of the case plan, including a failure to submit to random drug screens, because he had moved to Mississippi. The circuit court ordered McKinney to resolve his criminal matters and complete out-patient drug treatment.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      On July 27, 2017, DHS filed a petition to terminate McKinney's parental rights.

The court also found that McKinney had used drugs for over fifteen years, with his longest period of sobriety ending in 2012, and had not demonstrated sustained sobriety outside the prison setting.

Termination of parental rights is an extreme remedy and in derogation of a parent's natural rights; however, parental rights will not be enforced to the detriment or destruction of the health and well-being of the child.\n      <em>\n       Pine\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <em>\n       supra.\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-16\">\n      McKinney's first argument on appeal is that the circuit court erred in finding that returning M.M. to his custody would pose a risk of harm to the child. We hold that there was sufficient evidence to support this finding. The circuit court considered the recent involuntary termination of McKinney's parental rights to M.M.'s siblings, in which we affirmed the risk-of-harm finding based on evidence that McKinney had been in drug treatment only two days, had a long history of leaving rehabilitation programs before successfully completing them, and would likely need more intensive drug treatment than a standard twenty-one-day inpatient rehabilitation program.\n      <em>\n       McKinney\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386863\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/527/778/\">\n       2017 Ark. App. 475\n      </extracted-citation>\n      at 19, 527 S.W.3d at 791. In that appeal, we also noted that McKinney had been in and out of jail for several months and had provided no proof of employment, income, or stable housing.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 20, 527 S.W.3d at 790.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-17\">\n      We note that in the time since we affirmed the risk-of-harm analysis in McKinney's previous appeal, he has demonstrated very little progress in reducing those risk factors. He completed inpatient treatment on January 24, 2017. However, he\n     was then directed to complete twelve outpatient sessions but completed only four. He testified that he had been using illegal substances, including methamphetamine, for the past fifteen years without being able to sustain any prolonged period of sobriety. McKinney also chose to move to Mississippi, even though the terms of his probation required him to live in Arkansas. Since his last appeal, he was incarcerated for revocation of his probation because he had committed a new drug-related offense. At the time of the termination hearing, he was serving a three-year sentence. Although he testified that he would be released in November 2017, he had not yet been approved for parole. McKinney had previously testified that he would be released in October 2017, which did not happen. In short, he could not predict his release date with any certainty, and continued uncertainty is itself potentially harmful to children.\n      <em>\n       Brumley v. Ark.

In this case, McKinney married Natasha after her rights to their other three children had been terminated, and he testified that the last time he used meth in 2017, he used it with her. He violated the terms of his probation by living with her in Mississippi. In this case, McKinney remained married to Natasha even though this court affirmed in his previous appeal that their marriage was a subsequent factor demonstrating that return of M.M.'s siblings to McKinney's care was contrary to the juveniles' health, safety, and welfare.\n      <em>\n       McKinney\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386863\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/527/778/\">\n       2017 Ark.

The evidenced presented below demonstrates that McKinney has not become a safe, stable parent able to care for M.M., and McKinney's long history of drug addiction, incarceration, and poor judgment supports the court's risk-of-harm finding.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-20\">\n      McKinney's second argument on appeal is that there was insufficient evidence to support the court's finding that DHS made reasonable efforts at reunification. This argument is meritless because reasonable efforts were not required in this case. Under the juvenile code, reasonable efforts are a required element for termination on certain statutory grounds, but they are not required when a court of competent jurisdiction has found by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has had his or her parental rights involuntarily terminated as to a sibling of the child.\n      <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%209-27-303\">\n       Ark.
