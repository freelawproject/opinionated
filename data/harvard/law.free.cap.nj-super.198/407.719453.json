After he served the custodial portion of that probationary sentence and while still on probation, defendant was arrested and convicted of criminal trespass <em>(N.J. S.A. </em>2C:18-3). On August 13, 1982 he was sentenced on the trespass conviction to a custodial term of 12 months. Upon his plea of guilty to probation violation, defendant was also resentenced on the theft conviction to a concurrent custodial term of 4 years, against which he was granted credit of 41 days for time spent in custody while on probation. He appeals from both the trespass and the violation of probation judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">We find unpersuasive defendant\u2019s contention that the 1982 custodial sentence imposed on the probation violation constituted double jeopardy because he was thereby subjected to \u201ca custodial term in excess of the custodial term originally imposed and served as a condition of the probation sentence.\u201d The probationary term originally imposed was a \u201cconditional sentence\u201d under which defendant remained subject to a prison term for failure to comply with the conditions imposed by the court. <em>State v. Ryan, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7 n. 4, <em>cert. </em>den. 454 <em>U.S. </em>880, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>363, 70 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>190 (1981); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:45-3a(4). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>Ryan </em>found it \u201cbeyond question\u201d that the \u201cimposition of a custodial term after revocation of probation does not violate a defendant\u2019s double jeopardy rights.\u201d 86 <em>N.J. </em>at 8. It is immaterial whether a defendant has served a term of imprisonment or simply reported to a probation officer or performed some other obligation as a condition of his probation: in any such case, the court is authorized to impose a custodial sentence upon a probation violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Although it has been said that \u201cjeopardy attaches once the defendant has commenced serving his prison term,\u201d <em>Ryan, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 10, that principle applies only where the commencement of the sentence is \u201ccoupled with the defendant\u2019s expectation of finality in his original underlying conviction and sentence.\u201d <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>263, 270 (1984). Here, unlike <em>Ryan, </em>the original sentence imposed was conditional only and defendant accordingly had no legitimate expectation that the probationary sentence represented his maximum penal exposure at the time the sentence was imposed and his term of imprisonment began. The probationary sentence carried with it, as an essential term, the potential of a further custodial term if the conditions of probation were not fulfilled. That sentence was neither set aside nor increased after defendant commenced performing the obligations which it imposed. <em>Compare State v. Farr, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>463 (App.Div.1982); <em>State v. Watson, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>481 (App.Div.1983). The probationary sentence was not changed at all, but was simply carried out according to its terms. <em>See Ryan, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 10. Defendant\u2019s service of a term of imprisonment as a condition of his probation thus did not raise any constitutional bar against imposition of a further term of imprisonment upon resentencing following a probation violation. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 270; <em>see also State v. Burke, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>649 (Law Div.1983); <em>cf. United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>117, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>426, 66 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>328 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Defendant correctly points out that at his 1981 sentencing the judge did not \u201cspell out in unmistakable terms precisely what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>penalties may await a defendant who does not adhere to the conditions of his probation,\u201d as recommended by <em>Ryan, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 4 n. 1. But defendant had been placed on probation on at least two prior occasions as a juvenile and an adult; moreover he had executed a certification upon commencing this probationary term that he understood \u201cthat failure to comply on my part may result in the revocation of my probation and resentencing by the Court.\u201d Given those facts and the mandate of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:45~3a(4), we reject the suggestion that defendant entertained a reasonable expectation that no further custodial sentence could be imposed upon a violation of probation. <em>Compare Ryan, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 18 (Schreiber, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Defendant also contends that \u201cthe court did not take into consideration as a mitigating factor the intoxication of the defendant when sentencing him to 12 months in state prison for criminal trespass.\u201d We are satisfied that the sentencing judge gave heed to the legislative policies and to the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors and that the sentence which he fashioned was entirely proper. <em>See State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 364 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The judgments under review are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
