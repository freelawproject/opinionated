We affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Skillman in his written opinion reported at 191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>202 (Law Div.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Although we recognize that the United States Supreme Court disclaimed deciding the issue, we believe <em>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of US., Inc., </em>\u2014 <em>US. </em>-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984) implicitly extends the <em>New York Times v. Sullivan </em>requirement of \u201cactual malice\u201d to product disparagement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">The Court of Appeals entertained some doubt concerning the ruling that the New York Times rule should be applied to a claim of product disparagement based on a critical review of a loudspeaker system. We express no view on that ruling, but having accepted it for purposes of deciding this case, <em>we agree with the Court of Appeals that the difference between hearing violin sounds move around the room and hearing them wander back and forth fits easily within the breathing space that gives life to the First Amendment. Id. </em>104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1966, 80 L.Ed.2d at 525. [Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-11\">For a discussion of the relationship of product disparagement by noncompetitors to the First Amendment, see Note, \"Corporate Defamation and Product Disparagement: Narrowing the Analogy to Personal Defamation,\" 75 <em>Colum.L.Rev. </em>963, 986-993 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
