In view of the fact that counsel is notified of the argument date several weeks in advance (in this case six weeks), the event manifests a studied lack of consideration for this court. Unlike some intermediate courts of appeal, ours is a court which studies the record and the briefs carefully before oral argument. Where indicated\u2014and this appeal is such a matter\u2014law clerks are enrolled to analyze the matter in depth and prepare a comprehensive memorandum regarding it. This process takes a lot of time and a lot of work. Dilatoriness in striving for a settlement in a case where settlement is feasible and then in promptly notifying the court that it has occurred reflects not only a lack of consideration but a lack of concern for the wasted time and expense thereby incurred. In this day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>of crowded calendars not only in the trial courts but in the appellate courts as well\u2014more than 6,000 appeals were filed last year in the Appellate Division and historically the number of filings increas\u00e9s at the rate of 8% per year\u2014the discourtesy is not without an unhappy effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The appeal is dismissed with prejudice but without costs to any party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
