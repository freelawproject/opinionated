However, some further comment is necessary with respect to defendant\u2019s claim in <em>Point I, supra, </em>that the trial court\u2019s denial of his request for an adjournment was a clear abuse of discretion and resulted in a denial of his constitutional right to counsel of his own choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">The Sixth Amendment, applicable to the states by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 <em>U.S. </em>335, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), guarantees that in a criminal prosecution the \u201caccused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\u201d Our State Constitution guarantees nothing less. <em>N.J.Const.Art. </em>I, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>1110. <em>See State v. Fusco, </em>93 <em>N.J. 578, </em>583 (1983); <em>State v. Sugar, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>1, 15-17 (1980). An essential element of the constitutional right to the assistance of counsel is the right of a defendant to secure counsel of his own choice. <em>Chandler v. Fretag, </em>348 <em>U.S. </em>3, 75 <em>S.Ct. 1, </em>99 <em>L.Ed. </em>4 (1954); <em>Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 <em>U.S. </em>45, 53 <em>S.Ct. </em>55, 77 <em>L.Ed. </em>158 (1932). However, the right to retain counsel of one\u2019s own choice is not absolute, <em>United States ex rel. Carey v. Rundle, </em>409 F.2d 1210, 1215 (3d Cir.1969), <em>cert. </em>den. <em>sub nom. Carey v. Rundle, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>946, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>964, 25 L.Ed.2d 127 (1970); <em>State v. Reddy, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>32, 35 (App.Div.1975), and \u201ccannot be insisted upon in a manner that will obstruct an orderly procedure in courts of justice and deprive such courts of the exercise of their inherent powers to control the same.\u201d <em>Smith v. United States, </em>288 <em>Fed. </em>259, 261 (D.C.Cir.1923). <em>See also, United States v. Burton, </em>584 F.2d 485, 489 (D.C.Cir.1978), <em>cert. </em>den. 439 <em>U.S. </em>1069, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>837, 59 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>34 (1979); <em>Linton v. Perini, </em>656 <em>F.</em>2d 207, 209 (6th Cir.1981), <em>cert. </em>den. <em>sub nom. Perini v. Linton, </em>454 <em>U.S. </em>1162, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>1036, 71 L.Ed.2d 318 (1982); <em>Lee v. United States, </em>235 F.2d 219, 221 (D.C.Cir.1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">A defendant desiring to exercise the right to choose his own counsel must do so with reasonable diligence. <em>State v. McCombs, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>161, 165 (App.Div.1978), aff'd 81 <em>N.J. </em>373 (1979). The efficient administration of justice without unreasonable delay has great force and effect. The public has a strong interest in the prompt and effective operation of its judicial institutions. A trial court therefore must have the power to tightly control its own calendar so that the assignment of cases cannot be manipulated by the defense counsel or the defendant. <em>See Linton v. Perini, supra. </em>Consequently, when a defendant fails to act expeditiously in obtaining counsel of his own choice, the trial court must have the power to \u201cdo what is reasonably necessary to meet the situation.\u201d <em>State v. Yormark, </em>117 <em>N.J.Super. </em>315, 340 (App.Div.1971), modif. in part 61 <em>N.J. </em>202 (1972), <em>cert. </em>den. <em>sub nom. Perwin v. New Jersey, </em>409 <em>U.S. </em>862, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>151, 34 L.Ed.2d 109 (1972). <em>See also, State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number><em>Reddy, supra, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 35-36. The procedure that may generally be employed where defendant seeks to change counsel is to allow a reasonable adjournment to permit the defendant to retain counsel of his own choice. The granting of a continuance necessarily rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the exercise of that discretion will not constitute reversible error in the absence of a showing of an abuse of discretion causing defendant a manifest wrong or injury. <em>State v. Lamb, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>209, 213 (App.Div.1973); <em>State v. Smith, </em>87 <em>N.J.Super. </em>98, 105 (App.Div.1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">What constitutes a reasonable adjournment to permit a defendant to retain counsel of his own choice depends generally upon the surrounding facts and circumstances. One of the leading cases on the subject is <em>United States v. Burton, supra, </em>where the court commented on the factors to be considered in determining whether a reasonable delay is warranted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">Some of the factors to be considered in the balance include the length of the requested delay; whether other continuances have been requested and granted; the balanced convenience or inconvenience to the litigants, witnesses, counsel, and the court; whether the requested delay is for legitimate reasons, or whether it is dilatory, purposeful, or contrived; whether the defendant contributed to the circumstance which gives rise to the request for a continuance; whether the defendant has other competent counsel prepared to try the case, including the consideration of whether the other counsel was retained as lead or associate counsel; whether denying the continuance will result in identifiable prejudice to defendant\u2019s case, and if so, whether this prejudice is of a material or substantial nature; the complexity of the case; and other relevant factors which may appear in the context of any particular case. [584 <em>F.2d </em>at 490-491],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">When a defendant applies for an adjournment to enable him to substitute counsel, the trial court must strike a balance between its inherent and necessary right to control its own calendar and the public\u2019s interest in the orderly administration of justice, on the one hand, and the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to obtain counsel of his own choice, on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Applying the factors discussed in <em>United States v. Burton, supra, </em>we are satisfied that the trial judge did not mistakenly exercise his discretion by denying defendant\u2019s request for an adjournment and did not violate defendant\u2019s Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Amendment rights. The record shows that on May 1, 1982, defendant was arraigned on a charge of first degree robbery allegedly committed on March 21, 1982. Defendant was represented by William P. Cucco, Jr., (Cucco), a member of the bar of the State of New Jersey and an Assistant Deputy Public Defender in the Office of the Public Defender. On June 1, 1982, the case was pretried and marked ready for trial. Cucco agreed that he would complete his pretrial investigation by June 11, 1982. The case received a tentative trial date of July 6, 1982, and Cucco indicated that he would be ready to try the case at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Apparently the case was not reached on July 6, 1982. The trial judge, who was scheduled to go on vacation commencing July 12, 1982, spoke with the prosecutor and Cucco before doing so and learned from both of them that the case was still ready for trial and that they were prepared to try it in his absence. Since this was a jail case and the only jail case on the trial judge\u2019s calendar, it was sent to the acting criminal assignment judge so that the latter could assign it out to another judge for trial as scheduled. When the case was called there apparently were no trial judges available to try the case. The acting criminal assignment judge therefore marked the case as ready and scheduled it for July 26, 1982, to accommodate Cucco\u2019s vacation plans. When the trial court did not reach the case during the week of July 26, 1982, the court carried it further to accommodate the prosecutor\u2019s vacation plans (although the prosecutor indicated that someone else in his office was prepared to try the case in his absence). On August 10, 1982, when the trial judge returned from vacation and learned that the case had not been tried, he immediately notified the prosecutor and Cucco in writing that the trial would be held on August 30, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">A few days prior to August 30, 1982, Cucco advised the trial judge that defendant had retained or intended to retain as private counsel Bernard J. Czech (Czech), a member of the bar of New Jersey. This conversation represented the only knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>edge that the trial judge had that defendant intended to retain another attorney to replace Cucco until Czech made his application to be substituted for Cucco on the day of trial. Czech never informed the trial judge directly nor did he make any application to be substituted as counsel for defendant prior to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">On August 30, 1982, when the trial judge called the case for trial, Czech appeared and for the first time informed the trial judge of his intention to replace Cucco. Czech explained to the trial judge that he had met with defendant, who at the time was in jail, on August 19,1982, and that defendant had then decided to retain him. Defendant allegedly had obtained the funds to pay for a private attorney as a result of the recent settlement of a civil matter. After being retained Czech, without moving to be substituted as the attorney for defendant, appeared before the trial judge handling bail applications and succeeded in obtaining a reduction in defendant\u2019s bail. On August 23, 1982, Czech also represented defendant in a proceeding before the Newark Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Notwithstanding Czech\u2019s on-going representation of defendant, Czech did not inform either the trial court, the prosecutor or the Public Defender\u2019s office of his retention as defendant\u2019s attorney or move to be substituted as attorney for the defendant until the scheduled day of trial. Moreover, armed with the knowledge that defendant had been in jail awaiting trial and that a new court term was about to commence, Czech did not even communicate with the trial judge, the criminal assignment judge or his clerk, the prosecutor\u2019s office or the Public Defender\u2019s office to ascertain whether a trial date had been set and, if so, when the case was scheduled for trial. There cannot be any question that an attorney seeking to be substituted for another attorney in a matter has the responsibility at the time he is retained or as soon thereafter as possible to ascertain the status of the case on the court\u2019s calendar. In this regard, Czech conceded that he may have been \u201ca little dere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>lict\u201d in failing to reach out for the prosecutor the week before the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Before the trial judge Czech alleged that he had not learned of the trial date until that Monday morning, August 30, 1982, when during a proceeding in the Perth Amboy Municipal Court he received a call that the case was ready for trial. Czech explained that defendant had not learned of the trial date until told by his father late Friday afternoon, August 27, 1982. Defendant had tried to call Czech, but it was after 5:00 and everyone had left the office for the day. Czech himself went away for the weekend and therefore was unavailable. According to the record submitted on this appeal, it appears that Cucco sent a letter to defendant notifying him of the trial date. When Cucco did not receive a reply from defendant, he (Cucco) attempted to reach defendant by telephone on August 27, 1982. Cucco failed to reach defendant, but he did speak with defendant\u2019s father and informed him of the trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">On August 30, 1982, the scheduled trial date, the case had stood as a ready case for over a month-and-a-half. The State had its witnesses available in court and was ready to proceed. Czech, who admitted that he was not prepared to try the case, requested a month\u2019s adjournment. Czech informed the trial judge that he would probably be ready to try the case on September 13, but also allowed that he had \u201ca couple of trials in September, they\u2019re set down pre-emptively____\u201d He further informed the trial judge that he had \u201ctwo trial calls on September 13\u201d and because of the \u201ccoming weekend being a holiday weekend and a long weekend\u201d he had \u201cmade arrangements to be out of the State for the weekend.\u201d The trial judge denied defendant\u2019s request for adjournment and ordered the trial to proceed, reasoning in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">I\u2019m now asked to delay the trial for [a] reasonable period of time to allow a new attorney to become acquainted with it and to step into the picture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">I am not disposed to grant that request in these circumstances. Frankly, this was my trial for today, and I would not have anything to do otherwise; but, that\u2019s not the main factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The main factor is that this has been a ready case, and Mr. Furguson has known since July, for a good month-and-a-half that this is a ready case. And, I do not think now, when the State has its witnesses here, has gone to some difficulty in assembling them during the week before Labor Day, that it should then be put to having to reschedule all of this next month, particularly when no one saw fit officially to make a request, or advise the Court before today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">This is not, in any sense, in my mind, a deprivation of a right that Mr. Furguson possesses. He\u2019s been found to be qualified for public defender representation; he has been assigned a very competent, able, and experienced Public Defender to represent him. I don\u2019t think his interests in any way, are harmed by this decision; but, under the circumstances I do not think a delay is in order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The trial judge thereafter denied Czech\u2019s request that the case be carried until the following morning, August 31, 1982, and ordered defendant to proceed to trial with Cucco as his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">In the circumstances here present the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance would have further delayed the trial, thereby imposing unnecessary and unreasonable burdens on the judicial system, as well as the State and its witnesses. Further delays and calendar problems would necessarily follow if an adjournment were granted in such circumstances. Such delays undermine the effective and efficient administration of justice and inure to the detriment of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Moreover, the need for the requested adjournment arose in the first instance from Czech\u2019s and his client\u2019s neglect. Neither defendant nor his privately retained attorney Czech gave either the trial judge, the prosecutor or the Public Defender\u2019s office notice of the attempted substitution of counsel. No leave of court was sought pursuant to <em>R. </em>1:11-2 for the Public Defender to withdraw and the newly retained attorney to be substituted in his place until the day scheduled for trial. <em>R. </em>1:11-2 reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">1:11-2. Withdrawal or Substitution</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">After the entry of a plea in a criminal action or after the pretrial conference or the fixing of a trial date, whichever is earlier in a civil action, an attorney may withdraw from the action only by leave of court on written notice to all parties. Prior to such time, he may withdraw without leave of court if his client consents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>The obvious purpose of <em>R. </em>1:11-2 is to \u201cprevent delay and calendar problems.\u201d RALPH N. DEL DEO, NEW JERSEY PRACTICE\u2014VOL. I\u2014COURT RULES ANNOTATED, at 169 (3rd ed. 1969). Private counsel\u2019s conduct herein undisputably risked delay and interference with the court calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Finally, and equally important, defendant had competent, experienced counsel available and prepared to try the case and no complaint has been raised on this appeal that Cucco\u2019s representation was inadequate or that defendant was not afforded the reasonable effective assistance of counsel guaranteed him under the Constitution. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 80 <em>L.Ed. 2d </em>674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
