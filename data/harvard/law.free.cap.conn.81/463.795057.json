The lease, which was in writing, contained the following provision: \u201cIt is further mutually agreed that the lessee shall have the option at the expiration of this lease of renewing the same upon the same terms for a period of three years, provided he gives the lessor written notice of his intention to avail himself of said option six months before said lease expires. Should said lessee avail himself of said option, then at the expiration of said period of three years said lessee shall have the privilege of a further lease for the period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>five years at the annual rental of fifteen hundred ($1500) dollars, payable in semi-annual payments in advance, provided he gives the lessor the same notice as is above provided for the first renewal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-6\">The defendant entered into possession, occupied during the two years, and paid the stipulated rent therefor. On June 1st, 1906, and six months before the expiration of the two-year term of the lease, the defendant sent the plaintiff\u2019s agent in charge of the rental of the premises a telegram containing the words, \u201cWill continue lease on Nutmeg Park,\u201d and at the same time a letter addressed to said agent, as follows: \u201cShall continue to lease Nutmeg Park as per agreement.\u201d On June 5th the. agent wrote to the defendant in reply: \u201cWe are in receipt of your favor dated June 2d, notifying us that you avail yourself of the option given in the lease of the ' Nutmeg Park \u2019 property, as per the terms of said lease. We hereby accept the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-7\">The defendant has failed to execute a lease for any period subsequent to December 1st, 1906, although a draft of one for the term of three years thereafter, conformable in its provisions to the original lease, was tendered him for execution in July, 1906, and since the sending of said telegram and letter he has not, down to the time the action was commenced, February 18th, 1907, communicated with either the plaintiff or its agent with reference thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-8\">The possession of the premises has not been surrendered' to the plaintiff. The rent of the premises for the original term has been paid. No rent has been paid for any subsequent period. Between June 1st, 1906, and December 1st, 1906, the plaintiff had offers to lease the premises, and to dispose of them, which were refused in reliance upon the terms of the original lease and the defendant\u2019s two communications of June 1st, 1906.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-9\"><em>Frank J.

It is unnecessary to consider all these propositions. It might, for instance, be assumed that the terms of the original lease placed it in the power of the defendant to postpone the time for the exercise of his election until the expiration of the first lease, by his giving of a six months\u2019 notice of intention, and even that it gave him no right to effect a renewal until that time, and yet the defense must fail, since, even upon this theory, there would be no justification for the claims that an election could not be made before the expiration of the lease with the plaintiff\u2019s acquiescence, and that the provision for the giving of notice of intention had other importance than as a means of keeping alive the right of election until it should be exercised. The option which the lease gave to the defendant was in the nature of an offer on the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>part of a new lease upon the terms stated. <em>Willard </em>v. <em>Tayloe, </em>8 Wall. (U. S.) 557, 564; <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>3 Cush. (Mass.) 224, 227. When accepted as provided, the rights and obligations of the parties would become fixed. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Slee, </em>103 U. S. 828, 837; <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>3 Cush. (Mass.) 224, 227; <em>Guyer </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>175 Ill. 328, 335, 51 N. E. 580. The defendant\u2019s letter and telegram of June 1st, 1906, contained, in unequivocal language, an acceptance of the offer which the lease embodied, and the reply confirmed them as having that effect. The defendant\u2019s right of election was thereby fully exercised and the rights and liabilities of the parties fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">No other questions are presented by the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
