It was brought to the City Court of Waterbury, and the foreclosure of the mortgage was the only relief demanded in the original complaint. The amount of the matter in demand was therefore $80, the amount of the debt secured by the mortgage. General Statutes, \u00a7 541, The defendant moved to erase the case from the docket, and afterward demurred to the complaint, the ground of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>both the motion and demurrer being that the City Court of Waterbury had no jurisdiction to grant equitable relief. The denial of the motion to erase and the overruling of the demurrer are the errors assigned in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">By \u00a7 533 of the General Statutes, justices of the peace are given jurisdiction of \u201call civil actions for legal relief, wherein the matter in demand does not exceed one hundred dollars. . . .\u201d Section 534 provides that \u201call civil actions for equitable relief only, wherein the matter in demand does not exceed five hundred dollars, . . . shall be brought to the court of common pleas, except in counties where there is no such court.\u201d There is such a court in the county in which this action was brought. Section 562 provides that \u201c all borough, city, police, and town courts, and the officers thereof, shall have all the powers and jurisdiction which shall have been conferred upon them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Jurisdiction of civil actions was conferred by the legislature upon the City Court of Waterbury, by the following- language of \u00a7 22 of a special act of 1895 (12 Special Laws, pp. 60, 65): \u201cThe city court shall have jurisdiction of all civil actions wherein the matter in demand does not exceed one hundred dollars, provided the parties, or either of them, reside within the limits of the town of Waterbury; \u2022and shall have power to hear and try the same with or without a jury as may be proper, and proceed therein to final judgment and execution according to law. . . . But from all final judgments or decrees rendered or passed by said court, . . . the party feeling aggrieved thereby may appeal. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">No more apt words than \u201ccivil actions wherein the matter in demand does not exceed one hundred dollars\u201d could have been used to describe actions in which equitable relief only, or legal relief only, or both equitable and legal relief, to the amount named, is demanded in the complaint. That jurisdiction of actions demanding equitable relief, as well as of those demanding legal relief, were intended to be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>ferred by this section, is also indicated by the use of the word \u201call\u201d with the words \u201ccivil actions,\u201d and by the provision for an appeal both from all judgments rendered and all <em>decrees </em>passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">As used in the Practice Act, the term \u201ccivil actions\u201d is clearly intended to include actions demanding equitable or legal relief, or both. To do away with the old names and forms of the different actions at law and in equity, and enable a plaintiff to always demand and obtain, in one proceeding called a \u201ccivil action,\u201d both such equitable and legal relief as the facts alleged in his complaint entitled him to receive, were some of the principal purposes and results of the adoption of our Practice Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Section 7 of the Practice Act (\u00a7 613 of the General Statutes) provides that \u201cin every civil action, not brought before a justice of the peace, the plaintiff may include in his complaint both legal and equitable rights and causes of action, and demand both legal and equitable remedies.\u201d It follows that all our courts to which civil actions, as defined by the Practice Act, may properly be made returnable, excepting justice courts, may, in the absence of express law to the contrary, apply both legal and equitable remedies in the determination of -such actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The City Court properly denied the motion to erase, and overruled the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
