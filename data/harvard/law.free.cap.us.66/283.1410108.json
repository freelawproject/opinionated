A claim for land in California admitted by tbe United States to be regular and genuine confirmed to tbe proper owner, (the original \u25a0grantee or his assigns,) though the nonjinal claimant be one who derives title through a deed bearing date while the proceedings were pending and before the decree of concession.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-9\">Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the district of California.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-10\">This was.a claim for a tract-of land in Sonoma county, California, two leagues and a half in length by a quarter of a league in width, and called <em>Agua Calimte. </em>M. G. Yallejo filed his petition before the Land Commission claiming the tract above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>described under a deed from Lazaro Pi\u00f1a, to whom it had been granted in 1840 by Governor Alvarado. Before any testimony was taken in the case the attorneys of Vallejo withdrew from it and the Commission rejected the claim for lack of any proof, either of the original grant or of the alleged conveyance to Vallejo. Vallejo appealed to the District Court, and introduced a complete <em>espediente </em>from the archives showing that the grant had been made to Pi\u00f1a in 1840, and the journal of the Departmental Assembly, which proved that the title had been confirmed in 1845. The original grant was not produced, but was alleged to have been lost. . But while the decree of concession to Pi\u00f1a was dated July 13, 1840, the deed conveying the land to Vallejo under the same title bore date December 4th, 1839. This circumstance was not explained. In 1859 the District. Court confirmed the title to Vallejo, reserving, however, the rights of the heirs and assigns of Pi\u00f1a, \"so that the confirmation might inure to the benefit of any parties who could show a better title than.Vallejo', \u201cderived from the original grantee by deed, devise, descent, or otherwise.\u201d From this decree the United States.\" appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-5\"><em>Mr. </em>Black, of Pennsylvania, for the United States.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0F\">The title-papers in this case are clearly genuine. There is no doubt that Pi\u00f1a petitioned for. land; that Alvarado granted 'it; that the title was properly recorded and afterwards approved by the Departmental Assembly. . If Pi\u00f1a were the claimant before the court instead of Vallejo, the United States would not opr pose his claim. But the conveyance to Vallejo is dated more than six months before the land was granted. In October,. 1839, Pi\u00f1a had petitioned Vallejo, as Commandant General, to. grant him the tract-in question, and Vallejo had given him. a provisional concession, to last until he should have time to get a title from the Government. On the 4th of the following December Pi\u00f1a conveyed the land to Vallejo, and on the 13th of July of the next year his grant'issued. This conveyance was\u25a0 a fraud upon the Mexican Government. Pi\u00f1a had ho right to sell to another an expectant grant, for which he was asking in his own name and for his own benefit. Vallejo had already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>received from the Government as many leagues as the law allowed to be united in one hand. The colonization law did not contemplate that parties who had received the full measure of the Government bounty should swell their possessions by getting grants in the names of other persons. Pi\u00f1a, by making such a deed as this, forfeited his claim on the Government. He assigned it to Vallejo, who could not press .it in his own name. When the grant issued it vested no right in Pi\u00f1a, for he had abandoned his claim; neither did it inure to the benefit of Vallejo, who had lost his capacity to take. It was, therefore, void.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-5\"><em>Mr. JReverdy Johnson, </em>of Maryland, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag1\">Tho facts of this case being admitted, as well as sufficiently proved otherwise, there is no ground for appeal. On the part of the claimant, it is denied that the Mexican colonization laws forbade a party to sell out his right to land for which he had a pending petition, and it is wholly against the-principles of jus,tice, as administered in our courts, to say that a title which has been made to one person shall not inure to the benefit of another by whom it has been bought and paid for. At all events, the United.States have no title, and; therefore, no right to interfere between the grantee and his alienee.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b287-6\">Mr. Justice WAYNE.</author>\n<p id=\"AqC\">This claim is founded upon a grant from Governor Alvarado to Lazaro Pi\u00f1a of the date of July 18, 1840. The original grant was not produced, and is supposed to have been lost during'.the war between the United States and Mexico, in which the grantee was killed. The espediente is numbered by Jimeno and noted in his index. It exists complete among the archives. The journal of the Departmental Assembly shows that the grant was approved October 8, 1845. Pi\u00f1a, the grantee, occupied the land for several years. The error of date in the conveyance from Pi\u00f1a to Vallejo cannot raise a suspicion against the regularity of the grant. It is the opinion of this court that the original claim is a good and valid claim, and that the same should be, and hereby is confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\n<em>jDecree of the District Court affirmed.-</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
