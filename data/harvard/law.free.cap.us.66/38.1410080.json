The . action was in the nature of. an ejectment, arid brought to re\"eov-er possession of land. The plaintiff, below, was William .Hart, <em>junior, </em>a citizen of New York, residing at Manilla. His counsel in the cause was William Hart, <em>senior. </em>In March, 1858,-judgment was rendered by the coui\u2019t for the plaintiff. In October of.the same year a writ of error was sued out, returnable on the first Monday in December next thereafter, and \u25a0service of the citation .was on the 9th of October admitted by William Hart, <em>Senior. </em>- But this writ of errcr was not returned during the term to which it was made returnable, and failed, therefore, to bring up the ease. A second writ of error was taken by the defendant below in August, 1859, returnable to the ensuing December term of this court., The citation under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>this latter writ was directed to William Hart, <em>junior, </em>and served according to the marshal\u2019s certificate, on Mary Hart, widow.' and executrix of William Hart, <em>senior, </em>who died after the judgment, and on J. D. Stevenson, his former law partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">A. service of the citation on the attorney or counsel of the proper party is sufficient; but the executrix of the counsel on-record ivas not the counsel of her testator\u2019s client. His char acter and duties as counsel did not devolve on his own person al representative after his death. Nor is Mr. Stevenson to be. regarded as the counsel of William Hart, <em>junior, </em>merely because he had been the partner of William Hart, <em>senior. </em>We cannot notice law partnerships or other private relations between members of the bar. This may have been a partnership, solely because it provided for a division of profits, without putting either partner under any responsibility for the suits conducted by the other. The courts can know no counsel in a cause except those who regularly appear as such on the record. '</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The citation not being served on the party as his counsel, the cause is not brought into this court, agreeably to- the act of 1789; and the writ must therefore be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. .</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\n<em>Writ of error dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
