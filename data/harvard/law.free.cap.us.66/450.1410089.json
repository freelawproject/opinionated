It alleges no title in Ogden, nor any right to convey, but merely his. readiness to deliver a deed. The contract was an agreement .to sell -land, and thafimplies transmutation of property from one man to another; 2.\"Black-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>stone, 446; <em>Williamson </em>vs. Berry, (8 Howard, 544;) <em>Thomas </em>vs. <em>Van Ness, </em>(4 Wendell, 549.) A deed might be executed without conveying any title. The declaration should have averred title in Ogden and a readiness to execute such a deed as would be effectual to transfer that title. 1 Chit. Pl., <em>327 Thomas </em>vs. <em>Van Ness, </em>(4 Wendell, 549;) <em>Glover vs. Tuck, </em>(24 Wendell, 153;). <em>Tyler </em>vs. <em>Young, </em>(2 Scam., 146;) <em>Burn </em>vs. <em>McNulty, </em>(2 Gilman, 128.) You cannot compel a vendee to take a lawsuit instead of the land. <em>Bank of Columbia </em>vs. <em>Hagner, </em>(1 Peters, 455.) Performance must always be alleged according to the intent of the contract. It is not sufficient to follow merely the words. 1 Chit. Pl., 325.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-5\">The declaration does not allege notice to the defendants of the surrender and cancellation of the Wright contract, and this being a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of the vendor, should have been stated. 1 Chit. Pl., 328; Com. Dig., C. 73, 74; 2 Pars. Cont., 182. These defects in the declaration are not aided by the verdict. 1 Chit. Pl., 673; <em>Dodson </em>vs. <em>Campbell, </em>(1 Sumner, 319;) <em>Addington vs. Allen, </em>(11 Wendell, 375.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-6\">The court below assumed that a bare declaration by the plaintiff that Wright\u2019s contract was forfeited would be legally equivalent to a surrender and cancellation of it. This was clearly erroneous, and misled the jury. <em>Caldwell vs. United </em>States,(8 Howard, 366;) <em>Tucker </em>vs. <em>Moreland, </em>(10 Peters, 58;) <em>United States </em>vs. <em>Beitling, </em>(20 Howard, 254.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-7\">The court said that if it was the agreement and understanding of all parties in interest that the contract was at an end, then it might be regarded as substantially surrendered and cancelled. This statement tended to mislead the jury, whether as a rule of law it was true or false, for there was no evidence of any such understanding or agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-8\">An error still more extraordinary is found in the sentence that \u201c the offer of the property for sale- and a declaration of forfeiture after default <em>of </em>payment might be sufficient as showing the exercise of the option on the part of the grantor.\u201d It is true that in <em>Chrisman </em>vs. <em>Miller, </em>(21 Ill., 226,) it was held that the mere act of offering the land for sale after default' of the purchaser is sufficient to put an end to the contract. From <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>this the judge of the Circuit Court.deduced the startling inference that the mere offer of Ogden to. sell the land to Washington and Turner was, per <em>se, </em>a performance of his covenant with them to have the contract with Wright surrendered and can-celled. The suri\u2019ender and cancellation of Wright\u2019s contract was a condition precedent to that which Ogden made with Washington and Turner, and the court had no right to estimate either the importance or necessity of a compliance with it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-5\"><em>Mr. Fuller, </em>of Illinois, and <em>Mr.-Carlisle, </em>of Washington city, for defendants-in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aht\">In actions against a purchaser on a contract for the sale of land, the plaintiff is not bound to show that he has title.to the land. The contract admits at least <em>prima facie </em>his title, and the <em>onus </em>is on the defendant to show that he has not. <em>Bretthauph </em>vs. <em>Thurmand, </em>(3 Richardson, 216;) <em>Brown </em>vs. <em>Bellows, </em>(4Pickering, 179;) <em>Dwight </em>vs. <em>Cutler, </em>(3 Mich., 566;) <em>Espy </em>vs. <em>Anderson, </em>(14 Penn., 311.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-6\">Under the Wright contract, neither Wright himself nor his assignee had any interest or estate in the premises, and could acquire, none, .except by complying with the terms of it. This had not been done,\" and Ogden had a right to treat the contract as at an end. He exercised that right by selling the property to the defendants. Wright and his assignee, Clapp, both knew this, and acquiesced in it. This was a complete surrender and cancelment of the contract. <em>Chrisman </em>vs. <em>Miller, </em>(21 Ill., 227;) <em>Steele </em>vs. <em>Bigg, </em>(22 Ill., 643.) Although the contract was not released of record, that formed no valid objection to the title, as was decided in <em>Greenleaf </em>vs. <em>Queen, </em>(1 Peters, 138;) <em>Espy </em>vs. <em>Anderson, </em>(14 Penn., 308.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-7\">The duty of defendants was to'pay the money sued for, and execute bonds and mortgage. No . notice from the plaintiff was required. The averrnent of the plaintiffs readiness to perform his part of the contract was sufficient. 1 Chit. Pl., 326; <em>Rowsen vs. Johnson, </em>(1 East., 208;) <em>Tierney </em>vs. <em>Ashley, </em>(18 Pickering, 546;) <em>West </em>vs. <em>Emmons, </em>(5 Johnson, 179;) <em>Williams </em>vs. <em>Bank of United States, </em>(2 Peters, 96.) A time and place, being fixed for the performance by the defendants of their part of the contract, and they hot having attended, and the first act' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>of performance resting on them, the plaintiff could do nothing but be ready, to perform bis part. In the absence of the defendants, he could do no more. \u2022 The averment of readiness to perform is sufficient, especially, after verdict. 1 Chit. Pl., 859.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b457-5\">Mr. Justice GRIER.</author>\n<p id=\"AU3\">The very numerous exceptions to the sufficiency of the pleadings, and the-correctness of the instructions given by the court, all depend on the construction given to the covenants of the agreement, which.is the foundation of the suit. It is in the following words: .</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u201c Chicago, <em>June </em>20, 1859.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\u201cWe will give M. D. Ogden, trustee Chicago Land Company, sixty-seven thousand and five hundred dollars for the property described in the John S. Wright' contract with the trustees of the Chicago Land Company, dated June 4, 1855, or thereabouts, and pay for the same as follows: thirty-five thousand in cash within the next sixty days, and the balance in one, two, and three years, in .equal instalments, with six per cent, inter-' est, payable annually. It is understood that it is all payable at the office of Ogden, Eleetwood &amp; Co., in Chicago. In the event of our being deprived of the water front on block 35, Elston\u2019s addition to Chicago by Robins, a difference in the purchase-money shall be made, corresponding to the value of the property lost. The said M. D. Ogden, trustee, &amp;c., agrees to sell to Johri-A. \"Washington and Wm. E. Turner, both of Virginia, the above described property for the said sum of sixty-seven thousand five hundred dollars, payable as above; and on the payment of the said thirty-five thousand dollars, cash, within the next sixty days, he will make a deed to said Washington and Turner for said property, and take a bond and mortgage on the same, for payment of the balance of thirty-two thousand five hundred dollars, to be paid as above stated. This agreement is to be dependent on the surrender and cancelment of said contract with said Wright.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">It is evident that the covenants of this contract are not independent. They are concurrent or reciprocal, constituting mutual conditions to be performed at the same time. The vendor is not bound to convey, unless the money due on the first in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>stalmentbe paid; nor is the purchaser bound to pay unless the vendor can convey a good title, free of all incumbrance. The agreement shows that the vendor at that time was not able to give a satisfactory title, having a deed on i\u2019ecord, by which he had covenanted to convey the same land to another. It is therefore made a condition precedent by this agreement, that this previous contract should be surrendered and cancelled. The declaration avers that the contract with Wright- was surrendered and cancelled on the 28th day of June, and that the plaintiff has beeu. ever ready and willing to receive the money at the time and place, and <em>\u201cto deliver to defendants a deed of the property.\u201d </em>' But there is no averment in the <em>narr. </em>that the plaintiff had a good and sufficient title, free from all incumbrance, which he was ready and willing to convey. It is true, the words- of his covenant -are, \u201c that he will make a deed\u201d to his vendees on receipt of the first instalment. But the meaning pf these words in the contract requires that the deed shall convey the land, and it is not. sufficient to aver his readiness \u2022 to perform, merely according to the letter of the contract. . The performance must always be averred according to the' intent of the parties. It is not sufficient to pursue the words, if the intent be not performed. The legal effect of a covenant to Bell is, that the land shall be conveyed by a deed from one who has a good title, or full power to convey a good title.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">A sale, <em>ex vi termini-, </em>is a transfer of property from one man to another. It is a contract to pass rights of property for money. \u2022 This defect in the declaration cannot be cured by the verdict, under a presumption that the facts necessary to support it have been proved before the jury, because it appears by the record that no such proof was offered to aid the insufficient averments of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">It appears, also,- that the averment with regard to the surrender and cancelment of the contract with Wright, even if sufficiently pleaded, was wholly without proof to support it, and that the court instructed the jury that they might presume it without proof. It is clearly a condition precedent, without the literal performance of which the purchasers were not bound to pay their money. The vendor had, on the 4th of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>June, 1855, covenanted to' sell this land to John S. Wright, on payment of certain instalments. \u2022 The vendors had reserved to themselves very stringent and unusual powers of declaring the contract forfeited in case of non-payment of the several instalments. John S. Wright, on the third of July, 1837, by his deed, conveyed all his right and title to the premises to Timothy and Walter Wright. This deed was. recorded 13th July, 1837.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">T. &amp; W. Wright, on the 3d day of December, 1857, conveyed to James Clapp, and the deed was recorded on the 12th of\u2019 December, 1857. These deeds could not be surrendered or cancelled by parol. Both the original and the record'should have been cancelled and surrendered by act of the parties thereto under seal; if not by all,-yet certainly by'Clapp. This was not done. The plaintiffs in error had prepared their money. Their agent called on Ogden to obtain an abstract of the title, and a proper surrenderor release of the outstanding title, and. was instructed to prepare pi\u2019oper bonds and a mortgage. Ogden promised to attend to having a proper surrender executed, but none was shown or tendered to the agent; on the contrary, Ogden handed him a mortgage and notes to be sent to the purchasers to be executed by them. They refused to sign instruments in that form, and returned them to their agent. He returned them to Ogden, stating, among other reasons, that they expected a <em>proper release or surrender </em>of the outstanding title, and that in the absence of such a release Ogd.en could not make a good title nor\u2019 give possession. A second mortgage and bonds were then drawn and sent to the purchasers by. Ogden, which were also objected to, and another <em>promise </em>given, \u201cthatth <em>&amp; release shbidd be attended to.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">But no such deed of release or surrender was made, executed, or tendered to the purchasers within the sixty days. Clapp did not execute a-release till after the 1st of September, which was antedated as of the 15th of August. On this evidence, which was uncontradicted, it w\u00e1s clearly the duty'of the court to have instructed the jury that the plaintiffs below 'had not made out a case which entitled them.to a verdict; on the contrary, th.e court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AoD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>\u201c 2d. By the terms of the John. S. W right contract, if default were made in the payment of the instalment due in 1859, it was competent for the Messrs. Ogden, at their option, to declare it forfeited and at an end as a contract for conveyance, and the land might be granted to another. No release or conveyance in writing by Wright or his assignee was absolutely necessary in such case, in order to put an end to the contract to convey. Strictly speaking, Wright, having parted with his interest in the land to Clapp, had no power over the contract; but if he, with the acquiescence and consent of Clapp, after default of payment, delivered the contract to Mr. Ogden, and it was the agreement and understanding of all parties in interest that the contract was at an end, then it might be regarded as substantially surrendered and cancelled. That the offer of the property for sale, and a declaration of forfeiture after default of payment, might be sufficient, as showing the exercise of the option on the part of the grantor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">This instruction was excepted to by defendants. It was a very grave error to instruct the jury that the acquiescence of Clapp, and the mutual understanding of the parties to that transaction, might be regarded by the jury as an actual cancellation and surrender as between the parties to this suit. Acquiescence expressed by parol, and mutual understanding that a title should be released, .cannot be made a substitute for a deed of release or surrender, executed and recorded. Deeds under seal can be surrendered and cancelled only by other deeds\u2019 under'seal. No prudent man would accept a title with full notice on record, and knowledge of such an outstanding title. This contract, by its plain terms, is \u201c dependent on such surrender and cancelment being made within the sixty days.\u201d It is a condition precedent, without the performance of which, within the term specified, the purchaser had a just right to declare the contract annulled. To entitle the plaintiffs below to recover in thr\u00bb suit, the declaration should have averred that such deeds of surrender and cancellation had been duly executed;' that the plaintiff had a perfect title, free of all incumbrances, and was able as well as willing and ready to convey a good title to the plaintiff on the day named in the agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>But- he was not able to prove such averments, if they had been made, and his ease failed both in its pleadings and its proofs; consequently there was error in ruling the demurrers of the plaintiff to the 4th, 6th, and 7th pleas of defendant in favor of plaintiffs. The pleas alleged proper matters of defence to the suit, either in whole or in part. They were sufficient on general demurrer, whieh goes back to the first error in pleading. And from what we have already .'said, the first error in pleading is found in the declaration.. It is not necessary to. discuss more at large the form of the pleadings, or-whether the action should not have been convenant and not debt, as the plaintiff was not entitled to recover in any .form of action, according to the undisputed facts in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\n<em>The judgment of the Circuit Court reversed, and venire de novo. \u25a0</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
