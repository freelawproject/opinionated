It is the general rule, that the construction given by State courts to State laws and constitutions are binding and conclusive upon the Federal courts; but the rule does not extend to cases in which this court is called on to interpret the contracts of .States, though they have been made in the form of laws or by functionaries of the State in pursuance of State laws.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b438-9\">2. Fidelity to the Constitution of the United States makes it necessary, that in such a matter this court should not follow the construction of a State court with whose opinion it cannot concur, and it makes no difference in the obligation whether the contract is in the shape of a law or of a covenant by the State\u2019s agents.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b438-11\">3.

The 60th section of the charter of the State Bank of Ohio, which requires that six per cent, of the dividends shall be set off for the use of the State, which sum the State consents to accept in lieu of all taxes to which the banks or their stockholders might otherwise be subject, is a contract, and a subsequent law increasing the taxes is a violation of the contract.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b438-19\">7.

The Jefferson branch of the State Bank of Ohio brought trespass in the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>mon Pleas of Jefferson county against Alexander Skelly, and chargedin their declaration that the defendant took and carried away from the banking-house of the plaintiff, at Steubenville, a certain quantity of gold coin of the value of seven thousand dollars, and converted it to his own use. The defendant pleaded specially, in justification, that he was treasurer of Jefferson county, and, as such, required and authorized by law to collect the taxes assessed in the county of Jefferson; that taxes to the amount of $5,568 88.9-10 had been assessed upon, and wer.e then due from, the plaintiff, which it was the duty and right of the defendant to distrain for; and that the.supposed trespass consisted in making such lawful distraint. The plaintiff replied that it was a banking corporation, organized under an act of the State Legislature,, entitled \u201cAn act to incorporate the State Bank of Ohio and other banking corporations;\u201d that, agreeably to the 60th section of said act, the plaintiff had always regularly and punctually paid to the properly authorized officers six per cunt, of its profits;, that the 60th section of the charter was a contract between the State and the plaintiff to assess or demand no other or greater taxes from the plaintiff than six per lent, on its' profits; and that the taxes for which the defendant alleged that he had made the supposed distraint were assessed and demanded in pursuance of a law which was a violation of the said contract, and therefore void. The defendant l\u2019ejoined, taking issue on the replication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-5\">The question of law thus raised was, whether the State had a right to impose on the bank any taxes other than those which were stipulated for in the 60th section of the charter, the plaintiff asserting, and the defendant denying, that the section referred to was a contract which'made any other or greater taxes illegal and unconstitutional. The verdict and judgmen-t in the Common Pleas were in favor of the plaintiff\" for $6,292 80, with costs. The defendant appealed to the Circuit Court, where a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff were again rendered, hut the judgment was arrested, and judgment finally given for the defendant. Thence the cause was taken, on the plaintiff\u2019s petition, to the Supreme Coiirt of the State. The judges of the Supreme Court were of opinion that the said 60th section of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>the act of the General Assembly of Ohio of the 24th of February, 1845, entitled \u201c An act to incorporate the State Bank of Ohio and other banking companies,\u201d under the provisions of which the said Jefferson branch was organized, is not a contract within the meaning, and entitled to the protection, of that clause of the Constitution of the United States which provides that \u201cno State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts,\u201d and that, consequently, the subsequent laws under which the increased taxes were assessed and levied were valid. The judgment of the Circuit Court was, therefore, affirmed, and thereupon the plaintiff took this writ of error from the Supreme Court of the United States.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-5\"><em>Mr. Vinton, </em>of Washington city, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzU\">In this case the Supreme Court of Ohio adjudged:</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-6\">1st. That the 60th section of the charter of the State Bank of Ohio was not a contract between the State and the bank, within the meaning, and entitled to the protection, of that clause of the Constitution of the United States which declares that \u201c no State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATH\">' 2d. That the act of the General Assembly of Ohio, of the 13th of April, 1852, under which the tax in question was assessed against the bank, was a valid law, and obligatory on the bank, anything in said 60th section of said bank charter to the contrary notwithstanding; and that, consequently, the tax assessed under said act was a valid tax, and the bank was bound to pay the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-8\">The identical question presented by this record has heretofore been twice before this court for decision, and twice decided, after very elaborate examination of the question by the court in each case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-9\">The-first in the order of tim\u00e9is the case of the <em>Piqua Branch of the State Bank of Ohio </em>vs. Knoop, (16 How., 369.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-10\">In that case, a tax was assessed upon the .property of the Piqua branch, under an act of the Legislature of Ohio, passed in the year 1851, which the State attempted to collect by suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-11\">This court then decided that the 60th section of the bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>charter was a contract, and that the bank could not be otherwise taxed than in conformity to that contract, and. that the' act of 1851, which was in conflict with that contract, was invalid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-5\">The other case was that of <em>Dodge </em>vs. <em>Woolsey, </em>(18 How., 331.) In that case a tax had been assessed pn the Commercial Branch Bank of'Cleveland, a branch of the State Bank of Ohio, under\" the tax act of the 13th of April, 1852, which is the same act under which the tax now in question was assessed. This court again went into an elaborate investigation of the question in that ease, and again decided that the 60th section of the State Bank charter is a contract, and that the banks organized under it are subject to no other taxation, arid that the act of 1852 impaired that contract, -and was also invalid, bo far as it was in contravention to that section\" of the bank charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-6\">If it should be contended by the defendant in error, as it was in the case of the <em>Piqua Branch Bank </em>vs. <em>Knoop, </em>and again in.the case of <em>Dodge </em>vs. <em>Woolsey, </em>that the construction put upon the 60th section of the bank .charter by the State court ought to be conclusive upon the courts of the United States, the answer to it will be found in the case of the <em>Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company </em>vs. <em>Debolt, </em>(16 How., 432,) and <em>Mechanics and Traders\u2019 Bank </em>vs. <em>Debolt, </em>(18 How., 380.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b441-7\"><em>Mr. Murray, </em>of Ohio, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMW\">Does the 60th section of the act passed.

But it can hardly be claimed that (\u00a1his one decision,*made by a.divided court, the majority only agreeing in the conclusion arrived at, but wholly disagreeing as to the reasons therefor, so far settled this question that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>is no longer an open one. A renewal of this decision is asked for because the question is one as to the construction of the constitution and laws of the State of Ohio, and it is the duty of this court to follow the construction given by the Supreme Court of that State. <em>O.

An act of incorporation, when accepted, cau only constitute a con tract, between the grantor and grantees as to those rights, privileges, &amp;c., which it was in the power of the grantor to grant. The whole doctrine of contracts) as resulting from an accepted charter, is based on the fact that the King of England had no power to revoke a charter or patent which he had once granted, and which had been accepted' and acted upon .by the grantees. The King never did graiit, \"and hadi no power- to grant, exemption from taxation, either in whole or' in part, any more than he could have divested the Government of its right- of eminent domain. Any grant of either would have -been beyond his power, aud void. Consequently it could \u25a0have formed no part of any valid contract with his grantees. The Legislature of a State, then, even if they have succeeded to a certain extent to the prerogative of the King,, have nd power to make a graut of rights and privileges .which it was not in the power of the King to grant; and if their right' to make a\u2019 contract, which cannot be revoked by a subsequent Legislature, is based upon the power of the King of England in similar cases, it must be taken subject to all the restrictions .and limitations which apply to his exercise of this power. But the Legislature of Ohio, at the time of passing the tax law of April 5, 1859,. and the prior'laws changing the .rule of taxation \u25a0 prescribed by the 60th section, of the act of February 24,1845, was inhibited from passing the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae5r\">At the time of the passage of this act of February 24, 1845, ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>there was upon the statute-book of Ohio, in full force, an act passed March 7, 1842, (Ohio Law, vol. 40, p. 70,) which provided, that all subsequent corporations, whether possessing banking powers or not, were to hold their charters subject to alteration, suspension, and repeal, at the discretion of the. Legislature. Now, if the Legislature in this act of February 24, 1845, had provided in express terms that said act and all rights, privileges, franchise, etc., thereby granted, should not, for a given term of years, be subject' to alteration, repeal, or suspension, then it might, with some show' of reason, be claimed that the prior act of March 7, 1842, was repealed by implication \u2014 a mode of repeal, however, which is never favored; but inasmuch.as nothing of that kind is contained in said act, we are bound to presume that it was intended to be made in all respects subject to all general acts then in force having reference to corporations of a similar nature. This 60th section.of the act of 1845, in several respects, is wholly wanting in those ingredients which are indispensable requisites to a contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-5\">That it was designed by the Legislature to constitute a contract between the State and banking companies organized thereunder, as to the rate of taxation to which they should be subjected during their existence, will not.be presumed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-6\">The contract, if one exists, must be contained in the express terms of the act itself; it must appear therein so plainly and' obviously as to be beyond doubt; and if any other construction of the terms of-the act than that which makes it a contract can be reasonably given to it, that construction will be adopted. <em>Providence Bank </em>vs. <em>Billings, </em>(4 Peters, 561;) <em>Charles River Bridge </em>vs. <em>Warren Bridge, </em>(11 Peters, 420;) <em>Debolt </em>vs. <em>O.

Ohio. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Its purpose is to revise a judgment rendered by that court, in which it has, among other things, declared, contrary to the uniform decisions of this court upon the same subject-matter,. that the 60th section of the charter\u2019\u2019of the State Bank of Ohio is not a contract withiu the meaning of that clause of the Constitution of the United-States which provides, \u201cthat no State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Amd\">We' shall not now reargue the question, nor any point in connection with it, thinking if best to give, without addition, what have been the judgments of this court, when the matter \u201ein connection with the charter of. the State Bank of Ohio has been before it. The reasoning of the Supi\u2019eme Court of Ohio has, at all times, had our most respectful consideration. <em>:Hoc non obstante, </em>however, it is again reproduced by that court as the foundation of its judgment, without other illustration than it had when we first were called upon to review it; and we are how asked to reconsider it by the District Attorney, Jame3 Murray, Esquire, upon an intimation, that this court might be induced to reverse its decision in the <em>\u2022Pigua Branch </em>case, because that judgment qf this, court involves the construction of the constitution and laws of the State of Ohio differently from what both had been decided'to be by the Supreme Court of the State, arid that the Supreme Court of the United States should follow or conform to the conclusion of the former, at the. same-time admitting that there had been an inconstancy of interpretation by the Supreme Court of Ohio in its judgments upon the.60th section of the charter of the State Bank of Ohio. ... . ; \u25a0 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>We answer to this,-as this court has repeatedly said, whenever an occasion has been presented for its expression, that its ' rule of interpretation has invariably been, that the constructions given by the courts of the States to State legislation and to State constitutions have been conclusive, upon this court, <em>with a single exception, </em>and that is when it has been called upon to interpret the contracts of States, \u201cthough they have been made in- the forms of law,\u201d or by the instrumentality of a State\u2019s authorized functionaries, in conformity with State legislation. It has never been denied, nor is it now, that the . Supreme Court of the United. States has an appellate power to revise the judgment of the Supreme Court of a State, whenever such a court shall adjudge that not to be a contract which has been alleged, in the forms of legal proceedings, by a litigant, to be one, within the meaning of that clause'of the Constitution of the United States which inhibits the States from.passing any law impairing the obligation of contracts. Of what use would the appellate power be to the litigant whp feels himself aggrieved by some, particular State legislation, if. this' court could not decide, independently of all adjudication by the Supreme Court of a State,; whether or. not the phraseology of the instrument in controversy was expressive of a contract and within the protection of the Constitution of the United States, and that its obligation should be enforced, notwithstanding a contrary conclusion- by the Supreme Court of a State ? It never was intended, and cannot be sustained by any course of reasoning, that this' court should,' or could with fidelity .to the Constitution of the United States, follow the .construction, of the Supreme Court of a State in' such a matter, when it entertained a different-opinion: and in forming its judgment in such a-case, it makes no difference in the obligation of this court in reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of a State upon such a contract, whether it be one claimed to be such'under the form of State legislation, or has been made by a covenant or agreement by the agents of a State, by its authority. . , .</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">. We have thus given, very much in what has been the language of this court, wh\u00e1t has been always its attitude in re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>spect to the revisal of the judgments of the Supreme Court of a State upon contracts which have been declared not to be within the protection of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">We will now show, that this opinion may be better understood, in connection with the citations which will be produced to sustain it, the origin of this controversy from its proceedings and pleadings.-</p>\n<p id=\"Abv\">It was an action of trespass brought by the plaintiff in error against the defendant Skelly, for forcibly entering the plaintiff^ banking-house, and taking and carrying away gold coin, the money of the plaintiff. To \u2022 this charge the defendant pleaded the general issue, hot guilty, and two pleas of justification substantially the same. They are: That the defendant, as treasurer of the county, had received from the auditor for the collection of taxes, a tax duplicate of $5,808 70, which had beep assessed in the year,1852 upon the plaintiff\u2019s property for, State and county taxes, and other pm'poses; that being unpaid after the time allowed by law for its payment, he had seized and taken from the plaintiffs banking-house $5,568 88 in money of the plaintiff, to .satisfy the tax and penalty for default of payment, as he had the right officially to do. To these pleas the plaintiff replied: That the bank prior to 1850 had been incorporated and organized as a banking company, in conformity with an act of the General Assembly entitled \u201cAn act to incorporate the State Rank of Ohio and other banking \u2022 companies,\u201d passed the 14th of February, 1845, and as such tlad carried on business as a branch of the State Rank of Ohio, and was then doing so; that it had at all' times, as required by the 60th section of the act, set off to the State six per centum on its profits, deducting from it the expenses and its ascer-. tained losses for the six months preceding; and that the cashier had'punctually, within ten days after having done so, informed' the auditor of the State that it had been done, and that it had paid the same, whenever required,- to the treasurer, upon the order of the auditor, and that they had been and were then ready to pay the. amount according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">It is alleged, that the bank had performed all required by the 60th section, of the act of incorporation, and that from-its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>acceptance of the act and compliances with it, a contract had been made between the State and the bank, according to the 60th section, that the six per centum on'.the profits of the bank, to be divided semi-annually and set off to the State of Ohio, should be in lieu of all taxes which the bank and its stockholders, on account of the stock held by them, were bound to pay; and that the assessment set forth in the defendant\u2019s pleas of justification was a direct violation of the contract between the State and the banking company. To this replication the defendant made no answer, and a judgment was rendered against them for want of a rejoinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">In that state of the case, it was carried by appeal into the District Court of Ohio, and there submitt\u00e9d to a jury upon the plea of not guilty, and a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff. But after that judgment, the 'verdict was arrested by the District Court, upon the ground that the matter set forth, in the plaintiff\u2019s replication was no answer to the defendant\u2019s pleas of justification, and that those pleas were a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The case was then carried by appeal to the Supreme Cotirt, and the judgment of the District Court was affirmed, on the express ground that the 60th section of the bank charter was not a contract between the State and the bant, within the meaning of that clause of the Constitution of the United States which provides that \u201cno State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts;\u201d andNhat the act of the General Assembly, passed the 13th April, 1852, for the assessment and taxation, of all property in the State, according to its true value in money, was binding on the Bank of the State of Ohio, and its branches.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Having given the case in its pleading and proceedings in all their irregularities, we now proceed to \u2022 state what have been the uniform decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States in respect to the protective clause against legislation by the State's impairing the obligation of contracts, and particularly of that legislation of Ohio comprehending the present controversy, which its Supreme Court has affirmed to be constitutional, and which is now regularly before us for review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>and reversal, in conformity with, previous decisions of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">First, as to the decisions of this court in respect to the power of a State Legislature to bind the State by a contract, we refer to the case of <em>Billings </em>vs. <em>The Providence Railroad Bank, </em>that of the <em>Charles River Bridge Company, </em>and that of <em>Gordon </em>vs. <em>The Appeal Tax Court, </em>and to the case of <em>The Richmond Railroad Company </em>vs. <em>The Louisa Railroad Company, </em>(13 How., 71.) The last, in principle, was identical with that of <em>The Charles River Bridge </em>vs. <em>The Warren Bridge. </em>The opinion of the majority of the, court was put upon the ground that the Legislature of a State had a right to bind the State by such a contract, and the threb dissenting judges in that case were of the opinion, as the report of the case will show, not only that the Legislature might bind the State by such a contract, but that it had bound it, and that the charter of the Louisa Railroad Company violated the contract, and impaired its obligation. This court has also decided that the charter of a'bank is a franchise, which is not taxable as such, if a price has been' paid for it, which the Legislature has accepted, with a declaration that it was to be in lieu of all other taxation. <em>Gordon </em>vs. <em>Appeal Tax. </em>Court, (3 How., 133.) The rule of construction-in such a case is, that the grant pf privileges and exemptions to a corporation are to be strictly construed against the corporators, and iii favor of the public; that nothing passes but what has been granted in clear and explicit terras; and that \u25a0neither the right of,taxation, nor any other power of sovereignty, will be held by this court to have'been surrendered, unless such surrender has been expressed in terms too plain to be mistaken. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In respect to th\u00e9 power of a State Legislature to \u00e9xempt persons, corporations, and things from, taxation, and to bind the Statp by, such enactment, we refer to the case of <em>New Jersey </em>vs. <em>Wilson, </em>(7 Cranch, 164.) The circumstances of that case were these: A legislative act declaring that certain lands'' should be purchased for the Indians, and that such lands should not be thereafter subject to taxation, it was decided by this court, that \u2022 such language\u2019 made' a contract between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Indians and the State, which could not be rescinded by a subsequent legislative act, and that such a repealing act was void under that clause of the Constitution of the United States prohibiting the States from passing any law impairing the obligation of contracts. . The case shows what has been the fidelity of this court to the Constitution in this particular.' The illustration will be more decisive by briefly stating the circumstances of the cas\u00e9. In 1758 the State of New Jersey purqhased the Indian title to lands in that State, and as a consideration for the purchase, bought a tract of land as a residence for the'Indians, having previously passed an act declaring that such-lands should not be subject thereafter to any tax by the State, any law or usage, or law then existing, to the contrary notwithstanding. The Indians, from the time of purchase, lived upon the land until the year 1801, when they Avere authorized, by'an--act pf the Legislature, to sell the land. This last act contained1 no provision in respect to the future taxation of the land. \u2022 Under it, the lands were sold. In October, the Legislature repealed the act of August, 1758, which exempted the lands from: taxation, subjecting them to taxes in the hands of the purchasers. They were assessed and demanded ; the purchasers resisted; and, upon the trial of the case, the taxes imposed by the act of 1804 were declared to be unconstitutional. This court then said, the privilege, though, for the benefit of the Indians, is annexed by the terms which create it to the land itself, and not to their persons. In the event of a-sale, the privilege was material, because the exemption from taxes enhanced its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Our reports have other cases of a like kind, passed upon by this court with like results. In every case, the vital importance-of a State\u2019s, right .to tax was considered, and the relinquishment of it by a State has never jboen presumed. The language of the court has always been cautious, and affirmative of- the right of the State to impose taxes,' unless it has been relinquished by unmistakable Words, clearly indicating the intention of the State to do so. This court has always said and acted upon it: \u201cWe will not say that a State may not relinquish its right to tax in particular cases, or that a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>sideration sufficiently valuable to induce a.partial increase of it may not exist, but as.the whole community is interested in preserving it undiminished, it* has a right to insist that its abandonment ought not to be presumed in a case in which the deliberate purpose.of a State to abandon it does not appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\"><em>We </em>are aware, that the very stringent rule of construction of this court, in respect to taxation by a State, has not been satisfactory to all persons. But it has been adhered to by this ..court in every attempt hitherto made to relax it; and we presume it will be, until the historical recollections, which induced the framers, of the Constitution of the United States to inhibit the States from passing'any law impairing the obligation of contracts, have been. forgotten. This- court\u2019s view of that clause of the Constitution, in its application to the States, is'now, and ever has been, that State Legislatures, unless pro- . hibited in terms by State constitutions, may contract by legis-lation to release the -exercise of taxing a particular thing, corporation, or person, as that may appear in its act, and that the contrary has not been open\u2019 to inquiry or argument in the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"A6y\">This brings /us to the consideration of the legislation of Ohio, upon which its Supreme Court has passed judgment on the case now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">It has been decided three times by this court, that the 60th Section of the charter of the State Bank of Ohio was a contract between the State and the bank within the meaning, and. entitled to-the protection of the Constitution of the United States against any law of the State of Ohio impairing its obligation; and that the acts of Ohio, upon which the Supreme Court of Ohio has assumed the State\u2019s right to tax the State Bank of Ohio and its branches differently from the tax stipulated for in the 60th section of the charter, were and are unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">The first case in the order of time is that of the <em>Piqua Branch, &amp;c., &amp;c., </em>vs. <em>Knoop. </em>In that case, we declared the act of 1845 to be a general banking law, the 59th section of which required the bank to make semi-annual dividends, and that the ,60th section required the officers of the. banks to set off six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>per cent, of such dividends in the manner prescribed in it for the use of the State, which sum the State had consented to accept, and would accept in lieu of all taxes, to which the banks or their stockholders might otherwise be subject; that the act was a.contract, fixing the amount of taxation, and not a rule or law prescribed until changed by tire Legislature of the-State of Ohio; that the act of 1851, to tax banks and other stocks the same as property, was an act' to increase the tax upon the banks, and that such law being a violation of the State\u2019s contract, that the banks were not bound to pay the same; that a municipal corporation, in which is vested some portion of the administration of the Government, may be\" changed at the will of the Legislature; but that a bank, in which stock is held by individuals, is a private corporation, and its charter is a legislative contract, which cannot be changed without its consent; and in connection, this court again repeated that, by the 60t 1 section of the act of 1845, the State bound itself by contract 1 &gt; levy no higher tax than was mentioned in it upon the bank, should it be organized under'th\u00e1t law during the continuance of their charters. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Two years afterward, in 1855, the particulars of the decision, as they have just been stated, were reaffirmed. It also then added, that a stockholder in a corporation has a remedy in chancery against the directors of a.bank, to prevent them from doing acts- which Would amount to a violation of its charter, or to prevent them from any misapplication of its capital, which might lessen the value ofithe shares, if the acts intended to be 'done shall amount to what the law deems to be a breach of trust; also that a stockholder in a bank or other corporation had a remedy in chancery against individuals, in whatever character they profess to act, if the subject of complaint is. an imputed violation of a corporate purchase, or the denial of a right growing out of it, for which there is not an .adequate remedy at law; and if the stockholder who complains be a resident of another State than that in which the bank or corporation has its habitat, that he may then resort to the courts of the United States for a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">That the fact, that the people of the State of Ohio had, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>year-, adopted a new* constitution, in which it was declared that taxes should be imposed upon banks in the manner provided for by the-act of 13th April, 1852, cannot be applied to the State Bank of Ohio or its branches, without a violation of the'contract contained in the charter of 1845. Having now noticed every essential point made in the argument in support of a claim, to subject the Bank of the State of Ohio and its branches to a higher rate of taxation \u2022 than that stipulated in its charter, we will close this opinion in the language of the Chief Justice, in Knoop\u2019s case: \u201cI think, that, by the 60th section of the act of 1845, the State of Ohio bound itself by a contract to levy no higher tax than the one there mentioned upon the banks orstocks of the banks organized under that law during the continuance of their charters. In my judgment, the words \u25a0used are too plain to. admit of any other construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">We shall direct a revei\u2019sal of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio in this case, and direct a 'mandate to be issued accordingly.1</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\n<em>Judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
