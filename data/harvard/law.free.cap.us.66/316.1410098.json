Harkness and Mana his wife brought their bill in the Circuit Court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois,. against Isaac Underhill, to compel the defendant to convey to Maria Harkness the west'half of the east half of the southeast quarter of section 4 in township 8, range 8, east of the 4th principal meridian, in Peoria county,\" Illinois. \u2022' The -material facts set forth in the bill are these :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-10\">Isaac Waters, the father of Maria Harkness, wasasett-ler and housekeeper on the half-quarter section of land described. As such he was in possession of the whole eighty acres from April 5th, 18.82, until July 13th, 1833; and from the latter date until July 2d, 1835, he was in possession of forty acres, the west half, cultivating it and making improvements, which began in April, 1832. On the 24th of November, 1832, he made his affidavit, which was corroborated by that of John G-. Trail, that he was a settler,.and housekeeper on the.half-quarter section; which affidavits of himself and Trail he afterwards presented at the land office and applied for the purchase and entry of the l\u00bfnd, but failed because the public surveys of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>township had not then been returned. Subsequently to this the surveys were returned, but \"Waters died without renewing his application. He left a. widow, and several children. On the 7th of August, 1835, which was after the death of Waters and within one year after the-return of the surveys, his widow, on behalf of herself-and children, applied for a p're-emption right upon the proofs which Waters had. made in his lifetime. The register and receiver, allowed the claim, and the land was thereupon entered by the widow for herself and the heirs-at-law of Waters.. The receipt was recorded in the office of the recorder for Peoria country. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-4\">The narrative now goes back to certain transactions of Waters with-other parties. \u25a0 On the 13th of July, 1833, he made his Writing obligatory to. Stephen Stillman and William A. Stewart, reciting that Water\u2019s and Stillman were common owners of the eighty acres ; that Stewart had bought half of Stillman\u2019s share; that Steyvart should pay $50, one half of the whole purchase money, anc[ Waters should 'make to Stewart and Stillman a good title ^for forty acres, the east half of the eighty acres. Stewart conveyed his interest to Francis Church. As to the west half, Waters bound himself on the 2d of July, 1835, to convey that to Moses Pettingal and William Wolcott. They assigned their interest to Aaron Russell, who went into possession and made improvements worth $3,000r Russell died in possession in the fall of 1838, leaving no children, but a ..widow, .who retainedv the possession to the time of her own death in the fall- of 1839, when Gale and Cross, administrators of Russell, took possession and kept it until they were turned out.by force, as will be mentioned hereafter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-5\">Ijn 1836, Stillman, taking advantage of the possession which he had acquired, with Waters\u2019s consent, of the east half of the eighty acres, claimed a pre-emption right in the whole of it. H\u00a9 had previously sold a portion of it to Aquilla Wren. The land office refused to allow him a pre-emption or to permit 'him to enter the land, because a pre-emption for the same land had been already-allowed to-the heirs of Waters. ; Stillman . died in 1837. The year afterwards, Wren, together w'th one Frisby, sent an agent to the land office, who got a pre-emptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>right allowed, and an entry made in the name of himself as agent for Stillman\u2019s heirs. But this was done without the authority or knowledge of Stillman\u2019s h'eirs, and the purchase money and fees were paid by Prisby and Wren. They also got a patent from the General Land Office at Washington, and turned Bussell\u2019s administrators (G\u00e1le and Cross) out of possession of the west half by force. In 1841, Wren conveyed the west half of the lot to Isaac Underhill.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-4\">After the administrators of Bussell had been forcibly detruded from their possession, they brought an action against Waters\u2019s representatives on the bond which Waters had given to Pettingal and Wolcott for the title of the west half of the lot, and recovered $3,000. On this judgment execution was issued; the land now in controversy was levied on <em>inter </em>alia, and sold to Charles Balance for $5. Balance conveyed to Maria Harkness, a daughter .of Waters, and one of the present plaintiffs. The other heirs of Waters also released their respective rights to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-5\">The bill concludes by praying that Isaac Underhill, the defendant, be decreed to convey the west half of the eighty acres to Maria Harkness, and account to her for the profits he has r aceived.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-6\">The defendant\u2019s version of the facts as extracted from his' answer,- and simply stated, is this:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-7\">\u2022 Waters was riot a settler and housekeeper on the land. His affidavit to that effect was false, and so was Trail\u2019s. He went on the land September 23,1832, put up a log-pen, without \u00e1 roof, staid the.re'o.ne night only, and the next day made his affidavit. That was the only possession he ever had, and the certificate of pre-emption obtained upon it was fraudulent and void. Defendant knew nothing of the written contract b\u00e9- . tween Waters of the one part,-arid Stillman ^nd Stewart of the other part, until long after he purchased, from Wren, and he denies that the facts recited in that writing are. true, or that Stillman got possession of the east half of the lot under thats writing; .he was in possession before. It is true that Bussell made improvements on .the west half, but they were made with . a^ full knowledge that Waters\u2019s pre-emption right was cop-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>tested, and its validity denied. When defendant made his purchase from Wren, the bond from Waters to Stillman and Stewart, as well as the receiver\u2019s certificate and receipt, were recorded in the-recorder\u2019s office of Peoria county, but he did not know it; he had no actual knowledge, of either transaction, and he insists that he is an innocent and <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for a- valuable consideration, without notice of any adverse claim whatever. He has made valuable improvements, which the plaintiffs stood by and saw him make for years, without asserting any right of their own; and this, together with the lapse of time, should protect him. He admits that the land was s,old by the sheriff at the suit of Russell\u2019s administrators, on a judgment against the personal representatives of Waters; but the sheriff\u2019s vendee acquired no tith, because the title was then not in the heirs of Waters, but in Wren.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-5\">The evidence taken in the cause was convincing enough that Waters was not an actual-settler and housekeeper on any part of the eighty acres when he made Ms application for the right of pre-emption. 'He was.at that time a resident of Peoria, 'and'continued to reside there afterwards. This was the only fact controverted betweetn the parties. ''The' Commissioner of the General Land Office ordered the entry of Waters\u2019s heirs to be vacated on the ground.of fraud. The principal questions, therefore, which arose on the bill, answer, and evidence, were:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-6\">1. Whether Waters\u2019s right of pre-emption could be set aside and the entry,.of his heirs vacated on the ground that his proofs were insufficient or false.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-7\">- \u25a0 2. Whether Stillman, and those claiming under him, were estopped by his contract with Waters to take advantage of the unsoundness of Waters\u2019s title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-8\">- 3. Whether Underhill, the defendant, took the legal title which he purchased from Wren discharged of the equities against it in the hands of Stillman; and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-9\">4. Whether the lapse of time and the accompanying circumstances were, or were not, a protection to Underhill against the claim of the plaintiffs..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-10\">The Circuit Court decided all the points of fact and law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>against the plaintiffs and dismissed the bill. Thereupon, they took this appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-5\"><em>Mr. Williams </em>for complainants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APl\">It makes no difference whether Waters\u2019s house and actual' residence was on the land in question or. on the adjoining tract. The substantial requirement1 of the law was, the improvement, and that was' on the land.1 The United States were not wronged, for they got as much money, and \u00e1s good, from Waters as they would have got from Stillman. Nor was Waters\u2019s entry a.fraud upon Stillman. It was made-with his consent and for his benefit. At all events,, Waters\u2019s entry was good under the act of June 19, 1834, which provides that all persons who were in possession of and cultivated lands in 1833 shall be entitled to preemption. \u2022 Besides, the irregularity, was cured by the act of July 2, 1836!</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-6\">The register and receiver having sold the land to Waters in conformity with the instructions of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, had no further power or j ui\u2019isdiction over it. Neither had the,Commissioner of the General Land Office power to set asideidie sale even for fraud.

Waters was not a settler or housekeeper. He had, therefore, no right \u2014 no title \u2014 nothing but a fraudulent claim, wholly worthless and void.' That being its character, the register and receiver and Commissioner of the General Land Office -had authority to rescind, set aside, and treat as a nullity the entry made by his heirs on the false proqfs produced by him in his lifetime. As\" Waters\u2019s Gentry did not give him the tifie, it was still in the United States, and the land office was justified in permitting Stillman\u2019s heirs to enter it. 2 Land Laws, 646; <em>Lewis </em>vs. <em>Lewis, </em>(9 Mo., 143.) \u201cIt is the duty of the Commissioner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the General Land Office to-revise the proceedings of the register and receiver and vacate entries which may have been illegally.made, and thereby arrest the completion of a title originating in fraud, mistake, or violation of law.\u201d This is the language of the court in <em>Green </em>vs. <em>Hill, </em>(9 Missouri, 322.) To the same effect are the cases of <em>Perry vs. O\u2019Hanlon, </em>(11 Mo., 585;) <em>Huntsucker </em>vs. <em>Clark, </em>(12 Mo., 333;) <em>Nelson </em>vs. <em>Simms, </em>(23 Miss., 383;) <em>Glenn </em>vs. <em>Thistle, </em>(23 Miss., 42;) <em>Mitchell </em>vs. <em>Cobb, </em>(13 Ala., 137;) <em>Dickinson vs. Brown, </em>(9 Smeade and Marshall, 130;) <em>Gray vs. McCance, </em>(4 Ill.) Between the ease at bar and the case last cited there is no essential difference. The Commissioner of the Land'Office held Gray\u2019s entry to be a nullity, a. fraud on the Government, and directed it to be set aside, and his action was held to be not only legal but conclusive upon the parties. If Waters had any claim under the act of April 5,1832, or March 2,1833, he waived it by his neglect to comply with the rules and regulations of the General Land Office, and no subsequent act'that he could take advantage of would cure the irregularity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-5\">The bond which Waters gave to Stillman was neither morally nor legally binding. Waters was to convey to Stillman if he obtained a pre-emption, and this he neither did nor could do. His heirs after his' death entered the land in fraud of the law, but they never offered to execute the contract by. conveying to Stillman. The bond was contrary to the policy of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVa\">The plaintiffs rely on the record as proving notice to Under-hill.' Perhaps these records may be notice that he had a claim, but in 1841, when Underhill made his purchase from Wren, the entry by Waters\u2019s heirs had been set aside for three years, and for the same period no person had been in possession claiming under Waters or his heirs. The patent had been issued to Stillman\u2019s heirs, and no intention had been manifested to assert an adverse claim. Then eighteen years, elapsed after the title, to Stillman, and fourteen after Underhill\u2019s purchase, before this bill was filed. Me\u00e1ntim\u00e9 the land ha,d increased in value one hundred fold \u2014 had been laid out into town lots, improved \u25a0and built upon , by innocent purchasers, and had become a ma- . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>terial portion of a thriving and important western city. The purchase by Underhill was made in good faith, and the entire legal and equitable title is vested in him. He need not go behind his patent for a title. It is conclusive evidence of right and title in the patentee until attacked and overthrown'by some one who can show \u00e1 superior equity. The defendant is also fully and wholly protected by the statute of limitations. 2 Purple\u2019s Stat., 730; Purple\u2019s Real Estate St., 424.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b325-5\">Mr. Justice .CATRON.</author>\n<p id=\"A-W\">In the winter or spring of-1832, Isaac Waters and Stephen Stillman agreed to cultivate and improve-the east half of the southeast quarter of section four, a portion of which is in controversy in this suit.. This arrangement was made in view of the probability that Congress would, at its then session, pass a pre-emption law. It was further stipulated that Waters should make the necessaiy proof to obtain the pre-emption. As was anticipated, the act of April 5, 1832, was passed, allowing \u201cto actual settlers, being house-' keeper?,\u201d a pre-emption to enter a half-quarter section to include his improvement. Waters went on the land, made a slight improvement for the purpose of cultivation, erected a temporary hut, or rather a pen, put some furniture in it, and he,-with a part of -his family, went into the hut, staid there a couple of days, and then returned to his residence in the village of Peoria, where-he resided, and continued to reside. , He was a substantial resident of the village, having a house, home, and .family there. The 'half-quarter section adjoined the village property. Waters made an affidavit in September, 1832, that he'- was an actual settler and housekeeper on the land. -He does not say at what time, but he .applied t\u00f3 enter under the provisions of the act of April 5, 1832. He .also procured the affidavit of one Trail, who swoi\u2019e that Waters was an actual settler and housekeeper on the half-quarter section. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In July, 1833, Waters, in a written agreement with Stillman and Wm. A. Stewart, recited the* terms on which he and Still-man agreed to improve the land, to wit: that the entry was to be made for their joint benefit on the proofs, furnished by Waters. Stewart, at the date of the agreement, stipulated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>pay Stillman\u2019s moiety of the purchase-money, and Waters was bound to convey to Stewart.and Stillman one-half of the eighty acres; and it appears by a covenant, dated July 2, 1835, executed by Waters to Pettingal and Wolcott, that Waters\u2019s portion was the western forty acres, which he bound himself to convey to Pettingal and Wolcott, they being purchasers from Waters. Waters soon thereafter died, leaving a widow and children, and they entered the half-quarter section, in the name of Waters, at the land office at Quincy, August.7,1835. The entry stood in this condition till' May, 1838, when the Commissioner of the General Land Office informed the register and receiver at Quincy that, Stephen Stillman\u2019s h'eirs having applied to them to enter the half-quarter section, containing eighty acres, and having adduced evidence to the Commissioner tending.to prove that Waters went on the land into a' log-pen, without a ro\u00f3f, find staid there only on\u00e9 night; furthermore,.that the affidavits of Waters and Trail being evasive, aud not stating that Waters was an actual settler on the 5th of April, 1832, the register and receiver were, therefore, instructed, that if they believed the facts, as respects the frauds practised to obtain the entry in Waters\u2019s name, to treat it as void,.for fraud, and allow Still-man\u2019s heirs to enter the land; and this was accordingly done. The entry in Stillman\u2019s name was made under the .occupant law of 1834.'</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We con cur with, the Commissioner\u2019s directions, and the finding of the register and receiver, that the proceeding of Waters was a fraudulent contrivance to secure the valuable privilege-of a, preference of entry. It was- an attempt to speculate on his part, and also on the-part of Stillman, his co-partner,, by fraud and falsehood. , They both knew equally well that Waters was no actual settler on the.public lands at-any time, and that the affidavits of Waters and Trail were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The principal-ground on which the bill is founded assumes that the complainant, as. assignee of Waters\u2019s heirs, is entitled to a decree against the respondent, because his title was derived-through Stillman, andthat Stillman came.into possession under Waters, and therefore Stillman\u2019s assignee cannot dispute the title of him under whom he held possession, according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>doctrine maintained by this court in the case of <em>Thredgill </em>vs. Pintard, (12 How., 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In Thr\u00e9dgill\u2019s ease the transaction was fair, and obviously honest. \u25a0 The consideration between the .parties was full and undoubted; their contracts bound-them. But in this case, there was no legal contract between Stillman and Waters. They combined to defraud the Government; their agreement was contrary to public policy, because it was intended by contrivanee-to take the land' out of the market at public sale \u2014 \u00e1 cherished policy of the Government. Such an agreement can have no standing in a court of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">But there is another defence equally conclusive. The bill seeks the legal title from Underhill; he holds under a patent, dated in 1838; he purchased in 1841, and has been in uninterrupted possession ever, since. This suit was brought in 1854. \u2022 In the meantime,' the land' sued for has been' partly laid off into, lots, and become city property; yet, Waters\u2019s claiiu\u2019lay dormant after his entry was set aside at the General Land Office for eighteen years, and fourteen years after the patent in Stillman\u2019s name was issued, and the land conveyed to Underhill by Wren. Underhill, and those holding under him, have held possession from 1841 to the time when this suit was brought; and, in the meantime, the land had greatly increased in' value, and changed in its. circumstances. These facts present a case on which a court of equity cannot decree for the complainant, if there was 'no other defence.</p>\n<p id=\"AFA\">The question is again raised, whether this entry, having been allowed by the register and receiver, could be set aside by; the Commissioner. All the officers administering the public lands were bound by the regulations published May 6, 1886.1, 2 <em>L. </em>L. &amp; O., 92. These regulations prescribed the mode of proceeding to vacate a fraudulent occupant entry, and were pursued in the case before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">This question has several times been- raised and decided in this court, upholding the Commissioner\u2019s powers. <em>Garland </em>vs. <em>Winn, </em>(20 How., 8;) <em>Lytle </em>vs. <em>The State of Arkansas, </em>(22 How.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">Eor the reasons above stated, it is ordered that the decree of the Circuit Court hr affir-ihed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
