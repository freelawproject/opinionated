The answer of the defendants sets forth, among other things, the act of incorporation, and avers that they were in possession long before the passage of that act; that they were in possession at the time of its passage, and have remained in possession ever since, as the undisputed owners of the premises. The State court dismissed the information, (3 Gray, 1,) and this writ of error was taken by the relators.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-5\"><em>Mr. Bartlett, </em>of Massachusetts, for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKT\">moved the court to dismiss the writ of error for want of jurisdiction. The judgment (he said) is sought to be reversed, and the power of this court to do it rests solely on the ground that the act incorporating the defendants was unconstitutional, whereas it does not appear that the validity of that act was in any man-, ner drawn into controversy. Even if the validity of the act had been a question in the court below, and its validity had been sustained, there are various other grounds within the exclusive cognizance of the State court upon which this judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-6\">The doctrine is now firmly established, that to give this court jurisdiction, it must, appear by the record, or by. clear and necessary intendment, that the question on which the jurisdiction is founded <em>must </em>have been, raised, and <em>must </em>have been decided, in order to.have induced the judgment. <em>Crowell </em>vs. <em>Randall, </em>(10 Peters, 368, 398.)

In this case the <em>bill </em>refers tc the act of 1795 .'but once, and there avers in substance that it is valid.

The act of 1805 purports to transfer the seisin of the lands in dispute to the corporation, and thus impairs the obligation of the trust contract by which the premises were devoted to the religious uses of the Scottish Presbyterian Church. This wrong the State court refused to redress, and this court is bound to reverse the decree.for that reason. <em>Fletcher </em>vs. <em>Peck, (6 </em>Cranch, 87;) <em>New Jersey </em>vs. <em>Wilson, </em>(7 Cranch, 164;) <em>Jackson </em>vs. <em>Lamphere, </em>(3 Peters, 280;) <em>Providence Bank </em>vs. <em>Billings, </em>(4 Peters, 514;) <em>Charles River Bridge </em>vs. <em>Warren Bridge, </em>(11 Peters, 490;) <em>Gordon </em>vs. <em>Appeal Tax Court, </em>(3 Howard, 183;) <em>Maryland </em>vs. <em>Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co., </em>(3 Howard, 576;) <em>West River Bridge Co. </em>vs. <em>Dix, </em>(6 Howard, 507;) <em>Bronson </em>vs. <em>Kenzie, </em>(1 Howard, 111;) <em>Planters\u2019 Bank </em>vs. <em>Sharp, </em>(6 Howard, 301;) <em>Phalen </em>vs. <em>Virginia, </em>(8 Howard, 163;) <em>Woodruff vs. Trapnall, </em>(10 Howard, 190;) <em>Poup vs. Drew, </em>(10 Howard, 218;) <em>Baltimore &amp; Susquehanna Railroad Company </em>vs. <em>Nesbit, </em>(10 Howard, 395;) <em>Butler </em>vs. Pennsylvania, 10 Howard, 402;) <em>East Hartford </em>vs. <em>Hartford Bridge Company, </em>(10 Howard, 511;) <em>League </em>vs. <em>De Young, </em>(11 Howard, 105;) <em>Pennsylvania </em>vs. <em>Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co., </em>(13 Howard, 518;) <em>State Bank of Ohio </em>vs. <em>Knoop, </em>(16 Howrd, 369;) <em>Ohio Life Insurance Co. </em>vs. <em>Debolt, (16 </em>Howard, 416;) <em>Christ Church vs. County of Philadelphia, (20 </em>Howard, 28;) <em>Terrett vs. Taylor, </em>(9 Cranch, 43;) <em>Clark\u2019s Executor </em>vs. <em>Van Reinsdyk, </em>(9 Cranch, 133;) <em>Sturges vs. Commonwealth, </em>(4 Wheaton, 122;) <em>Farmers Mechanics\u2019 Bank </em>vs. <em>Smith, </em>(6 Wheaton, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>131;) <em>Ogden </em>vs. <em>Saunders, </em>(12 Wheaton, 213;) <em>Mumma </em>vs. <em>Potomac Co., </em>(8 Peters, 181;) <em>Beers </em>vs. <em>Haughton, </em>(9 Peters, 329;) <em>Gantley's Lessee </em>vs. Ewing, (3 Howard, 707;) <em>Cook </em>vs. <em>Moffat, </em>(5 Howard, 295;) <em>Crawford vs. Bank of Mobile, </em>(7 Howard, 279;) <em>Curran </em>vs. <em>Arkansas, </em>(15 Howard, 304.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-5\">It is not necessary that it should be <em>expressed </em>on the record, that the Validity of \u201cthe act was in controversy; .it is-sufficient that it appear by clear and necessary <em>intendment </em>that a question which this court has jurisdiction to re-examine was actually decided by the State court. <em>Medberry </em>vs. <em>Ohio, </em>(24 How., 413;) <em>Commercial Bank of Cincinnati </em>vs. <em>Buckingham\u2019s Executors, </em>(5 How. 317, 341;) <em>Smith </em>vs. <em>Hunter, </em>(7 How., 738;) <em>Neilson </em>vs. <em>Logan, </em>(12 How., 98;) <em>Williams </em>vs. <em>Oliver, </em>(12 How., III;) <em>Grand Gulf Railroad </em>vs. <em>Marshall, </em>(12 How., 165;) <em>Lawler </em>vs. <em>Walker, </em>(16 How., 149;) <em>Maxwell </em>vs. <em>Newbold, </em>(18 How., 511;) <em>Christ Church </em>vs. <em>Philadelphia, </em>(20 How., 26.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b267-6\">Mr. Justice GRIER.</author>\n<p id=\"AnB\">The writ of error in this ease suggests, as a foundation for the jurisdiction of this court, \u201c.that there was drawn in question the validity of a statute of said Commonwealth, to wit, an act of the legislature,-passed the 15th day of June, 1805, entitled \u2018An act declaring and confirming the incorporation of the-proprietors of the meetinghouse in Federal street,\u2019 in the town of Boston, being repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and the decision of the court was in favor of the validity of said statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Is this suggestion of the writ supported by .the record, either by direct averment, 'or by any necessary intendment ?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">We think it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">1. -The decree of the court is, simply, that' the bill be dismissed without any reasons alleged for su.ch dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">' 2. The bill itself raises no such issue; it refers to the act in question, only as conferring the privilege of a corporation on the defendant. It does not aver that the defendants pretend to have title to the property in question by virtue thereof,.and challenge its validity. _ \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">The answer alleges that respondents were incorporated by the act of 1805, and that, \u201cunder it, they are the true.and sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>owners of the premises, and that said act was passed on the application- and petition of parties who, prior thereto, 'were owners- of pews, or tenants in common of the land and the house thereon.\u201d It is not alleged that the act <em>\u201c'propria vigore\u201d </em>divested, the plaintiff\u2019s title and vested it in the corporation, but that the title was vested in the corporation at the request of the owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The only questions, therefore, which could arise on these pleadings were, whether the persons who obtained the act of incorporation were the owners, and whether, after an adverse possession of forty years, a. court of equity would interfere to disturb the possession of l\u2019espondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The answer takes issue on the charge of the bill, that Little and his associates had contributed land and money to support a public <em>charity; </em>it averred that, on a proper construction of the original deed of the premises, the meeting-house was not dedicated to a charitable use, but was erected for their common use, and held by them in proportion to the sums severally contributed; and, consequently, if the representatives of these tenants-in common had their rights transferred to the corporation, it was only a transfer of their rights by their consent, and for their own convenience \u2014 an enabling act, with which the complainants had no concern. The-issue, then, was not on the validity of the act, but on the construction of the original deed or agreement of the parties who built the meetinghouse. The validity of the act of assembly of Massachusetts was not, therefore, drawn in question directly by any averment of the pleadings by the decree, or by anj^ necessary intendment from other averments in the pleadings, or evidence on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The opinion of the State court to be found in 3 Gray, <em>1, </em>confirms this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The case is, therefore, dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">\n<em>Writ of error dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
