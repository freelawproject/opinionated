A corporation exists only in contemplation of law, and by force of law, and can-have no legal existence beyond the bounds of the sovereignty by which it is created. . It must dwell in the place of its creation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b288-8\">2. A corporation is not a citizen within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States, and cannot maintain a suit'in a court of the United States against the citizen of a different State from that by which it was chartered, unless the persons who compose the corporate body are all citizens of that State.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b288-10\">3. In such case they may sue by their corporate name, averring the eiti. zenship of all the members, and such a suit would be regarded as the joint suit of individual persons, united together in the corporate body and acting under the name conferred upon them for the more convenient transaction of business, and consequently entitled to maintain a suit in the courts of the United States against a citizen of another State.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b288-12\">4.

A suit by or against a corporation, in its corporate name, must be presumed to be a suit by or against citizens of the State which created the corporate body; and no averment or evidence to the contrary is admissible for the purpose of withdrawing the suit from the jurisdiction of a court of the United States.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b288-16\">6. A corporation endued with the capacities and faculties it possesses by the co-oper\u00e1ting legislation of two States, cannot have que and the same legal being in both States.

The declaration described the plaintiffs as \u201cThe President and Directors of th\u00e9 Ohio and Mississippi Railroad Company, a corporation created by the laws of the States of Indiana and Ohio, and having its principal place of business in Cincinnati, in the State of Ohio, a citizen of the State of Ohio.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-5\">.

United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-6\">There are,, as is well known, in the United States a considerable number of important railroads, which, like the one now in question, run through two or rriore, or parts of two or more States, by virtue and under the authority of the laws of those States. \u2022 ' \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-7\">. If such corporations have a right to sue at all in the courts of the United States, it must\" bebecause they ar\u00e9, in contemplation of law, citizens, of some pne_.or of all such States'. .It would be claiming very much for these corporation's to insist that, they can sue or be sued as a citizen of each of these States,. The right of. such a-corporation to sue \u00e1s a citizen of a State must, without doubt,.be limited to some one of-the'Stated through- which the .road passes. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-8\">And this gives rise to the question: .What,- in. such case, is the-.criterion by which the citizenship of such \u00bf .corporation shall be determined? <em>t. . ' </em>..</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-9\">. It will be difficult to fix upon any other criterion in such . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>\u2022case except the locality of its principal place of business. The place where it has its principal business office; where its stockholders hold their meetings; where the board of directors have their sessions; where the records of the company are kept; and where the governing power acts and issues its orders \u2014 there, if any yrhere, is;the <em>habitat, </em>the residence, the citizenship of such a corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-5\">This proposition would seem t\u00f3 be fairly inferable from the doctrine laid down by this court in the cases of <em>Covington Drawbridge Company </em>vs, <em>Shepherd et al., </em>(20 How., 231;) Louisville, <em>Cincinnati &amp; Charleston Railroad Company </em>vs. <em>Letson, </em>(2 How., 497;) and <em>Marshall </em>vs. <em>The Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, </em>(16 How,, 325:)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqJ\">\u25a0 Hpon the strength of these decisions we claim, that as it k admitted by the pleadings in this case that the plaintiff is a corporation, created such by the laws of Ohio, and has its principal place of business at Cincinnati, in that State,'the defendant is estopped by that admission from denying that the corporation is a citizen of Ohio, and that this estoppel is founded upon a principle of public convenience.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZM\">The case of <em>Marshall </em>vs. <em>The Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company </em>seems to be precisely in point. There, Marshall, a citizen of Virginia, sued the Baltimore &amp; Ohio.Railroad Company in the Circuit, Court of the United States for the district of Maryland. The Baltimore and. Ohio road runs through parts of the States of case, that company has its principal business office in one of those States, to wit, at Baltimore, in Maryland, and it uses and operates that part of the road which lies in Virginia precisely as the Ohio &amp; Mississippi Railroad Company uses, and operates that part of its road which is in Indiana. And by looking into th\u00e9 Jaws of Virginia it will be seen , that the grant to that company by that' State is not merely a grant of a right of way, but is a grant of corporate powers, and that the company is made subject to all the provisions of the general railroad laws of Vir\"ginia, so far as the same are properly applicable to that road. Among these laws of Virginia are the act passed March 8th, 1827, sess. acts of 1826-7, p. 77; March 11th, 1837, sess. acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>of 1836-7, p. 101; and March 6th, 1847, seas* acts of 1846-7, p. 86. (See 6th sec. of this act.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-6\">In the early decisions of this court, a strict construction was given to that clause of the Constitution which confers jurisdic; tion upon the courts of the. United States, by reason of the citizenship of the parties;. but the late eases, and especially those named above, have proceeded upon the ground, that this clause was intended to grant a beneficial privilege.to'the citizens of the United States, and ought,- therefore, to be liberally construed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Avt\"><em>Mr. Porter, </em>of Indiana,' for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnA\">The averment that the plaintiff is \u201ca corporation cre\u00e1te'd by the laws of the States of Indiaua and Ohio,\u201d is-repugnant as amounting to the alie-, .gation <em>of </em>a legal impossibility.. As between two States there, can be no joint legislation creating one and the same corporation \u2014 or, indeed, in passing any law. Each State in its legislation must act independently and separately; and its enactments are only binding within its own. jurisdiction. If two States pass a similar law on the same subject, the two are not one joint-law, such a's would create a corporation. -, .They might,indeed, perhaps create two distinct corporations having the same name and like, powers ; but they could not make the two to be the same artificial person., No.r could ,th\u00e9 States by subsequent acts unite the two corporations so as to give them- one identity. Such appears-to have been the doctrine of Mr. Jus-' ' tice Story, in <em>Farnum </em>vs. <em>The Blackstone Canal Co., </em>(1 Sumn., 47.),</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_E\">\u2022' The declaration says that the . plaintiff was created by the -laws\u00bfof Indiana and -Ohio, and yet claims that it is an. Ohio' corporation; Could the- Indiana Legislature contribute anything towards the creation\u2018of a corporation \u201cdwelling\u201d in Ohio f. \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-10\">If such action concerning a corporation should be had by two States, can it be said that the corporation was created by both the States ? Rather, shbuld, we not say that the State whose law first, took effect - created, the corporation; and that the other State had, at most, recognised its existence, not created it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>' But as no joint legislation, of two States can create one identical corporation, this corporation, if created at all, must, within the constitutional sense, have its citizenship, as well as its creation, in one of these States only; and the declaration leaves it uncertain of which State. 'We. contend that by a public Statute of Indiana, as we will hereafter more fully show, Indiana-alone created it, and Indiana alone is its dwelling-place. It cannot be contended that the plaintiff is a citizen both of Indiana and Ohio for the purposes of jurisdiction. No natural .person can be a citizen of more than one place at the same time. \u201c The supposition .that a man can have two domicils would lead to the absurdest consequences.\u201d <em>Abington </em>vs. <em>North Bridgewater, </em>(23 Pick., 170, 177;) Story on the Conflict of Laws, sec. 45, <em>a. </em>Now, shall we go so far as to give an artificial person, for the purposes of jurisdiction, a privilege which no natural person in the United States can have? If, \u00e1s the declaration avers, this corporation was created at all by the laws of Indiana, it is, for the purposes of jurisdiction, a citizen of Indiana, as muchas if no other State had legislated concerning it; and it therefore cannot sue a citizen of Indiana in the Federal courts of that State. If the. ground assumed in the declaration be tenable, the plaintiff might also sue in the Federal courts .in Ohio, and aver that it was created by the laws of Ohio and Indiana.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-5\">.We have said that the averment, \u201cthe principal place of business of the plaintiff is in Ohio,\u201d cannot save the. jurisdiction, and is mere surplusage. That it may help the jurisdiction seems to be hinted in the case of the <em>Lafayette Insurance Co. </em>vs. <em>French, </em>(18 How., 404.) We submit, however, that the, hint is but an <em>obiter dictum. </em>But be this as it may, the contrary has been often ruled in this court. Thus in Marshall vs. <em>The Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co., </em>(16 How., 325,) the averment was that the company was a \u201c body corporate, by an act of the General Assembly of Maryland;\u201d and it was held sufficient. And in <em>The Covington Drawbridge Co. </em>vs. <em>Shepherd, </em>(20 How., 227,) the same doctrine is held. So, in <em>The Philadelphia, Wilmington &amp; Baltimore R. R. Co. </em>vs. <em>Quigley, (21 </em>How., 202,) jt was held, that to aver the company to be \u201ca body corporate in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>State .of Maryland; by a law of the General Assembly of Maryland,\u201d was sufficient. So in <em>Covington Drawbridge Co. vs. Shepherd, (21 </em>How., 113,) the averment that the defendant is a corporation and citizen-of Indiana,\u201d was held good.' These cases, in 20 and 21 How.,-must be considered as overruling the dictum above referred to,in 18 How., and as settling the rul\u00e9 that the averment of the. place of business is unnecessary, and therefore surplusage*</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-4\">Nor can the averment that .the plaintiff\u2019 is a citizen of the State of Ohio,\u201d help the declaration. . This averment,, says Mr.: Justice Curtis, \u201c cap have no sensible, meaning \u00e1ttached to it. (18 How., 405.) . ;</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-5\">We conclude, therefore, that'the declaration is on its face bad; as not showing the jurisdiction; and that for this cause, whatever may be. thought of our- plea, the,poipt in question should be decided in our favor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-6\">Even though , this court* on- a. demurrer to Ufo plea to the jurisdiction, will not look into the declaration, Still the decision must be for the defendant, because the plea on its face is good as showing that, so far as .concerns jurisdiction, both the plain* .tiff and defendant \u00e1re citizens of Indiana.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-7\">This plea says that this corporation was created by an act of the Legisl\u00e1ture of Indiana, o/.February 14, 1848. That act is found in the Special Laws of Indiana of 1848, p. 619. By the, first section of that act it is provided that it \u201c shall take effect and lie in force frbm\u2019and after its passage, and shall be taken to be. a public act,\"and construed liberally for the object's therein set forth, and the regular organization of the corporation under the sapie shall be presumed, and considered as proven in all courts of'justice.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-8\">From this section of the plaintiff\u2019s charter the following conclusions seem inevitable:</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-9\"><em>First </em>That this ,act is a public act, of which, all courts must, <em>ex officio, </em>take notice. Bac. Ab. Tit. Statutes, F; 5 Blackf. R., 170.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-10\"><em>Sec\u00f3nd. </em>Th\u00e1t, the'corporation in; question was created by this statute on the 14th day of February, 1848, and thereby became. from that time an Indiana corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Third., That the \u201cregular organization of the. corporation,\u201d tinder said Indiana charter, must, <em>ex officio, </em>\u201cbe presumed and considered as proven \u201d in .this court. This court has, in a much weaker case, <em>ex </em>officio, taken notice of an Indiana charter, merely because the Indiana constitution makes all the statutes of that State public acts. <em>Covington Drawbridge Company </em>vs. <em>Shepherd, </em>(20 How., 231.) Indeed, it seems that since the court must officially note this fact, it is probable that in raising our objection to the jurisdiction, no plea' at all was. necessary; in other words, perhaps on ithe very face of the declaration'the court is bound officially to take notice that this is an Indiana corporation, and that therefore the declaration is bad, as not showing jurisdiction; and so this court has expressly decided <em>in Covington, &amp;c., Co. </em>vs. <em>Shepherd, </em>(20 How., 227, 231.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-5\"><em>We </em>believe that it is noffpretended by the plaintiff that any act of Ohio' referring specially to this corporation was ever passed till after said Indiana act took effect. , <em>We </em>suppose, indeed, that all the acts of Ohio concerning this corporation.wer.e private acts, and that, not being pleaded, they cannot be noticed by this court. It seems that acts creating private corporations, as this/is, are private statutes, unless the Legislature makes them public. 5Blackf., 78; Gould\u2019s Pl., 56.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-6\">But even if the court will officially notice the Ohio statutes recognising this corporation, it cannot aid the jurisdiction ;\u25a0 for it is clear that, these statutes having all been passed after the Indiana charter took effect, they did not create the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-7\"><em>We </em>shall here notice all the Ohio acts of which we have any knowledge which have recognised the plaintiff as a corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-8\">The first of tjhese Ohio acts is that of March 15,1849. Certainly it,creates no corporation,-but merely recognises the'existence of the plaintiff \u00e1s a corporation created in the State, of Indiana. It only says that \u201c the Legislature of Indiana, on the 14th day of February, 1848, passed an act incorporating the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad Company,\u201d \u00bfnd \u201cthat the corporate\u2019powers granted to said company by th\u00e9 act of Indiana incorporating the satae be recognised.\u201d Here is evidence in the Ohio law.itself, that this is an Indiana7 corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number><em>\u25a0 </em>The only other Ohio act on the subject which we have found is an act passed January 24,1851.V It authorizes an extension of the road, by the corporation already existing, to the city of Cincinnati. If is true that the third section of this act undertakes to declare that the intention of the first section of the act of March 15, 1849, \u201cwas to recognise, confirm, and adopt the .charter of the said Ohio and Mississippi Railroad Company as enacted by the Legislature of the State of \"Indiana.\u201d , But so far as th\u00e9-present- controversy is concerned, there are two objections to this declaratoryi\u00e1ct:.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-4\">\u25a0 <em>First. </em>The Ohio Legislature has no power to pass a declaratory act.' To declare \u201cthe intention \u201d of a prior law is a-judicial \u00e1ct; .and the. judicial power of Ohio has-always,\u2019by her constitution, been, vested in her courts. Her General Assembly has 'only legislative power; \"it may make laws, but cannot .afterwards construe them. \u201cIt seems.to be settled, as the . sense of the courts qf justice in this country, that the Legislarture cannot pass any declaratory laW.\u201d-; 1 Kent\u2019s Com., 456, ' note <em>b, </em>and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-5\">: <em>Second. </em>-This. Ohio act does not pretend to create a corpora- \u2022 tion.' It only \u201c recognises, confirms, and adopts the charter of said company as enacted by the Legislature of the State of Indiana.\u201d But the point is not, wheiehas the corporation been -recognised, but where-was it created? It has never been pretended that, touching'the question of the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, a corporation is a citizen of any State except that v? hich created it. Indeed, this court has said, in-the case of <em>the Bank of Augusta </em>vs., <em>Earle, </em>that a corporation \u201cmust dwelt bn the place of its creation,and cannot migrate to another sovereignty.\u201d 13 Pet., 588. And in <em>Runyan </em>vs. <em>Lessee of Coster </em>this, eburt again said : /\u201c A corporation can have no legal existence out of the sovereignty by which it was created.\u201d 14 Pet., 129.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-6\">No .matter what is stated in the pleadings, the court must judicially,take notice that by the last section of the plaintiff\u2019s Indiana charter, the pl\u00e1intiff is -an Indiana corporation, and, therefore, cannot sue a citizen of that- Stale in the Federal courts thereof. \u25a0 ,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Mr. Chief Justice TANEY.</author>\n<p id=\"A-V\">. This action was brought in - the Circuit Court of -.the United States for the district of Indiana, to recover $2,400, with ten per cent, damages, which' the plaintiffs alleged to be. due for fifty shares of the capital stock of the company, subscribed by the defendant; -</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The declaration-state that the,plaintiffs are \u201ca corporation, created by the laws of the States of Indiana and Ohio, having its principal place of! business in Cincinnati, in the State of: Ohio; that the corporation is a citizen\u2019of the State'of'Ohio* and Henry-D. Wheeler, the defendant,-is a citizen of the State of Indiana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Tlie defendant pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court, averring that he was-a citizen,of the State of Indiana, and ..that the plaintiffs were a body politic-and corporate, created, organized, and existing in the same State, under and by virtue of an act of Assembly of. the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The plaintiffs demurred to this plea; and the judges being opposed in opinion Upon the question whether their court had. jurisdiction, ordered their division of opinion to be certified to this court. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">\u25a0 A brief reference to cases heretofore, decided^ will show how the question must be answered. And, as the subject was fully considered and discussed in the cases to which we, are- about to refer, it is unnecessary to state here the principles and rules of law which have heretofore 'governed' the decisions of the court, and must-decide the question now bef\u00f3re us.</p>\n<p id=\"AXE\">In the ease of the <em>Bank of Augusta </em>vs. <em>Earle, </em>(13 Pet., 512,) the court held, that the artificial person or legal entity known to the common law as a corporation can have no legal existence out of the bounds of the sovereignty by which it'is created; that it exists only in contemplation of law, and by force of law; and where that law. ceases to operate, the corporation can have no existence. It must dwell in ,the place of its creation. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">It had been decided, in the case of <em>The Bank </em>vs. <em>Deviary, </em>(5 Cr., 61,) long before the case of the <em>Bank of Augusta </em>vs. <em>Earle </em>came before the court, that a corporation is not <em>d </em>citizen, within the meaning of the' Constitution of the United States, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>cannot maintain a suit in a court of the United States against the citizen of a different State from that by which it was chartered, unless the persons who compose the corporate body are all citizens of that' State. But, if that be the case, they may sue by their corporate name, averring the citizenship of all of the members; and such a suit would be regarded as the joint suit of the individual persons, united together in the corporate body, and-acting under the name conferred upon them, for the-more convenient transaction of business, and consequently \u2022entitled to maintain a suit in the courts of the United States against a citizen of another State.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">This question, as to the character of a coi'poration, and the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, in cases wherein they were sued, or brought suit in their corporate name,\"Was again brought before the court in the case of <em>The Louisville, Cincinnati and Charleston Railroad Company </em>vs. <em>Letson, </em>reported in 2 How., 497; and the court in that case, upon full consideration, decided, that where a corporation is created by the .laws of a State, the legal presumption is, that its members are citizens of the State in whibh alone the corporate body has a legal existence; and that a suit by or against a corporation, in its corporate name, must be presumed to be a suit by or against citizens of the State which created the corporate body; and that no averment or evidence to the contrary is admissible, for the purposes of withdrawing the suit from the jurisdiction of a court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"AbX\">The question, however, was felt by this court to be one of great difficulty and delicacy; and it was again argued and maturely considered in the ease of <em>Marshall </em>vs. <em>The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, </em>(16 How., 314,) as will appear by the report, and the decision in the case of <em>The Louisville, Cincinnati and Charleston Railroad Company </em>vs. <em>Letson </em>reaffirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AoE8\">And again, in the case of <em>The Covington Drawbridge Company </em>vs. <em>Shepherd and others, </em>(20 How., 232,) the same question of jurisdiction was presented,- and the rule laid down in the two last-mentioned cases fully maintained. After these successive decisions, the law. upon this subject must be regarded as settled ; and a suit by or against a corporation in its corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>name, as a suit by or against citizens of the State which created it.</p>\n<p id=\"A81\">It follows from these decisions,' that this suit in the corpora ate name is, in contemplation of law, the suit of the individual persons who compose it, and must, therefore, be regarded and treated as a suit in which citizens of Ohio and Indiana are joined as plaintiffs in an action against a citizen of the last-mentioned State. Such an action .'cannot be maintained \u00fcn a court of the United States, where jurisdiction of the ease depends altogether on the citizenship of the parties. And, ip such a suit, it can make no\\ difference whether the plaintiffs sue in their own proper names, or by the corporate name aiid style by which they are described.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The averments in the declaration would seem'to imply that the plaintiffs claim to have been created a corporate body, ancl to have been endued with the capacities and faculties it possesses by the co-oper\u00e1ting legislation of the two States, and to, be one and the same legal being in both States.'</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">If this were the case, it would not affect the question of jurisdi\u00e9tion in this suit. But such a corporation can have no legal existence upon the principles of the common law, or under the decision of this court in the case of the <em>Bank of Augusta </em>vs. <em>Earle, </em>before referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">It is true, that a corporation, by the name and style of the plaintiffs appears to have been - chartered by the States of Indiana and Ohio, clothed with the same capacities\u2019and powei\u2019s, anti intended to accomplish the same objects, and it is sp'oken of in the laws of the States as one eox\u2019poratb body, exercising the same powei\u2019s and fulfilling the sain\u00e9 duties in both Slates. Yet.it has no legal existence in either State, except by the law of the State. And neither State could confer on it a corporate existence in the other, nor-add to or diminish the powers to be there exercised.. It-may, indeed, be .composed and represent, under the corporate name, the same natural persons. But the legal entity or pei\u2019son, which exists by force of law, can \u00f1ave no existence beyond the limits of the St\u00bbte or sovereignty which brings it into life and endues it with, its faculties and powers-. The President\u2019 and Directors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad Company is, therefore, a distinct and separate corporate body in Indiana from the corporate body of the same name in Ohio, and they cannot be joined in a suit as one and the same plaintiff, nor maintain a suit in that character against a citizen of Ohio or Indiana in a Circuit Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">These questions, however, have been so fully examined in the cases above referred to, that further discussion can hardly be necessary in deciding the case before us. And we shall certify to the Circuit Court, that it has no jurisdiction of the case on the facts presented by the pleadings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
