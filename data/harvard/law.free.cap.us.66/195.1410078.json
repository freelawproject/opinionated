If was commenced in the St. Louis Land Court, (equity side,) by petition and summons, agreeably to the code of Missouri. The plaintiff, John Magwire, claimed four arpents by four of land lying in the county of St. Louis, of which the defendants, Mary L. Tyler and others, were wrongfully in possession. The petition prayed a decree for title in them \u2014 for possession - -for an account of profits, and an injunction against waste. The defendants answered at lengthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>denying the material facts set forth in the petition^ and asserting that they were rightfully in possession. The Land Court heard the cause, found the facts specially, and made a decree in favor of the defendants, dismissing the petition, which was affirmed afterwards-by the Supreme Court of the State, and' the plaintiff took'this writ of error. \"What the facts in dispute were, and how they were found by the court of original juris- ' diction, will appear by reference to the opinion of Mr. Justice <em>Catron. </em>The defendants in error moved to dismiss the writ for want of jui\u2019isdiction, and the court heard the argument on that motion, and upon the errors assigned by the plaintiff in the judgment of the State court at the same time.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A99\"><em>Mr. </em>Ewing, of Ohio, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9v\">The two confirmations were connected in the same concession and included in one survey! That survey was recognised by the United States and acquiesced in by th\u00e9 parties for more than fifteen years. It vested an inchoate legal title in both accprding to their respective interests.

N. west course, from the foot of the hill where stands the' Grange.de Terre, ascending to the vicinity of Stoiiy creek, bounded on one side by the bank of the Mississippi; on the opposite side by the public domain; and on the southern side th\u00e9 tract was bo\u00fanded'by the concession to the'\u2019free mulattress Esther, made in 1793. .</p>\n<p id=\"AHc1\">In 1798, Brazeau sold and conveyed to Labeaume part of his : concession. The deed includes four arpents, \u201cto be taken from the foot of the hill or mound c\u00f3mmonly called the Grange de Terre, by twenty- arpents in depth, bounded by the Rocky branch on the extremity opposite the said mound; reserving to myself (says Brazeau\u2019s deed) four arpents of land, to be taken at the foot of said mound, in the southern part of the aforesaid tract; selling only sixteen arpents in depth to the said L&amp;beaume.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">In 1799, Labeaume applied to the-Governor, and go.t his tract of 4 by 16 arpents enlarged,-including the land conveyed to him by Brazeau, extending north to the Rocky Branch, calling for .twenty arpents in depth. This enlarged tract the Governor ordered Soulard to survey for Labeaume, and to put him into possession; which the surveyor did, in April, 1799.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Labeaume applied to have his claim confirmed by the board of commissioners, and, in 1810, it was confirmed for 356 arpents; and at the same tirne^ acting on Brazeau\u2019s concession of -1794, the board confirmed to .him his 4 by 4 arpents, adjoining Labeaume\u2019s tract on the south.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">The board ordered that Labeaume\u2019s concession should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>surveyed, in conformity to the order of survey made by the Lieutenant Governor; and that Brazeau\u2019s tract of sixteen arpents \u201cshould be surveyed, agreeably to a reserve made in a sale from Joseph Brazeau to -Louis Labeaume.\u201d This survey was to be made conformably to the reservation in the deed, and that.reservation was at the foot of the mound.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Patents were ordered to be issued to the parties respectively ; but, owing to litigation beforeJ;he department of public lands and in the courts of justice, between the.parties claiming the reservation, and the proper mode of surveying the tract,, was not settled till 1852, when the surveys were approved, and patents issued to each of the parties', locating the southern boundary of Brazeau\u2019s claim at the' foot of the mound, and the opposite line, adjoining the southern boundary of Labeaume, four arpents further north, at au old ditch. Brazeau\u2019s representatives refused to accept the patent for the sixteen arpents, and caused it tobe recalled at the General Land Office. His claim, therefore, stands before the court as it existed. in 1810, when the board of commissioners confirmed it as valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u2022 The assignees of Brazeau brought an action of ejectment, to recover possession of 4 by 4 arpents above Labeaume\u2019s southern line, and within his survey; but'this court held, that the power to survey and fix definite boundaries, and issue a patent for Brazeau\u2019s tract, was a sovereign power, reserved to the executive branch of the Government, and that a court of justice had no jurisdiction to locate the claim. <em>West </em>vs. <em>Cochran, </em>(17 How.)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The unsuccessful party then filed his bill in a State Circuit. Court, and insists that equity can do what was declared could not be done at'law, on the assumption that the court only decided in the former case that Brazeau\u2019s incipient but equitable title would not sustain an action of ejectment.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">In the year 1817, \u201cby authority of the United States and' under the direction of the Surveyor General for t\u00edre district of Illinois and Missouri,\u201d the tract of land confirmed to Brazeau was surveyed by Joseph C. Brown, a deputy surveyor, conjointly wifh Labeaume\u2019s enlarged tract. The surveyor certifies that he had \u201c surveyed for Louis Labeaume . two tracts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>one: the one confirmed in his own name for 356 arpents; the other, under Joseph Brazeau, for four arpents;\u201d together, 360 arpents \u2014 equal to 306| acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The courses and distances of the lines are given. At one of the corners the call is for a stone at the . mouth of an old ditch, the lower corner of the survey on the river. The next line runs westwardly with the ditch. This survey was returned to the Surveyor General\u2019s office, and duly approved shortly after it was made. It purported to include Brazeau\u2019s tract of sixteen arpents, and, of course, it was located in the southeast corner .of the survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">When this survey was presented to the recorder of land titles to obtain \u00e1 patent certificate, he refused to issue one, because both tracts were included in one survey; whereas, the recorder held that the confirmation certificates required separate surveys. Thus the matter stood till 1833, when Brown made another survey of Labeaume\u2019s tract, maintaining the ditch as tbe southern boundary, and throwing off on the west a surplus to reduce the tract to the quantity confirmed to Labeaume.</p>\n<p id=\"Aeg\">\"The representatives of Brazeau claimed to own the tract of four by four arpents north of the ditch, as indicated in Brown\u2019s survey of 1817, and a1 contest was carried on before the department of public lands as to the proper location of Brazeau\u2019s claim, according to his confirmation, for nearly twenty years. IFinally, the Secretary of the Interior ordered that the tracts should be surveyed separately \u2014 set the surveys of Brown of 1817 and 1833 aside \u2014 and' ordered that Brazeau\u2019s claim should be surveyed \"south of the ditch and next to the mound, and that Labeaume\u2019s tract should be located north of the ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The representatives;of Labe\u00e1ume hold the land in the southeasterly corner of Brown\u2019s survey, and this is the land the bill prays may be decreed to the complainant \u2014 first, on the assumption that the confirmation certificate locates it there; and, secondly,' that there' was no authority in the Secretary of the Interior Department to set the survey of 1817 aside-.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Labeaume\u2019s survey of 1833 was merely a reformation of the survey of 1817, excluding Brazeau\u2019s four by four arpents.</p>\n<p id=\"AXd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>In 18.47 the matter as regarded these surveys was reported by the Surveyor General to the General Land Office,'where it was held that Brazeau was entitled to his four arpents square in the southeasterly part of Soulpxd\u2019s Spanish survey of, 1799, which embraced both .Labeaume\u2019s and Brazeau\u2019s tracts. This decision was overruled by Secretary Steuart in 1851, under whose order a survey was made for Brazeau outside of Labeaume\u2019s survey, as made by Brown. \u2022 .</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">This decision we are called on, in effect, to overthrow,' by holding that Brazeau\u2019s \u25a0 land is- covered by the patent to Labeaume, and the legal title vested in his representatives. And it is insisted that if it is, then a court of* equity may decree that it shall be conveyed by the legal owner to him having the better equity. And this-raises the question wheth\u00e9r the Secretary was authoi\u2019ized by law to reject the survey of 1817, order another, and overthrow Brazeau\u2019s claim of title. That the General Land Office has, from its first establishment iu 1812, exercised control over surveys generally, is not open to discussion at this day.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">By the act of March 3, 1807, the board of commissioners was required to deliver-to each party whose claim was confirmed a certificate \u25a0 that he was entitled to a patent for the tract of land designated. This certificate was to be presented to the Surveyor General, who proceeded to have the survey made and returned, with the certificate, to .the recorder of land titles, whose duty it was to issue a patent certificate; which, being transmitted to the Secretary of the Treasury, entitled the party to a patent. Act of 1807, S. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">This duty of the Secretary of the Treasury, by the act of 1812, is transferred to the Commissioner of the General Land Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The act of April 18, 1814, S. 1, requires that accurate surveys shall be made, according to the description in the certificate of confirmation, and proper returns shall be made to the Commissioner of the certificate and survey, and all such other evidence as may be'required by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">These acts show that the surveys and .proceedings must be, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>in regard to their correctness, within the jurisdiction of the Commissioner; and such has been the practice. Of necessity, he must have power to adjudge the question of accuracy preliminary to the issue of a patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">By the act of July 4, 1836, reorganizing the General Land Office, plenary powers are conferred on the Commissioner to supervise all surveys of public lands, \u201c and also such as relate to private claims of land and the issuing of patents.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">By the act of March 3, 1849, the Interior Department was established. The 3d section of the act vests the Secretary, in matters relating to the General Land Office, including the powers of supervision and appeal, with the same powers that were formerly discharged by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The jurisdiction to revise on the appeal was necessarily coextensive with the powers to adjucjge by the Commissioner. \"We are, therefore, of the opinion that the Secretary had authority to set aside Brown\u2019s survey of Labeaume\u2019s tract, order another to be made, and to issue a patent to Labeaume, throwing off Brazeau\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">A preliminary motion was made to dismiss this cause for want of jurisdiction, which was brought on with the final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The survey made by Brown in 1817 for Labeaume included both the tracts confirmed'to Labeaume and Brazeau. This survey was duly approved, and so continued for fifteen years. A patent might have been issued on it, either singly to Labeaume or jointly to the two owners, Brazeau\u2019s sixteen arpents being granted to him in the southeast corner of the survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">Standing on the original concession, Brazeau\u2019s tract had no specific boundary, and attached to no land; but Brown\u2019s survey identified its locality and boundary, and vested a title to land, subject to be sued for and recovered by the local laws of Missouri, and the bill was filed to assert this title, on the ground that the Secretary of the Interior Department had no authority to set the survey aside, divest Brazeau\u2019s title, and locate the land elsewhere.- The construction- of the acts of Congress, conferring power on the Secretary to do the acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>complained of, were-prominently drawn in question, and the decision below rejected the title set up by maintaining the .validity of the Secretary?s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The case falls within the principle declared in Lytle\u2019s case, 22 How., 202. The finding of the State court, and the decree founded on that finding, show that the, question necessary to give this court jurisdiction was raised and decided. <em>Craig </em>vs. Missouri, (4 Peters, 425-6.)</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b205-6\">Mr. Chief Justice TANEY.</author>\n<p id=\"Aj7\">I think the court has not jurisdiction in this case. The only point in dispute appears to be upon the true location of the land reserved by Br\u00e1zeau in' his. deed to Labeaume. And that question\" depends altogether upon the description of it in the. deed, and not upon the survey made by the Surveyor General of the United States, nor upon the judgment or decision of the Land Office. It is a judicial question, belonging exclusively to a' court and jury of the State, and not embraced in any one of the provisions of the 25th section of the judiciary act of 1789, in which appellate power over a judgment of a State court is conferred upon this court. But as a majority of the court are of a contrary opinion, and have taken jurisdiction, I concur in affirming the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b205-7\">Mr. Justice GRIER.</author>\n<p id=\"AK7\">I concur with the Chief Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\n<em>Decree of the Supreme Court of Missouri affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
