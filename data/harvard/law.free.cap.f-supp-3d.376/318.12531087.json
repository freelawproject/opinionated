Before the Court is Defendant's Motion To Dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Not. of Mot. (Dkt. No. 17).). For the following reasons, Defendant's Motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts recounted below are taken from Plaintiff's Complaint and are assumed to be true for purposes of resolving the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant is a municipal corporation incorporated in the State of New York. (Compl. \u00b6 12.) Plaintiff has been employed as a law enforcement officer for the Village since August 1989 and has permanent competitive civil service status in that position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) In October 2001, Plaintiff was promoted to the title of Detective and received an increase in pay over the pay he received as a police officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Since approximately 1994, Plaintiff has served as President of the Police Benevolent Association (\"PBA\") of Wappingers Falls, the exclusive bargaining agent for a unit consisting of all full-time and part-time police officers in the Village, with the exception of the Chief of Police and the Village Police Commissioner, Carl Calabrese (\"Calabrese\"), who works part-time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) The PBA and the Village are parties to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\") for the period January 1, 2006 through December 1, 2013, as modified by a Memorandum of Agreement (\"MOA\") covering the period January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In his role as Union President, Plaintiff has actively advocated with the Village on behalf of the PBA and its members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Plaintiff alleges that Village officials, including Calabrese, \"have frequently exhibited, in word and in deed, antipathy to that advocacy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) For example, on April 28, 2014, Plaintiff, along with PBA Vice President Scott McHugh (\"McHugh\"), who was also a Detective, advocated on behalf of the PBA to the Village Police Committee that Calabrese was causing scheduling problems within the Village Police Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) There was at that time a long-standing practice within the department that Detectives prepared their work schedules. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Plaintiff alleges that in retaliation for the foregoing advocacy, on April 29, 2014, the very next day, Calabrese issued an order prohibiting Plaintiff, McHugh, and two other detectives, from preparing their work schedules. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In May 2014, Calabrese told one or more PBA members that he would bankrupt the PBA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) At some point in the Fall of 2014, Plaintiff, McHugh and another part-time police officer met with Calabrese to advocate for the PBA by setting forth demands for CBA negotiations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Shortly thereafter, Calabrese stated to the others who attended that meeting that he was going to \"get Novick.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In June 2015, Plaintiff was diagnosed with bladder cancer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) He advised Calabrese, as well as Police Sergeant Burke (\"Burke\") and Police Lieutenant Birdsell (\"Birdsell\") of that diagnosis in July 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) In or about July 2015, Plaintiff advised Calabrese that he was going to go through a series of treatments and that it would last six weeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) In the Summer of 2015, Plaintiff explained to Calabrese, Burke, and Birdsell how the treatment known as \"BCG\" worked, specifically that the treatment was administered by being injected directly into the bladder, and that he did not know how he\n   was going to feel after the treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In or about July 2015, Plaintiff took time off from work for his cancer treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) During the course of his first round of treatment, Plaintiff explained to Calabrese the effects of the treatment, including that he was very uncomfortable, and that he experienced urgency to go to the bathroom without real warning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) In addition, in July 2015, Plaintiff advised Village Mayor Matt Alexander that he had bladder cancer and that the medical plan was to have six weeks of treatment and three years of periodic treatments or \"preventive maintenance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff learned in October 2015 that the first round of treatment was not effective and he advised Calabrese and Burke that he would be going to Sloan Kettering in New York City for a second opinion. (Compl. \u00b6 30.) Plaintiff was required to undergo a second round of treatment commencing in November 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) He informed Calabrese, Birdsell, and Burke of the second round of treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During the second course of treatment, Plaintiff was out of work for a number of days and presented a note to his superiors on December 16, 2015 to the effect that he was required to be out of work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) In January 2016, Plaintiff returned to work but continued to suffer the side effects of treatment, including urgency and frequency of urination and fatigue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During the period described above, Plaintiff was assigned to the Detective Bureau, and notwithstanding the side effects of treatment, he was able to manage his caseload as a Detective without restrictions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) Plaintiff alleges that during this time, his supervisors were aware of the side effects he suffered as a result of the cancer treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In February 2016, in his role as PBA President, Plaintiff engaged in CBA negotiations with Calabrese who demanded that the new CBA contain language whereby new hires would be required to commit to remaining employed with the Village for five years before seeking new employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) Plaintiff advocated against the insertion of such language because he believed that it was in the interest of the PBA members to be able to better themselves by seeking other employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In March 2016, Police Commissioner Calabrese intentionally falsely told one of the Village's full-time police officers that the PBA did not want the Village to employ full-time police officers, that the PBA does not represent that officers' interests, that he should not trust the PBA or its leadership, and that he should look out for himself because the PBA would not do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During the period between March 30 and April 13, 2016, Plaintiff underwent three weeks of additional cancer treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) As a result of those treatments, Plaintiff again suffered side effects of urgency of urination, irritability, and fatigue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Plaintiff's supervisors, including Calabrese, Birdsell, and Burke were aware that Plaintiff was suffering those side effects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) During this period, Plaintiff was assigned to the Detective Bureau and had easy access to bathroom facilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 27, 2016, all three Detectives in the Detective Bureau, including Plaintiff and McHugh, were notified that as of June 1, 2016, they would be reassigned from the Detective Bureau to patrol and that all Detective functions and work they had exclusively performed and which had been exclusively performed by part-time police officers in the PBA's unit, would be transferred\n   and performed by the Dutchess County Sheriff's Office and/or New York State Police, except that the Village detectives would assist the State Police in homicide investigations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) On June 1, 2016, all three Detectives in the Detective Bureau, including Plaintiff, were reassigned to uniform patrol. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While assigned to the Detective Bureau, Plaintiff had not been required to wear a uniform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) Also, while assigned to the Detective Bureau, Plaintiff and the Detectives planned their own schedules, put in their schedules weekly, and were able to change their schedules and manage their schedules around their caseloads. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) On patrol, Plaintiff and the other Detectives reassigned to patrol were required to put in their schedules monthly and were required to work an eight-hour tour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Upon inquiry as to the reasons for this reassignment, Plaintiff was advised that the reasons were budgetary. (Compl. \u00b6 46.) Plaintiff alleges that the Village budget was not in fact reduced by reason of the reassignment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On July 8, 2016, while Plaintiff continued to serve as President of the PBA, the PBA filed an Improper Practice Charge against the Village of Wappingers Falls with New York State Public Employment Relations Board, alleging numerous violations of law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff was scheduled to work on Monday, July 25, 2016 and Thursday, July 28, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) On July 24, 2016, Plaintiff called Police Headquarters and on a recorded call stated \"I'm not coming in this week because [of] my treatment. I told the Lieutenant that I was going to try to at least do my Monday shift, but I got to go for my treatment again this week.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) He further stated, \"[a]nd with my treatment I got to just stay close to the house ... I tried but I just can't make it.\" \"I don't want to be put in a bad position.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The dispatcher on duty responded, \"All right, Marty, you got it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) On July 24, 2016, per departmental procedure and practice, Plaintiff also called the on-call Lieutenant Birdsell at 6:02 p.m., but Birdsell did not answer the call or call back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) At 6:03 p.m. on July 24, 2016, Plaintiff again called Birdsell who did not answer the phone or call back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) However, Plaintiff left a recorded message and stated, \"I just wanted to call you up and let you know I won't be able to make it tomorrow (July 25, 2016) either. I'm still hurting over this. I'm going to keep trying to call you. I did let the desk know that I wouldn't [be] able to be in. But I'll keep trying to call you. Bye.\" (Compl. \u00b6 55.) At 7:25 p.m. on July 24, 2016, Plaintiff again called Birdsell who again did not answer the phone or call back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) After following departmental procedure by calling the on-call supervisor three times without reaching him, Plaintiff called his immediate supervisor, Police Sergeant Burke and informed him he would not be reporting for work for the upcoming week, specifically the midnight shifts of Monday,\n   July 25 and Thursday, July 28, to which Burke responded in substance that he \"would take [care] of it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) Burke was aware that Plaintiff received treatment on Wednesdays, and that he was unable to work Thursdays as a result. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff thus did not report to work on July 25 or July 28, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) Calabrese subsequently directed Plaintiff to provide a written explanation of his absence on July 28, 2016, claiming that his absence was \"unauthorized.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) Plaintiff complied with Calabrese's directive and provided a written explanation on July 30, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) In that explanation, Plaintiff stated that he was required to periodically undergo treatment for bladder cancer, that he began treatment two weeks prior, and that it had caused him discomfort.\n   <em>\n    (Id.)\n   </em>\n   He advised that he had explained the treatment to Birdsell who stated it was not a problem. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.) He advised Calabrese that he would be unable to work during the week following treatment and would provide a note when he returned.\n   <em>\n    (Id.)\n   </em>\n   On August 1, 2016, Calabrese claimed that he was unaware that Plaintiff was having maintenance treatment for cancer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On August 10, 2016, Plaintiff and his counsel met with Calabrese and others regarding Calabrese's purported investigation of Plaintiff's July 28, 2016 allegedly unauthorized absence and to mediate a resolution of his absence before filing \"potential charges.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Plaintiff provided Calabrese a doctor's note dated August 10, 2016 stating that Plaintiff required an accommodation at work in that he required frequent bathroom breaks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   By letter dated September 6, 2016, Calabrese served and filed a Notice of Discipline against Plaintiff alleging misconduct based upon the allegedly unauthorized absence of July 28, 2016 and allegedly insubordinate statements made by Plaintiff during the August 10, 2016 meeting. (Compl. \u00b6 66.) Hearings on the Notice of Discipline began on October 10, 2016 and continued over nine sessions, the last of which was held on January 10, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On September 6, 2016, Plaintiff filed a Complaint of discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment on the basis of disability with the New York State Division of Human Rights against the Village and the Village Police Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 67.) At that time, Plaintiff also filed a complaint alleging violations of the ADA with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On October 25, 2016, in response to the August 10, 2016, request for an accommodation, the Village's counsel advised Plaintiff that inasmuch as the Village is of \"significantly limited size,\" Plaintiff could take as many bathroom breaks as he wanted\" while working patrol. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) Plaintiff and/or his representatives informed the Village that this was an insufficient accommodation because if Plaintiff were on the road or involved in an in investigation, he might be unable to get to a bathroom in sufficient time to meet his needs, and that the accommodation requested was to work inside at headquarters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.) The requested accommodation was repeatedly denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On March 9, 2017, the New York State Division of Human Rights found that probable cause existed that Defendants engaged in or are engaging in the unlawfully discriminatory practice alleged by Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On May 19, 2017, the Hearing Officer designated to hear evidence on the September 6, 2016 disciplinary charges found Plaintiff responsible on each of the three\n   charges put forth by the Village attorney, and recommended the penalty of demotion. (Compl. \u00b6 72.) Plaintiff was instructed to report to Police headquarters to receive a new identification card and badge reflecting this demotion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) To date, as a result of the Village's failure to accommodate Plaintiff's request to work in headquarters as he had previously done when he was a Detective, he has been unable to return to work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On July 28, 2017, the EEOC issued Plaintiff a Notice of Right to Sue on his claims of discrimination on the basis of disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that other officers, including a Lieutenant of the Wappingers Falls Police Department, have been absent from work without authorization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) Those other officers were not Union officers and did not engage in advocacy on behalf of Union members, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75), and did not have a disability as defined by federal or state law, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76). Plaintiff alleges that no such other officer was ever served with a Notice of Discipline, brought up on charges, or demoted as a result of being absent without authorized leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff alleges he is and was able to perform the essential functions of his previously assigned position of Police Detective and his current assignment to patrol, with or without an accommodation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff filed his Complaint on October 16, 2017. (Compl. (Dkt. No. 1).) On November 28, 2017, the Court granted Defendant an extension to answer or otherwise respond to the Complaint. (Dkt. No. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On December 15, 2017, counsel for Defendant submitted a pre-motion letter to the Court requesting permission to file a Motion To Dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Howard Miller, Esq., to Court (Dkt. No. 9).) On December 18, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiff's request for an extension to reply to Defendant's letter. (Dkt. No. 11.) On January 8, 2018, counsel for Plaintiff submitted a letter opposing Defendant's request for a pre-motion conference. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Jane Gould, Esq., to Court (Dkt. No. 12).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On February 15, 2018, the Court held a pre-motion conference, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. (minute entry for Feb. 15, 2018)), and set a briefing schedule, (Dkt. No. 14). On March 27, 2018, the Court granted Defendant an extension to submit its Motion to Dismiss. (Dkt. No. 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On April 5, 2018, Defendant filed the instant Motion To Dismiss and accompanying papers. (Not. of Mot.; Aff. of Howard Miller, Esq. (\"Miller Aff.\") (Dkt. No. 18); Def.'s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. To Dismiss (\"Def.'s Mem.\") (Dkt. No. 19).) On May 7, 2018, Plaintiff filed his Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. of Law in Opp'n to Mot. To Dismiss (\"Pl.'s Mem.\") (Dkt. No. 21).) Defendant filed its Reply in Further Support of their Motion To Dismiss on May 18, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. of Law in Further Supp. of Mot.

Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).

(Compl. \u00b6 17.) Second, at some point in the Fall of 2014, Plaintiff, McHugh, and another part-time police officer met with Calabrese to advocate for the PBA by setting forth demands for CBA negotiations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Third, in February 2016, in his role as PBA President, Plaintiff engaged in CBA negotiations with Calabrese to oppose proposed contract language requiring a five-year commitment to the Police Department by new hires. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.) Plaintiff advocated against this provision because he believed that it was in the interest of PBA members to be able to better themselves by seeking other employment.
