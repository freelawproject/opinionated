She suffers from severe respiratory issues, which purportedly caused her to miss twenty days of school her freshman year and an additional twenty the semester after (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at p. 1; Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 3 at p. 1). Most if not all of these absences were supported by a note written by her mother, her doctor, or both (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at p. 1; Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 3 at p. 2). Instead of offering Plaintiff services for students with disabilities or conducting an assessment to determine whether those services were appropriate, Defendants referred Plaintiff's mother (\"Mrs. Boggs\") to truancy court (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mrs. Boggs reached out to Principal Jeremy Harpole (\"Principal Harpole\") the day after receiving a summons to the Truancy Court hearing (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at p. 2). She expressed her intent to appeal the referral to truancy court since Plaintiff's absences were due to her health, and requested the contact information for the School's Attendance Committee and the Superintendent (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at p. 2). Principal Harpole \"curtly\" responded that, if Mrs. Boggs did not plead \"guilty,\" the matter would be for a grand jury to decide-without giving Mrs. Boggs the information requested (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at pp. 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the hearing held the following day, Principal Harpole told the Truancy Court he would work with Mrs. Boggs to help Plaintiff secure all necessary course credits (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at p. 3). But when Mrs. Boggs followed up on that offer, she and Plaintiff found Principal Harpole unhelpful. Although there were other ways for Plaintiff to make up her course credits (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 51, Exhibit 6 at pp. 12-14; Dkt. # 51, Exhibit 7 at pp. 15-16), Principal Harpole recommended that Plaintiff take online courses at Texas Tech that she could not afford (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at p. 3; Dkt. # 51, Exhibit 6 at p. 14). He also recommended that Plaintiff start taking classes on Friday nights and on Saturdays (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at p. 4)-even though the Saturday classes would not start for\n   another two months (Dkt. # 51, Exhibit 6 at p. 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff contends that Principal Harpole started retaliating against her due to her mother's advocacy. Plaintiff reports that Principal Harpole called her and her mother \"liars\" in earshot of other students, followed her from class to class, and gave her intimidating looks (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at p. 4; Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 3 at pp. 2-3). Principal Harpole also reportedly questioned whether Plaintiff could make up the credits in question to another faculty member, who relayed that message to Plaintiff (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at p. 5; Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 3 at p. 3). Mrs. Boggs raised concerns about Principal Harpole's conduct to the Superintendent on multiple occasions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at pp. 4, 5, 7). The Superintendent responded to one complaint (about the Principal calling Plaintiff a \"liar\") by promising that School District staff would not retaliate against Plaintiff but ignored her complaints otherwise (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at pp. 4, 5, 7). Mrs. Boggs also used the School District website to file a bullying complaint against Principal Harpole four days later but did not receive a response (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at p. 5). According to Mrs. Boggs, these failures to respond violate School District Policy (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at pp. 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   These events made Plaintiff anxious, depressed, and scared to attend school, prompting Plaintiff to attempt to take her life by overdosing on antidepressants (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at pp. 5-6; Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 3 at p. 3). Plaintiff subsequently elected to transfer to a high school with an intensive outpatient program (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at p. 6). Mrs. Boggs told Principal Harpole of the attempted suicide and upcoming transfer. She also asked him to grant Plaintiff credits Plaintiff believed she had earned, her absences notwithstanding (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at p. 6). Principal Harpole responded that he would grant the credits \"with the understanding that [Plaintiff] would not be coming back to the district\" (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at p. 6). But he would not live up to that promise, sending Plaintiff's new high school her school records without the credits in question (Dkt. # 47, Exhibit 2 at p. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently accused the School District of violating her rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\") by engaging in the above-referenced conduct, and filed a Due Process Petition against the School District with the Texas Education Agency (the \"Agency\") (Dkt. # 21 at pp. 5-22)-as parties are required to do when bringing a claim under that statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f), 1415(l). Before the action was resolved on the merits, Plaintiff and the School District stipulated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [T]here are no issues related to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) or concerns that the student did or did not receive a Free Appropriate Public Education.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Dkt. # 21 at p. 70). Plaintiff then moved to dismiss the matter (Dkt. # 21 at p. 67) and, after the dismissal, filed this suit based on substantially similar allegations (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 15). This lawsuit, however, does not accuse the School District of violating the IDEA. It, instead, brings claims against the School District for violations of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the \"RA\") and the Americans with Disabilities Act (the \"ADA\"). It also brings claims against both Defendants under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The School District now moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff's RA and ADA claims, arguing that Plaintiff should have exhausted her administrative remedies before the IDEA State Agency-its prior representation that the claims did not implicate issues related to the IDEA apparently notwithstanding. Defendants also\n   seeks summary judgment on Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claims based on a failure to raise genuine issues of material fact and qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The purpose of summary judgment is to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims or defenses.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

But the School District is judicially estopped from raising this argument. Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine meant \"to prevent a party from asserting a position in a legal proceeding that is inconsistent with a position taken in a previous proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Love v. Tyson Foods, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871440,5732196\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/258/\">\n    677 F.3d 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 261 (5th Cir. 2012). Although the doctrine \"is not governed by 'inflexible prerequisites or an exhaustive formula for determining [its] applicability,\" courts generally consider whether \"(1) the party against whom judicial estoppel is sought has asserted a legal position which is plainly inconsistent with a prior position; (2) a court accepted the prior position; and (3) the party did not act inadvertently.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871440,5732196\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/258/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Judicial estoppel should bar the School District from securing a dismissal based on any failure to exhaust administrative remedies here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the School District now faults Plaintiff for not obtaining a final decision on the merits while this dispute was before a State Educational Agency, it made the opposite argument to the State Agency that previously heard these claims. The School District stipulated that Plaintiff's allegations did not raise \"issues related to the\n   <em>\n    Individuals\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    With Disabilities Education Act\n   </em>\n   (IDEA) or concerns that the student did or did not receive a Free Appropriate Public Education\" (Dkt. # 21 at p. 70). The Hearing Officer subsequently dismissed the action on this basis (Dkt. # 21 at p. 70-74). Allowing the School District to now fault Plaintiff for not obtaining a resolution on the merits before the State Agency would be manifestly unjust-to the integrity of the judicial process and to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The School District dismisses the Stipulation as \"Plaintiff's attempt at sleight of hand to try and circumvent exhaustion requirements\" (Dkt. # 41 at pp.13-14)-Plaintiff's prior attempt to adjudicate these issues before an IDEA State Agency apparently notwithstanding. More specifically, the School District states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Agreeing that there is no IDEA or FAPE issues is like ordering Chilean Sea Bass. The menu calls it Chilean Sea Bass and jacks up the price, but you are still eating a Patagonian toothfish. Just because you agree to call Plaintiff's fishy claims something else, doesn't mean the claims could not have been brought under IDEA; they clearly could have been (and they were). Thus, the question here is whether [the School District] (and the Court) would be estopped from looking at the Plaintiff's fishy facts, due to the written [stipulation], and finding that regardless of the written [stipulation], Plaintiff was required to exhaust her administrative remedies. To paraphrase the classic song from Casablanca, \"You must remember this, a fish is still a fish.\" Herman Hupfield, As Time Goes By, in Casablanca (1931) (as performed by Dooley Wilson, \"You must remember this, a kiss is just a kiss ...\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Dkt. # 41 at pp. 13-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although it is not entirely clear, the School District appears to argue that the Stipulation reflects the Parties' shared belief that Plaintiff lacked a valid IDEA claim-not that Plaintiff's allegations did not raise issues under the IDEA. The School District will not be let off the hook that easily. Again, the Stipulation states that there are no \"concerns that the student\n   <em>\n    did or did not\n   </em>\n   receive a Free Appropriate Public Education\"-not that the claims raised IDEA claims were invalid (Dkt. # 21 at p. 70) (emphasis added). The only reasonable way to interpret this language is that Plaintiff's allegations do not raise IDEA issues that the State Agency need to decide one way or the other, making any exhaustion requirement under the IDEA moot. This interpretation is especially reasonable since the School District drafted the Stipulation. This means that, to the extent the Stipulation is ambiguous, it should be interpreted in Plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v. Mission Am. Ins.

The Court need not rule on this argument since the Court denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the RA/ADA claims based on evidence outside of the affidavits and finds that Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claims are insufficiently supported-even assuming the truth of the affidavits.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    In their briefs, Defendants levy attacks on Plaintiff's character that seem to have no or little relevance to the issues to be decided on this motion. This includes a suggestion that Plaintiff is a liar because her Complaint lists an old address rather than her current one-as well as several references to Plaintiff's personal life, including her dating history, alcohol use, a shoplifting incident, and her mother's issuance of a bad check. The Court does not consider irrelevant character evidence when deciding the merits of the motion and reminds Defense counsel of his duty to act professionally in all court matters.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Local Rule AT-3(k) (\"Effective advocacy does not require antagonistic or obnoxious behavior, and members of the bar will adhere to the higher standard of conduct which judges, lawyers, clients, and the public may rightfully expect.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The Court does not address Plaintiff's futility arguments since the motion for summary judgment as to these claims fails on other grounds.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Although no party has argued otherwise, the Court notes that there are no concerns about whether subject matter jurisdiction exists over an IDEA claim that has not been exhausted.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wright v.
