Plaintiff has responded, [DE # 87]. Plaintiff has also filed a motion to exclude expert witness, [DE # 86], to which defendants have responded, [DE # 88]. Plaintiff additionally filed a response to defendants' Statement of Material Facts, [DE # 89], to which defendants responded with a motion to strike, [DE # 90].

By order filed March 26, 2018, this court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss, leaving the following claims by plaintiff for adjudication by the court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1) Section 1983 Claim for violation of the Fourth Amendment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2) Section 1983 Claim for violation of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause for Deprivation of Liberty Interest;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3) Section 1983 Claim for violation of the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   4) North Carolina Invasion of Privacy Claim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   5) North Carolina Negligent Training and Supervision Claim Against Defendant Hardy, in her individual and official capacities; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   6) Wrongful Discharge\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants now move for summary judgment as to all claims. [DE # 64 at 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF THE FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff, an African-American male, began working for defendant Brunswick County, North Carolina (\"the County\") in the Operation Services Department (\"OSD\") as an Equipment Operator II in 1988. [DE # 1 \u00b6 29]. A Commercial Driver's License (\"CDL\") was a requirement of the position of Equipment Operator II, and plaintiff held such a license.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [DE # 68 at 22, 32]. In 1992, Plaintiff was convicted of Driving While Impaired (\"DWI\"). He lost his CDL license for a year and was terminated by the County.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20, 23. After working for several private companies, plaintiff was rehired by the County in 2000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 10, 2011, plaintiff was charged with a second DWI, but was ultimately not convicted. As a result of the charge, he lost his CDL license, at least temporarily. The County chose not to terminate plaintiff, but rather demoted him to a position that did not require a CDL license, namely a Maintenance Assistant I which involved a salary cut of $ 3,500.00. [DE # 1 \u00b6 40]. Plaintiff additionally was referred to the County's employee assistance program and agreed to periodic drug and alcohol testing for the next 12 months. [DE # 68 at 35].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After reinstatement of his CDL license, plaintiff applied for an open Equipment Operator II position [DE # 68 at 38]. After interviewing with defendant Bryan Hollis, plaintiff was re-hired as an Equipment Operator II in approximately 2012. [DE # 68 at 38-39]. During his employment with the County, plaintiff's supervisors consistently rated his job performance as \"meets or exceeds standards.\" [DE # 1 at \u00b6 15]. In fact, plaintiff received a 2% merit-based pay raise approximately two weeks before his termination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 21, 2014, plaintiff was tested for drug use. Plaintiff admitted in his deposition that as a CDL holder in 2014 he was subject to random drug testing by the County. [DE # 68 at 39-43]. After plaintiff's sample tested positive for a controlled substance, plaintiff was given the option to resign rather than be terminated for cause. Plaintiff chose to resign on August 15, 2014. [DE # 68 at 72, 80].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Following plaintiff's resignation in lieu of termination, plaintiff applied for the position of Equipment Operator II with the County, a position requiring a CDL, and was denied at least four separate times. Plaintiff alleges defendants Hollis and Lewis, with defendant Hardy's approval, selected all white males to fill all four of the open Equipment Operator II positions, who were objectively less qualified than plaintiff. [DE # 1 \u00b6\u00b6 32, 35, and 39].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On October 9, 2014, plaintiff met with Defendant Hardy, the County Manager, to discuss his not being rehired and their alleged discriminatory employment practices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. However, plaintiff claims he was qualified to be rehired and that Defendant Hardy failed to investigate or take any corrective measures in response to plaintiff's raising his concerns to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     COURT'S DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Expert Testimony, [DE # 86]\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff has moved to strike expert testimony of proposed expert Reginald R. Hines. It is unclear whether plaintiff seeks to strike the entire report or simply limit the testimony of the expert. However, as the court did not rely on any legal conclusions within the expert report in reaching its conclusion on the motion for summary judgment, the motion to strike is DENIED AS MOOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Defendants' Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Response to Statement of Material Facts, [DE # 90]\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants have moved to strike plaintiff's response to defendants' statement of material facts, arguing plaintiff responded outside the permissible time frame and without requesting permission. [DE # 90]. While plaintiff technically responded outside the permissible window, the court notes plaintiff did file a motion for extension of time on October 12, 2018, to \"serve and file a response to defendants' motion [for summary judgment].\" [DE # 85]. This extension request was granted due to two major storms that impacted eastern North Carolina in September and October 2018, on the basis of \"excusable neglect\" pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b) (1) (B). [DE # 94]. Plaintiff's response, [DE # 87], filed October 12, 2018, was deemed timely. Plaintiff's response to the statement of material facts [DE # 89] was filed just three days later on October 15, 2018. As a response to statement of material facts is expected to be filed with the response to the motion for summary judgment, the court construes this document to be implicitly included in plaintiff's October 12, 2018 extension request. Thus, plaintiff's response to the statement of material facts, [DE # 89], is deemed timely and defendants' motion to strike, [DE # 90], is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Therefore, violations of CSERA cannot serve as a basis for plaintiff's wrongful termination claim. Further, the court has already found plaintiff has not shown racial discrimination in his testing, termination, or failure to be rehired. Therefore, plaintiff has not shown a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of North Carolina public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Therefore, finding that plaintiff has failed to set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial on these claims as required by Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, defendants' motion for summary judgment as to plaintiff's North Carolina claims is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, [DE # 64], is GRANTED. Plaintiff's motion to exclude expert testimony of Reginald R. Hines, [DE # 86], is DENIED AS MOOT. Defendants' motion to strike plaintiff's response to the statement of materials facts at DE # 89, [DE # 90], is DENIED. The clerk is directed to close this case.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    As noted in this court's order on the motion to dismiss, the court notes plaintiff's claim of wrongful discharge is far from a model of clarity, not being set out as a separate section of the complaint but rather seemingly interspersed through various paragraphs. The court has broadly construed the complaint as a whole in its analysis. Defendants move for summary judgment as to plaintiff's wrongful discharge claim as well, referring to it as \"latent.\" [DE # 66 at 1].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Plaintiff first obtained his CDL in 1988.
