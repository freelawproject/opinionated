(First Amended Complaint (\"Am. Compl.\") (Doc. 20) \u00b6 13.) According to the Complaint, at some point in time, Plaintiff was raped and sexually assaulted by Bishop.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Plaintiff reported the rape and then confronted Bishop, who became angry and threatened Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Bishop was, at the time, in a relationship with Broderick, Duke's Coordinator of Gender Violence Intervention Services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16-17.) Bishop allegedly continued to harass Plaintiff and threatened that Broderick, as his girlfriend, would use her position to undermine Plaintiff's credibility and destroy Plaintiff's reputation if Plaintiff continued to pursue complaints about the alleged assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-19.) When Plaintiff attempted to report the assault through Duke, she was referred to Broderick and wrote Broderick to request counselling and other support services, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22), which Broderick failed to provide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges further that, over an unspecified time period, Bishop and Broderick engaged in a campaign to impugn Plaintiff's reputation by (1) making false stalking reports to the Duke Police Department, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31), (2) disclosing Plaintiff's confidential sexual assault report widely within the university, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32),\n   (3) causing a Duke University Police officer to make false statements regarding Plaintiff at a custody hearing involving Bishop, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-37), and (4) compiling and disseminating negative information about Plaintiff to destroy her reputation both at Duke and within the medical community at large, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43, 48-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that other Duke officials and administrators were involved, to varying degrees, in the scheme perpetrated by Bishop and Broderick. First, Broderick's immediate supervisor refused to provide any counselling or other services when Plaintiff followed up on her letter to Broderick and instead directed Plaintiff to seek help outside the university. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Second, Broderick's colleague in the Student Affairs Division allegedly \"interrogated\" Plaintiff about her complaint and relationship with Bishop. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Third, another Student Affairs administrative allegedly told Plaintiff that Duke would not treat Plaintiff's letter to Broderick as confidential and that Duke was not investigating the alleged rape. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.) Finally, when one of Broderick's colleagues reported Broderick's behavior to \"supervisors\" and \"managing employees\" of the university, these supervisors \"took no meaningful action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff filed her initial complaint in the Durham County Superior Court, (Doc. 4), and the case was then removed by Duke to this court. (Doc. 1.) Plaintiff filed an amended complaint (Am. Compl. (Doc. 20).) Each Defendant moved to dismiss the First Amended Complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and filed a brief in support of that motion: Duke, (Docs. 29, 30), Broderick, (Docs. 26, 27), and Bishop, (Docs. 31, 32.) Plaintiff responded opposing each motion: Duke, (Doc. 37), Broderick, (Doc. 39), and Bishop, (Doc. 38). Each Defendant then replied: Duke, (Doc. 42), Broderick, (Doc. 43), and Bishop, (Doc. 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction and Governing Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This court has jurisdiction over Plaintiff's Title IX claim because it arises under federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Duke is not a state actor and Plaintiff does not plausibly allege that Duke intentionally discriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of sex or any other protected ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Regarding Title IX, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 99D-1 requires that the conspiracy be \"motivated by race, religion, ethnicity, or gender.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Radcliffe v.

As previously discussed, Plaintiff has not plausibly alleged that any agreement was motivated by her gender as opposed to a more obvious motivating factor; namely, Broderick's personal animus against Plaintiff. For that reason, it appears to this court that Plaintiff was not denied any right under Title IX. However, even assuming Plaintiff was denied such a right, this court finds that Title IX does not \"impact on\" a constitutional right within the meaning of \u00a7 99D-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Because almost any statute can potentially be said to impact on a constitutional provision in some tangential way, this court declines to give \"impacts on\" the broad meaning Plaintiff suggests. It defies logic to believe that the North Carolina legislature intended to create such a broad remedy, especially when many federal and state laws contain their own individualized enforcement provisions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5. It would be odd, to say the least, if the North Carolina legislature intended to permit plaintiffs to bypass federal statutory procedures and sue directly under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 99D-1 merely because Title IX arguably \"impacts on\" the constitutional guarantee of equal protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   This court believes that the most natural reading of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 99D-1 is that the statute is intended to cover explicit constitutional guarantees and statutes that, by their language, enforce or interpret such guarantees. The crucial question for Plaintiff's \u00a7 99D-1 claim is whether Title IX enforces substantive rights granted by the Equal Protection Clause or is merely related to the Equal Protection Clause. This question, in turn, can only be answered by determining the constitutional provision under which Congress passed Title IX; that is, whether Congress passed Title IX pursuant to \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to define and enforce substantive rights granted by the Equal Protection Clause, or pursuant to the Article I, Section 8 Spending Clause to address discrimination by private institutions that receive federal funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Courts have approached this question differently,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   finding alternatively that Title\n   IX has its origins in the Spending Clause or that Title IX guarantees substantive rights found in the Equal Protection Clause.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   , David S.

Therefore, Congress could not have constitutionally passed a law that applies to private entities, such as Title IX, pursuant to \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. This court is convinced that, while Title IX certainly deals with similar subject matter as the Equal Protection\n   Clause, it does not substantively alter or impact on the rights granted by this clause and is thus primarily a Spending Clause statute designed to reach a self-selecting universe of educational programs or activities that receive federal funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff must identify either a specific constitutional right that is interfered with by the alleged conspiracy or identify a federal or state law whose primary purpose is to interpret or enforce substantive rights granted by the constitution.

Plaintiff fails to show that Title IX \"enforces, interprets, or impacts on a constitutional right\" and fails to show that Defendants have interfered with any right granted by either Title IX or the Equal Protection Clause.

Many of these courts do not consider whether Congress\n    <em>\n     in fact\n    </em>\n    acted pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause or the Spending Clause, which is the critical question here to determine whether Title IX interprets or enforces pre-existing constitutional rights in order to interpret North Carolina law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    While the\n    <em>\n     Litman\n    </em>\n    court asserts that \"the substantive provisions of Title IX reach beyond the Fourteenth Amendment's prohibitions against gender discrimination\" by prohibiting disparate-impact discrimination,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541353\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/5/366/#p373\">\n     5 F.Supp.2d at 373-74\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , this court does not reach the same conclusion. The Equal Protection Clause itself protects only against state action motivated by a discriminatory purpose (which may be inferred from effect alone).\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     McCleskey\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214785\" index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/279/#p292\">\n     481 U.S. at 297-98\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214785\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/279/#p292\">\n     107 S.Ct. 1756\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Although there appears to be some debate regarding the exact scope of Title IX, the Supreme Court has held that the analogous Title VI creates no private right to recover based on disparate impact,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Alexander v.

Lower courts have generally interpreted these holdings to mean that \"a Title IX claim may not be premised on the 'disparate impact' a policy has with respect to a protected group.\"\n    <em>\n     Doe v. Brown Univ.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340822\" index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/166/177/#p184\">\n     166 F.Supp.3d 177\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 184 (D.R.I. 2016). Nevertheless, this court finds that the application of anti-discrimination laws to a self-selecting group of private institutions is strong proof that Title IX is a Spending Clause statute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    To state a claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that Defendants' conduct injured her right to receive benefits of an existing contractual arrangement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Heron Bay Acquisition, LLC v.
