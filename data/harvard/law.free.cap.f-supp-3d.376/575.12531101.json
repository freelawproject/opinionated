The student, Reginald Jacobs, alleges the SRO punched him in the face in a hallway outside the school gym just a few minutes after the school day ended. He has brought this lawsuit against the SRO, the County, and the Board of Education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The County and the Board of Education have filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting they cannot be liable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   or the Maryland Declaration of Rights. They first argue the SRO - who had removed his badge, gun, and protective vest moments before the assault - was not acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the incident. They also argue the school board is not a proper defendant because it did not directly employ the SRO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I do not find either of these arguments persuasive, as presented.

The first is whether the County and Board (collectively, the \"County Defendants\") are entitled to summary judgment on Counts I and II because Pickard, in their view, was acting outside the scope of his official duties when he struck Jacobs. The second is whether the Board is exempt from liability on the ground that it was not technically Pickard's employer at the time of the incident.

Summ. J. 7. While they concede that Pickard was acting in his official capacity when he first confronted Jacobs and frisked him for weapons, they say the encounter took on an altogether different dimension when he removed his badge, gun, and vest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-12. At that point, they say, Pickard \"ceased acting as a Resource Officer,\" Reply 3, ECF No. 66, and sought only to mentor a young man he had known from past interactions - a function that, they contend, \"is not part of his job duties as a\n   Prince George's County police officer or Resource Officer,\" Mot. Summ. J. 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   I will assume, without deciding, that \"scope of employment\" is an essential element of Jacobs's claims under \u00a7 1983 and the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The County Defendants motion fails, in any event, because they have not persuaded me of the absence of a genuine dispute on this issue. That is to say, I do not agree with the County Defendants that the evidence would not permit a reasonable jury to find that Pickard was, indeed, acting within the scope of his official duties when he assaulted Jacobs in the school hallway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The County Defendants, drawing on Maryland law, contend the proper test of whether an officer was acting within the scope of his employment is \"whether the actions were committed in furtherance of the employer's business\" and were \"committed during the performance of the duties entrusted to him by the employer, even though not expressly authorized.\" Mot.

Factors indicating an officer's actions fall outside of official duties, they say, are: \"(a) the employee's conduct was personal; (b) the conduct represents a departure from the purpose of furthering the employer's business; and (c) the employee is acting to protect his own interest, even if committed during normal duty hours and at an authorized locality.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Sawyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2046299,2046262\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/322/247/\">\n    587 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   471 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Applying this test here, the County Defendants say the undisputed facts show Pickard's actions after frisking Jacobs were \"clearly personal and in no way in furtherance of any legitimate governmental purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. I do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Among the weaknesses of the County Defendants' argument is that it asks this Court to take an overly narrow view of Pickard's duties as an SRO. Their motion, citing Pickard's testimony in the 2015 criminal trial, limits those duties to simply \"enforcing the laws of the State of Maryland, enforcing the rules of Suitland High School, and educating students as to the law.\" Mot. Summ. J. 9 (citing Pickard Test. 321:2-8). That, however, is not how Pickard characterized his responsibilities.

When asked how he, as an SRO, approached the challenges he encountered at Suitland High School, Pickard said he \"participated in coaching and mentoring and counseling the kids, also doing after-school programs with the students at Suitland, educating them on how being stopped by the police in your community, how you're supposed to handle yourselves and how you can de-escalate a lot of things before it can escalate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 323:23-324:6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   These activities were not confined to after-school hours. In his deposition, Pickard said he sometimes played basketball with students during their physical education classes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pickard Dep. 40:10-13. He did this, he said, not for personal reasons, but to \"build a rapport with certain kids that I had been told to talk to.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:17-19. This, in fact, is what Pickard said he was doing just before his run-in with Jacobs outside the school gymnasium on November 12, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 45:13-46:5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Pickard's deposition testimony further undermines the County Defendants' assertion that his interest in speaking with Jacobs was purely personal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply 3-4. Pickard explained that the reason he \"felt the need to reach out and help\" Jacobs was because Jacobs \"was known to deal with guns and so forth, and I have took [sic] a lot of guns out of Suitland.\" Pickard Dep. 41:13-17. Describing some of their earlier interactions, before the November 2013 confrontation, he said he sometimes caught Jacobs trying to leave school grounds while classes were still in session.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:3-8. Pickard, explaining that monitoring the perimeter of the school property was one of his job responsibilities, said he would \"try to talk him out of it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43:5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On other occasions, he recalled, he gave Jacobs money to buy a snack or drink from the school vending machine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:17-21. Again, Pickard said his motivation was \"building rapport.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45:1-2. He considered this important, he said, because the school's gang specialist had advised him to \"keep a close eye on this kid.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45:3-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The County Defendants' motion overlooks these portions of Pickard's testimony. All of them, though, can be found in the exhibits the County Defendants themselves enclosed along with the briefing on their motion, and construed in any light (let alone the \"light most favorable\" to Jacobs), these statements amply support an inference that Pickard's purpose in confronting Jacobs was related to his work as an SRO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To be clear, the County Defendants do not dispute that Pickard was engaged in police work when he first approached Jacobs and frisked him for weapons. Their argument, rather, is that Pickard \"ceased acting as a Resource Officer when he dispelled his suspicion that Jacobs was either armed or in possession of marijuana.\" Reply\n   3. They reason that, at that point, there was no longer reasonable suspicion to detain Jacobs, and so \"the law and his training required Pickard to release Jacobs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This argument fails for several reasons. For one thing, it misstates the facts. Contrary to their contention, the evidence does not establish that, following the frisk, Pickard no longer had reason to suspect Jacobs was carrying marijuana. Pickard testified in his criminal trial that Jacobs smelled of \"burnt marijuana.\" Pickard Test. 332:14-15. He also said that, while frisking Jacobs, he felt a \"spongy-like object\" that felt to him like \"maybe two bags of marijuana.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 332:5-10. He said he tried at least three times to search Jacobs's pocket, but Jacobs pushed his hand away each time.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 334:19-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Pickard's testimony was that the pat down aroused his suspicion that Jacobs had marijuana in his pocket.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 335:10-11. Whether, as a matter of constitutional law, his observations were sufficient to permit him to detain Jacobs is immaterial. While the County Defendants' argument invokes the language of constitutional law, the issue before me is not whether Pickard had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to seize Jacobs under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution - or even whether there was, in fact, a seizure. The question, rather, is whether the confrontation between the officer and the student fell within the scope of the officer's employment. To that end, Pickard's testimony indicates that he suspected Jacobs had drugs in his pocket. Pickard also testified that, after taking off his badge, gun belt, and vest, he tried to persuade Jacobs to let him \"confiscate\" the marijuana.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 339:6-9. \"I just wanted to get to his pocket, finish the whole investigation and send him on his way,\" Pickard said.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 339:14-16. These statements are wholly at odds with the County Defendants' contention that Pickard's reasons for interacting with Jacobs were unrelated to police work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Granted, there is no dispute that Pickard removed his badge, gun, and vest before striking Jacobs. The County Defendants argue this decision \"demonstrated his intent to not be viewed as a police officer.\" Mot. Summ. J. 10. It seems to me, though, that the pertinent question here is not how Pickard wanted\n   <em>\n    Jacobs\n   </em>\n   to perceive him. Certainly, in other circumstances, there may be legitimate reasons for an officer to create an impression that their conversation is unconnected to a police investigation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Illinois v. Perkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122654\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/292/#p300\">\n    496 U.S. 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 300,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122654\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/292/#p300\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122654\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/292/#p300\">\n    110 L.Ed.2d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). Here - while acknowledging that what he did may have been \"the stupidest thing in America\" - Pickard asserted that his goal was to \"keep everything ... diffused\" so he could continue talking to Jacobs. Pickard Interview 8:360, 10:420-21, ECF No. 66, Ex. 4. A reasonable juror, should he or she credit this testimony, could find that Pickard's actions - however ill advised - were inextricably linked with his duties as an SRO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   None of this, of course, precludes the County Defendants from attempting to prove at trial that Pickard's reasons for speaking with Jacobs were strictly personal. Here, though, at the summary judgment stage, they must show that no reasonable juror could find otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

The Amended Complaint references the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 32.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-54,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23, 33, 35, 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Eighth Amendment \"protects the rights of\n   <em>\n    postconviction\n   </em>\n   detainees.\"\n   <em>\n    B.N.S. ex rel.

However, before this case proceeds to trial, I am ordering Jacobs to file a brief letter clarifying which constitutional rights he seeks to vindicate under \u00a7 1983. I also am ordering the parties to submit briefing on two other issues: whether Jacobs's \u00a7 1983 claim lies against the Board as a matter of law, and whether the County Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on their\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim. As to this additional briefing, the County Defendants shall file first; the Plaintiff will file a response, as may Pickard (so long as it is not duplicative of what the Plaintiff has argued); and the County Defendants may file a reply.
