DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The pivotal issue here is whether Section 402 bars Defendant from relying on FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3 to withhold the six FISC opinions, because, as Plaintiff alleges, there is no evidence that a declassification review was conducted, as required by Section 402. Dkt. No. 68 at 7. Put another way, the Court must decide whether it can essentially enforce the declassification mandate under Section 402 through a FOIA action. This may include determining whether the USA FREEDOM Act applies retroactively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 66 at 19-25; Dkt. No. 68 at 11-14. If Section 402 does not prevent the government from relying on the FOIA exemptions, then the inquiry is whether the government properly withheld the six opinions and whether the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index it provided was sufficient to satisfy FOIA requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Plaintiff contends that because the government did not submit evidence that it has performed the declassification review required by Section 402, then either (1) the six opinions are improperly classified and not\n   subject to withholding under FOIA Exemptions 1 or 3, or (2) the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index provided by the government is inadequate to serve as a \"declassification summary,\" because it does not provide the information required in Section 402.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201872\">\n    50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A) (stating that summary \"shall include, to the extent consistent with national security, a description of the context in which the matter arises and any significant construction or interpretation of any statute, constitutional provision, or other legal authority relied on by the decision.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although Plaintiff presents a creative argument, the Court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff cannot enforce Section 402 through this FOIA action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Dkt. No. 69 at 5. Although Plaintiff contends it is only requesting that the Court \"interpret Section 402, not enforce it,\" Dkt. No. 70 at 3, Plaintiff plainly seeks to enforce Section 402's requirements. If the Court finds that the USA FREEDOM Act imposes additional requirements that Defendant failed to satisfy when claiming FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3, then according to Plaintiff, Defendant must either release the opinions, or include unclassified summaries as part of its\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index to reasonably justify withholding them.

Dkt. No. 68 at 17. But the content of the unclassified summaries is different than what is required under FOIA. Under FOIA, a\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index requires the government to \"identify[ ] each document withheld, the statutory exemption claimed, and a particularized explanation of how disclosure of the particular document would damage the interest protected by the claimed exemption.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freedom of the Press Found. v.
