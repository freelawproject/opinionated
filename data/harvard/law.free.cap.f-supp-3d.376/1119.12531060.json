The new regulations were proposed to \"clarify grantee responsibilities under Title X, to remove the requirement for nondirective abortion counseling and referral, to prohibit referral for abortion, and to clarify compliance obligations under state and local laws ... to clarify access to family planning services where an employer exercises a religious and moral objection ... and to require physical and financial separation to ensure clarity regarding the purpose of Title X and compliance with the statutory program integrity provisions, and to encourage family participation in family planning decisions, as required by Federal law.\"\n  <em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201002719\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </em>\n </attorneys>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs contend the Final Rule is in excess of the agency's statutory authority, is arbitrary and capricious, violates the Administrative Procedures Act, violates Title X requirements, violates congressional Non-directive Mandates, violates Section 1554 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\"), and is otherwise unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs assert the Final Rule is not designed to further the purposes of Title X, which is to equalize access to comprehensive, evidence-based, voluntary family planning. Rather it is designed to exclude and eliminate health care providers who provide abortion care and referral-which by extension will impede patients' access to abortion-even when Title X funds are not used to provide abortion care, counseling or referral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs also believe the Final Rule appears to be designed to limit patients' access to modern, effective, medically approved contraception and family planning health care. Plaintiffs argue the Final Rule was designed by the Department to direct Title X funds to providers who emphasize ineffective and inefficient family planning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs believe the Final Rule is politically motivated and not based on facts. Instead, it intentionally ignores comprehensive, ethical, and evidence-based health care, and impermissibly interferes with the patient-doctor relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants assert the Final Rule adopted by the Secretary is consistent with the Administrative Procedures Act,\n   consistent with Title X, the Non-directive Mandates, and Section 1554 of the ACA\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and is otherwise constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants believe the Final Rule is indistinguishable from regulations adopted over 30 years ago, which were held to be valid by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Rust v.

They have presented facts and argument that the Final Rule violates the Non-directive Mandate because it requires all pregnant patients to receive referrals for pre-natal care, regardless of whether the patient wants to continue the pregnancy, and regardless of the best medical advice and treatment that might be recommended for that patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   They have also presented facts and argument that the Final Rule likely violates Section 1554 of the ACA because the Final Rule creates unreasonable barriers for patients to obtain appropriate medical care; impedes timely access to health care services; interferes with communications regarding a full range of treatment options between the patient and the health care provider, restricts the ability of health care providers to provide full disclosure of all relevant information to patients making health care decisions, and violates the principles of informed consent and the ethical standards of health care professions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Fourth, Plaintiffs, with the help from\n   <em>\n    Amicus\n   </em>\n   parties, have presented facts and argument that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it reverses long-standing positions of the Department without proper consideration of sound medical opinions and the economic and non-economic consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs have presented facts and argument that the Department failed to consider important factors, acted counter to and in disregard of the evidence in the administrative record and offered no reasoned analysis based on the record. Rather, it seems the Department has relied on the record made 30 years ago, but not the record made in 2018-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiffs have demonstrated they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction by presenting facts and argument that the Final Rule may or likely will: (1) seriously disrupt or destroy the existing network of Title X providers in both the State of Washington and throughout the entire nation-this network has been carefully knit together over the past 45 years and there is no evidence presented by the Department that Title X is being violated or ignored by this network of providers; (2) impose additional and unnecessary costs on the State of Washington and other states; (3) harm the health of the patients who rely on the existing Title X providers; and (4) drive many Title X providers from the system either because of the increased costs imposed by the new separation requirements or because they cannot or will not comply with the allegedly unprofessional gag rule requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Washington State has shown that it is not legally or logistically feasible for Washington to continue accepting any Title X funding subject to the Final Rule. At the minimum, Washington stands to lose more than $ 28 million in savings from the loss of federal dollars. It has demonstrated the harmful consequences of the Final Rule will uniquely impact rural and uninsured patients. If the Final Rule is implemented, over half of Washington counties would be unserved by a Title X-funded family planning provider. Students at Washington colleges and universities will be especially hurt by the Final Rule. DOH reports it does not have the funding that would be required to comply with the Final Rule, nor would it be able to comply with the May 3, 2019 deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   NFPRHA currently has more than 65 Title X grantee members and almost 700 Title X sub-recipient members. These NFPRHA member organizations operate or fund a network of more than 3,500 health centers that provide family planning services to more than 3.7 million Title X patients each year. NFPRHA has shown that upon its effective date, the Final Rule will cause all current NFPRHA members grantees, sub-recipients, and their individual Title X clinicians to face a Hobson's Choice that harms patients as well as the providers. Faced with this difficult choice, many NFPRHA members will leave the network once the Final Rule becomes effective, thereby leaving low-income individuals without Title X providers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   It is worth noting that Plaintiffs have submitted substantial evidence of harm, including declarations from Karl Eastlund, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho, ECF No. 10; Cynthia Harris, program manager for the Family Planning Program, Washington DOH, ECF No. 11; Anuj Khattar, M.D., primary care physician and reproductive health provider, ECF No. 12; Dr. Judy Kimelman, practitioner at Seattle Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Group, ECF No. 13; Bob Marsalli, CEO of\n   the Washington Association for Community Health, ECF No. 14; David Schumacher, Director of the Office of Financial Management, State of Washington, ECF No. 15; Dr. Judy Zerzan-Thul, Chief Medical Officer for the Washington State Health Care Authority, ECF No. 16; Clare M. Coleman, President and CEO of the National Family Planning &amp; Reproductive Health Association, ECF No. 19; Dr. Kathryn Kost, Acting Vice President of Domestic Research at the Guttmacher Institute, ECF No. 20; Connie Cantrell, Executive Director of the Feminist Women's Health Center, ECF No. 21; Kristin A. Adams, Ph.D, President and CEO of the Indiana Family Health Council, ECF No. 22; J. Elisabeth Kruse, M.S., C.N.M., A.R.N.P, Lead Clinician for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Family Planning at the Public Health Department for Seattle and King County, Washington, ECF No. 23; Tessa Madden, M.D., M.P.H., Director of the Family Planning Division, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Washington University School of Medicine, ECF No. 24; Heather Maisen, Manager of the Family Planning Program in the Public Health Department for Seattle and King County, Washington, ECF No. 25; and Sarah Prager, M.D., Title X Director of the Feminist Women's Health Center, ECF No. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Yet, the Government's response in this case is dismissive, speculative, and not based on any evidence presented in the record before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Balance of Equities/Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The balance of equities and the public interest strongly favors a preliminary injunction, which tips the scale sharply in favor of Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   There is no public interest in the perpetration of unlawful agency action. Preserving the status quo will not harm the Government and delaying the effective date of the Final Rule will cost it nothing. There is no hurry for the Final Rule to become effective and the effective date of May 3, 2019 is arbitrary and unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   On the other hand, there is substantial equity and public interest in continuing the existing structure and network of health care providers, which carefully balances the Title X, the congressional Non-directive Mandates, and Section 1554 of the Affordable Care Act, while the legality of the new Final Rule is reviewed and decided by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   1. The State of Washington's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 9, is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   2. National Family Planning &amp; Reproductive Health Center,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 18, is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   3. Defendants and their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and any person in active concert or participation with them, are\n   <strong>\n    ENJOINED\n   </strong>\n   from implementing or enforcing the Final Rule entitled\n   <em>\n    Compliance with Statutory Program Integrity Requirements\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207714\">\n    84 Fed.

No bond shall be required pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   . The Clerk of Court is directed to enter this Order and forward copies to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Defendants also argue Plaintiffs have waived their argument that the Final Rule violates Section 1554 of the ACA by failing to refer to Section 1554 in their comments prior to the Final Rule being published. It is doubtful that an APA claim asserting that an agency exceeded the scope of its authority to act can be waived. Moreover, it appears that during the rule making process the agency was apprised of the substance of the violation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    President Nixon,\n    <em>\n     Special Message to the Congress on Problems of Population Growth\n    </em>\n    (July 18, 1969).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Title X became law as part of the \"Family Planning Services and Population Research Act of 1970.\" Pub.
