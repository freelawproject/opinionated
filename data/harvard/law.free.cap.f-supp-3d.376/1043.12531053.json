(Compl. (doc. no. 1-2) \u00b6\u00b6 46, 47, 53.) According to the complaint, d-l malic acid is a \"synthetic petrochemical.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) It \"confers a tart, fruit-like flavor\" to \"help[ ] make the Products - which are over 50% corn syrup and sugar - taste more like fruit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50 (internal quotation marks omitted), 59.)
