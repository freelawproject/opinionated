Eichman, M.D., is a state actor under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Docket Nos. 57 and 59). For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Dr. Eichman is not a state actor; therefore, Defendant's summary judgment motion will be granted and Plaintiffs' motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This matter arises from allegations of child abuse made against Plaintiffs A.L. and S.W. Plaintiffs filed this action on March 22, 2017, against Dr. Eichman and three other Defendants, Allegheny County, Andrew Fleming and Anjelica Salih, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   alleging procedural, substantive, and Fourth/Fourteenth Amendment due process claims against Defendants. (Docket No. 1). Defendants filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim, which the Court denied on July 14, 2017. (Docket Nos. 23, 26, 35, 36). On March 28, 2018, pursuant to a stipulation of dismissal by the parties, the Court ordered that all claims against Defendants Fleming, Salih and Allegheny County were dismissed with prejudice. (Docket Nos. 53, 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following discussion at a post-fact discovery status conference, the parties agreed to proceed to summary judgment on the issue of whether Dr. Eichman is a state actor. Accordingly, the parties filed their cross motions for summary judgment and supporting briefs on June 15, 2018,\n   followed by responses in opposition, replies and sur-replies to same. (Docket Nos. 57-61, 63-66, 68, 70-73). On September 7, 2018, the Court held oral argument on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. (Docket No. 74). Each party subsequently submitted supplemental records and argument in support of their respective position, and the transcript of the oral argument was filed on October 1, 2018. (Docket Nos. 76, 77, 80). Accordingly, the matter is now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Relevant Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Allegheny County Department of Human Services, Office of Children Youth and Families (\"CYF\") entered into a contract with Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of the UPMC Health System (\"CHP\") for the period July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016, pursuant to which CHP agreed to provide health services for children including comprehensive physical exams, intake or discharge exams, x-rays, treatment for injury and psychosocial assessments. (Docket No. 60-4 at 1, 49). The contract stated that CHP \"shall also participate in investigations of child abuse and neglect [and] shall provide written reports and/or court testimony in Allegheny County Juvenile Court and Allegheny County Criminal Court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to the Annual Statement of the Child Advocacy Center (\"CAC\") at CHP, its mission is \"to protect children and promote healthy families through excellence in assessment of child maltreatment, medical and social care for vulnerable children, collaboration with child-protection agencies [and] education and research.\" (Docket No. 60-3 at 2). The purposes of the CAC are \"(a) to ensure that injured, vulnerable patients receive competent assessment for concerns of maltreatment and (b) to ensure that there are ongoing medical and social services for children who have been abused or are at risk of abuse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). To these ends, CAC physicians are responsible for medical service, teaching, research and administrative leadership. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The goals and objectives of the medical/clinical service include the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    To provide consultative services for children receiving care at Children's Hospital, including forensic medical and social evaluations of children who may be victims of child abuse or neglect\n   </em>\n   . This service involves collaboration with other physicians on the medical staff, including specialists from trauma, neurosurgery, orthopaedics, radiology, ophthalmology, emergency medicine, behavioral health, and pediatrics.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    To work with professionals from community-based child-protection agencies and to support the judicial system in the protection of children. This includes providing\n    <strong>\n     objective\n    </strong>\n    medical information through consultative reports and legal testimony\n   </em>\n   for (a) the judicial system, both in family court and criminal court settings; (b) professionals working in the Office of CYF; (c) law-enforcement agencies; and (d) the district attorney's offices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 To provide pediatric medical care to vulnerable children in the child-protection system....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Dr. Eichman is listed in the CAC's Annual Statement as an Assistant Professor\n   of Pediatrics, but she testified that she is not employed by the CAC. (Docket No. 60-3 at 3; Docket No. 60-6 at 57:16-17). Dr. Eichman is employed by University of Pittsburgh Physicians (\"UPP\"), which is a physician group affiliated with UPMC, and the University of Pittsburgh as a pediatrician and an assistant professor of pediatrics. (Docket No. 60-6 at 12:1-17, 57:16-17). Dr. Eichman is separately compensated by UPP and the University, and she does not receive any compensation from the CAC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:11-13, 20:25-21:5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As an educator, Dr. Eichman's responsibilities include teaching medical residents, as well as teaching and training for community physicians, caseworkers and judges. (Docket No. 60-6 at 21:6-17). Dr. Eichman does not receive any compensation when she teaches and trains caseworkers or judges, but sometimes a donation is made to the hospital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:25-22:4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a clinician, Dr. Eichman's job responsibilities include working as an attending pediatrician with the CAC, which began on July 1, 2013. (Docket No. 60-6 at 11:1-2, 15:12-16, 16:18, 57:16-58:1). In that role, Dr. Eichman is a consultant who evaluates a child and offers recommendations to physicians on the various primary services at CHP, such as general pediatrics, neurology or trauma. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:5-10). As a medical consultant, Dr. Eichman evaluates whether or not a child has been abused or neglected, which includes performing a comprehensive physical examination of the child. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79:9-80:8). Dr. Eichman testified that she does not investigate child abuse, as would a caseworker or a police officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78:14-16). Nonetheless, as a pediatrician, Dr. Eichman is a mandated reporter,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   meaning that she is mandated to make a report to Child Protective Services (\"CPS\") if she has a reasonable suspicion of abuse or neglect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59:16-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs are the parents of two children, S.L.W. and D.W. (Docket No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). During S.L.W.'s one-month well child visit on July 14, 2015, the nurse practitioner at his pediatrician's office noticed four bruises on S.L.W., one each on his forehead, left inner elbow, right lower leg and back/waist area. (Docket No. 64-1 at 3). According to the pediatrician office notes, S.L.W.'s mother, Plaintiff A.L., stated that she may have remembered accidentally hitting his head when she placed him into his swing, but she did not see the other bruises until they were pointed out that day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The office notes state, \"d/w mother concern for possible medical condition as well as concern for someone inflicting intentional injury to nonmobile infant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A.L. indicated that she understood and agreed to take S.L.W. to the emergency room at CHP for evaluation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The office notes state that A.L. was aware that S.L.W. would have lab work and a skeletal survey as part of the evaluation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   CHP Emergency Department records indicate that S.L.W. presented for evaluation because his primary pediatrician's office was concerned about the unexplained bruises. (Docket No. 76-1 at 21). Based on the history provided by S.L.W's mother, there was concern for non-accidental trauma perpetrated by his father, Plaintiff S.W. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Emergency Department notes document that S.W. had been on feeding duty with S.L.W. on Saturday night (three days prior to presenting to CHP), and A.L. first noticed a bruise on S.L.W.'s back and leg on Sunday morning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). A.L. asked S.W. about the bruises, and he responded that he \"may have been frustrated\" and \"perhaps he had been a little rough with the baby.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Emergency Department notes further indicate that there was no family history of bleeding disorders, but A.L. bruises easily, and it was noted that S.L.W.'s leg was bruised after his blood pressure was taken. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Emergency Department consulted with a doctor on the trauma service, as well as Dr. Eichman to perform an evaluation of S.L.W. because of concerns for abuse. (Docket Nos. 60-6 at 175:17-25; 76-1 at 23). Dr. Eichman performed a physical examination of S.L.W. and obtained history from A.L, who told Dr. Eichman that S.W. had night duty on Saturday night, and she noticed a bruise on S.L.W.'s forehead and back on Sunday morning. (Docket No. 64-3 at 2, 3, 6). S.W. did not have an explanation for the forehead bruise, other than he \"was probably too rough with the baby.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). As to the back bruise, S.W. said that was probably due to him \"massaging S.L.W.'s belly due to gas.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A.L. also noted that she bumped S.L.W.'s head while putting him into his swing a few days earlier, but the impact seemed insignificant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Eichman's notes indicate that A.L. said she bruises easily and has heavy periods, but she has not had a formal work-up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Dr. Eichman reported that S.L.W.'s CT scan and skeletal survey were preliminarily normal, but his bloodwork was pending. (Docket No. 64-3 at 8). The report stated that \"[b]ruising in a non-mobile infant is HIGHLY CONCERNING for physical child abuse,\" thus more medical information, including a dilated eye exam and further bloodwork, will be forthcoming. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Eichman noted, \"will file a ChildLine with ACCYF and await a safety plan,\" S.L.W.'s sister, D.W., must also be seen for a physical exam, and S.L.W. must have a follow-up skeletal survey in 10-14 days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Eichman suspected S.L.W. may have been abused based on the concerning objective factor of bruising on a non-mobile infant, along with the history provided by A.L. indicating that S.W. might have been a little rough with him. (Docket No. 60-6 at 176:14-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The ChildLine Report of Suspected Child Abuse was filed on July 14, 2015, at 3:33 p.m. (Docket No. 66-6). Dr. Eichman explained that the ChildLine report is electronically filed and sent to the state in Harrisburg, and then the state contacts the county where the potential abuse occurred. (Docket No. 60-6 at 177:18-178:1). In this case, the state contacted Allegheny County CYF, which then began an investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 178:6-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A report dated July 14, 2015, by CYF caseworker Andrew Fleming indicates that the ChildLine was filed for Dr. Eichman with an eSignature by Jamie Zaremski. (Docket No. 60-7 at 2). Mr. Fleming's report notes that Dr. Eichman called at 5:30 p.m. to confirm whether CYF received the ChildLine report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Fleming's report recounts that S.L.W. was seen at his pediatrician's office earlier that day and he was referred to CHP because of bruising for which the only explanation was that\n   S.W. may have been too rough with him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 2). Mr. Fleming's report further states that sibling D.W. was examined at the CHP Emergency Department and there were no medical concerns with her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). D.W. was ready for discharge, but Dr. Eichman was concerned about her leaving with S.W. until CYF implemented a safety plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On the evening of July 14, 2015, CYF caseworker Angelica Salih met with and interviewed Plaintiffs at CHP. (Docket No. 66-7). Dr. Eichman was not present when Ms. Salih interviewed Plaintiffs, nor when any investigation occurred. (Docket No. 60-6 at 178:8-14). A.L. told Ms. Salih that she noticed the bruise on S.L.W.'s forehead on Sunday morning and that she noticed a bruise on his left arm, lower back and leg throughout the day on Sunday. (Docket No. 66-7 at 2). A.L. asked S.W. about the bruising, as he had the previous night duty with S.L.W., and S.W. stated that he gave S.L.W. a belly massage to alleviate gas, which he thought might have caused the bruise on S.L.W.'s back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). S.W. admitted that he may have been \"a little too rough\" with S.L.W., but he denied intentionally harming the baby. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). S.W. also told Ms. Salih that the belly massage might have caused S.L.W.'s back bruise, but he denied intending to harm the child. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The report of Ms. Salih's July 14, 2015, meeting and interview of Plaintiffs notes that they expressed great frustration with \"being treated guilty until proven innocent.\" (Docket No. 66-7 at 3). Despite their frustration, Plaintiffs agreed to a safety plan, which provided that S.W. would have no unsupervised contact with S.L.W. and D.W. during the investigation period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A.L. and S.W. indicated that they understood the plan and they signed it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Eichman testified that she was not involved in formulating the safety plan, as that is not her purview. (Docket No. 60-6 at 178:20-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The report of Ms. Salih's interviews with Plaintiffs also indicates that they agreed to leave S.L.W. at CHP overnight and return home with D.W. (Docket No. 66-7 at 3). That evening, Ms. Salih conducted an inspection of Plaintiffs' home, and no concerns were noted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Dr. Eichman again met with S.L.W.'s parents on July 15, 2015. (Docket No. 76-1 at 48). A.L. told Dr. Eichman that they had met with a CYF caseworker and signed a safety plan pursuant to which she would supervise S.W.'s contact with the children. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A.L. asked why CYF was involved when there were still medical tests pending which could \"exonerate\" them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Eichman explained that the threshold to file a report is \"a reasonable concern for abuse, not a definite diagnosis of abuse\" and the priority is to ensure the child's immediate safety because some medical tests can take weeks to return. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-49). Dr. Eichman reviewed with Plaintiffs that there was a concern for physical abuse because S.L.W. was only four weeks old, he was \"not yet cruising or even moving\" and routine infant care does not cause bruising, thus it was abnormal for him to have any bruises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49). Dr. Eichman explained that it was important to recognize that S.L.W. was most likely hurt by an adult caretaker, which she observed Plaintiffs were having difficulty accepting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). S.L.W. was discharged from the hospital later that day and a follow-up examination was scheduled at the CAC on July 28, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On July 17, 2015, Dr. Eichman received the preliminary results of S.L.W's bloodwork, which were all within a normal range. (Docket No. 76-1 at 48). Dr. Eichman's treatment notes document her conversation with A.L. concerning the results:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   I gave [S.L.W.'s] mother the preliminary results of his von Willebrand screen. I explained that these results will be verified by the hematologist and that I will call if there are any changes in the results, I will call his family. His mother asked whether there was any significance to his Factor IX level being in the lower end of normal range. I explained that I spoke with the attending hematologist, and that normal is normal. If [S.L.W.] had a clinically significant bleeding disorder, the screens sent (Factor VII and Factor IX and von Willebrand screen) would have showed an abnormality.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Eichman testified that the referenced conversation with the attending hematologist was a \"curbside consult,\" which meant that she asked for the hematologist's help in interpreting lab work based on the clinical scenario she described. (Docket No. 60-6 at 135:8-17). In view of S.L.W.'s normal bloodwork test results, Dr. Eichman did not refer him to a hematologist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 148:4-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   According to Mr. Fleming's notes on July 21, 2015, Detective Honan of the Pittsburgh Police had explained to A.L. that he was waiting for results from the scheduled follow-up at the CAC on July 28, 2015, and then he would interview S.W. (Docket No. 60-9 at 1). Detective Honan said that his course of action \"would largely depend upon whether or not Dr. Eichman's medical opinion found [S.W.'s] explanation of [S.L.W.'s] injuries to be plausible and/or consistent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). If Dr. Eichman's medical opinion was that S.L.W.'s injuries were \"diagnostic of child abuse, Detective Honan said he would approach the DA, and if the DA told him to charge [S.W.], then he would press charges.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2). Mr. Fleming's notes also document that he provided Detective Honan with information concerning his interviews with Plaintiffs and the safety plan which CYF put in place to assure the children's safety during the investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Dr. Eichman's July 28, 2015, report of S.L.W.'s follow-up examination recounts the history of his case and notes that his medical tests and bloodwork, including tests to screen for a bleeding disorder, were normal. (Docket No. 60-1 at 1). Dr. Eichman spoke with Plaintiffs, who said that S.L.W. was doing well and they had not noticed any new bruises or injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Eichman examined S.L.W. and noted normal findings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). Dr. Eichman concluded that \"[t]he bruises found on [S.L.W.] were the result of physical child abuse. [S.L.W.] could not have caused the bruises himself. Routine care of an infant does not cause bruising. [S.L.W.] does not have an underlying medical condition that would make him prone to bruising.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A CYF Investigation Summary of S.L.W.'s case states, \"[a]lthough the children's needs continue to be met and home visits revealed no immediate safety concerns, collateral contacts revealed concerns for physical abuse.\" (Docket No. 70-2 at 3). The Summary's Recommendation section stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   CPS saw injury. Photographs of the injury were taken. Dr. Eichman stated the injuries caused substantial pain. CPS investigation determined that there is substantial evidence of causing bodily harm through [ ] recent act and/or failure to act. This family has been accepted for services.... A Dependency Hearing is scheduled for 8/26/15.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Based on an affidavit of probable cause by a Detective Honan, a criminal complaint charging one count of aggravated assault and one count of endangering the welfare of a child was filed against S.W. on August\n   18, 2015. (Docket No. 60-10). The criminal complaint summarizes Dr. Eichman's medical reports, including that S.L.W.'s medical tests and blood work were normal, and Dr. Eichman's opinion that \"[t]he bruises found on [S.L.W.] were the result of physical child abuse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). S.W. voluntarily turned himself in on August 20, 2015 and spent one night in jail before being released on bond, with the condition that he have no contact with any children, including his own. (Docket No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 98-99). Dr. Eichman was not aware of S.W.'s arrest until November 2015. (Docket No. 60-6 at 173:18-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In November 2015, S.L.W. was seen at the Hemophilia Center of Western Pennsylvania, and diagnosed with a platelet function disorder. (Docket No. 1, \u00b6 114). On November 18, 2015, Dr. Eichman made an addendum to her report of July 28, 2015, indicating that she received a call from S.L.W.'s hematologist, who stated that he had further blood tests and was diagnosed with a platelet function disorder. (Docket No. 60-1 at 4). Dr. Eichman wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Such an underlying bleeding disorder would make it easier for S.L.W. to bruise. It is important to note, however, that S.L.W. has not had any further bruising since 4 weeks of age. I continue to be concerned that S.L.W. was bruised due to a caretaker being too rough with him when he was 4 weeks of age.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Eichman testified that when she ordered blood testing on S.L.W. in July 2015, she was not aware that the results of those tests could come back normal and he still could have a bleeding disorder.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 175:17-25). The record evidence shows that Dr. Eichman conducted a physical examination of S.L.W., obtained history from A.L. and ordered certain testing and bloodwork. (Docket No. 64-3 at 2, 3, 6, 8). After the bloodwork results and a follow-up physical examination of S.L.W. were found to be normal, Dr. Eichman rendered an opinion that the bruises on him were the result of physical child abuse. (Docket Nos. 60-1 at 3, 4). Dr. Eichman's examination of S.L.W., ordering medical tests and rendering an opinion as to the cause of his bruises are not functions that are traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state; thus, she is not a state actor under the first\n   <em>\n    Kach\n   </em>\n   test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klavan v.

Ill. Jan. 4, 1996) (holding that a physician and a pediatric center were not state actors even though they contracted with the state and received compensation in return for reporting their findings to the state's Department of Children and Family Services and testifying at criminal proceedings).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiffs cite no record evidence showing that Dr. Eichman acted with the help of or in concert with Allegheny County when she initially evaluated S.L.W. and ordered testing, re-evaluated him, or when she issued her opinion that his bruises were the result of physical child abuse. Plaintiffs argue, however, that concerted action is shown because Dr. Eichman called Allegheny County CYF \"requesting a safety plan that prohibited S.W. from leaving the hospital with D.W.\" and a safety plan was subsequently instituted which prohibited S.W. from having unsupervised contact with the children. (Docket No. 63 at 9). The evidence does not show that Dr. Eichman \"requested\" a safety plan, as Plaintiffs suggest, or otherwise demonstrate any concerted action. Rather, Mr. Fleming's report indicates,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Dr. Eichman called to confirm whether CYF received the ChildLine report concerning S.L.W. and that sibling D.W. was examined and ready for discharge, but Dr. Eichman was concerned about her leaving with S.W. until CYF implemented a safety plan. (Docket No. 60-7 at 2). Though Dr. Eichman expressed concern in that regard, there is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     no\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   evidence that Dr. Eichman was consulted by CYF relative to creating and implementing a safety plan or that she played any role whatsoever in that matter. As Dr. Eichman unequivocally testified, she was not involved in formulating the safety plan, as that is not her purview. (Docket No. 60-6 at 178:20-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiffs' assertion that Dr. Eichman acted in concert with the Pittsburgh Police likewise is unsupported by the record evidence. According to Plaintiffs, in deciding to charge and arrest S.W., Detective Honan substituted Dr. Eichman's judgment for his own on the issue of whether S.L.W. was abused. (Docket No. 63 at 10). Plaintiffs insist that this is so because Mr. Fleming's notes state that Detective Honan's course of action \"would largely depend upon whether or not Dr. Eichman's medical opinion found [S.W.'s] explanation of [S.L.W.'s] injuries to be plausible and/or consistent.\" (Docket No. 63 at 10 (quoting Docket No. 60-9 at 1)). Plaintiffs ignore that Mr. Fleming further noted that if Dr. Eichman's medical opinion was that S.L.W.'s injuries were \"diagnostic of child abuse, Detective Honan said he would approach the DA, and if the DA told him to charge [S.W.], then he would press charges.\" (Docket No. 60-9 at 1-2). Mr. Fleming's notes show that Detective Honan was gathering information about S.L.W.'s case, including Dr. Eichman's medical opinion, but it was the District Attorney's decision whether to charge\n   S.W. with a crime. It was entirely proper for Detective Honan to consider Dr. Eichman's medical report and opinion, and cite it in the affidavit of probable cause supporting the criminal complaint against S.W. (Docket No. 60-10 at 3). None of this shows that Dr. Eichman acted with the help of or in concert with the police. There is no evidence that the police or the District Attorney influenced Dr. Eichman's evaluation of S.L.W. or her opinion that his bruising was caused by physical child abuse, nor is there any evidence that Dr. Eichman opined on whether charges should be filed against S.W.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Dr. Eichman testified, she was not aware that S.W. had been arrested until November 2015.

(Docket Nos. 61 at 13-18; 63 at 12-19; 71 at 4-5). Once again, the thrust of Plaintiffs' argument is that Dr. Eichman was performing contractual obligations concerning the investigation of child abuse pursuant to CHP's contract with Allegheny County, (Docket No. 61 at 14), which alone is not sufficient to establish that Dr. Eichman is a state actor under the third\n   <em>\n    Kach\n   </em>\n   test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3499549\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/589/626/#p646\">\n    589 F.3d at 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   To repeat, the focus of the inquiry is \"whether the state has exercised control over the particular conduct that gave rise to the plaintiff's alleged constitutional deprivation.\"\n   <em>\n    Kach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3499549\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/589/626/#p646\">\n    589 F.3d at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to Plaintiffs, Dr. Eichman's medical report indicating that S.L.W.'s bruises were the result of physical child abuse was the reason a safety plan was implemented which precluded S.W. from unsupervised contact with the children and the reason that he was charged and arrested. There is no evidence in the record, however, that Allegheny County CYF, the Pittsburgh Police or the District Attorney's Office exercised coercive power or provided significant encouragement which dictated or controlled Dr. Eichman's medical examination of S.L.W. or her opinion that his bruises were caused by abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Groman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7410729\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/47/628/#p640\">\n    47 F.3d at 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no state action with respect to private actor for \u00a7 1983 purposes where \"[t]here [was] no evidence that the Township controlled the first aid squad's professional conduct.\").

Plaintiffs have not cited any authority for the proposition that a doctor's alleged missed diagnosis in a situation such as this establishes that the doctor was a state actor. The Court notes, however, that Dr. Eichman candidly explained she was not aware in July 2015 that the results of the blood tests she ordered on S.L.W. at that time could come back normal and he still could have a bleeding disorder. (Docket No. 60-6 at 128:20-24). Dr. Eichman thought that running the testing recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics would catch any clinically significant bleeding disorder. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 129:4-11). She did not learn until November 2015 that the blood tests which were done on S.L.W. in July 2015 would not have picked up on every bleeding disorder.
