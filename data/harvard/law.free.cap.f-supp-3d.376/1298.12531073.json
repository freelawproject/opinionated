This matter was referred to the undersigned\n   by the Honorable Ursula Ungaro, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida (DE# 14, 1/8/19). Having carefully considered the motion, the Plaintiffs' Response in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration [D.E. 9] (DE# 18, 1/18/19) and the defendant Medica Healthcare Plans, Inc's Reply in Support of Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay the Litigation, the parties' exhibits, the court file and the applicable law, the undersigned recommends that the defendant Medica Healthcare Plans, Inc.s' Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay the Litigation (DE# 9, 1/4/19) be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     I. INTRODUCTION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiffs, Baptist Hospital of Miami, Inc., South Miami Hospital, Inc., Doctors Hospital, Inc., Homestead Hospital, Inc., and West Kendall Hospital, Inc. (collectively \"plaintiffs\" or \"Baptist Hospitals\") filed an action in state court against the defendant to recover more than $ 800,000 for alleged medically necessary and covered services provided to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medica's Medicare Advantage plans (\"Medica Members\") between January 2017 and January 2018 pursuant to the Medical Hospital Provider Agreement with an effective date of January 1, 2005 between the defendant and the plaintiff hospitals (\"2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement\"). The plaintiffs allege four counts in their complaint: 1) breach of contract (Count I), unjust enrichment/breach of implied-in-law contract (Count II), promissory estoppel (Count III), and claim for benefits under contract by assignee (Count IV).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant, Medica Healthcare Plans, Inc. (\"defendant\" or \"Medica\") removed the action to federal court pursuant to the Federal Officer Statute because Medica claims it was acting on behalf of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a Medicare Advantage Organization (\"MAO\") and that the Court has supplemental jurisdiction over any related state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant argues that the plaintiffs' claims are subject to mandatory arbitration pursuant to a provision in the 2005 Medical Hospital Provider Agreement that requires the plaintiffs to comply with any manuals or publications maintained by Medica, as amended and revised from time to time. Medica contends that the current and operative manual that applies to contracted providers for members of Medicare Advantage plans generally, and Medica Members specifically, is the 2018 UnitedHealthcare Care Provider Administrative Guide (the \"2018 UHC Provider Guide\") which contains an arbitration provision. Baptist Hospital maintains that the operative manual for its claims is the 2017 UHC Provider Guide, which does not contain an arbitration provision, because Baptist Hospitals' claims pre-date the April 1, 2018 effective date of the 2018 UHC Provider Guide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Baptist Hospitals oppose arbitration on three grounds: 1) the 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement does not contain an arbitration provision; 2) the 2018 UHC Provider Guide is an unenforceable modification to the 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement; and 3) the 2018 UHC Provider Guide does not cover the benefit claims at issue because Baptist Hospitals' claims predate its effective date of April 1, 2018 and the 2017 UCH Provider Guide does not contain an arbitration provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its Complaint that was filed in state court on November 14, 2018, Baptist Hospitals seek payment for denied benefit claims for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries pursuant to the 2005 Medica\n   Hospital Provider Agreement with Medica. Baptist Hospitals allege that the 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement \"obligated Medica to 'compensate [the Hospitals] for [Covered] Services furnished to [Medica's] members pursuant to this agreement and the rates and charges set forth [in it].\" Complaint at \u00b6 8 (DE# 1-1, 12/28/18). Baptist Hospitals seek to recover approximately $ 800,000 for claims between January 2017 and January 2018 for the alleged medically necessary and covered services provided to Medica Members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 13-101 (DE# 1-1, 12/28/18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is undisputed that the 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement does not contain an arbitration provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 5 (DE# 9, 1/4/19). Medica relies on Section 3.2 of the 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement, which implicitly incorporates the definition of \"Hospital Manual\" found in Section 1.24, and states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   3.2\n   <em>\n    Cooperation and Compliance\n   </em>\n   .

A hospital manual has been furnished to [Baptist Hospitals]. Provider shall reasonably cooperate with the provisions of the Hospital Manual provided the instructions and/or policies do not conflict with the terms of this Agreement or are not in conflict with Provider's policies and procedures.

Medica contends that the 2018 UHC Provider Guide is the current and operative manual that governs and requires Baptist Hospitals to arbitrate the claims at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Baptist Hospitals argue three grounds for the Court to deny Medica's motion to compel arbitration, namely: 1) neither Baptist Hospitals nor Medica agreed to submit the claims at issue to mandatory and binding arbitration as evidenced by the lack of an arbitration provision in the 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement; 2) the 2018 UHC Provider Guide is an unenforceable modification of their 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement; and 3) even if Baptist Hospitals were bound by the 2018 UHC Provider Guide, the arbitration provision does not apply to Baptist Hospitals' claims that are based on non-payments that pre-date the effective date of the arbitration provision.

Medica relies on the 2018 UHC Provider Guide, which contains the subject arbitration provision, and was promulgated by Medica's parent company, UnitedHealthcare (\"UHC\") pursuant to Sections 1.24 and 3.2 of the 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement. The UHC Provider Guide became effective April 1, 2018 for healthcare providers already participating in UHC's commercial and Medicare networks.

Baptist Hospitals expressly agreed in the 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement that they \"shall reasonably cooperate with the provisions of the Hospital Manual [as amended and revised by the Plan in its discretion] provided the instructions and/or policies are not in conflict with the terms of the this Agreement or are not in conflict with the Provider's policies and procedures.\" Reply at 2 (DE# 21, 1/25/19) (quoting 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement \u00a7 1.24).

(DE# 9-3, p. 5). Medica contends that the Medica supplement in the 2018 UHC Provider Guide subjects providers, like Baptist Hospitals, to the general guide and the supplement and that the supplement governs only if in conflict with the general guide. Medica maintains that the general section of the 2018 UHC Provider Guide provides that the parties \"may pursue dispute resolution.\" Motion at 6 (DE# 9, 1/4/19) (quoting Lubowitz Decl., Ex. 3 at p. 61).

Medica argues that\n   <em>\n    All South Subcontractors\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Careplus Health Plans\n   </em>\n   are factually distinguishable because both cases involved parties who had two separate agreements, one containing an arbitration provision and one that did not. Both cases also had merger clauses that are substantially similar to the one in the present case. None of the agreements at issue in those cases contained a provision that allowed one party to unilaterally amend or revise the policies and procedures that were incorporated by reference as Sections 3.2 and 1.24 of the 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement provides in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    All South Subcontractors\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs filed a putative class action against the defendants for violations of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79. The defendants moved to compel arbitration based on the most recent version of the defendants' \"terms and conditions\" that included an arbitration provision. The plaintiffs argued that the action was based on the terms of the parties' agreement in 2010, which was the operative agreement in place at the time the causes of action arose, and that the 2012 terms and conditions could not \"retroactively bind [the plaintiff] to an arbitration clause that [it] had not known existed in 2010.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80. The\n   <em>\n    All South Subcontractors\n   </em>\n   court agreed and held that the plaintiffs could not be compelled to arbitrate their claims based on the 2012 terms and conditions because \"there was no assent to arbitrate disputes arising from the 2010 [contract] due to the lack of any arbitration language connected to that [contract].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82 (citing\n   <em>\n    Careplus Health Plans, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7001423\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/124/968/#p971\">\n    124 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   970 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Careplus Health Plans\n   </em>\n   was a medical services provider that entered into an agreement (the \"2004 agreement\") with the defendant, Careplus Health Plans, Inc., a subsidiary of Humana.\n   <em>\n    Careplus Health Plans, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7001423\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/124/968/#p971\">\n    124 So.3d at 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

No arbitration provision existed at the time Baptist Hospitals' claims arose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2017 Manual, Exhibit A to Response (DE# 18, 1/18/19). Medica cannot retroactively bind Baptist Hospitals to the arbitration provision in the 2018 UHC Provider Guide where, as here, the claims at issue arose under the 2017 Manual that did not contain an arbitration provision and thus, did not require arbitration. Because the arbitration provision in the 2018 UHC Provider Guide is not retroactive and Baptist Hospitals' claims have no nexus with the 2018 UHC Provider Guide, Medica's motion to compel arbitration based on the arbitration provision in the 2018 UHC Provider Guide should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Baptist Hospitals' Merger Clause Argument Lacks Merit\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Baptist Hospitals argue that the merger clause in the 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement requires that any modification of the Agreement's terms be in writing and signed by both parties. Baptist Hospitals contend that Medica's unilateral modification, that would require all disputes to be submitted to arbitration by adding the provision in the 2018 UHC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Provider Guide, is unenforceable because Baptist Hospitals never agreed to nor intended to agree to such terms. Response at 9 (DE# 18, 1/18/19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The undersigned finds that Baptist Hospitals' merger clause argument lacks merit. The merger clause in the 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    8.1 Entire Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   This Agreement and its attachments and exhibits embody all of the terms and conditions relating to this Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties. The provisions of this Agreement may not be\n   <em>\n    amended, supplemented, changed orally or by course of conduct of the parties\n   </em>\n   , but only by a written document signed by all the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   (DE# 9-2, \u00a7 8.1) (emphasis added). Baptist Hospitals' interpretation and suggested application of the merger clause would negate their obligation to \"reasonably cooperate with [Medica's] policies and procedures, including ... the Hospital Manual....\" that Medica had the contractual right to unilaterally \"amend[ ] and revise[ ] from time to time ... in its discretion.\" Sections 3.2 and 1.24 of the 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement. Contract interpretation principles require courts to give meaning to all provisions of a contract. In Sections 3.2 and 1.24, Baptist Hospitals expressly agreed to comply with procedures and policies that Medica had the discretion to amend or revise in the future as long as the terms in such publications do not conflict with the 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Baptist Hospitals' suggested application of the merger clause would negate Medica's contractual right to promulgate amended or revised polices and procedures in its discretion in the future. The undersigned rejects Baptist Hospitals' merger clause argument and finds that Section 3.2 and 1.24 of the 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement expressly authorize future unilateral amendments or revisions of policies and procedures by Medica to the extent such amendments or revisions do not conflict with the 2005 Medica Hospital Provider Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   This Court should deny Medica's motion to compel arbitration. The undersigned finds that the arbitration provision that was added in the 2018 UHC Provider Guide is enforceable but is not retroactive. Neither Medica nor Baptist Hospitals agreed to arbitrate the subject claims for non-payment that occurred between January 2017 and January 2018. Medica cannot retroactively bind Baptist Hospitals to arbitrate the subject claims that predate the April 1, 2018 effective date of the 2018 UHC Provider Guide where, as here, Baptist Hospitals' claims have no nexus with the 2018 UHC Provider Guide. This Court should deny the motion to compel arbitration because Baptists' Hospitals claims are not subject to and do not fall within the scope of the arbitration provision in the 2018 UHC Provider Guide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Stay\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit has held that \"the FAA requires a court to either stay or dismiss a lawsuit and to compel arbitration\" when all of the claims are subject to mandatory arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Lambert v.
