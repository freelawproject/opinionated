Plaintiffs Robert J. Larkins and Anne K. Larkins (collectively \"Plaintiffs\" or \"the Larkins\") allege that Defendant Fifth Third Mortgage Company (\"Defendant\" or \"Fifth Third\") violated the Truth In Lending Act (\"TILA\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   specifically 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639g and its corresponding regulation at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201026.36\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026.36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3). Fifth Third moves for summary judgment on the Larkins' sole claim, while the Larkins move for partial summary judgment on liability. Both motions are fully briefed and ripe for review. (Docs. 16, 19, 21, and 17, 18, 22, respectively.) For the reasons below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Fifth Third's Motion for Summary Judgment,\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the Larkins' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, and\n   <strong>\n    TERMINATES\n   </strong>\n   this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the summer of 2003, the Larkins took out a mortgage with Fifth Third to buy their home in Dayton, Ohio. After the Larkins defaulted on their mortgage loan, Fifth Third filed a foreclosure action against them in state court in November of 2016. In that foreclosure action, as of April 2017, the law firm of Clunk, Paisley, Hoose Co., L.P.A. served as foreclosure counsel for Fifth Third, and the law firm of Doucet &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A. served as foreclosure counsel for the Larkins. As of that same time (April 2017), John P. Miller was an associate with Doucet and Associates Co., LPA (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Larkins' foreclosure counsel), and Diane Bennett was a legal assistant with Fifth Third's foreclosure counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 14, 2017, the Larkins received a written offer to purchase their home. They needed a payoff quote by April 30, 2017 to prevent the offer from expiring. Because of the pending foreclosure action and the fact that Fifth Third had legal representation, the Larkins' foreclosure counsel sent a written request for a payoff balance to Fifth Third's foreclosure counsel. Specifically, on April 19, 2017, Ms. Bennett received an email from Mr. Miller that had been directed to the firm's \"notice\" and \"requests\" electronic inboxes. The email's subject line was \"Fifth Third Mortgage v. Larkins 2016 CV 05921,\" and it stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Good morning Attorney Mueller and Attorney Whiteacre,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Anne and Robert Larkins request a payoff quote from Fifth Third in regard to the mortgage loan associated with the pending litigation between the two parties. Could yourselves or your other attorneys associated with this case obtain this pay off quote and send it along? Your assistance is greatly appreciated\n   and we look forward to hearing from you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Sincerely,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   John P. Miller\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response to Mr. Miller's email, Ms. Bennett stated in an email: \"Hello: We can order a payoff quote for you. We will send it upon receipt. Diane Bennett Legal Assistant.\" Not surprisingly, Fifth Third's foreclosure counsel did not have access to Fifth Third's internal systems or the information necessary to generate a customer payoff quote itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On Monday, April 24, 2017, Fifth Third received a request for a payoff quote from Ms. Bennett, on behalf of the Larkins. (Doc. 16-5, \u00b6 7; Doc. 16-1, \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 16-8, p. FTM477.) On Friday, April 28, 2017, Fifth Third generated the payoff quote. (Doc. 16-1, \u00b6 14.) Fifth Third sent the payoff quote (with payoff amount) to Ms. Bennett, which Ms. Bennett received on Monday, May 1, 2017. (Doc. 16-5, \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 16-5 PAGEID # 257.) Therefore, Fifth Third sent the payoff quote five business days after receiving the request from Ms. Bennett on behalf of the borrower (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Larkins).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 4, 2017, after receiving clarifying information that she had requested from Fifth Third regarding the payoff quote, Ms. Bennett both mailed and emailed the payoff quote to Mr. Jesse Moses of Doucet and Associates Co., L.P.A., the attorney of record for the Larkins in the foreclosure action. The addresses used for both mailing and emailing the payoff quote to Mr. Moses were those provided on his Notification Form of Record in the foreclosure action. Ms. Bennett received an \"Email Delivery Failure\" email that indicated her email to Mr. Moses could not be delivered and that the email address for Mr. Moses no longer existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 15, 2017, the Larkins' foreclosure counsel asserted in an email to Fifth Third's foreclosure counsel that Fifth Third had refused to furnish a payoff quote. Fifth Third's foreclosure counsel responded by email the next day, re-sending the payoff quote that Ms. Bennett had sent on May 4, 2017 and noting that the payoff quote had been sent on May 4, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD ON SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary judgment \"shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

(Doc. 16-5, \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 16-5 PAGEID # 257.)

There is no argument, nor evidence demonstrating, that the payoff balance that Fifth Third provided to Ms. Bennett on May 1, 2017 was not an accurate payoff balance at the time that Fifth Third sent it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Fifth Third\n   complied with the requirements of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639g and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201026.36\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026.36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In an attempt to save its claim, the Larkins argue that agency principles should apply here to somehow qualify Fifth Third's foreclosure counsel as a \"creditor.\" The argument is contrary to TILA's plain language.

However, again, the statute and regulation at issue do not include agents. In\n   <em>\n    Chicago Title\n   </em>\n   , the court found that a title company was acting as an agent for another title company for purposes of issuing title-insurance policies where those companies had actually entered into an \"issuing-agent\" agreement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514397\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/507/\">\n    692 F.3d at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defendant title company \"enter[ed] an issuing-agent agreement with [other title company] that authorized [other title company] to issue title-insurance policies on [defendant title company's] behalf.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Here, there is no evidence of an agreement between Fifth Third and its foreclosure counsel for its foreclosure counsel to respond to consumers' payoff balance requests.

While Fifth Third's agreement to allow its foreclosure counsel to represent Fifth Third in foreclosure proceedings may qualify its counsel to be Fifth Third's agent for certain purposes, that agreement is not an agreement for its foreclosure counsel to accept and respond to payoff requests subject to TILA on Fifth Third's behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Langenfeld\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3666251\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/537/1181/#p1205\">\n    537 F.Supp.2d at 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (despite the definition of \"card issuer\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o) including both a person who issues a credit card\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the agent of such person, defendant law firm was not an agent for purposes of statute at issue where there was no agreement that the cardholder could use a line of credit with the alleged agent (law firm) to pay obligations incurred by using the credit card) (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   12 C.F.R., pt. 226, supp. I, official staff commentary, P2(a)(7) );\n   <em>\n    Neff v.

In fact, with respect to the payoff balance request, the Larkins and Fifth Third only communicated through their foreclosure counsel. The undisputed facts show that it was that process (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , making the request through foreclosure counsel during litigation) that caused delay beyond the April 24 to May 1 period that it took Fifth Third to receive the request and provide the payoff balance.

Thus, Fifth Third's foreclosure counsel sent the payoff balance eleven business days from April 19, 2017 -- the date on which the Larkins' foreclosure counsel sent the request to Fifth Third's foreclosure counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Fifth Third is a \"creditor,\" Fifth Third cannot necessarily control third parties. For example, in this case, it could not control: (a) where the Larkins' foreclosure counsel sent the payoff balance request; (b) how often its own foreclosure counsel checked its email accounts; and (c) whether the Larkins' attorney of record in the foreclosure action provided a correct mailing or email address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Under the circumstances, and given the fact that the request and response needed to make additional steps by traveling through intermediaries because of the foreclosure litigation, eleven business days was certainly a \"reasonable time\" to provide the payoff statement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Larkins do\n   not show otherwise, and no reasonable juror could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the Larkins are entitled to a verdict on their claim given the applicable law and evidence presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For this additional, independent reason, Fifth Third is entitled to summary judgment on the Larkins' claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
