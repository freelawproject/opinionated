The Inmate Observation Record Love filed with Love's complaint, if believed, indicates the Defendants checked on her semi-regularly throughout May 15, 2017 and into the morning of May 16, 2017, though not every ten minutes, as instructed. [R. 1-1.] Love went into labor sometime during May 15, 2017. Somehow, despite frequent looking-ins, Love was allowed to give birth, unassisted and without medical care, in her jail cell. [R. 9 at 6.] When Defendant Phillips entered Love's cell at approximately 8:04 a.m. on May 16, 2017, Love's blood covered the floor. Love had completed labor and delivered a child.

In addition, Love puts forth a new theory of liability under the Fourteenth Amendment, which she calls \"intentional decision.\" [R. 9 at 8.] With this Count, she urges this Court to adopt a new standard for pretrial detainee medical care claims based on\n   <em>\n    Kingsley.\n   </em>\n   The Defendants have moved for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).

Until recently, the extent of this right has been the same for pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners. To succeed on an action for deliberate indifference to medical needs, plaintiffs have been required to show: (i) an objectively substantial risk of serious harm, and (ii) that the jail or county officials were \"subjectively aware of the risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Harbin v. City of Detroit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1249340\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/147/566/#p570\">\n    147 F.

The Supreme Court, however, signaled in\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   that this universal test for both pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners' claims was misguided.\n   <em>\n    Kingsley v. Hendrickson\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590968\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2466/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590968\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2466/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The Court's holding suggests that pretrial detainees no longer need to prove that the defendant had actual knowledge to succeed on the second prong of the deliberate indifference test. Instead, a pretrial detainee need only show that the defendants \"recklessly failed to act with reasonable care to mitigate the risk that the condition posed to the pretrial detainee even though the defendant-official knew, or should have known, that the condition posed an excessive risk to health or safety.\"\n   <em>\n    Bruno v.

That is, a pretrial detainee-plaintiff can succeed by pointing only to objective facts and without proving the defendant's mindset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   concerned only a pretrial detainee's Fourth Amendment excessive force claim, its holding has implications on all pretrial detainee's claims. In\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   , the Court only required the pretrial detainee show that \"the force purposely or knowingly used against him was objectively unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590968\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2466/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To support a less stringent test, the Court cited: (i) precedent; (ii) workability; and (iii) the greater protections afforded by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590968\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2466/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These rationales extend to pretrial detainee claims for deliberate indifference. The court explains each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   First, precedent supports using an objective test for pretrial detainee's claim of deliberate indifference.\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   itself was not focused exclusively to excessive force precedent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590968\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2466/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To the contrary, the Court looked at challenges by pretrial detainees generally-identifying a challenge to double-bunking.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590968\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2466/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Only one conclusion can be drawn from the wide-net cast by the Court: its reasoning was not meant to be constrained to excessive force claims. Indeed, a challenge to double-bunking provides a closer analogue to a deliberate indifference claim than it does to an excessive force claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590968\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2466/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Unlike an excessive force claim, which focuses on the direct infliction of punishment, a conditions of confinement claim highlights the failure to provide a necessity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590968\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2466/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, deliberate indifference claims seek damages for a failure to provide something necessary: health care.\n   <em>\n    Richmond v.

Therefore, the Court's use of a pretrial double-bunking case supports an objective test for deliberate indifference to medical need claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Yet, this Court need not rely on simply reading the tea leaves of precedent. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   used broad language to convey its holding. Focusing on pretrial detainees generally, the Court reported that, to succeed, a pretrial detainee only needs to show that the government's actions were not \"rationally related to a legitimate nonpunitive government purpose\" or that the actions \"appear excessive in relation to that purpose.\" Such language cannot be mistaken;\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   is meant to apply to all pretrial detainees.\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. County of Lake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518199\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/335/#p351\">\n    900 F.3d 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 351 (7th Cir. 2018) ;\n   <em>\n    Castro v.

In addition, her complaint alleges \"[a]fter the defendants looked in [her] cell when it was obvious she was in labor, they notified Rogers of their observations,\" and \"Defendant Rogers ... [was] aware of how the other individual defendants responded to and trained FCRJ staff to respond to FCRJ inmates with medical emergencies and intentionally chose not to intervene.\" [R. 9 \u00b6\u00b6 22, 28.] A failure to train is not actionable. However, the allegation that the other individual defendants notified Rogers that Love was in labor, and that Rogers did nothing to intervene, when construed in a light most favorable to Love and taken as true, establishes that Rogers \"at least implicitly authorized, approved, or knowingly acquiesced in the unconstitutional conduct of\n   the offending officers.\"\n   <em>\n    Shehee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753216\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/295/#p300\">\n    199 F.3d at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The exception to that general rule, known as\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability, provides that a local government may be held liable where \"execution of a government's policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under \u00a7 1983.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p694\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a plaintiff must adequately plead (1) that a violation of a federal right took place, (2) that the defendants acted under color of state law, and (3) that a municipality's policy or custom caused that violation to happen.\"\n   <em>\n    Bright v.

Therefore, this claim will survive a motion to dismiss if Love pleads \"that a municipality's policy or custom caused that violation to happen.\"\n   <em>\n    Bright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5918695\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/639/#p660\">\n    753 F.3d at 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The amended complaint alleges that Franklin County and Defendant Rogers failed to adequately train, supervise, or discipline their employees. Specifically, Love alleges the Defendants were not trained on how to respond to medical emergencies among inmates. [R. 9, \u00b6 51-54.] Further, it alleges that Franklin County and Defendant Rogers's failure to train was so pronounced that it \"amounted to deliberate indifference that inaction would obviously result in the violation of the right to medical care or attention to medical needs.\" [R. 9, \u00b6 53.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This is a close call, but the Court finds that Love has adequately pleaded that there existed a custom within FCRJ such that \"inaction would obviously result\" when medical emergencies occurred. In\n   <em>\n    Leach v. Shelby County\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit found that a \"sheriff's failure to supervise and correct the situation in view of the numerous similar incidents and his failure subsequently to punish the responsible individuals is more than sufficient evidence of a policy or custom to render the County liable for Leach's damages.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537762\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1241/#p1248\">\n    891 F.2d 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1248 (6th Cir. 1989). Love has alleged both a complete lack of training and a failure to discipline FCRJ employees. Whether it's true training at FCRJ was really so inadequate that \"inaction would obviously result\" will certainly come to light in discovery or at trial. At this stage, Love is not required to prove her claim, only plead it. The Court finds that she has done so sufficiently enough to survive a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In the fifth and final count of the amended complaint, Love brings a claim of Kentucky common law negligence against all individual Defendants. [R. 9, \u00b6 56.] In Kentucky, to establish negligence, a plaintiff must demonstrate the existence of a duty, breach thereof, and consequent injury, which includes \"actual injury or harm to the plaintiff and legal causation between the defendant's breach and the plaintiff's injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Pathways, Inc. v. Hammons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096310\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/113/85/#p89\">\n    113 S.W.3d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89 (Ky. 2003) ;\n   <em>\n    Mullins v. Commonwealth Life Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9996875\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/839/245/#p247\">\n    839 S.W.2d 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 247 (Ky. 1992). Kentucky law \"imposes the duty on a jailer to exercise reasonable and ordinary care and diligence to prevent unlawful injury to a prisoner placed in his custody, but he cannot be charged with negligence in failing to prevent what he could not reasonably anticipate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Despite the fact that Love was incarcerated pending trial, completely dependent on employees of FCRJ for care, the Defendants actually argue that Love \"does not plead any facts that would allow this Court to determine if the Individual Defendants owed the Plaintiff a duty of care.\" [R. 10 at 13.] Their position is untenable. Kentucky law imposes a duty of care on the Individual Defendants by the nature of their relationship to Love. Love has pleaded, and the Defendants have not disputed, that she was a pretrial detainee and the Defendants were her jailers. [R. 9, \u00b6\u00b6 2-13.] These facts, taken as true, establish that Defendants owed a duty of care to Love.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In addition to duty, Love must also plead that there was breach of that duty, and a resulting injury. To do so successfully, Love must plead more than a \"formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court finds that she has done so. Love's amended complaint alleges that Defendants violated her Fourteenth Amendment rights because they knew she was pregnant, witnessed her undergoing labor and delivery, and failed to respond or obtain medical assistance. [R. 9, \u00b6\u00b6 14-32.] A factfinder could find that, based on these facts, the duty of care owed to Love was breached. The violation of her Fourteenth Amendment rights is the injury. Love satisfactorily pleads both of these elements in her amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    5\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Fifth and finally, the individual Defendants assert that they are entitled to qualified immunity as to all claims raised in Love's amended complaint. The Court has already established that Love has pleaded a violation of her Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   II.C.1-3,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   A right to medical treatment for a serious medical need has been established since at least 1987, and labor is a serious medical need.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. Roane Cty. Tennessee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065188\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/531/#p545\">\n    534 F.3d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 545 (6th Cir. 2008). Further, \"that labor is inherently risky is well known.\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson v. Corr. Med. Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5756721\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/583/522/\">\n    583 F.3d 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , n. 5 (8th Cir. 2009) (en banc). A pretrial detainee's right to medical treatment is clearly established, both generally and specifically as it relates to Love's condition: childbirth. Every reasonable officer knows he is under an obligation to obtain medical help for prisoners and pretrial detainees experiencing serious medical conditions. Accordingly the individual Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Therefore, and the Court being otherwise sufficiently advised, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   1.
