Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Doral Bank (\"Doral\") loaned the Mart\u00ednez defendants $ 180,000.00 to purchase a property in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. (Docket No. 8, Ex. 1.) The Mart\u00ednez defendants defaulted on the loan, prompting Doral to commence a foreclosure action in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance on August 26, 2014 (hereinafter the \"foreclosure action\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doral Bank v.

Subsequently, the Mart\u00ednez defendants answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims against Doral. (Docket No. 1 at p. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the foreclosure proceedings, the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions closed Doral and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC-R\") to serve as Doral's receiver.

The Mart\u00ednez defendants did not commence a lawsuit, nor did they continue the foreclosure action within the 60-day timeframe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Doral transferred the mortgage note for the Guaynabo property to Banco Cooperativo. (Docket No. 12, Ex. 2 at p. 5.)

The Court agrees. As the holder of the mortgage note, Banco Cooperativo's property interest is at stake in this action.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bouchard v. Winstar Mortg.

The timeliness of a motion to intervene is \"not measured, like a statute of limitations, in terms of specific units of time, but rather derives meaning from assessment of prejudice in the context of the particular litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    P.R.

The Mart\u00ednez defendants have made no attempt to advance their counterclaims against Doral or Banco Cooperativo. In fact, the final and only pleading filed by the Mart\u00ednez defendants is their July 2, 2015 motion to remand. (Docket No. 7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the FDIC-R is no longer the holder of the mortgage note, Banco Cooperativo cannot rely or expect that the FDIC-R will adequately represent its interests.
