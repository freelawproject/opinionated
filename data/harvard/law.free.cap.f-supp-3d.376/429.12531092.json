Richard Caputo, United States District Judge\n     This case raises the question of whether a public school can lawfully remove a student from an extracurricular activity for her profanity, transmitted off school grounds on a Saturday to fellow students. Plaintiff B.L., a student at Mahanoy Area High School, was dismissed from the cheerleading squad for uttering \"fuck school, fuck softball, fuck cheer, fuck everything\" off school grounds on a Saturday. I hold that B.L.'s words were constitutionally protected by the First Amendment.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-9\">\n     Indeed, I granted B.L.'s motion for a preliminary injunction for this reason and suggested that holding otherwise would \"allow school children to serve as Thought Police-reporting every profanity uttered-for the District.\"\n     <em>\n      B.L. by Levy v. Mahanoy Area Sch. Dist.\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523303\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/607/#p613\">\n      289 F.Supp.3d 607\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 613 (M.D. Pa. 2017). The District now proffers one Dr. Mussoline as an expert, and moves for summary judgment on the ground that the undisputed evidence gathered since the preliminary injunction hearing proves the District did not violate B.L.'s rights. B.L. cross-moves for summary judgment, arguing just the opposite; B.L. also moves to oust Dr. Mussoline. All three motions are presently before me. Because the undisputed evidence shows the District violated B.L.'s rights, her motion for summary judgment will be granted. The District's motion will accordingly be denied, and B.L.'s motion to exclude the expert report and testimony of Dr. Mussoline will be denied as moot.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-10\">\n     <strong>\n      I. Background\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     Both sides agree on the facts. The Mahanoy Area School District is located in Mahanoy City, a small borough in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. (Doc. 40 at \u00b6 5 (Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Facts) ). B.L. is a junior at Mahanoy Area High School, which is a part of the District. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 2).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-12\">\n     In her freshman year, B.L. joined the junior varsity cheerleading squad led by Coaches Nicole Luchetta-Rump (a math teacher at the High School) and April Gnall (a third-grade teacher in the District). (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6\u00b6 6-9). The squad held tryouts for the next school year in May of B.L.'s freshman year. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 12). Before she could try out, however, B.L. was required to agree to a number of rules that would apply to her if she made the squad again. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6\u00b6 16-23). These rules-the \"Cheerleading Rules\" or \"Rules\"-state: \"Please have respect for your school, coaches, teachers, other cheerleaders and teams. Remember you are representing your school when at games, fundraisers, and other events. Good sportsmanship will be enforced, this includes foul language and inappropriate gestures.\" (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 19 (the \"Respect Provision\") ). The Rules also warn: \"There will be no toleration of any negative information regarding cheerleading, cheerleaders, or coaches placed on the internet.\" (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 23 (the \"Negative Information Rule\") ). Coaches Luchetta-Rump and Gnall adopted these Rules from their predecessor, and did not need the District's permission to adopt or enforce them. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6\u00b6 15, 24, 45).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-13\">\n     B.L. and her mother reviewed the Rules prior to tryouts, and signed a document acknowledging B.L. would be bound by them. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 18). Unfortunately for B.L.,\n     tryouts did not go so well-she was placed on the junior varsity squad again for her sophomore year. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 34). And, to add insult to injury, an incoming freshman made the varsity squad. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 35).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-14\">\n     In frustration, B.L. took to Snapchat that Saturday. (\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6\u00b6 37, 40). (Snapchat is a social media application for smartphones that allows users to send private text, photo, and video messages to other users-but these messages are limited in duration, cannot be accessed from the web, and can only be viewed temporarily,\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      B.L. by Levy v. Mahanoy Area Sch. Dist.\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523303\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/607/#p613\">\n      289 F.Supp.3d 607\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 610 n.1 (M.D. Pa. 2017) ). Posing in street clothes with a friend, middle fingers raised, B.L. took a \"selfie\" at the Cocoa Hut, a local store and student stomping ground. (\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6\u00b6 37-40). On top of the photo, B.L. added the following text: \"fuck school fuck softball fuck cheer fuck everything.\" (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     ). B.L. then posted the captioned photo-the \"Snap\"-on her private Snapchat account, where it could have been viewed briefly by about two-hundred and fifty (250) of her friends. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6\u00b6 37-42). She posted a follow-up Snap just after, reading: \"Love how me and [my friend] get told we need a year of jv before we make varsity but that[ ] doesn't matter to anyone else?\" (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 41). Many of B.L.'s friends on Snapchat are students at District schools; some are fellow cheerleaders. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6\u00b6 42-43).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-15\">\n     One of those cheerleaders, Coach Gnall's daughter, came across the Snaps, took screen shots of them (as they were not publicly viewable), and brought them to the coaches' attention. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 43). Meanwhile, with the weekend now over, word of B.L.'s Snaps spread through the school. (\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6\u00b6 57-60). Several students, \"both cheerleaders and non-cheerleaders[,] approached Coach Luchetta-Rump to express their concerns that the Snaps were inappropriate.\" (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 59). \"Students were visibly upset and voiced their concerns to [Coach] Luchetta-Rump repeatedly for several days.\" (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 60). Accordingly, \"Coaches Gnall and Luchetta-Rump jointly decided to suspend B.L. from the cheerleading team for one year for violating the Cheerleading Rules by posting the offensive Snaps.\" (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 44). Specifically, \"B.L. was disciplined for violating the Respect Provision and the Negative Information Rule of the Cheerleading Rules....\" (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 57). Even though electronic squabbling amongst cheerleaders at the High School \"is a fairly typical occurrence,\" the coaches felt the need to enforce the Rules against B.L. \"to 'avoid chaos' and maintain a 'team-like environment.' \" (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6\u00b6 55-56). \"The cheerleading coaches would not have suspended B.L. from the team if her Snaps had not referenced cheerleading,\" though. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 58).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-16\">\n     B.L.'s father appealed to the School Board, but the Board declined to get involved. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 49-51). Accordingly, B.L., through her parents, filed suit against the District for declaratory and injunctive relief. (\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Doc. 1; Doc. 33-1 (giving up her claim for damages) ). B.L. contemporaneously filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction (Doc. 2); I granted the TRO pending resolution of the preliminary injunction motion (Doc. 5). After holding a hearing, I issued a preliminary injunction, finding that, among other things, B.L. was likely to succeed on the merits.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      B.L. by Levy v.

The District subsequently answered the complaint (Doc. 16), discovery ensued, and both sides have moved for summary judgment. (Docs. 33, 37). B.L. also moves to exclude the expert report and testimony of Dr. Lawrence J. Mussoline, whom the District retained to opine on a number of matters related to cheerleading, school discipline, and sports teams.

In other words, if a student challenges her school's punishment as excessive, the rubric of Due Process might be more appropriate in resolving that claim. In that case, it would be relevant that the law recognizes a student's property interest in public education but not in participation in extracurricular activities.\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <em>\n      Dominic J. v.

The District argues its punishment was permissible (and, conversely, that B.L.'s speech was unprotected) for three reasons: first, as a threshold matter, schools can punish students for off-campus speech, (Doc. 38 at 11-12); second,\n     <em>\n      Tinker\n     </em>\n     allows schools to punish student speech that has the potential to disrupt an athletic team, and speech that, in the absence of punishment, would likely result in \"substantial disruption of the [school's] educational mission,\" (\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     at 15; Doc. 51 at 12-17); and third,\n     <em>\n      Fraser\n     </em>\n     permitted the District's discipline, (Doc. 38 at 21-26). B.L. counters that her speech caused no substantial disruption and was thus protected under\n     <em>\n      Tinker\n     </em>\n     , and that\n     <em>\n      Fraser\n     </em>\n     cannot apply to off-campus speech. (Doc. 49 at 12-23).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-48\">\n     The District's concession that B.L.'s speech occurred off-campus is all but fatal. The Third Circuit held in\n     <em>\n      J.S. ex rel. Snyder v. Blue Mountain School District\n     </em>\n     that a school cannot punish a student for off-campus speech that is merely profane.\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5875087\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/915/#p920\">\n      650 F.3d 915\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 932-33 (3d Cir. 2011) (en banc).

B.L. \"spoke,\" through Snapchat, in street clothes, at the Cocoa Hut, on a Saturday; the District does not and cannot claim that constitutes on-campus speech.

To the extent the District argues\n     <em>\n      Kuhlmeier\n     </em>\n     justifies its discipline because profanity conflicts with the coaches' legitimate pedagogical concerns, the District has not produced any evidence that B.L.'s speech bore the imprimatur of the school or the squad, or that a reasonable observer would so conclude. A passing reference to cheerleading on B.L.'s private social media account does not equate to an imprimatur.\n     <em>\n      Cf.\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Morse v.

True, Coach Luchetta-Rump raised the specter of potential \"chaos.\" (Doc. 40-13 at 32:4-22). But her understanding of \"chaos\" is at odds with the \"substantial disruption\" standard. The only prior example of \"chaos\" Coach Luchetta-Rump could give (which again, she described as a \"fairly typical occurrence\") was a situation where one cheerleader texted another \"something mean,\" so she spoke with both of them to \"put the fire out\" without resorting to punishment. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 32:4-22). And the only other time the \"Negative Information Rule\" was enforced was against Coach Gnall's own daughter, who was suspended from a few games for speaking ill of a rival school's cheerleading uniforms online-without any finding of actual or likely disruption. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 30:9-25; 31:1-19). Thus, even viewing Coach Luchetta-Rump's talismanic incantation of chaos in the light most favorable to the District,\n     <em>\n      Tinker\n     </em>\n     remains unsatisfied. \"Undifferentiated fear or remote apprehension of disturbance\" does not suffice.\n     <em>\n      Sypniewski v.

The vague similarity of B.L.'s Snaps to speech that caused little disruption in the past is no ground for predicting substantial disruption in the future. Moreover, Coach Luchetta-Rump testified, at both the preliminary injunction hearing and at her deposition, that she punished B.L. for profanely referencing cheerleading, not because of any possibility of disruption. (\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Doc. 40-13 at 47:2-11; 53:10-24; 62:8-11).

The District cannot sidestep these admissions and have me theorize what a reasonable coach could have concluded about B.L.'s speech. B.L.'s mere off-campus profanity is what upset Coach Luchetta-Rump, not the potential for chaos about which the District's evidence, at best, raises \"metaphysical doubt.\"\n     <em>\n      Chavarriaga v.

I need not weigh in on that question, though. The undisputed evidence shows that neither of these standards has been met, so B.L.'s speech was protected. Accordingly, the District violated B.L.'s rights when Coach Luchetta-Rump dismissed her from the cheerleading squad. And because B.L. concedes all the relief she seeks can be granted on this basis alone, I decline to address her alternative arguments regarding the Cheerleading Rules' vagueness or viewpoint discrimination.

But the fact is that Dr. Mussoline's testimony and report would not save the District from summary judgment even if I had considered it.
