Richard Caputo, United States District Judge <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"432\" href=\"#p432\" id=\"p432\">*432</a>This case raises the question of whether a public school can lawfully remove a student from an extracurricular activity for her profanity, transmitted off school grounds on a Saturday to fellow students. Plaintiff B.L., a student at Mahanoy Area High School, was dismissed from the cheerleading squad for uttering \"fuck school, fuck softball, fuck cheer, fuck everything\" off school grounds on a Saturday. I hold that B.L.'s words were constitutionally protected by the First Amendment.</p><p id=\"p-9\">Indeed, I granted B.L.'s motion for a preliminary injunction for this reason and suggested that holding otherwise would \"allow school children to serve as Thought Police-reporting every profanity uttered-for the District.\" <em>B.L. by Levy v. Mahanoy Area Sch. Dist.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523303\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/607/#p613\">289 F.Supp.3d 607</extracted-citation>, 613 (M.D. Pa. 2017). The District now proffers one Dr. Mussoline as an expert, and moves for summary judgment on the ground that the undisputed evidence gathered since the preliminary injunction hearing proves the District did not violate B.L.'s rights. B.L. cross-moves for summary judgment, arguing just the opposite; B.L. also moves to oust Dr. Mussoline. All three motions are presently before me. Because the undisputed evidence shows the District violated B.L.'s rights, her motion for summary judgment will be granted. The District's motion will accordingly be denied, and B.L.'s motion to exclude the expert report and testimony of Dr. Mussoline will be denied as moot.</p><p id=\"p-10\"><strong>I. Background</strong></p><p id=\"p-11\">Both sides agree on the facts. The Mahanoy Area School District is located in Mahanoy City, a small borough in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. (Doc. 40 at \u00b6 5 (Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Facts) ). B.L. is a junior at Mahanoy Area High School, which is a part of the District. (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6 2).</p><p id=\"p-12\">In her freshman year, B.L. joined the junior varsity cheerleading squad led by Coaches Nicole Luchetta-Rump (a math teacher at the High School) and April Gnall (a third-grade teacher in the District). (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 6-9). The squad held tryouts for the next school year in May of B.L.'s freshman year. (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6 12). Before she could try out, however, B.L. was required to agree to a number of rules that would apply to her if she made the squad again. (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 16-23). These rules-the \"Cheerleading Rules\" or \"Rules\"-state: \"Please have respect for your school, coaches, teachers, other cheerleaders and teams. Remember you are representing your school when at games, fundraisers, and other events. Good sportsmanship will be enforced, this includes foul language and inappropriate gestures.\" (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6 19 (the \"Respect Provision\") ). The Rules also warn: \"There will be no toleration of any negative information regarding cheerleading, cheerleaders, or coaches placed on the internet.\" (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6 23 (the \"Negative Information Rule\") ). Coaches Luchetta-Rump and Gnall adopted these Rules from their predecessor, and did not need the District's permission to adopt or enforce them. (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 15, 24, 45).</p><p id=\"p-13\">B.L. and her mother reviewed the Rules prior to tryouts, and signed a document acknowledging B.L. would be bound by them. (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6 18). Unfortunately for B.L., <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"433\" href=\"#p433\" id=\"p433\">*433</a>tryouts did not go so well-she was placed on the junior varsity squad again for her sophomore year. (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6 34). And, to add insult to injury, an incoming freshman made the varsity squad. (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6 35).</p><p id=\"p-14\">In frustration, B.L. took to Snapchat that Saturday. (<em>See</em> <em>id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 37, 40). (Snapchat is a social media application for smartphones that allows users to send private text, photo, and video messages to other users-but these messages are limited in duration, cannot be accessed from the web, and can only be viewed temporarily, <em>see</em> <em>B.L. by Levy v. Mahanoy Area Sch. Dist.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523303\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/607/#p613\">289 F.Supp.3d 607</extracted-citation>, 610 n.1 (M.D. Pa. 2017) ). Posing in street clothes with a friend, middle fingers raised, B.L. took a \"selfie\" at the Cocoa Hut, a local store and student stomping ground. (<em>See</em> <em>id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 37-40). On top of the photo, B.L. added the following text: \"fuck school fuck softball fuck cheer fuck everything.\" (<em>Id.</em> ). B.L. then posted the captioned photo-the \"Snap\"-on her private Snapchat account, where it could have been viewed briefly by about two-hundred and fifty (250) of her friends. (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 37-42). She posted a follow-up Snap just after, reading: \"Love how me and [my friend] get told we need a year of jv before we make varsity but that[ ] doesn't matter to anyone else?\" (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6 41). Many of B.L.'s friends on Snapchat are students at District schools; some are fellow cheerleaders. (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 42-43).</p><p id=\"p-15\">One of those cheerleaders, Coach Gnall's daughter, came across the Snaps, took screen shots of them (as they were not publicly viewable), and brought them to the coaches' attention. (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6 43). Meanwhile, with the weekend now over, word of B.L.'s Snaps spread through the school. (<em>See</em> <em>id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 57-60). Several students, \"both cheerleaders and non-cheerleaders[,] approached Coach Luchetta-Rump to express their concerns that the Snaps were inappropriate.\" (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6 59). \"Students were visibly upset and voiced their concerns to [Coach] Luchetta-Rump repeatedly for several days.\" (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6 60). Accordingly, \"Coaches Gnall and Luchetta-Rump jointly decided to suspend B.L. from the cheerleading team for one year for violating the Cheerleading Rules by posting the offensive Snaps.\" (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6 44). Specifically, \"B.L. was disciplined for violating the Respect Provision and the Negative Information Rule of the Cheerleading Rules....\" (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6 57). Even though electronic squabbling amongst cheerleaders at the High School \"is a fairly typical occurrence,\" the coaches felt the need to enforce the Rules against B.L. \"to 'avoid chaos' and maintain a 'team-like environment.' \" (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 55-56). \"The cheerleading coaches would not have suspended B.L. from the team if her Snaps had not referenced cheerleading,\" though. (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6 58).</p><p id=\"p-16\">B.L.'s father appealed to the School Board, but the Board declined to get involved. (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6 49-51). Accordingly, B.L., through her parents, filed suit against the District for declaratory and injunctive relief. (<em>See</em> Doc. 1; Doc. 33-1 (giving up her claim for damages) ). B.L. contemporaneously filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction (Doc. 2); I granted the TRO pending resolution of the preliminary injunction motion (Doc. 5). After holding a hearing, I issued a preliminary injunction, finding that, among other things, B.L. was likely to succeed on the merits. <em>See</em> <em>B.L. by Levy v. Mahanoy Area Sch. Dist.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523303\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/607/#p613\">289 F.Supp.3d 607</extracted-citation> (M.D. Pa. 2017). The District subsequently answered the complaint (Doc. 16), discovery ensued, and both sides have moved for summary judgment. (Docs. 33, 37). B.L. also moves to exclude the expert report and testimony of Dr. Lawrence J. Mussoline, whom the District retained to opine on a number of matters related to cheerleading, school discipline, and sports teams.

Des Moines Independent Community School District</em> that public school students do not shed their speech rights at the \"schoolhouse <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"435\" href=\"#p435\" id=\"p435\">*435</a>gate.\" <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p506\">393 U.S. 503</extracted-citation>, 506, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p506\">89 S.Ct. 733</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p506\">21 L.Ed.2d 731</extracted-citation> (1969). The plaintiffs in that case, students who wore black armbands to protest the Vietnam War, were suspended by their school after ignoring its ban on the armbands. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p506\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p506\"> at 504</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p506\">89 S.Ct. 733</extracted-citation>. The Court held the school violated the students' First Amendment rights because the students' expression did not \"materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school,\" and because school officials did not reasonably forecast such disruption. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p506\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p506\"> at 513</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p506\">89 S.Ct. 733</extracted-citation>. <em>Tinker</em> thus sets the baseline for what student speech is protected: anything that does not, or in the view of reasonable school officials, will not cause material and substantial disruption at school. Later cases set out exceptions to this broad dictate.</p><p id=\"p-27\"><em>Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">484 U.S. 260</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">108 S.Ct. 562</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">98 L.Ed.2d 592</extracted-citation> (1988) established the next <em>Tinker</em> exception. In <em>Kuhlmeier</em> , the Court held that schools may \"exercis[e] editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities so long as [its] actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\"> at 273</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">108 S.Ct. 562</extracted-citation>. Under the <em>Kuhlmeier</em> exception, schools \"are entitled to exercise greater control\" over \"school-sponsored ... expressive activities that students, parents, and members of the public might reasonably believe to bear the imprimatur of the school.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\"> at 270-21</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">108 S.Ct. 562</extracted-citation>. Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Marshall and Blackmun, criticized the majority opinion for \"abandoning <em>Tinker</em> ,\" creating a new \"distinction between personal and school-sponsored speech,\" and relying on \"the school's pedagogical message\" as a \"constitutionally sufficient justification for the suppression of student speech.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\"> at 280, 282</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">108 S.Ct. 562</extracted-citation> (Brennan, J., dissenting). It appears that of the Court's student speech precedents, only <em>Kuhlmeier</em> holds a court can balance a student's speech against \"legitimate pedagogical concerns;\" however, this balancing is limited to situations in which a reasonable observer would conclude the speech is essentially that of the school itself. <em>See</em> <em>Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p834\">515 U.S. 819</extracted-citation>, 834, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p834\">115 S.Ct. 2510</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p834\">132 L.Ed.2d 700</extracted-citation> (1995).</p><p id=\"p-29\">Under the Supreme Court's student speech precedents, there are thus four rules: (1) \"Under <em>Fraser</em> , a school may categorically prohibit lewd, vulgar or profane language[;]\" (2) \"Under [ <em>Kuhlmeier</em> ], a school may regulate school-sponsored speech ... on the basis of any legitimate pedagogical concern[;]\" (3) Under <em>Morse</em> , a school may categorically prohibit speech that can reasonably be regarded as encouraging illegal drug use; and (4) \"Speech falling outside of these categories is subject to <em>Tinker</em> 's general rule: it may be regulated only if it would substantially disrupt school operations or interfere with the right of others.\" <em>Saxe v. State Coll. Area Sch.

In <em>J.S. ex rel. Snyder v. Blue Mountain School District</em> and <em>Layshock ex rel. Layshock v. Hermitage School District</em> , students were suspended for creating websites that lampooned school officials using vulgar language. <em>See</em> <em>J.S. ex rel. Snyder</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5875087\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/915/#p920\">650 F.3d 915</extracted-citation>, 920-22 (3d Cir. 2011) (en banc); <em>Layshock ex rel.

In decisions handed down the same day, the Third Circuit held that (1) student speech uttered off-campus is not rendered \"on-campus speech\" simply because it eventually reaches inside the school; (2) <em>Fraser</em> is inapplicable to off-campus speech; and (3) <em>Tinker</em> might apply to off-campus speech. <em>See</em> <em>J.S. ex rel. Snyder</em> , 650 F.3d at 926, 930-32 ; <em>Layshock ex rel. Layshock</em> , 650 F.3d at 215-19.</p><p id=\"p-31\">With this background in mind, I turn to the applicable legal framework and the parties' arguments. It is not clear if student speech claims are meant to be addressed under the three-step First Amendment retaliation framework. <em>Compare</em> <em>Monn v. Gettsyburg Area Sch.

If, on the undisputed facts, B.L.'s speech was unprotected, then the District's motion for summary judgment must be granted; however, if B.L.'s speech was protected, then her motion for summary judgment will prevail.</p><p id=\"p-33\"><strong>B.</strong></p><p id=\"p-34\">I need to clear away some argumentative brush before getting to the root of the dispute, though. The District first argues that B.L. waived her First Amendment rights when she joined the cheerleading squad. (Doc. 55 at 10-12). The District maintains that both B.L. and her mother voluntarily waived B.L.'s First Amendment rights by signing the \"Application for Cheerleading Tryouts\" (which conditioned participation on abiding by the Cheerleading Rules). (<em>Id.</em> ). B.L. responds that there is no evidence to support a finding of waiver, and regardless, the District cannot condition extracurricular participation on a waiver of constitutional rights. (Doc. 49 at 27-30).</p><p id=\"p-35\">The District has not produced sufficient evidence that B.L. waived her speech rights. Courts must \"indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights.\" <em>Johnson v. Zerbst</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10805\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/458/#p464\">304 U.S. 458</extracted-citation>, 464, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10805\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/458/#p464\">58 S.Ct. 1019</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10805\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/458/#p464\">82 L.Ed. 1461</extracted-citation> (1938) (quotation omitted). The voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of one's First Amendment rights must be shown by \"clear and compelling\" evidence. <em>Curtis Publ'g Co. v.

There is no evidence that any of these factors is present here: neither B.L. nor her mother had bargaining equality with the coaches or the school; the Cheerleading Rules were not subject to negotiation; and B.L. and her mother were not represented by counsel when they agreed B.L. would abide by the Rules. Additionally, conditioning extracurricular participation on a waiver of a constitutional right is coercive. <em>See</em> <em>Moran v. Burbine</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204292\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/412/#p421\">475 U.S. 412</extracted-citation>, 421, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204292\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/412/#p421\">106 S.Ct. 1135</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204292\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/412/#p421\">89 L.Ed.2d 410</extracted-citation> (1986) (waiver is involuntary if it is coerced); <em>cf.</em></p><p id=\"p-36\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"438\" href=\"#p438\" id=\"p438\">*438</a><em>Capua v.

B.L. did not, therefore, waive her First Amendment rights.</p><p id=\"p-37\">Next, the District contends that it cannot be liable because the coaches' actions are not vicariously attributable to it, <em>see</em> <em>Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. of City of New York</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p690\">436 U.S. 658</extracted-citation>, 690-91, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p690\">98 S.Ct. 2018</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p690\">56 L.Ed.2d 611</extracted-citation> (1978). (Doc. 51 at 23-26). B.L. has not shown, the District argues, that, consistent with the rule established in <em>Monell</em> , the District \"implement[ed] an official policy, practice or custom\" that violated B.L.'s constitutional rights. <em>Losch v. Borough of Parkesburg, Pa.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"587701\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/736/903/#p910\">736 F.2d 903</extracted-citation>, 910 (3d Cir. 1984) (citation omitted). This argument can be dismissed out of hand because the District admits it \"approved or ratified\" the Cheerleading Rules pursuant to which B.L. was punished, (Doc. 16 at \u00b6 18), and delegated its authority over the cheerleading team to Coaches Luchetta-Rump and Gnall, (<em>see, e.g.</em> , Doc. 40 at \u00b6 45 (\"The cheerleading coaches did not need-and did not receive-authorization from [the District] to suspend B.L. from the team.\"); <em>id</em> . \u00b6 51 (\"The School Board decided that it should not get involved in the minutiae of extracurricular activities, and that coaches must be permitted to hold students accountable for their actions.\") ). <em>See</em> <em>Seamons v.

(Doc. 38 at 16-20; Doc. 55 at 4-7). In response, B.L. argues that whether she has a constitutional right to participate in extracurricular activities or whether her coaches' sanction was \"harsh enough\" is irrelevant to First Amendment analysis. (Doc. 34 at 19-20; Doc. 49 at 23).</p><p id=\"p-39\">I agree with B.L. What the District's argument does is put the constitutional cart before the horse. The court in <em>Johnson v. Cache County School District</em> (which the District relies on) made the same mistake. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526508\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/323/1301/#p1321\">323 F.Supp.3d 1301</extracted-citation>, 1321 (D. Utah 2018) (\"The court finds the cases recognizing the distinction between school suspension and participation in an extracurricular activity to be more persuasive given that there is no constitutional right to participate in an extracurricular activity.\"). The issue with this reasoning, which assumes all student athlete speech is <em>ipso facto</em> less protected, <em>see</em> <em>Lowery v. Euverard</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3617923\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/497/584/#p605\">497 F.3d 584</extracted-citation>, 605 (6th Cir. 2007) (Gilman, J., concurring in the judgment) is two-fold: it muddies the First Amendment analysis, and conflates it with Due Process analysis.</p><p id=\"p-40\">As to the first point, the threshold inquiry under standard First Amendment analysis is whether speech is protected-considering the speech at issue and the context in which it was uttered. <em>See</em> <em>Rauser v. Horn</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136966\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/330/#p333\">241 F.3d 330</extracted-citation>, 333 (3d Cir. 2001). Take <em>Tinker</em> , for example. Student speech that would not materially disrupt school or invade the rights of others is protected. <em>Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch.

The <em>Doninger</em> court, <em>after</em> holding the student's speech likely unprotected under <em>Tinker</em> , noted that \"given the <em>posture</em> of th[e] case,\" it \"ha[d] no occasion to consider <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"440\" href=\"#p440\" id=\"p440\">*440</a>whether a different, more serious consequence than disqualification from student office would raise constitutional concerns.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566779\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/41/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566779\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/41/\"> at 53</extracted-citation> (emphasis added). For that proposition, <em>Doninger</em> cited <em>Wisniewski v. Board of Education of the Weedsport Central School District</em> , which in turn declined to decide whether the First Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment would apply to a \"distinct challenge to the extent of the [school's] discipline\" for a student's speech. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047066\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/34/#p40\">494 F.3d 34</extracted-citation>, 40 (2d Cir. 2007) (citing <em>Graham v.

In other words, if a student challenges her school's punishment as excessive, the rubric of Due Process might be more appropriate in resolving that claim. In that case, it would be relevant that the law recognizes a student's property interest in public education but not in participation in extracurricular activities. <em>See, e.g.</em> , <em>Dominic J. v. Wyoming Valley W. High Sch.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9014587\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/362/560/#p572\">362 F.Supp.2d 560</extracted-citation>, 572 (M.D. Pa. 2005). But just as in <em>Doninger</em> , B.L. is not mounting that sort of challenge, so First Amendment standards apply.</p><p id=\"p-43\">And the Third Circuit has made the applicable standard clear: a public school's \"punishment\" for a student's protected expression opens the courthouse doors. <em>Walker-Serrano ex rel. Walker v. Leonard</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9345944\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/412/#p419\">325 F.3d 412</extracted-citation>, 419 (3d Cir. 2003). Accordingly, students have been found likely to succeed in First Amendment challenges to seemingly minor discipline. <em>See, e.g.</em> , <em>K.A. ex rel. Ayers v. Pocono Mountain Sch. Dist.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3550679\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/99/#p102\">710 F.3d 99</extracted-citation>, 102 (3d Cir. 2013) (upholding preliminary injunction against school that denied the plaintiff's request to \"distribut[e] invitations to her classmates to a Christmas party at her church\"). If telling a student \"Don't distribute invitations\" can be unconstitutional, surely kicking a student off the team can be too-as the Ninth and Tenth Circuits implicitly hold. <em>See</em> <em>Pinard v. Clatskanie Sch. Dist. 6J</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3806185\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/755/#p770\">467 F.3d 755</extracted-citation>, 771 (9th Cir. 2006) (remanding for a determination as to whether the coach's \"decision to suspend [the plaintiffs] permanently from the team\" was motivated by the plaintiffs' protected speech); <em>Seamons v.

The dicta from <em>Doninger</em> and <em>Wisniewski</em> regarding Due Process do not imply a school's punishment must exceed removal from an extracurricular activity in order to offend the First Amendment. In fact, the Second Circuit expressly rejected that implication later in the <em>Doninger</em> litigation. <em>Doninger v. Niehoff</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383268\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/334/#p351\">642 F.3d 334</extracted-citation>, 351 (2d Cir. 2011) (\"To be clear, we do not conclude in any way that school administrators are immune from First Amendment scrutiny when they react to student speech by limiting students' participation in extracurricular activities.\"). Even the Sixth and Eighth Circuits, while noting that dismissal from an extracurricular activity does not impact a student's \"regular education,\" did not go so far as holding such dismissal unactionable. <em>See</em> <em>Lowery v. Euverard</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3617923\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/497/584/#p605\">497 F.3d 584</extracted-citation>, 600-01 (6th Cir. 2007) (holding the plaintiffs' speech unprotected under <em>Tinker</em> ); <em>Wildman ex rel.

The District argues its punishment was permissible (and, conversely, that B.L.'s speech was unprotected) for three reasons: first, as a threshold matter, schools can punish students for off-campus speech, (Doc. 38 at 11-12); second, <em>Tinker</em> allows schools to punish student speech that has the potential to disrupt an athletic team, and speech that, in the absence of punishment, would likely result in \"substantial disruption of the [school's] educational mission,\" (<em>id.</em> at 15; Doc. 51 at 12-17); and third, <em>Fraser</em> permitted the District's discipline, (Doc. 38 at 21-26). B.L. counters that her speech caused no substantial disruption and was thus protected under <em>Tinker</em> , and that <em>Fraser</em> cannot apply to off-campus speech. (Doc. 49 at 12-23).</p><p id=\"p-48\">The District's concession that B.L.'s speech occurred off-campus is all but fatal. The Third Circuit held in <em>J.S. ex rel. Snyder v. Blue Mountain School District</em> that a school cannot punish a student for off-campus speech that is merely profane. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5875087\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/915/#p920\">650 F.3d 915</extracted-citation>, 932-33 (3d Cir. 2011) (en banc). The <em>Fraser</em> exception to <em>Tinker</em> , the Third Circuit explained, \"cannot be extended to justify a school's punishment ... for use of profane language outside the school, during non-school hours.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"5875087\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/915/#p920\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"5875087\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/915/#p920\"> at 932</extracted-citation> (footnote omitted). In so holding, the Third Circuit rejected the school's argument that the student's speech was punishable because it was \"lewd, vulgar, and offensive [and] <em>had an effect on the school and the educational mission of the District.</em> \" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"5875087\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/915/#p920\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> (emphasis added).</p><p id=\"p-49\"><em>J.S. ex rel. Snyder</em> thus forecloses nearly all the District's arguments. <em>Fraser</em> cannot <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"442\" href=\"#p442\" id=\"p442\">*442</a>justify its punishment. B.L. \"spoke,\" through Snapchat, in street clothes, at the Cocoa Hut, on a Saturday; the District does not and cannot claim that constitutes on-campus speech. Nor can <em>Tinker</em> justify the District's punishment, even if the District rephrases its concern as \"disruption of the educational mission\" of the team or the school. As Justice Brennan made clear in his <em>Kuhlmeier</em> dissent, <em>Tinker</em> is not concerned with the disruption of a school's educational mission. <em>See</em> <em>Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">484 U.S. 260</extracted-citation>, 280-82, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">108 S.Ct. 562</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">98 L.Ed.2d 592</extracted-citation> (1988) (Brennan, J., dissenting). Moreover, a school cannot circumvent <em>Tinker</em> , <em>Fraser</em> , and <em>J.S. ex rel.

Snyder</em> , 650 F.3d at 932 (implicitly rejecting this argument); <em>see also</em> <em>Morse v.

High school athletics are not reserved for the popular and the unfailingly polite.</p><p id=\"p-52\">On the other hand, a coach would have a legitimate interest in regulating student athlete speech that bears the imprimatur of the team or the school. <em>See</em> <em>Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">484 U.S. 260</extracted-citation>, 271-73, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">108 S.Ct. 562</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">98 L.Ed.2d 592</extracted-citation> (1988). It is unclear to me, though, how a student athlete's off-the-field speech bears such an imprimatur, or how athletics constitute the sort of \"vehicle[s] of student expression\" <em>Kuhlmeier</em> was concerned with. <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\"> at 273</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/\">108 S.Ct. 562</extracted-citation>. To the extent the District argues <em>Kuhlmeier</em> justifies its discipline because profanity conflicts with the coaches' legitimate pedagogical concerns, the District has not produced any evidence that B.L.'s speech bore the imprimatur of the school or the squad, or that a reasonable observer would so conclude. A passing reference to cheerleading on B.L.'s private social media account does not equate to an imprimatur. <em>Cf.</em> <em>Morse v.

True, Coach Luchetta-Rump raised the specter of potential \"chaos.\" (Doc. 40-13 at 32:4-22). But her understanding of \"chaos\" is at odds with the \"substantial disruption\" standard. The only prior example of \"chaos\" Coach Luchetta-Rump could give (which again, she described as a \"fairly typical occurrence\") was a situation where one cheerleader texted another \"something mean,\" so she spoke with both of them to \"put the fire out\" without resorting to punishment. (<em>Id.</em> at 32:4-22). And the only other time the \"Negative Information Rule\" was enforced was against Coach Gnall's own daughter, who was suspended from a few games for speaking ill of a rival school's cheerleading uniforms online-without any finding of actual or likely disruption. (<em>Id.</em> at 30:9-25; 31:1-19). Thus, even viewing Coach Luchetta-Rump's talismanic incantation of chaos in the light most favorable to the District, <em>Tinker</em> remains unsatisfied. \"Undifferentiated fear or remote apprehension of disturbance\" does not suffice. <em>Sypniewski v.

The vague similarity of B.L.'s Snaps to speech that caused little disruption in the past is no ground for predicting substantial disruption in the future. Moreover, Coach Luchetta-Rump testified, at both the preliminary injunction hearing and at her deposition, that she punished B.L. for profanely referencing cheerleading, not because of any possibility of disruption. (<em>See</em> Doc. 40-13 at 47:2-11; 53:10-24; 62:8-11). She would have punished B.L.-under the same Rules-if B.L.'s Snap read: \"Cheerleading is fucking awesome.\" (<em>Id.</em> at 47:7-11). The District cannot sidestep these admissions and have me theorize what a reasonable coach could have concluded about B.L.'s speech. B.L.'s mere off-campus profanity is what upset Coach Luchetta-Rump, not the potential for chaos about which the District's evidence, at best, raises \"metaphysical doubt.\" <em>Chavarriaga v. N.J.

I need not weigh in on that question, though. The undisputed evidence shows that neither of these standards has been met, so B.L.'s speech was protected. Accordingly, the District violated B.L.'s rights when Coach Luchetta-Rump dismissed her from the cheerleading squad. And because B.L. concedes all the relief she seeks can be granted on this basis alone, I decline to address her alternative arguments regarding the Cheerleading Rules' vagueness or viewpoint discrimination.

The District asked Dr. Mussoline to provide his opinions on immaterial matters. (<em>See</em> Doc. 36-1 at 2). For example, Dr. Mussoline was asked to opine on \"how communities view cheer squads in general ...[,]\" \"the reasonableness of the [Cheerleading Rules,]\" and \"how the conduct in which B.L. displayed [<em>sic</em> ] impacts the interscholastic nature of sportsmanship and team bonds in a sport like cheerleading[.]\" (<em>Id.</em> ). Again, Coach Luchetta-Rump admitted she punished B.L. for off-campus profanity, in violation of the Constitution. Nothing Dr. Mussoline could say changes that.
