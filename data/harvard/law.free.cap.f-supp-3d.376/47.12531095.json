Indeed, from the plaintiffs' submission of four FOIA requests between July and December 2016, to their initiation\n      of this lawsuit in October 2017,\n       <em>\n        see\n       </em>\n       Compl., the defendants had released only 92 pages of records, Pls.'

By January 2018, the defendants claimed that all FDA divisions other than the CDRH, which had not yet started releasing responsive documents, had responded in full to the plaintiffs' FOIA requests,\n       <em>\n        see\n       </em>\n       Suppl.

Following the February 2, 2018 status conference, the case was bifurcated. \"CDRH and any other HHS component to which a referral has been made\" were ordered to \"make a rolling production of no fewer than 5,000 pages per month to the plaintiffs, beginning on March 1, 2018, and continuing every sixty days thereafter until production is complete.\" Min.

Circuit has said about an agency's determination of whether a document meets FOIA's definition of \"agency record,\" courts must \"be careful to ensure that '[t]he term 'agency records' ... not be manipulated to avoid the basic structure of the FOIA: records are presumptively\n      disclosable unless the government can show that one of the enumerated exemptions applies.' \"\n       <em>\n        Consumer Fed'n of Am.\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3456664,3253266\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/455/283/\">\n        455 F.3d at 287\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (quoting\n       <em>\n        Bureau of Nat'l Affairs, Inc. v.

Although the question here is not whether information qualifies as an agency record in the first place, but rather about where one record ends and another begins, the admonition against record manipulation is no less applicable. Allowing the defendants to re-define the contours of a given record midway through litigation would invert the ordinary process of responding to a FOIA request, in which the first step is identifying the responsive records,\n       <em>\n        see\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        AILA\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410362,4349127\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/667/\">\n        830 F.3d at 677\n       </extracted-citation>\n       , just because the agency realized that, without the change, certain information would be subject to disclosure. That is precisely the sort of manipulation that undermines the purpose of FOIA.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-50\">\n       That the defendants have altered their conception of what constitutes a single record is evident from comparison of the defendants' second\n       <em>\n        Vaughn\n       </em>\n       Index and third\n       <em>\n        Vaughn\n       </em>\n       Index.

The second\n       <em>\n        Vaughn\n       </em>\n       Index reveals that the defendants viewed the email attachment as a piece of a single record that included the parent email and additional attachment.

Missing from that analysis is any acknowledgment that the complainant expressed an intent to publicize his or her views.

The defendants have not met their burden because they have forgone a necessary step in Exemption 6's balancing standard-properly defining the interests on either side of the equation. Redacting the identities of individuals who have publicly associated themselves with the very views that redaction intends to shield, without considering how that welcomed publicity changes the privacy interest, improperly ascribes a uniform privacy interest to one's identity and ignores a fact that minimizes any asserted privacy interest.

Indeed, the plaintiffs' massive FOIA requests returned over 24,000\n      responsive records, to say nothing of the 60,000 records that CDRH is in the process of producing. Such broad requests are understandable given that the records relate to the agency's regulation, and possible ban, of a treatment practice that the plaintiffs adamantly believe in.

On the defendants' side, too much has been painted with too broad a brush. While the end, at least for now, of the defendants' regulatory work is the Proposed Ban, the defendants have made an awful lot of intermediary decisions to get from the point at which JRC did not have to obtain 510(k) clearance for the GED to proposing a rule that would ban the GED altogether. In making those decisions, the FDA consulted with many individuals, including former JRC patients. Certainly, as a baseline, all JRC patients have a privacy interest in their medical history, but some individuals can exhibit behaviors reflecting a lesser interest in maintaining that privacy. The plaintiffs have done no better, identifying general problems with the defendants' production but offering only a smattering of examples of those purported problems, which fall short of their obligation under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.\n       <em>\n        See, supra\n       </em>\n       n.5.

Of course, going forward, the remaining issues in this case may be narrowed by the parties conferring about the production, with this Memorandum Opinion providing some guidance. If the parties require another round of summary judgment briefing, they must do better focusing on which withholdings are still contested.
