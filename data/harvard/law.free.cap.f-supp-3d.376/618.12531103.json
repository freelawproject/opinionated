(ECF No. 50.) Before the Court is Blue Cross NC's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, (ECF No. 51). For the reasons set forth below, the motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff is a medical practice located in Iredell County, North Carolina, \"devoted solely and exclusively\" to treating patients with substance abuse and drug addiction issues. (ECF No. 50 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13.) BCBSNC \"is an administrator of health benefit plans for its insureds or members.\" (ECF No. 52 at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 50 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 14.) Plaintiff and BCBSNC entered into a Network Participation Agreement (\"Provider Agreement\"), effective May 8, 2011, under which Plaintiff \"agree[d] to render Medically Necessary Covered Services\" to BCBSNC Members\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in exchange for \"payment in full for Covered Services delivered to Members during the term of th[e] Agreement.\" (ECF No. 50 at 17, 20 \u00a7 2.1.1;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 26 \u00a7 4.1;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Until July 2015, BCBSNC \"made all payments directly to Plaintiff for the medical services provided to BCBS[NC] insureds,\" and Plaintiff \"experienced no problem with the payment of its claims submitted to Defendant for those services.\" (ECF No. 50 \u00b6\u00b6 17d, 17e, 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 22, 2015, BCBSNC notified Plaintiff by letter that, \"effective immediately,\" BCBSNC would institute a pre-payment review of certain claims for urine tests administered by Plaintiff to BCBSNC Members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 24.) BCBSNC further informed Plaintiff that, \"[g]oing forward,\" Plaintiff would be required to \"submit all medical record documentation\" to support the billing of claims for urine tests, including \"the test results along with the specific rationale for performing these tests.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) Upon receiving BCBSNC's July 22, 2015 letter, Plaintiff complied with the new billing submission requirements while attempting, to no avail, to discuss the matter with BCBSNC in order to understand \"the reason or reasons that [BCBSNC] was investigating [Plaintiff, and] why the protocol for presenting claims had changed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31-33.) BCBSNC subsequently terminated Plaintiff as a provider for BCBSNC on June 2, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2016, Plaintiff filed this action in state court, alleging that BCBSNC failed to pay Plaintiff for certain \"medically necessary\" services provided to BCBSNC insureds. (ECF No. 6.) On March 10, 2016, BCBSNC removed the action to this Court, contending that federal question jurisdiction was present because \"one or more of Plaintiff's claims are completely preempted by [ERISA].\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 8.) On April 11, 2016, BCBSNC moved to dismiss all claims in Plaintiff's Complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) (\"First Motion to Dismiss\"). (ECF No. 15.) On February 9, 2017, this Court entered a Memorandum Opinion and Order which, in pertinent part, granted in part and denied in part BCBSNC's First Motion to Dismiss, and further, granted leave for Plaintiff to amend its Complaint \"so that Plaintiff can properly file its claims consistent with this opinion and clarify any claim brought under \u00a7 502.\"\n   <em>\n    Bobby P.

In its Memorandum Opinion and Order, this Court concluded that \"Plaintiff's first cause of action for breach of contract is completely preempted by ERISA to the extent it involves ERISA governed health care plans and must be treated as a federal claim arising under \u00a7 502(a).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268395\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/233/496/#p508\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268395\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/233/496/#p508\">\n    at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 22, 2017, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint, (ECF No. 27), which BCBSNC moved to dismiss, (ECF No. 29). Plaintiff then simultaneously filed a motion seeking leave to file a Second Amended Complaint as well as a motion to remand this action to state court. (ECF Nos. 34, 36.) On March 23, 2018, this Court entered an Order denying Plaintiff's motion to remand; granting leave for Plaintiff to file a Second Amended Complaint; and denying as moot, without prejudice, BCBSNC's motion to dismiss. (ECF No. 43 at 9-10.) BCBSNC now moves to dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (ECF No. 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\"challenges the legal sufficiency of a complaint,\" including whether the complaint meets the pleading standard of Rule 8(a)(2).\n   <em>\n    Francis v.

Rule 8(a)(2) requires a complaint to contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), thereby \"giv[ing] the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl. Corp. v.

A complaint may fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted in two ways: first, by failing to state a valid legal cause of action,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a cognizable claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holloway v.

R. Civ. P. 12(d) ). The court can, however, properly consider \"documents attached to the complaint, as well as those attached to the motion to dismiss, so long as they are integral to the complaint and authentic.\"\n   <em>\n    Philips v. Pitt Cty. Mem'l Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670870\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/176/#p180\">\n    572 F.3d 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 180 (4th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). The Court will therefore consider the Provider Agreement attached to the Second Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 50 at 17-51.) In addition, the Complaint alleges that the Provider Agreement authorized Plaintiff \"to provide certain medical services to persons ... eligible for health insurance coverage\n   <em>\n    under one or more benefit plans\n   </em>\n   provided by [BCBSNC] to its 'member[s].' \" (ECF No. 50 \u00b6 17 (emphasis added).) Accordingly, the Court will also consider the health benefit plan documents attached to Defendant's memorandum of law in support of its motion to dismiss,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the authenticity of which has not been challenged by any party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant moves for Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of Plaintiff's Complaint on the following four grounds: (i) \"Plaintiff lacks statutory standing to bring a claim under ERISA\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ii) \"Plaintiff fails to state an ERISA claim for wrongful denial of plan benefits\"; (iii) \"Plaintiff has not shown that each alleged ERISA beneficiary exhausted all administrative remedies for each claim for which Plaintiff seeks benefits before filing suit\"; and (iv) because Plaintiff's claims for interest and attorney's fees \"depend entirely on the ERISA claim which must be dismissed,\" Plaintiff's claim for\n   interest and attorney's fees must likewise be dismissed. (ECF No. 52 at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As an initial matter, Plaintiff argues that its claims \"hinge[ ] solely upon the Provider Agreement\" and that \"[t]his case has nothing to do with efforts by Plaintiff to recover payment for medically necessary services from any of the health insurance plans alluded to in Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.\" (ECF No. 54 at 3, 5.) According to Plaintiff, BCBSNC's assertions that \"Plaintiff has filed [this] civil action to recover under ERISA\" is erroneous, and \"[n]othing could be further from the truth, as appears on the face of the pleadings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   However, Plaintiff specifically alleges the following on the face of its Second Amended Complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (i) that \"[t]his Court has jurisdiction to consider Plaintiff's claims pursuant to the authority granted in\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , et seq., particularly\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , ERISA \u00a7 502,\" (ECF No. 50 \u00b6 5); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (ii) \"ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) grants to Plaintiff the right to bring this action to recover sums due [Plaintiff] for medically necessary services provided ... to Defendant's insureds,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff also pleads its first claim in the Second Amended Complaint as: \"Payment for medically necessary services under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) The Court continues to be perplexed, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 43 at 4-5), by Plaintiff's repeated contention that this action does not involve ERISA and, instead, arises out of a breach of contract claim, despite having elected to amend its Complaint\n   <em>\n    twice\n   </em>\n   to include an ERISA claim, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 27, 50). Thus, as this Court stated in its Memorandum Opinion and Order entered February 9, 2017, \"Plaintiff's breach of contract claim is really one for benefits under [ERISA] \u00a7 502(a).\" (ECF No. 26 at 9.) Accordingly, the Court will now address BCBSNC's first argument that \"Plaintiff lacks statutory standing to bring a claim under ERISA,\" (ECF No. 52 at 2, 7-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant first argues that Plaintiff's ERISA claim should be dismissed \"because Plaintiff does not have direct or derivative standing ... to bring an ERISA claim.\" (ECF No. 52 at 12.) Specifically, Defendant contends that \"Plaintiff does not have direct statutory standing to bring an ERISA action because he is not a fiduciary, beneficiary, or a plan participant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Defendant further contends that Plaintiff lacks derivative standing because \"[u]nder the plain language of the Blue Cross NC health benefit plans, Blue Cross NC members are contractually prohibited from assigning benefits to any third party, and any purported assignment has no legal effect.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.) Plaintiff argues that \"[s]tanding to enforce a claim under ERISA is a non-issue, because it is abundantly clear from the pleadings and the facts here that Plaintiff's claim against Defendant arises from a 'Provider Agreement' between Plaintiff and Defendant and not between Plaintiff and an ERISA plan which has defined benefits for an insured.\" (ECF No. 54 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Congress enacted ERISA to 'protect ... the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries' by setting out substantive regulatory requirements for employee benefit plans and to 'provid[e] for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts.' \"\n   <em>\n    Aetna Health Inc. v.

However, as BCBSNC correctly points out, (ECF No. 55 at 6), in\n   <em>\n    Borrero\n   </em>\n   , there was no anti-assignment clause, thus the Eleventh Circuit did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   consider, and made no finding about, the effect of an anti-assignment clause in an ERISA benefit plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In contrast, in the second case cited by\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff-Spinedex Physical Therapy USA Inc. v.
