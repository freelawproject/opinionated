Plaintiff filed a Response, (ECF Nos. 24, 25), and Defendant filed a Reply, (ECF No. 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendant's Uber App and the Underlying Technology Services Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant is a technology company that offers a smartphone application (\"Uber App\") to connect people looking for transportation (\"riders\") to transportation providers (\"drivers\") looking for riders. (Rosenthal Decl. \u00b6 3, ECF No. 10-1). When drivers seek to use Defendant's Uber App to begin connecting with riders, they must enter into the Technology Services Agreement (\"TSA\") with Defendant's subsidiary, Rasier, or a related entity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8). To accept the TSA, a driver must first log on to the Uber App using a unique username (the driver's email address) and password. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). The driver personally selects the unique username and password at the time he signs up to use the Uber App, and the driver's account can only be accessed by inputting that unique username and password. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Once a new driver logs on to the Uber App, he is given an opportunity to review the TSA by clicking a hyperlink presented on the screen within the Uber App. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). At the top of this screen, the Uber App states: \"TO GO ONLINE, YOU MUST REVIEW ALL THE DOCUMENTS BELOW AND AGREE TO THE CONTRACTS BELOW.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Clicking the link opens the TSA, which can be reviewed by scrolling through. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The driver is free to spend as much time as he wishes reviewing the TSA on his smartphone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). To advance past the screen which contains the link to the document, the driver must click \"YES, I AGREE\" to the TSA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Directly above \"YES, I AGREE,\" the Uber App states: \"By clicking below, you represent that you have reviewed all the documents above and that you agree to all the contracts above.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After clicking \"YES, I AGREE,\" the driver is prompted to confirm acceptance a second time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On the second screen, the Uber App states: \"PLEASE CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE REVIEWED ALL THE DOCUMENTS AND AGREE TO ALL THE NEW CONTRACTS.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After clicking \"YES, I AGREE\" a second time, the driver is able to access the Uber App, and the TSA is immediately sent to the driver's \"Driver Portal,\" where the driver can access the TSA at any time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As pertinent to this case, the TSA contains an arbitration provision (\"Arbitration Provision\"), which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   This Arbitration Provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (the \"FAA\") and evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.

It further states in boldface text:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Except as it otherwise provides, this Arbitration Provision is intended to apply to the resolution of disputes that otherwise would be resolved in a court of law or before any forum other than arbitration, with the exception of proceedings that must be exhausted under applicable law before pursuing a claim in a court of law or in any forum other than arbitration. Except as it otherwise provides, this Arbitration Provision requires all such disputes to be resolved only by an arbitrator through final and binding arbitration on an individual basis only and not by way of court or jury trial, or by way of class, collective, or representative action.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Additionally, it contains a delegation clause (\"Delegation Clause\"), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Except as provided in Section 15.3(v), below, regarding the Class Action Waiver, such disputes include without limitation disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this Arbitration Provision, including the enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration Provision or any portion of the Arbitration Provision....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The TSA then explicitly states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Except as it otherwise provides, this Arbitration Provision also applies, without limitation, to all disputes between You and the Company or Uber, as well as all disputes between You and the Company's or Uber's fiduciaries, administrators, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, and all successors and assigns of any of them, including but not limited to any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement and disputes arising out of or related to your relationship with the Company, including termination of the relationship.

Factual Allegations and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that he applied to be a driver for Defendant in January 2016. (Am. Compl. 2:18-20, ECF No. 5). As part of the application process, Plaintiff accepted the TSA via Defendant's Uber App. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   3:5-12, 21:9-12). However, Defendant ultimately rejected Plaintiff's January 2016 application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   4:20-5:4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In April 2016, Plaintiff reapplied to be a driver for Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   5:5-7). Plaintiff alleges that he was not presented with the TSA as part of the application process, and therefore, he did not accept the TSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    5:23-6:3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Defendant, however, alleges that Plaintiff was presented with the TSA, and that he accepted it through the Uber App. (Mot. to Compel 3:7-12, ECF No. 10). Nevertheless, Plaintiff contends that\n   on or about April 8, 2016, he was approved to drive for Defendant. (Am. Compl. 6:4-6). Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant wrongfully terminated its relationship with Plaintiff on or about February 16, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9:17-10:10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 26, 2018, Plaintiff commenced the instant action, and on May 7, 2018, Plaintiff filed the instant Amended Complaint, (ECF No. 5). Plaintiff asserts the following claims against Defendant: (1) detrimental reliance; (2) breach of contract; (3) fraudulent inducement; (4) economic duress; (5) violation of federal minimum wage law; (6) willful violation of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act; (7) wrongful termination; (8) fraud; and (9) embezzlement. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the instant Motions, Defendant argues that the Court should compel Plaintiff to arbitrate his claims in accordance with the TSA and dismiss Plaintiff's claims with prejudice, or alternatively, stay the case pending the completion of arbitration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Compel 1:20-26). Plaintiff, however, contends that he did not accept the TSA, and that as a result, cannot be compelled to arbitrate his claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 13:7-17, ECF No. 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A written provision in ... a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction ... shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"In enacting \u00a7 2 of the [FAA], Congress declared a national policy favoring arbitration and withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Southland Corp. v.

The Court will then address arguments arising from the January\n   2016 TSA, followed arguments arising from the April 2016 TSA. Lastly, the Court will consider the effect of the TSA's Delegation Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendant's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Surreply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In Plaintiff's Surreply, Plaintiff indicates that he \"seeks leave of the Court to file this Sur Reply,\" because Defendant \"seems to have abandoned the alleged April 2016 arbitration agreement in favor of the January 2016 arbitration clause that Plaintiff admitted that Plaintiff signed.\" (Surreply 1:16-19, ECF No. 21). While the Court does not agree that Defendant \"abandoned\" its position regarding the April 2016 TSA, the Court does find that Defendant raised new arguments for the first time in its Reply. As discussed in Part III.B\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , Defendant argues that Plaintiff should be compelled to arbitrate his claims because he accepted the TSA in January 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant contends that it addressed the January 2016 TSA in its Reply because Plaintiff discussed it in his Response to the Motion to Compel. (Mot. to Strike 3:11-13, ECF No. 22) (\"Uber was merely responding to arguments raised by Plaintiff in his opposition to Uber's Motion to Compel Arbitration.\"). However, the Court notes that in Plaintiff's Amended Complaint, Plaintiff's asserts that he accepted the TSA when he first applied with Defendant in January 2016. (Am Compl. 3:5-12, 21:9-12). Any arguments based on this allegation should have been presented in Defendant's Motion to Compel, and not addressed for the first time in Defendant's Reply.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Provenz v.

Nev. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court finds that considerations of fairness counsel in favor of allowing Plaintiff to address the arguments set forth in Defendant's Reply. Accordingly, for good cause appearing, the Court will consider Plaintiff's Surreply, (ECF No. 21), and deny Defendant's Motion to Strike, (ECF No. 22). Additionally, the Court will grant Defendant's Motion for Leave to File a Response, (ECF No. 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. January 2016 TSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff accepted the TSA in January 2016 and is therefore bound by the Arbitration Provision and Delegation Clause contained therein. (Reply 5:7-8, ECF No. 20). Defendant proffers two theories in an attempt to support its argument. First, Defendant summarily states that the TSA \"sets forth the bases upon which it will be terminated-none of which apply here.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   5:1-3). As such, Defendant contends that the January 2016 TSA was not terminated and thus compels the arbitration of Plaintiff's instant claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, Defendant fails to explain-and it is not evident to the Court-how\n   <em>\n    none\n   </em>\n   of the bases for termination outlined in the TSA apply to the instant facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, Defendant points to Section 12.3 of the TSA, which states that the Arbitration Provision survives the TSA's termination. Defendant then contends that even if the January 2016 TSA was terminated, \"the Arbitration Provision remains in effect regardless and must be adhered to.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   5:5-7). Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the Arbitration Provision survived the TSA's termination, Defendant nevertheless does not provide sufficient legal or factual basis to support a finding that the Arbitration\n   Provision necessarily applies to the instant claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C. April 2016 TSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant argues that the Court should compel arbitration of Plaintiff's claims because, contrary to Plaintiff's assertions, Plaintiff accepted the TSA in April 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Mot. to Compel 3:6-12, ECF No. 10). As evidence of Plaintiff's acceptance, Defendant provides a declaration from Brad Rosenthal, the head of UberHEALTH Partnerships at Defendant's headquarters, in which Rosenthal explains that drivers cannot use the Uber App to connect with riders without first accepting the TSA. (Rosenthal Decl. \u00b6 8, ECF No. 10-1). Defendant further provides what it purports to be the electronic receipt of Plaintiff's acceptance based on his unique username and password. (Electronic Receipt, Ex. E to Rosenthal Decl., ECF No. 10-1). In response, Plaintiff argues that \"[a]ll that Defendant can prove is that the 'YES, I AGREE' was allegedly pressed from Plaintiff's phone.\" (Resp. 7:1-2, ECF No. 13). Plaintiff further argues that the Court should not consider Rosenthal's declaration because Rosenthal is not competent to testify regarding the matters set forth in his declaration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   11:16-12:19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Where there is doubt as to whether an agreement to arbitrate exists, \"[o]nly when there is no genuine issue of fact concerning the formation of the agreement should the court decide as a matter of law that the parties did or did not enter into such an agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Three Valleys Mun.

Rosenthal further explains, that upon a driver's acceptance of the TSA, an electronic receipt is automatically generated, and that \"the receipt includes a date\n   and time stamp establishing when the [driver] accepted the agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12). Thus, Plaintiff's acceptance of the TSA is evidenced by Plaintiff's assertion that he drove for Defendant from April 2016 to February 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. 6:4-6, 9:17-10:10). Indeed, Plaintiff would not have been able to connect with riders unless he first accepted the TSA. Moreover, Defendant provides the electronic receipt generated by Plaintiff's acceptance and Rosenthal explains that \"the receipt only could have been generated by someone using [Plaintiff's] unique username and password and hitting 'YES, I AGREE' twice when prompted by the Uber App.\" (Rosenthal Decl. \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On the other hand, Plaintiff offers little to refute Defendant's evidence. Plaintiff first speculates that someone other than Plaintiff pressed, \"YES, I AGREE,\" from his smartphone. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 6:14-9:13). Specifically, Plaintiff insists that \"if any arbitration clause was signed in April of 2016, then someone at Defendant's office signed the agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   3:19-20). Immediately thereafter, however, Plaintiff presents a conflicting argument, stating that the possibility that one of his three children clicked and accepted the TSA \"cannot be ruled out in this case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   7:1-8). To be sure, while Plaintiff is adamant that he did not accept the TSA in April 2016, he provides no evidence that someone else was in possession of his smartphone, that his smartphone was malfunctioning, or that it was otherwise outside his control on April 7, 2016, the acceptance date recorded by Defendant's electronic receipt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Instead, Plaintiff relies on\n   <em>\n    Ruiz v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053713\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/232/836/\">\n    232 Cal.

In\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   , a California appellate court affirmed a trial court's implicit conclusion that the defendant, Moss Bros., \"did not present sufficient evidence to support a finding that [the plaintiff, Ernesto] Ruiz electronically signed\" the arbitration agreement at issue.\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053713\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/232/836/\">\n    232 Cal.

The court held that the testimony was insufficient because it did not explain \"how she ascertained that the electronic signature on the [ ] agreement was 'the act of' Ruiz,' \" and failed to address whether some other employee could have written Ruiz's name, and\n   whether the date and time next to the purported electronic signature automatically recorded the actual date and time of signing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=181%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20781\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=181%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20781\">\n    at 843-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=181%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20781\">\n    181 Cal.Rptr.3d 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   However, the instant case is substantially distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   because while the defendant in that case failed to provide sufficient evidence that its employees were required to use their unique usernames and passwords to access the human resources system and sign agreements, here, Rosenthal states that Plaintiff's unique username and password were necessary to access the Uber App and accept the TSA. Moreover, Defendant has provided evidence that it was necessary for Plaintiff to accept the TSA in order to begin connecting with drivers. Yet in\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   , it was not clear whether any consequences would have resulted from Ruiz's failure to sign the arbitration agreement. Further, the timeline in\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   differs. There, the arbitration agreement was allegedly signed at some point during the course of the plaintiff's employment. But here, the TSA was accepted only hours after Defendant allegedly sent Plaintiff an email informing him that his account was \"now active.\" (Email Correspondence, Ex. 6 to Resp., ECF No. 13) (showing email was sent April 6, 2016, at 1:47 P.M.). The Court does note that the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   did not recall signing an arbitration agreement, while in the instant case, Plaintiff is \"adamant\" that he did not accept the TSA. (Resp. 6:14-15). Nevertheless, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   averred that had he been presented with an agreement limiting his ability to sue the defendant, he would not have signed it. In stark contrast, Plaintiff makes no such assurance and instead asserts that he accepted an identical version of the TSA only months before, in January 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2: 13-16, 3:7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Moreover, the Court finds that Plaintiff's challenges to Rosenthal's qualifications are without merit. Specifically, Plaintiff argues that \"Mr. Rosenthal has not told the court what his role at Uber is. All he has said is that he is employed as head of UberHEALTH Partnerships.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   11:16-20). However, Rosenthal explains that he has \"personal knowledge of the process [drivers] must go through to use the Uber App and the various documents to which they must assent in order to use the Uber App.\" (Rosenthal Decl. \u00b6 6). Moreover, Rosenthal states that he has worked for Defendant since 2014 and has held many roles during his employment with the company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2). Additionally, Rosenthal avers that he has \"access to Uber's business records reflecting the identity of [drivers] that use the Uber App. These records are maintained in the regular course of business and are records of a regularly conducted activity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). As such, the Court finds that Rosenthal is sufficiently competent to testify regarding the matters set forth in his declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, Plaintiff has not provided enough evidence to raise an issue of material fact regarding the formation of an agreement to arbitrate. Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant has sufficiently shown that Plaintiff electronically accepted the TSA in April 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
