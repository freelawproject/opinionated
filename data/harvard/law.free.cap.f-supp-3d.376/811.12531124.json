Because the claims are time-barred, Defendants' motion will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants, Exactech, Inc. and Exactech\n   US, Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   produce medical devices, and specialize in manufacturing orthopedic devices for joint arthroplasties (i.e., joint replacements) [D. 61-2, pp. 4-5]. For hip replacements, Exactech produces a device known as the \"AcuMatch M-Series Fem-oral Stem\" [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. 61-6; D. 57, \u00b6 8]. Plaintiff underwent a total left hip replacement surgery on September 14, 2001, where Dr. Robert Covino implanted an M-Series stem [D. 61-1, p. 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The hip is a \"ball-and-socket\" joint that sits at the intersection of two bones: the femur and the pelvis. At the end of the pelvis is the \"socket\"-known as the acetabulum-while the \"femoral head\" is a ball-like protrusion, connected to the femur, that fits into the pelvic socket. In a healthy hip, cartilage eliminates friction between the ball and the socket. When the cartilage is damaged or destroyed, a hip arthroplasty may be necessary to restore pain-free movement of the hip. The M-Series stem that is the subject of this claim mimics the function of the femoral stem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For almost (but, importantly, not quite) fifteen years, Plaintiff suffered no side effects from the hip replacement. Then, on May 24, 2016, Plaintiff was exiting his vehicle when the femoral stem sheared and broke in half [D. 60-2, p. 2]. According to records, he was taken to a hospital for treatment five days later, on May 29, and discharged on June 21 [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 2, 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff originally filed his complaint more than fifteen years after the implant, on August 24, 2017, in the Northern District of Texas [D. 1]. Defendants quickly moved to transfer the case out of Texas [D. 17], and later filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings [D. 22]. The Texas court granted the motion to transfer, sending the case to the Eastern District of Tennessee [D. 31].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   An amended motion for judgment on the pleadings was then filed by Defendants [D. 44]. This Court denied that motion, because it raised a factual issue that was inappropriate for adjudication on a motion for judgment on the pleadings [D. 51, p. 8]. (The Court also ruled that Texas law applied to this case [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 4].) Plaintiff filed an amended complaint to make a minor correction on August 9, 2018 [D. 57], and Defendants filed this motion for summary judgment on August 14, 2018, which-after a response and a reply-is now ripe for the Court's decision [D. 59, 61, 62].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff raises eight claims for relief [D. 57, pp. 13-31]. In their motion for summary judgment, Defendants do not raise any substantive arguments against these claims. Instead, they contend Plaintiff's claims should be dismissed because they are time-barred under the relevant Texas statute of repose [D. 59]. In response, Plaintiff argues he is entitled to exceptions under the statute of repose. In the alternative, he contends the statute of repose as applied to him is unconstitutional, both under the Texas and U.S. Constitutions, or that it violates public policy [D. 61].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Summary judgment is proper only if the record shows there is \"no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.

In his affidavit, Dr. Covino asserts he \"would have advised the patient of an expected 15-20 year life span of the implant,\" and he would have provided the advice \"orally and/or in writing\" prior to the surgery [D. 61-4, \u00b6 8]. Plaintiff contends this \"advice\" amounts to a warranty. But his argument fails under the clear statutory language of \u00a7 16.012(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, a doctor is not a \"manufacturer\" or \"seller\" within the meaning of the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hadley v.

Ct. App. 2009) (finding that, at common law, doctors are not considered \"sellers\" for products liability purposes, and that statutory definition does not abrogate the common law definition). So even if Dr. Covino had expressly warranted the product in writing, his warranty would be legally ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff also concedes that it is \"part and parcel of Defendants' business model to not directly provide a warranty for their products\" [D. 61, \u00b6 30]. Instead, Defendants purportedly warrant their products by producing (or \"caus[ing] to be produced\") \"literature\" suggesting the product will last fifteen to twenty years, and \"indirectly advis[ing] and inform[ing] practitioners that their product has a specific life expectancy\" [D. 34, 36]. Setting aside whether such literature counts as a \"writing,\" such an \"indirect\" warranty is not an\n   <em>\n    express\n   </em>\n   warranty, which is what the statute requires [\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D. 61, \u00b6 32 (arguing Defendants' used \"unofficial\" statements of sales representatives \"to\n   <em>\n    imply\n   </em>\n   a warranty to the orthopedic surgeon community\") (emphasis added) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To prevail, the party seeking the benefit of the \u00a7 16.012(c) exception needs to show the \"manufacturer\" or \"seller\" made a written, express warranty. Plaintiff has not done so, and therefore cannot claim the exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Latent Disease\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that under the \"plain language\" of \u00a7 16.012(d-1), he should not be subject to the fifteen-year limit [D. 61, p. 9]. Separately, he argues that he qualifies for the \"latent disease\" exception\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in \u00a7 16.012(d). In essence, Plaintiff treats these as two different exceptions. But by the terms of the statute, Plaintiff must first show that his cause of action is the sort described in subsection (d) before he can claim the particular exception of subsection (d-1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 16.012(d-1) (\"This section does not reduce a limitations period for a\n   <em>\n    cause of action described by subsection (d)\n   </em>\n   that accrues before the end of the limitations period under this section\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Subsection (d) provides that the statute of repose will not apply when the claimant establishes the following: \"1) they were exposed to the product that is the subject\n   of the action before the end of 15 years after the date the product was first sold; 2) the claimant's exposure to the product caused the claimant's disease that is the basis of the action; and 3) the symptoms of the claimant's disease did not, before the end of fifteen years after the date of the first sale of the product by the defendant, manifest themselves to a degree and for a duration that would put a reasonable person on notice that the person suffered some injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303148\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/287/847/#p849\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16.012(d)(1)-(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The parties agree the femoral stem broke within fifteen years of the date of sale, that Plaintiff brought suit after fifteen years (outside the applicable statute of repose), and that suit was brought within two years of the date the injury actually occurred (inside the applicable statute of limitations\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ). Plaintiff argues that because he received the implant within fifteen years of the date of sale, and it caused his injury at a later date, he can claim the protection of subsection (d). And because subsection (d-1) does not reduce the applicable statute of limitations period for a cause of action in these situations, he argues the suit is timely under this narrow exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To recover in tort, a plaintiff must show i) defendant had a duty; ii) defendant breached that duty; and that the defendant iii) caused iv) a harm (for which plaintiff can be compensated in damages). Traditional tort law doctrine is well-equipped to compensate plaintiffs for injuries that manifest quickly or immediately-in other words, where the breach immediately causes the injury that leads to the harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Paoli R.R.

To meet the statute of repose exception, the claimant must show they were i) exposed to the product within fifteen years of the product's sale, ii) that the exposure caused the disease, and ii) that the symptoms manifested after fifteen years had elapsed. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 16.012(d)(1)-(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff's exposure to the harm, the actual injury, and his awareness of the harm were simultaneous. Here, Plaintiff is arguing that because there was a gap between his exposure and his injury, he is entitled to the statutory exception. But under the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   and the plain language of \u00a7 16.012(d), the separation in time between the exposure to the product and the resulting harm is immaterial. The relevant consideration is whether there was a gap\n   between when the injury occurred, and when the harm became apparent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff's harm appeared immediately after the injury. He testified that his problems began the day he stepped out of his truck and felt \"something\" [D. 60-2, p. 2]. Even though he checked into the hospital eight days later, he reported that at the time that he had been feeling left hip pain for eight days [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 3]. Because Plaintiff has admitted the symptoms were immediately apparent, and the latent disease exception should not apply in this circumstance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, to hold otherwise would create an exception that swallows the rule. This is likely not the first case where a medical device manufacturer has sold a product to a doctor who immediately uses it for a joint replacement, and the product (unfortunately) fails many years down the line. Indeed, one could assume that in most cases, there is a temporal separation between exposure to a defective medical device and its failure. If the Court were to rule that Plaintiff could claim the benefit of \u00a7 16.012(d), it would effectively create a \"medical device exception\" for an otherwise strict statute of repose. There is no evidence the Texas legislature intended this outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff's claims are not subject to the statutory exception under \u00a7 16.012(d), so the Court need not address whether subsection (d-1) applies. Because neither the subsection (c) nor (d) exception fits with these facts, the Court finds the fifteen-year statute of repose applies in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Constitutional and Policy Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court must now address whether the application of the statute would be contrary to the United States Constitution, the Texas Constitution, or public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Constitutional Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff's constitutional claims come in two flavors. First, Plaintiff argues the statute of repose is invalid under the Texas Constitution's \"open courts\" provision. Second, Plaintiff argues the statute of repose violates the concept of \"fundamental fairness\" protected by the Texas and U.S. Constitutions. Both arguments are built upon the same foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Courts reviewing the constitutionality of Texas statutes presume \"the legislature has not acted unreasonably or arbitrarily.\"\n   <em>\n    Methodist Healthcare Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324302\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/307/283/#p286\">\n    307 S.W.3d at 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The applicable statute of repose in that\n   case was for ten years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 285.

The Open Courts provision, it held, \"confers a constitutional right of access but not an everlasting one.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303457\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/290/863/#p866\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In that case, the plaintiff did not discover her injury until after the ten year period had elapsed, so it would have been impossible for her to commence the suit within the applicable time period on those facts. In this case, the injury occurred within the applicable time period of fifteen years, but suit was filed more than fifteen years after the date of sale (although within the applicable statute of limitations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This presents an interesting hypothetical that is not answered by the facts in\n   <em>\n    Methodist Healthcare Systems\n   </em>\n   : If the plaintiff is injured by the product\n   <em>\n    just before\n   </em>\n   the end of the fifteen-year window, to the point that a plaintiff could not practically commence the suit until after fifteen years have elapsed, would the Open Courts provision be violated in that scenario? (Or, would it violate fundamental fairness?) Plaintiff was discharged from the hospital on June 21, 2016, less than three months before September 14, 2016, when the fifteen-year clock would run out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   This Court is not sure, and the Texas courts have apparently not decided. But Plaintiff has not fleshed his argument out in the brief. The Court must apply a presumption that the challenged statute is constitutional and it cannot apply its own ingenuity to make Plaintiff's case for him. It finds Plaintiff has not met his burden of persuading the Court that \u00a7 16.012 is unconstitutional in this scenario. For that reason, the Court concludes that \u00a7 16.012 does not violate the Open Courts provision or the fundamental fairness principles inherent in the Texas and U.S. Constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Public Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The public policy argument is thin. The thrust of Plaintiff's contention is that by allowing \"intentional\" wrongdoers to take advantage of the statute, the \"fair and just balance\" struck by the statute would be disrupted [D. 61, \u00b6 67]. Under the law as written, a \"products liability action\" is defined as: \"[A]ny action against a manufacturer or seller ... caused by a defective product, whether the action is based in strict tort liability, strict products liability, negligence, misrepresentation, breach of express or implied warranty, or\n   <em>\n    any other theory or combination of theories\n   </em>\n   [.]\" TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 16.003 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The statutory language belies the premise of Plaintiff's argument. The statute of repose applies to an action brought under \"any theory or combination of theories.\" Whether prudent or not, the language suggests the Texas legislature did not intend to discriminate between intentional and unintentional wrongdoers. Instead, the language indicates the legislature intended to create an umbrella under which any products liability defendant could seek protection, notwithstanding their degree of culpability. This Court should not second-guess legislative policy, and it will not elect to do so here by denying the motion for summary judgment on these public policy grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In conclusion, the fifteen-year statute of repose applies to bar Plaintiff's claims, and the Court has not found the statute violates either the Texas or U.S. Constitution. For these reasons, Defendants' motion for summary judgment [D. 59] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and this case is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Exactech US, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Exactech, Inc., and conducts Exactech, Inc.'s sales and distribution activities in the United States [D. 57, \u00b6 3].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Meaning \"any action against a manufacturer or seller for recovery of damages or other relief for harm allegedly caused by a defective product, whether the action is based in strict tort liability, strict products liability, negligence, misrepresentation, breach of express or implied warranty, or any other theory or combination of theories[.]\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016.012\">\n     Tex.
