For the following reasons, the Court finds that the administrative law judge's (\"ALJ\") decision was based on reversible legal error and remands for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Solomon is a 66-year-old male who previously worked as a civil engineer. This is Solomon's second application for disability benefits. His first application, which alleged a disability onset date in August 2009, was denied by written decision on October 19, 2011 (A.R. 105-120) and became the Commissioner's final decision. In February 2012, Solomon filed a second application for disability benefits (A.R. 327-338), which gives rise to this case. Solomon alleges he became disabled in October 2011. The claim was denied initially on October 9, 2012 (A.R. 121) and again upon reconsideration on June 25, 2013 (A.R. 134). Solomon then filed a written request for hearing on July 20, 2013. (A.R. 212-213.) On February 26, 2014, he appeared and testified at a hearing at which an impartial vocational expert also appeared and testified. (A.R. 47-82.) On May 28, 2014, the ALJ issued a decision concluding that Solomon was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. (A.R. 174-193.) Solomon requested the\n   Appeals Council review the decision, and on February 5, 2015, the Appeals Council granted his request and remanded the case to the ALJ. (A.R. 194-197.) The ALJ conducted a new hearing on July 7, 2016 (A.R. 83-104) and issued a decision again determining that Solomon wasn't disabled (A.R. 18-46). Solomon requested review of the ALJ's decision, but the Appeals Council denied review on December 4, 2017. (A.R. 1-7.) At that point, the ALJ's decision became the Commissioner's final decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court addresses only the issues raised by the claimant in the appeal from the ALJ's decision.\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

(A.R. 25.) At step two, the ALJ found that Solomon had the following severe impairments: lumbar and cervical degenerative disc disease, status post right hip replacement, and bilateral shoulder degenerative joint disease with right shoulder surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The ALJ acknowledged the record also contained evidence of status post pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis, status post hernia repair, status post left knee surgery, possible irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, and depression, but found these were not severe impairments. (A.R 25-27.) At step three, the ALJ determined that Solomon didn't have an impairment or combination of impairments that meets or medically equals the severity of a listed impairment. (A.R. 27-28.) At step four, the ALJ determined that Solomon had the RFC to perform sedentary work, except that he is limited to occasionally overhead reaching bilaterally, occasionally climbing ramps and stairs, and occasionally balancing, stooping, crouching, kneeling, and crawling. (A.R. 28-35.) Further, the ALJ determined Solomon can never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The ALJ found Solomon wasn't capable of performing his past relevant work, but that Solomon had obtained skills from his past work that were transferable to the occupation of project estimator. (A.R. 35-36.) The ALJ concluded Solomon would need to make \"very little, if any, vocational adjustment,\" such that, at most, he would have a one- to three-month adjustment period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This Social Security appeal is unusual in that Solomon doesn't challenge the ALJ's rejection of his symptom testimony or the ALJ's decision to assign \"little weight\" to the opinion of his treating physician.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, he argues the ALJ erred by (1) improperly concluding that \"very little, if any, vocational adjustment\" would be required for him to perform the job of project estimator and (2) failing to include his mental limitations in the RFC or the hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert. (Doc. 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As explained below, the Court disagrees with Solomon as to the first issue but agrees as to the second.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Whether The ALJ Committed Reversible Error By Concluding That \"Very Little, If Any, Vocational Adjustment\" Would Be Required\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n   <strong>\n    The ALJ's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The ALJ determined that Solomon is limited to sedentary work and cannot perform his past relevant work as a civil engineer. (A.R. 28, 35.) However, the ALJ found that Solomon had acquired the following skills from his work as a civil engineer:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   project explanation skills, pricing skills, coordination of materials, and reviewing of bids and contracts. (A.R. 35.) The ALJ determined that these skills were transferable to other occupations existing in significant numbers in the national economy and that Solomon would need to make \"very little, if any, vocational adjustment in terms of tools, work processes, work settings, or the industry\" to perform the occupation of \"project estimator.\" (A.R. 35-36.)

Moreover, \"civil engineer\" has a specific vocational preparation (\"SVP\") Level of 8, whereas \"project estimator\" only has an SVP Level of 7, meaning that the project estimator occupation requires a lesser degree of skill.

(Doc. 16 at 13-14.) Solomon further argues that, at a minimum, the ALJ was required under\n   <em>\n    Renner\n   </em>\n   to explain with specificity how a one- to three-month adjustment period could qualify as \"very little, if any\" adjustment. (Doc. 18 at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   These arguments are unpersuasive. The \"very little, if any\" adjustment requirement is a qualitative description of how much adjustment a claimant of advanced age may be required to endure, not a requirement that the adjustment must be completed within some particular period of days.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v.

Here, the vocational expert testified that Solomon's transition from civil engineer to project estimator would be \"very brief\" and involve \"[n]o issue\" concerning \"transferability skills.\" (A.R. 102.) That testimony provided substantial evidence in support of the ALJ's conclusion that the \"very little, if any\" adjustment standard, which the ALJ correctly identified in the order (A.R. 36), was satisfied. Courts have regularly upheld ALJ determinations that \"very little, if any, vocational adjustment\" was needed where the vocational expert testified to the same, even if the adjustment period was more than 30 days.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tyree v.

(A.R. 26-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At Step 4-where the ALJ assesses a claimant's RFC-the ALJ determined Solomon is limited to sedentary work. (A.R. 28.) The ALJ also found Solomon had other physical limitations. However, the RFC didn't incorporate any of the non-severe mental limitations that had been identified during Step 2. Nor did the ALJ discuss with any particularity Solomon's mental limitations, only briefly noting two medical opinions regarding mental health and giving them \"substantial weight\"-one in which a psychological evaluator opined that Solomon's \"limitations are due primarily to physical and not mental problems,\" and another in which a state agency psychological consultant diagnosed Solomon with \"a non-severe mental impairment of affective disorder.\" (A.R. 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At Step 5-where the ALJ determines if a claimant can perform any work beside his past relevant work-the ALJ decided Solomon could perform the occupation of project estimator. (A.R. 35-36.) This conclusion was based on the vocational expert's testimony-specifically, the vocational expert's response to a hypothetical posed by the ALJ that included only physical, not mental, limitations.

(A.R. 14-16.) In response, the Commissioner argues that \"an ALJ is not required to include mild mental limitations in the claimant's [RFC] assessment or in the ALJ's hypothetical's to the VE, when the limitations do not significantly interfere with the performance of a claimant's work activities.\" (Doc. 17 at 5-6.) In support of this argument, the Commissioner cites, among other cases,\n   <em>\n    Ball v.

Although the ALJ determined Solomon had mental limitations that caused mild limitation in social functioning and concentration, persistence, and pace (A.R. 26-27), the ALJ's order provides no indication that the ALJ considered those limitations when calculating Solomon's RFC during Step 4.
