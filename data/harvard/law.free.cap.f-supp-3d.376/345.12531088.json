Plaintiffs contend that Defendants have inappropriately withheld material which is not protected by the deliberative process privilege, despite Defendants' invocation of FOIA Exemption 5, and that\n   Defendants have inappropriately withheld the identities and professional backgrounds of certain experts who contributed to the report (the \"Experts\") pursuant to FOIA Exemption 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons that follow, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as to a portion of the records at issue. However, for the remainder of the records, additional scrutiny is required-either through\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, or by subsequent re-review by Defendants. Furthermore, the Experts' slight privacy interests in their identities and professional backgrounds are substantially outweighed by the public's interest in disclosure of that information. Accordingly, for the reasons articulated below, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART, and Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In that role, the CRCL conducts on-site investigations at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") and ICE-contracted immigration detention facilities. Decl. of James V.M.L. Holzer, May 9, 2018 (ECF No. 40) (\"Holzer Decl.\") \u00b6 16.

Holzer Decl. \u00b6 20. The Report also states that, in response to over fifty complaints received since 2012, the CRCL sent a \"super-recommendations memorandum\" to ICE in May 2015 (the \"Super-Recommendations Memo\") \"formally notifying [ICE] of [the CRCL's] long-standing and continuing concerns\" regarding the ECDC. Report at 35. As described in the Report, the Super-Recommendations Memo highlighted \"the seriousness of the problems found in previous investigations [of the ECDC], the continued receipt of additional\n   correspondence raising similar concerns, and CRCL's belief that additional fact-finding is unnecessary as [CRCL's] prior recommendations are likely not being fully implemented.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20345\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20345\">\n    at 28-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the Report describes the Super-Recommendations Memo as recommending \"that ICE develop a comprehensive plan to address the deficiencies at the facility, address the issues raised in complaints opened since the 2012 site visit, and either transition the facility to the 2011 Performance Based National Detention Standards or cease use of the facility.\" Report at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As stated above, Plaintiffs submitted the Request on September 8, 2016 seeking disclosure of the Super-Recommendations Memo. Receiving no response, Plaintiffs submitted an administrative appeal of the \"constructive denial\" of their FOIA request on October 20, 2016. 56.1 \u00b6 2.

This new type of memorandum, colloquially termed a \"super-recommendations memorandum,\" is an avenue to inform Component leadership of areas where there has been no significant implementation of CRCL recommendations despite repeated follow-up, CRCL continues to receive complaint allegations on the issues raised in the recommendations, and the issues presented raise serious civil rights concerns. In this instance, the memorandum addressed a detention facility in Alabama. CRCL highlighted the seriousness of problems found in previous investigations, the continued receipt of additional correspondence raising similar concerns, and CRCL's belief that additional factfinding\n   implemented. In these limited circumstances, CRCL made significant and far-reaching recommendations to fix identified problems,\n   <em>\n    including a request that ICE no longer use the facility to house detainees\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Request at 2 (quoting Report at 28-29) (emphasis added).

The Super-Recommendations Memo is a scant five pages in length.

Defendants deny that such language is in the redacted portions of the Super-Recommendations Memo, despite their contrary representation to Congress. Rather than attempt to resolve the conflict between the language of the Report and the agency declarations in the abstract, the Court will review the document\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Accordingly, the Court defers judgment as to the applicability of Exemption 5 to the redacted portions of the Super-Recommendations Memo pending its\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Expert Reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiffs object that Defendants' redactions of the Expert Reports, even as narrowed by the Subsequent Release, are overbroad. Specifically, they contend that the Defendants redacted standards and methodologies applied by the Experts which are not protected by the deliberative process privilege, and that Defendants applied too broad a brush in redacting the\n   Experts' findings and analysis-redacting severable factual material alongside material properly withheld pursuant to Exemption 5. The Court considers each objection in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Standards and Methodologies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court cannot determine, on the record before it, that the Defendants have not improperly redacted material which constitutes the adopted policy, or working law, of the DHS and/or ICE. Accordingly, the Court defers adjudication as to this issue, and directs Defendants to re-review the Expert Reports and to update the\n   <em>\n    Vaugn\n   </em>\n   Index to address with specificity the concerns expressed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \"When the contents of [a] document have been adopted, formally or informally, as the agency position on an issue or are used by the agency in its dealings with the public,\" that material has been adopted by the agency and may not be withheld pursuant to Exemption 5.\n   <em>\n    Brennan Ctr. for Justice at New York Univ.

The Court is concerned that certain redactions appear to have withheld standards applied by the Experts in their analysis which may have been adopted by the DHS and/or ICE. For example, the Released Records include the following: \"2. Analysis[:] ECDC's Telephone policy provides [redacted].\" Released Records at 40. The natural conclusion of that phrase would be a statement of ECDC's existing telephone policy for detainees-which is most likely the adopted policy of DHS and/or ICE in that regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The parties have not fully addressed this issue in their briefing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, which describes the redacted section as a \"discussion of the subject matter expert's subjective findings, analysis, and proposed recommendation is response to specific detainee allegations,\" claim that the policy at issue is not the adopted of the DHS and or/ICE.\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 6. Mr. Holzer's declaration is somewhat contradictory on this topic, claiming both that applicable standards and methodology were disclosed when it \"was reasonably servable from exempt information,\" which implies that some such material may have been withheld when it was not severable, and that the \"redacted portions within sections marked with headings such as 'methodology,' 'applicable standards,' and 'findings' do not contain information concerning applicable standards ...\" Holzer Decl. \u00b6 27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the inadequacy of the record, the Court cannot conclude that severable discussion of adopted agency policy was not improperly withheld from the Expert reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As the record is currently insufficient for the Court to determine whether the redactions at issue were appropriate, the Court defers adjudication. Defendants are directed to re-review the Expert Reports, and to release any severable material which constitutes the adopted policy or working law of DHS and/or ICE. Defendants are further directed to update the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index to specifically discuss whether any redacted standards and methodologies constitute the adopted policy or\n   working law of the DHS and/or ICE, and to more specifically delineate Defendants' rationales for withholding each standard or methodology applied by the Experts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Severable Factual Material\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court is also concerned that material which appears likely to be purely factual in nature and severable may nonetheless have been withheld by the DHS.

While Defendant's are correct that, in certain circumstances, the selection of which facts to include in a document may reveal the author's subjective opinions formed as part of an agency's deliberative process, the Court cannot find, on the record presented, that rule to be applicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The D.C. Circuit has opined that the key inquiry as to whether factual material can be withheld pursuant to the deliberative process privilege due its selective inclusion by the author is as to the relationship between the document and the ultimate decision made.\n   <em>\n    Mapother v.

Cir. 1974) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court finds that distinction relevant here. The Expert Reports, in general, discuss specific detainee complaints, followed by findings, analysis and recommendations.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   Released Records at 31. That structure is more in keeping with an \"investigative report\" into a specific question, than it is a \"complex decision in an adjudicatory proceeding.\" Accordingly, on the record before it, the Court cannot find that any redactions of purely factual material in the Expert's Reports, on the basis that the selection of such material by the author would reveal the deliberative process of the agency, was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court notes, however, that this analysis may only apply to the sections of the Experts' Reports which are responsive to cited detainee complaints. It may be the case that this concern is not raised as to the sections of the Experts' Reports concerning broader recommendations or summaries,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   Released Records at 42-43, where Defendants may have a stronger argument that the Experts' inclusion or exclusion of specific facts would be more revelatory of broader policy determinations, rather than investigation of a specific, disclosed, detainee complaint. It may also be the case that certain facts within the analysis of specified detainee complaints are inextricably intertwined with policy recommendations and can properly be withheld-the Court does not hold otherwise today. However, facts as to specific detainee complaints in the section of an\n   Expert Report discussing those detainee complaint are not\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   protected by the deliberative process privilege simply due to their selection, as Defendants argue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Unfortunately, the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index is also insufficiently precise to permit the Court to determine whether severable factual material was impermissibly withheld. For example, an indicative selection from the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index describes the withheld material as a \"discussion of the subject matter expert's subjective findings, analysis, and proposed recommendation is response to specific detainee allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 6. That description is insufficiently specific for the Court to conclude that the quoted passage does not include inappropriately withheld severable factual material. And while the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index also notes that the factual material in this section \"is inextricably intertwined with the expert's proposed policy making recommendations,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679704,203876\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/491/63/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , the Court presumes, based on Defendants' arguments, that Defendants' assessment of severability was informed by their erroneous assumption that the facts within the analysis of a detainee complaint are\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   protected by the deliberative process privilege due to their selection by an Expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Accordingly, the Court defers adjudication on this aspect of the redactions to the Experts' Reports. The Defendants are directed to re-review the Experts' Reports and to release material as needed, consistent with this opinion. Defendants are further directed to update the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index to provide more specific justifications for each iteration of factual material withheld from the Experts' Reports, in keeping with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The November 2, 2012 Memo and the Attachments to the Released Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   On its face, the redacted portions of the November 2, 2012 memo appear to comprise summaries of the recommendations provided by the Experts in their individual reports.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Released Records at 8 (\"All of the recommendations are set forth below\"). Given CLCR's established predecisional role in DHS's (and/or ICE's) deliberative process and the facially deliberative nature of recommendations provided by the Experts for the DHS's and ICE's consideration, there is ample support for Defendants' redactions to this document. However, as discussed in \u00a7\u00a7 III(A)(3)(a)-(b), above, the Court is generally concerned that certain types of severable-factual material, agency working law, and adopted agency policy may have been redacted. While these concerns are lessened as to the November 12, 2012 Memo, which, unlike the Expert Reports, is not structured in relation to specified detainee complaints, in the interest of caution the Court directs Defendants to re-review the November 2, 2012 Memo consistent with this opinion. For the same reasons, the Court further directs the Defendants to re-review Attachment C to the Released Records. Released Records at 113-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   However, there is no dispute that the redacted material in Attachment A to the Released Records was properly withheld. Released Records at 118-128. Further, those redactions appear, on their face, to consist largely of unchallenged personal identifiers, which were properly withheld under Exemption 6.

Holzer Decl. \u00b6 36. As Plaintiffs correctly point out, the Experts visited ECDC and interviewed detainees and staff as part of their investigative process, and there is no suggestion that they did not conduct that process openly. Given that any agency employee or detainee who interacted with an Expert presumably knew that Expert's identity and likely possessed at least a general understanding of that Experts' function, the Court has been presented with no basis upon which it could conclude that release of the Experts' identifies and professional backgrounds would increase the likelihood of Internal Harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Also unavailing is the argument that releasing the Experts' identities would subject the Experts to outside harassment, from the media or through organized campaigns by activist groups such as certain Plaintiffs. Such harassment, if it were a real risk, could, in theory, make it difficult for CRCL to hire contractors to participate in on-site investigations in the future.\" Holzer Decl. \u00b6 36. However, Plaintiffs have adduced evidence that the Experts refer to their work on their reports in their publicly available curricula vitae, expert reports, press releases, and media interviews.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Reply at 11-12 (collecting evidence). That is unsurprising, as the CRCL has stated that the Experts were selected through a competitive process, which would make public disclosure of their selection seem to be a feather in their cap, rather than a cause for concern. And Defendants have not provided the Court with any specific information as to material in the Reports which would tend to subject the Experts to harassment were their identities released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Accordingly, it may be that whatever privacy interest the Experts have in controlling dissemination of their identities and professional backgrounds is\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   and does not trigger the need to balance that interest with the public interest in disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   , 758 F.3d at 176 ;\n   <em>\n    Fed.

However, the Court need not determine that issue as, in any event, any privacy interest at stake is slight, and the interest in public disclosure articulated by the Plaintiffs is palpable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The CRCL's core function is review of the DHS's compliance with civil rights and liberties. The Experts investigated detainee allegations of violations of their civil rights and liberties on behalf of the CRCL, provided their findings as to whether violations took place, and provided recommendations to promote future agency compliance. As the CRCL has contracted out part of its responsibility to review alleged violations of civil rights and liberties, the public has a real interest in understanding whose judgment is being employed by the CRCL, and whether those contractors are qualified for the job. Decl. of Silky Shah, June 5, 2018 (ECF No. 45) \u00b6 6. Furthermore, as the CLCR purports to hire their subject-matter experts through a competitive process, the public has an interest in ensuring that the CRCL is, in fact, hiring adequately qualified experts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7 (the\n   public \"has an interest in knowing whether the DHS is spending money on highly-qualified well respected experts, or partisan or insufficiently-trained consultants.\"). As the identity of the Experts and their professional backgrounds are relevant to evaluating the CRCL's functionality, as well as how the CRCL is spending taxpayer funds, disclosure here would further the \"core purpose of the FOIA which is [to] contribute[e] significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of Def. v.

However, as Plaintiffs have submitted such a statement, and the procedural history of the FOIA request is not in contention, the Court utilizes Plaintiffs' Local Rule 56.1 statement as a factual basis to describe the procedural history of Plaintiffs FOIA request.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    As the Initial Release comprises several documents presented sequentially, each with its own individual pagination, the Court refers to the relevant ECF page number when citing to the Initial Release.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    For a discussion of the FOIA exemptions at issue\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    \u00a7\u00a7 III(A) and (B), below.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    As the Released Records, like the Initial Release, comprise several documents presented sequentially, each with its own individual pagination, the Court refers to the ECF page number when citing to the Released Records.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    The Court notes that the issue here is not whether the standards or methodologies were previously disclosed, but whether those standards and methodologies constitute adopted policy or working law of the agency.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    To the extent it applies here, the Court further notes that Defendants' contention that certain redacted material \"concerns a separate issue concerning standards then under consideration,\" Holzer Decl. \u00b6 27, could refer to standards ultimately adopted by the DHS and/or ICE, or to standards which were not adopted-a distinction which may impact whether the redacted material at issue was properly withheld and which cannot be determined on the present record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    As noted above, Plaintiffs do not challenge the redaction of the Experts' contact information.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
