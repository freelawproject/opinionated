HOWELL, Chief Judge\n   The plaintiff, Helen Krukas, individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated (except for individuals residing in California), as well as the general public, brings this putative class action against the defendants, AARP Inc., (\"AARP\"), AARP Services Inc. (\"ASI\"), and AARP Insurance Plan (\"AARP Trust\") (collectively referred to as \"AARP\"), alleging a violation of the Washington D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act (\"CPPA\"), D.C. CODE \u00a7 28-3901\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , as well as common law violations of conversion, unjust enrichment, and fraudulent concealment, based on her purchase of a Medicare supplemental health insurance policy, also known as a \"Medigap\" policy, administered by AARP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 16, 17, 88, ECF No. 1.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff challenges AARP's role in soliciting, marketing, and administering Medigap policies, a state-regulated form of health insurance to supplement Medicare. Since at least 1997, AARP has held, in its name, group Medigap policies underwritten by UnitedHealth Group and UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company (collectively, \"UnitedHealth\") and offered participation in those group policies to individual AARP members and the general public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22, 37, 51. The plaintiff alleges that AARP's administration and provision of other services in support of these group Medigap policies amounted to acting as an unlicensed insurance agent, that the \"royalties\" paid to AARP as a percentage of premiums constituted illegal commissions, and that AARP materially misrepresented the nature and source of the \"royalties,\" causing consumers to pay more for AARP Medigap policies than they otherwise would.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-15.

She alleges that \"[b]ut for Defendants' deceptive and unlawful acts ...

As AARP's taxable, \"for-profit\" division, ASI \"negotiates, oversees, and manages lucrative contracts with AARP's insurance business partners.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   AARP created ASI in 1999 pursuant to a settlement agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), following an IRS investigation into the income that AARP earned through endorsement deals.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 36.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39, 40. Under the Agreement, AARP agrees to: (1) market, solicit, sell and renew AARP Medigap policies with UnitedHealth; (2) collect and remit premium payments on behalf of UnitedHealth; (3) generally administer the AARP Medigap program; and (4) otherwise act as UnitedHealth's agent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. The Agreement makes clear that AARP owns all solicitation materials related to the Medigap program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47 (citing Agreement Subsection 7.2, \"Member Communications\"). \"[I]n exchange for AARP's administering of the insurance program and its marketing, soliciting, and selling or renewing of AARP Medigap policies on behalf of UnitedHealth, as well as its collecting and remitting insurance premiums on behalf of UnitedHealth, AARP earns a 4.95% commission-disguised\n   as a 'royalty'-on each policy sold or renewed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. In 2016, AARP generated $880 million in revenues from \"royalties,\" of which 68% came from UnitedHealth insurance products, including Medigap Policies and other insurance products.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 32, 33, 37.

The plaintiff suggests that AARP characterizes its \"commission\" as a \"royalty\" to avoid oversight by insurance regulators and to avoid paying taxes on the income generated through insurance sales, whereas other associations \"do the right thing and acquire a license to act as an agent.\" Compl. \u00b6 8 &amp; n.1 (citing example of the automobile club AAA, which is licensed to sell insurance).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to the plaintiff, \"AARP and UnitedHealth, together and through their respective subsidiaries, have orchestrated an elaborate scheme where AARP, as the de facto agent of UnitedHealth, helps market, solicit, and sell or renew AARP Medigap policies and generally administers the AARP Medigap program for UnitedHealth, in exchange for an undisclosed and illegal 4.95% commission that AARP collects from\" plaintiff and other consumers when they pay AARP for their Medigap policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.

Consideration of these factors demonstrates that no stay is necessary to permit DISB or any other state insurance agency the first opportunity to opine on the merits of the plaintiff's instant claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The plaintiff has not made a prior application to DISB, or to any other state insurance agency that regulates Medigap insurance, and thus no apparent danger of inconsistent rulings between this Court and a state insurance agency is presented that, as a matter of comity, would warrant this Court abstaining. While mindful that DISB has the authority to review rates and even advertising related to Medigap insurance, and that nothing prevents a consumer troubled by the 4.95% charge from alerting DISB to her concerns rather than pursuing a nationwide class action, the mere availability of regulatory review is not sufficient reason to apply the primary jurisdiction doctrine. Simply put, DISB has no exclusive jurisdiction over the claims at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moreover, rather than requiring agency expertise, the claims at issue here-whether advertising is deceptive or misleading, and related common law claims of conversion, unjust enrichment and fraudulent concealment-are regularly subject to judicial review and therefore fall squarely within the conventional expertise of the courts.

Otherwise, the defendants contend, the plaintiff would violate the nonjusticiability principle of the filed-rate doctrine because her claim attacks the rate that insurance regulators have already approved, and would violate the nondiscrimination principle because she seeks damages that, if paid, would reduce the rate below the rate on file with state regulators.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27 (\"[B]y seeking a refund of the portion of the rate she claims is improper (i.e., the royalty), Plaintiff seeks to effectively pay a lower rate than the filed rate paid by other insureds under the Policy.

The defendants point to UnitedHealth and AARP's Agreement, which expressly states that the royalty\n   <em>\n    is paid out of the premium rate approved by state regulators\n   </em>\n   , and to UnitedHealth's public rate filings in Florida, which indicate the same.

Thus, the Court looks only to the plaintiff's Complaint, which alleges that consumers are not informed that expenses charged to them as part of a premium include a 4.95% royalty UnitedHealth is contractually obligated to pay AARP.

This fact underscores that the plaintiff challenges behavior independent of the terms and conditions of the filed rate. The plaintiff alleges that, through unfair and deceptive trade practices, the defendants collect and retain a commission to which they are not legally entitled. Should the plaintiff prevail on these claims to require AARP to stop collecting that \"commission\" on extant terms, no change to UnitedHealth's rates would necessarily follow. Indeed, nothing about the plaintiff's claims against AARP and its affiliates prevents UnitedHealth from continuing to collect precisely the approved rates. Any follow-on disruption to UnitedHealth and AARP's side agreement regarding the \"royalty\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   payment and whether, as a result of this disruption, UnitedHealth will decide to change the rates filed going forward is irrelevant to an analysis of whether the filed-rate doctrine bars plaintiff's claims against AARP now.
