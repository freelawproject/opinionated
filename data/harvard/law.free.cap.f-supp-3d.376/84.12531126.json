Sullivan, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Kimberly Sellers has worked for the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), Immigration and Custom Enforcement (\"ICE\") for over 30 years. She alleges that DHS has subjected her to several types of discrimination and harassment on the basis of her gender and care-taker status beginning in October 2013 after she took leave in connection with the adoption of her daughter. Two broad categories of discriminatory actions are alleged in Ms. Sellers' complaint: (1) DHS's gradual removal of Ms. Seller's substantive responsibilities with the purpose of putting her in a marginal role; and (2) DHS's denial of several promotions and other career-advancement opportunities from 2014 to 2017. As a result of these, and several other alleged acts, Ms. Sellers brings this action against Kirstjen Nielsen, in her official capacity as Secretary of DHS (\"Defendant or DHS\"), alleging discrimination on the basis of her gender and caregiver status, retaliation, and hostile work environment, all in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court is defendant's motion for partial judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c).

Pre-EEO Investigation Discriminatory Acts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Sellers is employed by Homeland Security Investigations (\"HSI\"), an office within ICE, which is a component of DHS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Beginning in 2008, HSI assigned Ms. Sellers to the Department of State (\"DOS\") as a Liaison to the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (\"INL\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. While serving as a Liaison in 2013, Ms. Sellers took leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") in connection with the adoption of her child.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Although Ms. Sellers was on leave, she continued to receive emails and calls from her supervisors, requesting that she complete various tasks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. She reminded her colleagues that she was on FMLA leave and caring for her adopted daughter, but nonetheless completed the tasks when others could not because she was expected to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the conclusion of Ms. Sellers' leave on October 1, 2013, she was prepared to return to her full-time Liaison position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. However, two weeks later, on October 15, 2013, she was told that she was being removed as Liaison and would be reassigned to HSI headquarters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. This came as a shock to Ms. Sellers because prior to her leave, she had discussions with HSI regarding significant projects, both long and short-term, that she would work on as a Liaison.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. Sellers was also informed that her duties would be assumed by another employee, Mr. Charles Allen, an employee less qualified for the position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30. She later discovered that Mr. Allen had assumed some of her responsibilities while she was away on leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. Ms. Sellers was officially instructed to return to HSI headquarters on December 13, 2013, and her Liaison position was given to Mr. Allen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27, 32. Although Ms. Sellers was no longer serving as a Liaison, she remained on the INL team and supported Mr. Allen on his projects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After Ms. Sellers lost her Liaison position, she suspected that she may have been discriminated against because she used FMLA leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. Accordingly, Ms. Sellers contacted the agency's Equal Employment Opportunity (\"EEO\") office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. She explained that she was demoted immediately after taking FMLA leave and the EEO office advised that, because DHS's actions were potentially a violation of the FMLA, Ms. Sellers needed to report her complaint to the leave office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. Ms. Sellers took this advice and filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel for violation of her FMLA rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Over the following year, however, several actions by DHS led Ms. Sellers to realize it was her gender and caregiver status, rather than her choice to take FMLA leave, that motivated the agency's alleged discriminatory conduct as well as its hostile work environment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. For example, Mr. Allen treated her in an \"increasingly hostile and aggressive manner, which continues to this day.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Mr. Allen has menaced Ms. Sellers, telling her \"how well he was doing in her job,\" loomed over her physically, passed needlessly close to her on numerous occasions, blocked her path, criticized her in public, took credit for her work, and otherwise attempted to intimidate her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35-38. Additionally, feeling the need to document that he had successfully been appointed to her position, Mr. Allen took photographs of Ms. Seller's personal possessions in boxes when he moved into her office, and emailed their supervisor, gloating about the fact he was taking over her office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ms. Sellers reported Mr. Allen's hostility to her supervisor, Ted Lopez, and sought\n   his intervention.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. Mr. Lopez took no action but rather, blamed Mr. Allen's hostility on Ms. Sellers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-41. For example, in April 2015, when Ms. Sellers sought out Mr. Lopez's assistance with Mr. Allen's aggressive behavior, Mr. Lopez insisted that Ms. Sellers \"drop it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Concerned for her safety, Ms. Sellers asked if it would take Mr. Allen to actually physically assault her before DHS intervened to which Mr. Lopez responded, \"that's correct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Sellers was also forced to do administrative and secretarial tasks for Mr. Allen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. These duties were far below her grade-level and experience and were an attempt by Mr. Allen and Mr. Lopez to put her in her place as a subordinate to Mr. Allen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In June 2014, Mr. Lopez informed Ms. Sellers that she was to have no contact with INL whatsoever.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. Mr. Lopez did not provide a reason for the no-contact order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Seeking a way out of her predicament, Ms. Sellers began applying to other positions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. In August 2014, Ms. Sellers applied to two GS-14 positions, Liaison to Europol, and Assistant Attach\u00e9 to Pretoria, and achieved scores of 99 and 90 respectively for the positions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. She was the most qualified of all applicants, however, the positions were given to two male employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 10, 2014, Ms. Sellers was notified that she would be removed from the INL team entirely and her remaining administrative responsibilities would be assumed by Mr. Allen and Mr. Chris Nissen, another employee at HSI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. Ms. Sellers often reported her concerns regarding the increased marginalization and lack of responsibilities and duties to Mr. Lopez, but to no avail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. Despite Ms. Sellers' many pleas to Mr. Lopez, no changes were made to provide her with any meaningful duties and responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, she applied for a detail assignment to the National Security Council (\"NSC\") in November 2014 but was not selected for that position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    2. EEO Investigation and Discriminatory Acts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Disturbed by the fact that her duties had gradually diminished, and her remaining duties were given to two men who were less qualified than she was, Ms. Sellers again contacted the EEO on October 23, 2014, alleging discrimination on the basis of her gender and status as caregiver to her recently adopted child.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. Ms. Seller's suspicions that the agency's conduct was motivated by her gender and status as a mother were confirmed soon after when Mr. Lopez told her that the reason her substantive duties were replaced was because she \"was caring for her young daughter\" and explicitly stated he had his \"wife stay at home and take care of all that.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Based on her formal complaint, the agency accepted five claims, three of which are relevant to this action:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Whether U.S. Department of Homeland Security discriminated against Complainant and subjected her to a hostile work environment on the bases of sex (female) pregnancy and reprisal (prior EEO activity) when the following events occurred:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1. On August 5, 2013, Complainant was asked to perform significant amounts of work while on leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   2. On October 15, 2013, Complainant was informed that she was going to be removed as Liaison and was being assigned back to Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) headquarters;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   3. On December 13, 2013, Complainant was instructed to report to HSI, where she was stripped of her Liaison duties\n   and consigned to performing administrative duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Statement of Accepted Claims. Def.'s Mot., Ex. B., ECF No. 10-2 at 2. The Statement of Accepted Claims instructed that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   If you believe that your client's claim has not been correctly identified, please provide to me written clarification within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of this letter, specifying why the claim has not been correctly identified. If a reply is not received within the specified time period, I will consider that you agree with the claim as defined above\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It is undisputed that Ms. Sellers submitted no clarification. However, in her formal administrative complaint she referenced, among other things, that she was \"recently passed over for multiple positions for which she was qualified.\" ECF No. 10-1 at 6. She expressly referenced the two non-selections for the positions she applied for in August of 2014, the Liaison to Europol and Assistant Attach\u00e9 to Pretoria positions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   While Ms. Sellers' EEOC complaint was working its way through the administrative process, life became worse for her at the agency. Ms. Sellers alleges that throughout the administrative process Mr. Allen became increasingly aggressive towards her and threatened to file a formal complaint if she did not stop \"spreading rumors\" about him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. Additionally, the agency blocked several different attempts by Ms. Sellers to obtain promotions. She applied for three positions while her investigation was being conducted: (1) in May 2015, she applied for an Assistant Attach\u00e9 to London position,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62; (2) in 2015, on an unspecified date, she applied for a Liaison to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol position,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63; and (3) in 2015, on an unspecified date, she applied to a position with DHS's one-year Master's Program through National Defense University.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Post-Investigation Discriminatory Acts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After the conclusion of the investigation, on November 23, 2015, Ms. Sellers applied to at least eight more positions and was not selected for any of them. In December 2016, she applied for a detail assignment to the White House Situation Room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. In 2016, on unspecified dates, she applied for a position as Liaison to the Office of National Drug Control Policy,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64, and for a leadership position in the Homeland Security Program,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68. In May and June 2017, she applied for several detail assignments to the NSC including Director for Critical Infrastructure, Director for Cybersecurity, Director for Health and Development, and Director for Security Screening and Vetting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. Last, on an unspecified date in 2017, she applied for another Leadership position in the Homeland Security Program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In 2017, an administrative judge granted the agency's motion to dismiss the 2013 claims for failure to make timely contact with an EEO counselor. Def.'s Mot., Ex. D., ECF No. 10-4 at 2. The administrative judge agreed with defendant that the claims that occurred from August 5, 2013, through December 13, 2013, occurred well outside the 45-day regulatory time-frame since Ms. Sellers contacted the EEO on October 23, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Administrative Judge later clarified that the 2013 claims were only dismissed as discrete claims of discrimination but remain part of Ms. Seller's\n   hostile work environment claim. Def.'s Mot., Ex. E., ECF No. 10-5 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ms. Sellers filed this action alleging discrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment claims, based on her gender and care-giver status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.

Construing all inferences in Ms. Sellers favor, it was not until the following year-after being continually stripped of substantive duties that were given to less qualified men-that she reasonably knew that DHS's actions were motivated by her gender and her status as a caregiver. Specifically, when, on September 10, 2014, she was removed from the INL team entirely. Because the October 23, 2014 EEO contact occurred within 45 days of the September 10, 2014 date, the Court cannot say at this stage of the proceedings that she did not exhaust her administrative remedies as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to Ms. Seller's discrimination claims related to the 2013 adverse acts, and Ms. Sellers' claims for discrimination based on the 2013 adverse acts may proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Court addresses each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    1. 2014 Pre-EEO Complaint Non-Selections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The first two non-selection claims concern two positions that Ms. Sellers applied for in August 2014. Defendant argues that these non-selections should be dismissed because Ms. Sellers did not give the agency an opportunity to investigate those claims when she failed to challenge the Agency's Statement of Accepted Claims which excluded the non-selections. Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 10 at 13. Ms. Sellers argues that the non-selections were included in her formal charge and it is the formal complaint that governs, not the agency's informal statement of accepted issues. Pl.'s Opp'n., ECF No. 13 at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendant acknowledges that Ms. Sellers raised the two August 2014 non-selections in her formal administrative complaint, but faults her for failing to correct the agency when it did not include these two non-selections in its Statement of Accepted Claims.

The Court is not persuaded. This is not a case in which Ms. Sellers alluded to a general failure to select her for some unnamed position at some undisclosed time, both August 2014 non-selections were named by position and date in her formal complaint to the agency. Def.'s Mot., Ex. A., ECF No. 10-1 at 6. This is also not a case in which a plaintiff fails to allege a particular type of discrimination (e.g., race) or claim (e.g., retaliation), and later brings that type of claim in federal court. Such a case would surely fail on exhaustion grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKeithan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4162849\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/803/63/#p68\">\n    803 F.Supp.2d at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing retaliation claim for failure to exhaust when plaintiff failed to include it in his administrative complaint or any allegations that could be construed as a retaliation claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   This Court does not believe that the hardline approach suggested by the defendant is appropriate as a matter of law in this case.

Courts have also recognized denial of detail assignment claims in the retaliation context. For example in\n   <em>\n    Browne v. Donovan\n   </em>\n   , a court refused to endorse the rule that the \"failure to detail does not constitute\n   an adverse employment action for purposes of Title VII's anti-retaliation provision.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219406\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/12/145/#p154\">\n    12 F.Supp.3d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 154 (D.D.C. 2014). The court instead engaged in a highly fact-specific analysis to determine whether the detail was an adverse employment decision and ultimately denied the defendant's motion to dismiss after analyzing the specific details of the position, the opportunities for advancement the position would provide, and whether the failure to detail might dissuade a reasonable employee from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219406\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/12/145/#p154\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (stating the failure to detail plaintiff into the Associate General Counsel position constituted an adverse employment action).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   To be sure, when a plaintiff alleges the denial of a detail but only claims harms-or benefits-that are speculative, a court may find that the failure to detail was not an adverse employment action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maramark v.

However, Ms. Sellers has alleged detail assignments that included, among other things, promotion opportunities with increased pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n., ECF No. 13 at 44. At the pleading stage, it cannot be said that the benefits from the detail assignments she was denied are \"too speculative to constitute an objectively tangible harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Maramark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202935411\">\n    2007 WL 2935411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Accordingly, the defendant's motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Ms. Seller's detailed related non-selections, and Ms. Sellers may proceed on her Title VII claims based on the denial of specific detail assignments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
