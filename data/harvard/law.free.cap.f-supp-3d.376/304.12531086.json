CROTTY, United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   There has long been disagreement in the state of New York over how to define and when to prosecute an individual for possession of a gravity knife. Under the Penal Law, possession of a gravity knife is illegal\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , but a gravity knife is defined by function and not design. A knife is not illegal because it is designed to open by the force of gravity and lock into place; the knife is illegal when it actually opens by the force of gravity and locks into place by means of a procedure used by the District Attorney's office to identify a gravity knife, called the \"wrist flick test.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Because the wrist flick test is a functional one, it is difficult if not impossible for a person who wishes to possess a folding knife to determine whether or not the knife is illegal. For example, a customer might attempt, but fail at applying the wrist flick test on a common folding knife she wishes to purchase at a store in New York, and purchase the knife believing it is permissible because she was unable to get the knife to lock into place. Yet that same customer's consistent use of the knife might loosen a screw over time, making it capable of flicking into locked position when the wrist flick test is applied. Or, a police officer who is more adept than an ordinary customer at conducting the wrist flick test could succeed in getting the knife to lock into place in the store, and the knife could be illegal at the time of purchase without the customer realizing. Or, one police officer who is less adept at the wrist flick test could test out the knife at the time of purchase and fail to flick it open, leading the customer to believe it is legal, even though a second police officer who is more adept at the wrist flick test might succeed at getting it to lock into place the very next day, and could arrest the customer for illegal possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The New York state legislature has attempted but failed to solve the law's inherent enforcement problems. Its last attempt at a clarifying amendment to the gravity knife statute, which is codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20265.01\">\n    N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 265.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) and 265.00(5), was vetoed by the Governor, who found the statute would be even more confusing with the proposed amendment. Courts in New York have considered the issue, both in the context of criminal prosecutions and vagueness challenges, but have sustained the statute. Yet it appears no court has faced a true prospective, as-applied vagueness challenge to the statute, and the Second Circuit has indicated that such a case might succeed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Copeland v.

Cracco claims that it took his arresting officer four or five tries of the wrist flick test to get the knife to lock into place; Defendant Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., in his official capacity as District Attorney for the County of New York (\"Vance\" or the \"District Attorney\"), disagrees and claims that it did not take that many tries. Cracco wants to continue carrying the same type of knife that led to his arrest, but fears he will be prosecuted again. He seeks a declaratory judgment against Vance that: (1) the gravity knife statute as-applied is void for vagueness, and (2) a knife that does not open in response to the wrist flick test on the first or second attempt cannot form the basis for a criminal prosecution under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties have cross moved for summary judgment.

Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 265.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) and 265.00(5) (collectively, \"the gravity knife statute\") were enacted in 1958. Rather Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13 &amp; Ex. DA-1. At that time, Assemblyman Stanley Steingut explained that the gravity knife is \"the successor of the switchblade knife,\" and that the amendment was needed because the gravity knife was being used to circumvent the statute prohibiting possession of certain dangerous weapons. Ex. DA-1 at 5. The New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\") recommended enactment of the amendment, which it described in a report to the Mayor as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The bill defines as a misdemeanor the manufacture, sale or possession of a gravity knife and as a felony the possession of such a knife if previously convicted of any crime. The gravity knife is one which is released from the handle or sheath thereof by gravity or by the application of centrifugal force. When released, it is locked in place by means of a button, spring, lever or other device.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Under the present statutes covering dangerous and unlawful weapons, the switchblade knife is included therein while there is silence as to the gravity knife. There can be no doubt that the gravity knife is as much a hazard to the safety of the general public as the switchblade knife. Since it has been made unlawful to have and possess a switchblade knife, the gravity knife has been most attractive and useful to those engaged in criminal activity. The experience of this Department indicates that gravity knives are being used increasingly as weapons in the perpetration of such crimes as homicides, assault, rape and robbery. Naturally, since it is not unlawful to possess such a knife under present law, the person about to commit such heinous crimes has no fear of being apprehended with such knife in his possession. As a result, one of the deterrent factors in the prevention of serious crimes is lost.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The gravity knife is inherently dangerous. To children and adults not versed in the use of such weapons, this knife can cause very serious injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   For the above reasons, this Department strongly urges the enactment of this proposal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ex. DA-1 at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 2016, the New York Assembly and Senate passed an amendment to the gravity knife statute, which would have excluded from the definition of \"switchblade knife\" and \"gravity knife\" those knives that have \"a spring, detent, or other mechanism, including but not limited to resistance to opening designed to create a bias toward closure and that requires exertion applied to the blade by hand, wrist, or arm to overcome the bias toward closure and open the knife.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 72 Ex. 2. The Governor vetoed the amendment, which he believed \"would create more confusion\n   among law enforcement and knife owners based upon its ambiguous phraseology,\" and which failed to account for his proposed modifications \"that would have allowed crafts and tradespeople to possess these knives without penalty, as well as create an affirmative defense for those who possessed gravity knives with no intent to use it unlawfully.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20265.01\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In his veto statement, the Governor described that the original intent of the gravity knife statute was \"to outlaw a knife created in the 1950s for use by German paratroopers, which could truly open by the force of gravity alone,\" but that \"[t]he law has been subsequently interpreted to include knives that could be opened with a flick of one hand ... result[ing] in a definition that is both amorphous, subject to abuse and could include nearly any pocket knife.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20265.01\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Governor recognized the problem of knife violence in New York, but also the \"absurd\" construct that purchasers of common folding knives that \"are designed, marketed and sold as work tools for construction workers and day laborers at a variety of major retailers across the State ... can be subsequently arrested and prosecuted for mere possession.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20265.01\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Cracco wishes to carry the same type of knife in the future, but fears he will be prosecuted again. He seeks prospective relief that would allow him more easily to determine if the knife is legal to possess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Copeland\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit found against the plaintiffs after applying the facial vagueness standard to the gravity knife statute.\n   <em>\n    Copeland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517299\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/893/101/#p112\">\n    893 F.3d 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Copeland\n   </em>\n   , Cracco argues that the folding knife he possessed did not lock into place on the first try. Instead, he claims that it took four or five tries for Officer Correa to succeed in the wrist flick test. While the District Attorney disputes that it took that many attempts, Cracco did not posit hypothetical unfair enforcement actions, but rather used his own criminal prosecution as the basis for his challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   By its prospective nature, a prospective, as-applied challenge does not seek to redress a past unconstitutional prosecution, but rather relates to conduct that has not yet occurred, which cannot be narrowly proscribed within the tightly limited scope of the exact facts of a previous prosecution. The facts of a future prosecution may differ slightly from Cracco's past prosecution, but he has still limited his challenge to his past conduct. While \"Courts consider prospective, as-applied vagueness challenges comparatively infrequently,\" the Second Circuit has indicated that a prospective, as-applied challenge to the gravity knife statute could look like \"someone previously convicted for carrying what is indisputably a gravity knife ...

Notice of Prohibited Behavior\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The crux of Cracco's vagueness argument is that he has no reliable way of knowing whether the common folding knife he wishes to possess will be viewed as legal or illegal given the text of the gravity knife statute and the procedures used by the District Attorney to enforce the statute. Cracco's position is supported by the record. The District Attorney's argument seems to be that the statute itself and some cases in state and federal court in New York put Cracco on notice that his possession of any folding knife that might at some point respond to the wrist flick test risks criminal prosecution. But it is not the District Attorney's position that any folding knife is a gravity knife. Rather, a knife must open upon application of the wrist flick test to warrant prosecution, even though there is no specific number of attempts of the wrist flick test that is too many. Under this enforcement regime, Cracco has no way of knowing that his past conduct was, or that his intended future conduct will be, criminal under the gravity knife statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   There are several additional factors indicating that Cracco did not have notice that carrying his knife was illegal. First, contrary to the District Attorney's claim, the case law in New York is not clear on what can be considered a gravity knife.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carter v.

The gravity knife statute and the wrist flick test do not allow Cracco to discern whether his intended conduct will be criminally prohibited.
