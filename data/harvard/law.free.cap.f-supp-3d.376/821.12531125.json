PALLMEYER, United States District Judge\n  Karen Tichy (\"Plaintiff\"), on behalf of herself and a putative class of consumers, brings two claims against Defendants Hyatt Hotels Corporation (\"Hyatt\"), Hilton Domestic Operating Company Inc. (\"Hilton\"), Six Continents Hotels, Inc. (\"Six Continents\"), Marriott International, Inc. (\"Marriott\"), and Wyndham Hotel Group LLC (\"Wyndham\"), all of which are major U.S. hotel chains. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated the Sherman Act's prohibition on contracts or conspiracies in restraint of trade,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n  </extracted-citation>\n  . Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants conspired to stop using certain forms of branded keyword search advertising on the Internet, thereby increasing the costs of searching for and booking hotel rooms online. In Count I, Plaintiff alleges a\n  <em>\n   per se\n  </em>\n  violation of\n  <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n  </extracted-citation>\n  . In Count II, Plaintiff alleges, in the alternative, an unreasonable restraint on trade in violation of\n  <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n  </extracted-citation>\n  . Defendants now move to dismiss both counts of Plaintiff's complaint.

The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff is a resident of Clarksville, Virginia. (First Amended Class Action Complaint [58] (\"First Am. Compl.\") \u00b6 15.) She used the Internet to search for, reserve, and purchase hotel rooms from one or more of the Defendants in the United States in 2015, 2016, and 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant Hyatt is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Illinois. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Hyatt controls thirteen hotel brands, including 739 properties in fifty-seven countries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Hilton is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Virginia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Hilton's parent controls 5,168 hotels in 103 countries and territories. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Six Continents is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Georgia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Six Continents' parent, InterContinental Hotels Group, PLC (\"IHG\") controls 5,273 hotels in nearly 100 countries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Marriott is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Maryland. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Marriott controls more than 6,000 hotels in 122 countries and territories. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Wyndham is a Delaware corporation with its primary place of business in New Jersey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) The Wyndham chain is the largest hotel company in the world. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It controls more than 8,300 hotels worldwide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Collectively, Defendants \"control a substantial percentage of available hotel rooms in the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Online Travel Agencies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Most hotel rooms are sold either directly from a hotel's website or through online travel agencies (OTAs) and their affiliates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61 (alleging that \"[t]he online booking penetration rate in the United States is nearly 70%\").) OTAs, such as Expedia and Priceline, are entities \"organized to effectuate travel plans, reservations, and purchases\" through the Internet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) OTAs were \"virtually unknown\" \"[a]s recently as 1997,\" but the online travel industry \"has seen explosive growth and consolidation\" in recent years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   OTAs \"obtain access to room inventories through lodging agreements with ... hotels.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) Using OTAs' Internet portals, consumers can view a wide variety of hotel rooms available in a particular location on a particular date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 33.) Consumers can \"easily view and compare prices, ratings, features, locations, and other relevant data about hotels from major chains, like the Defendants,\" and independent hotels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Many OTA websites also display consumers' written reviews of hotels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.) When a consumer finds a desirable room, he or she can book it on the OTA's website. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) OTAs have become more popular with consumers as technology has advanced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   OTAs \"put downward pressure on the prices of hotel rooms because they expose the consumer to a wide variety of competitive choices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35 (stating that OTAs put \"negative pressure on room pricing\" because they \"make relevant pricing and quality information readily available to and easy for consumers to compare\").) Hotels, including Defendants, pay a price for OTAs' services: When a customer books a hotel room on an OTA website, the hotel generally pays the OTA a commission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) Defendants typically pay commissions ranging from twelve to twenty percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) And when a customer books a room on an OTA website rather than a hotel website, the hotel loses the chance to directly build customer loyalty and obtain \"data associated with that customer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Despite the costs associated with OTAs, Defendants rely on them \"to sell a large number and percentage of their rooms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) Indeed, OTAs \"are responsible for as much as 50% of\" Defendants' online bookings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) Collectively, Defendants and OTAs \"account for over 75% of all hotel rooms reserved online.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) More than 90 percent of OTA bookings are made through Expedia, Priceline, and their affiliates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because OTAs are popular with consumers, \"any single Defendant that decided to stop making inventory available to the OTAs would be at a significant competitive disadvantage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) In other words, if one Defendant stopped providing inventory to OTAs, OTA users might navigate directly to that Defendant's website, but \"would likely see and book competitive alternatives on the OTA site.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants therefore \"find it in their business interest to continue to use the OTAs to sell their rooms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Branded Keyword Search Advertising\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A consumer who wants to book a hotel room online can do so in several ways. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) For example, she can navigate directly to a hotel website, such as Hilton.com. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Alternatively, she can navigate directly to an OTA website. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Or, she can begin her search by typing a query into an Internet search engine like Google.com or Bing.com. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that \"many\" consumers \"begin their search[es]\" on Internet search engines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72 (estimating that the putative class could comprise thousands of consumers and businesses).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The words comprising a search term in an Internet search engine-such as \"Honolulu Hyatt\"-are called \"keywords.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) When a consumer enters a keyword into a search engine, the search engine typically returns two types of results: \"algorithmic\" results and \"paid search\" results (advertisements). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Search engines generate revenue by auctioning keywords to advertisers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Advertisers bid an amount they are willing to pay for a consumer to click on a keyword, and if they win, their advertisement will appear in the paid search results for that keyword. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Paid search results typically appear at the top of search results, above algorithmic results. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 28.) The number of advertisements returned in response to a search can vary by search and search engine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Bidding to have an advertisement appear in response to a keyword containing a brand or trademarked name, such as \"Hyatt,\" is called branded keyword search advertising. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) \"Frequently, the brand owner will bid on these keywords, as will competitors and sellers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Thus, for example, \"a search for 'New York Hilton' might present advertisements for not only Hilton, but Hilton competitors like Marriott or Hyatt, and sellers of hotel rooms, like [OTAs].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Branded keyword advertising is a \"highly effective\" strategy \"because it allows an advertiser to target an audience of people searching for a particular product.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) The hotel owner, the hotel's competitors, and OTAs all have incentives to bid on that hotel's branded keywords. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The hotel owner's incentives include \"maximiz[ing] the chance of converting [the potential consumer] to a sale.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) If the hotel owner is successful, it avoids paying a commission it might otherwise have paid to an OTA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36 (\"[A]n identically priced room [booked] through the hotel website is usually more profitable to the Defendants.\").) It also \"get[s] the opportunity to establish a direct relationship with [the] customer, including the collection of commercially important data about [her] and the ability to introduce [her] to other offerings within that brand.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Preventing the customer from visiting an OTA or competitor's website also \"reduces the chances of that customer being exposed to competitive offerings that might prove more attractive or less expensive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For OTAs, the incentive to bid on the hotel's branded keyword \"is the opportunity to get the customer to visit their website[s] to see offers on that hotel as well as many others, make the booking, earn a commission, and establish a relationship with that customer that might lead to additional business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) And for the hotel's competitors, \"the incentive is to present competing offers ... in hopes it will prove more attractive than the brand for which the customer was searching.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) \"Appearing at or near the top of a search results page\" is in the interest of each of these market participants, and bidding on branded keywords \"can help ensure that happens.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Prior to 2015, OTAs and competing hotel chains commonly bid for hotel branded\n   keywords. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2013, a company called BrandVerity \"monitored search results for hotels' branded keywords.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) BrandVerity produced a study that stated, \"OTAs bid on hotels' branded keywords rather extensively. For example, on a given SERP (search engine results page) the brand's ad(s) will typically be situated among multiple OTA ads. OTAs will also occupy the # 1 ad position on a significant percentage of SERPs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The study also stated, \"In certain situations, brand bidding by OTAs can be useful to the brand-ensuring that a potential customer doesn't book with a competitor. In others, it may be harmful-reducing the brand's traffic and direct bookings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that branded keyword advertising in the hotel industry facilitated a \"robust exchange of competitive marketplace information\" and put downward pressure on hotel room prices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Industry Conferences\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants' representatives attended the Dallas Hotel Conference in November 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) There, \"industry expert Dan Lesser,\" who is not alleged to be a Defendant representative, gave a presentation in which he stated, \"technology advances with OTA's continue negative pressure on room pricing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Daniel Lesser,\n   <em>\n    U.S. Lodging Fundamentals: Paradigm Shift or Movie Rerun?\n   </em>\n   , 4 (Nov. 19, 2014) (\"Lesser Presentation\"), available at http://www.dallashotelconference.com/Documents/2014_Dallas_Hotel_Conference_Presentations.pdf (last visited Mar. 17, 2019.) Lesser also \"called on the hotels to 'RAISE ROOM RATES aggressively NOW.' \" (First Am. Compl. \u00b6 43 (quoting Lesser Presentation 8).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Katherine Lugar, then the CEO of the American Hotel and Lodging Association (AHLA), also gave a presentation at the conference. (First Am. Compl. \u00b6 44.) She \"call[ed] for 'Unity' and 'Stronger, better alignment.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Katherine Lugar,\n   <em>\n    AH &amp; LA and Legislative Update: Policy Priorities\n   </em>\n   , 2 (Nov. 19, 2014) (\"Lugar Presentation\"), available at http://www.dallashotelconference.com/Documents/2014_Dallas_Hotel_Conference_Presentations.pdf (last visited Mar. 17, 2019.) Lugar also \"identified 'Deceptive Ad Buys: Unauthorized Purchase of Words' \" as \"a practice that needed to be addressed.\" (First Am. Compl. \u00b6 44 (quoting Lugar Presentation 22).) Plaintiff alleges that Lugar was \"referring to the purchase of branded keywords by OTAs.\" (First Am. Compl. \u00b6 44.) At the time Lugar gave her presentation, a representative from each of Hyatt, Hilton, Marriott, Wyndham, and IHG was serving on the AHLA board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Defendants' Alleged Conspiracy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that \"in or about 2015\"-\"[f]ollowing the meeting in Dallas, and through that meeting and meetings of the AHLA\"-\"Defendants agreed to prevent branded keyword advertising by three means and agreements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) First, Defendants \"agreed with each other to stop bidding for each other's branded keywords.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Second, Defendants agreed, going forward, to incorporate provisions into their OTA lodging agreements that prohibited OTAs from bidding on Defendants' branded keywords, and required OTAs to attempt to prohibit affiliated OTAs from doing the same. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 49.) Third, each Defendant revised its existing written lodging agreements with OTAs\n   Expedia and Priceline as just described. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 51-53, 55.) The November 2015 agreement between Marriott and Expedia, for example, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   No Party will knowingly use in any way, including a bid in paid search engine advertising, any other Parties [sic] intellectual property, including the trademarks that are listed in Exhibit G and are owned by or licensed to Expedia or Marriott, as applicable (whether or not registered) for use in connection with hotel services. Expedia will list Marriott Marks listed in Exhibit G as well as its common misspelling as negative keywords as indicated in order to prevent its ads from appearing as a result of a search for those terms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) And the August 2015 agreement between Hilton and Expedia provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [N]either Party shall knowingly bid on or otherwise use any of the other Party's trademarks ... or common misspellings for use in connection with hotel services with the intent of targeting specifically the other Party's properties or services. Each Party shall actively apply negative keywords for the Marks and common misspellings of the other Party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In 2015, Plaintiff alleges, Defendants in fact stopped bidding on each other's branded keywords. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) They also began sending cease-and-desist letters to \"affiliate OTAs,\" meaning OTAs that \"obtain their inventory from top tier OTAs like Expedia or Priceline who have direct relationships with\" Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) The cease-and-desist letters sought to prevent the affiliate OTAs from bidding on Defendants' branded keywords. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that \"Defendants did not act unilaterally or independently, or in their own economic interests, when: (a) entering into the agreements; (b) refusing to engage in competitive branded keyword advertising against one another; and (c) imposing branded keyword advertising restrictions on the OTAs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84, 93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

Parallel Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that prior to 2015, hotels and OTAs \"regularly bid for branded keywords.\" (First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 29-30.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Beginning in 2015,\" Plaintiff alleges,\n   each Defendant changed its behavior: it (1) stopped bidding on the other Defendants' branded keywords and (2) revised its contracts with OTAs Expedia and Priceline to prohibit them from bidding on its branded keywords. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50, 51.) The OTA agreements quoted in Plaintiff's complaint contain nearly identical terms-including that the\n   <em>\n    Defendant\n   </em>\n   stop bidding on the\n   <em>\n    OTA's\n   </em>\n   branded keywords. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.) The agreements use similar language and were reached within three months of each other. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff also alleges that, beginning in 2015, each Defendant began sending letters to affiliate OTAs demanding that they cease and desist from bidding on its branded keywords. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) These allegations appear to make a threshold showing of parallel conduct; indeed, Defendants have not explicitly argued otherwise. Instead, they contend that Plaintiff has not made any allegations that place the parallel conduct \"in a context suggestive of conspiracy.\" (Defs.' Mot. 9.) For the reasons that follow, the court disagrees, and concludes that Plaintiff has \"nudged [her] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Additional Factual Circumstances\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the following factual allegations show that Defendants' parallel conduct resulted from a conspiratorial agreement rather than from \"chance, coincidence, independent responses to common stimuli, or mere interdependence unaided by an advance understanding among the parties\" (Pl.'s Opp. 4 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   556 n.4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ): (1) Defendants had motive and incentive to \"collude\" to \"steer customers away from\" OTA websites; (2) a Defendant that unilaterally engaged in the alleged conduct \"would be acting against its economic self-interest\"; (3) Defendants used industry meetings in 2014 and 2015 \"to discuss, coordinate, and arrive at their illegal scheme\"; (4) Defendants' parallel conduct began soon after the meetings, in 2015; and (5) Defendants and OTAs frequently bid on Defendants' branded keywords before the conspiracy, and the result the conspiracy \"is visible in the search results of the major search engines.\" (Pl.'s Opp. 4-8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   First Am.

Motive and Incentive\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff notes, first, that OTAs exert downward pressure on online hotel room prices, charge Defendants booking commissions, and interfere with Defendants' customer relationships. Thus, Plaintiff asserts, Defendants had motive and incentive to conspire as alleged-that is, to divert customers away from OTA websites and to their own. As Defendants point out, however, these same conditions could have prompted each Defendant to unilaterally restrict OTA advertising. The court agrees with Defendants that the drawbacks OTAs pose for them do not, in isolation, suggest that Defendants conspired to address them. Rather, parallel behavior aimed at reducing OTA-related costs could \"just as well be independent action\" in \"response[ ] to common stimuli.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   , at 556 n.4, 557,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Baby Food Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397117\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/112/#p118\">\n    166 F.3d at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that if \"a motive to achieve higher prices\" were sufficient to allege conspiracy, \"every company in every industry\" would be accused of conspiracy).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Actions Against Economic Self-Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   A second argument has more traction: Plaintiff contends that bidding on competitors' keywords benefits each Defendant, and that any Defendant's unilateral choice to stop the practice would be contrary to its economic self-interest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. 5.) And, Plaintiff asserts, a Defendant would likewise act against its economic self-interest by unilaterally restricting OTA advertising as alleged. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 84, 93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiff's factual allegations, viewed in the light most favorable to her, reasonably suggest that the practice of bidding on competitors' keywords benefits each Defendant. Many consumers begin hotel room searches by querying online search engines; a Defendant that bids on competitors' branded keywords can win prized advertising space in those search results; and a Defendant that wins prized advertising space gains an opportunity to take business away from its competitors. Plaintiff's factual allegations also reasonably suggest that by unilaterally ceasing the practice, a Defendant (say, Marriott) would be acting against its economic interest. Marriott would not only forego opportunities to take business away from the other Defendants, but also decrease the likelihood that consumers searching for Marriott would visit Marriott.com. That is because, without coordinated action, all other Defendants' advertisements could appear at the top of the results for a Marriott-branded search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Similar inferences can reasonably be drawn regarding the Defendant-OTA bidding practices. Allowing OTAs to bid on a Defendant's keywords (say, Hilton's) can benefit Hilton if its competitors are also bidding on Hilton's keywords. That is because OTA advertisements, presented alongside Hilton\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   competitors' advertisements, can provide Hilton a second chance to win consumers' business. Hilton prefers that consumers book rooms directly on its website, but its next-best scenario is not losing bookings to competitors-it is winning bookings indirectly through OTAs. A Defendant that unilaterally prohibits OTAs from bidding on its keywords loses this opportunity but continues to face the same amount of competition from other Defendants. Unilateral action, therefore, plausibly damages a Defendant's economic interest. Similarly, it is reasonable to infer that a Defendant (say, Wyndham) benefits from bidding on OTAs' branded keywords. This is because if Wyndham's advertisements appear in response to customers' searches for OTAs' words, Wyndham gains an opportunity to win bookings directly from its website. If Wyndham unilaterally agrees to stop bidding on OTAs' branded words, it loses that chance. Meanwhile, consumers could continue seeing advertisements for all other Defendants at the top of their OTA-branded search results. Unilaterally adopting the alleged OTA agreements, therefore, can reasonably be said to damage a Defendant's economic interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendants respond that there are obvious, alternative business reasons that would prompt a Defendant to unilaterally stop bidding on each other's keywords. First, according to Defendants, they do not necessarily benefit from bidding on competitors' keywords. (Defs.' Reply 10.) Keyword advertising \"isn't free,\" Defendants contend, and bidding on competitors' keywords targets only \"consumers who have already expressed an interest in a competitor's\n   brand by using it in their searches.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff \"alleges no facts,\" Defendants argue, \"to suggest that this particular means of advertising ... would be a sound use of [a] Defendant's limited marketing resources.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants further argue that it is perfectly normal for a business to refrain from chasing down every possible opportunity to compete. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397117\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/112/#p118\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 10-11 &amp; nn.6-7 (noting that in\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   , the Court found that allegations regarding defendants' \"common failure\" to pursue seemingly advantageous business opportunities did not plausibly suggest a conspiracy because no business \"enters every market that an outside observer might regard as profitable\" (quoting\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 551, 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted) ) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendants make similar arguments regarding parallel adoption of the alleged OTA agreements. Defendants emphasize that the complaint itself references the costs OTAs impose on Defendants, and argue that restricting OTA advertising as alleged could reduce those costs. The alleged advertising restrictions, Defendants maintain, channel the services OTAs provide into targeting consumers who have not already expressed a branded interest. (Defs.' Mot. 9-10.) Defendants explain the alleged cease-and-desist letters similarly: the costs that OTAs impose on Defendants would justify sending the letters, as would the need for each Defendant to enforce its contracts with Expedia and Priceline. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 11 n.3.) More generally, Defendants argue that \"[s]imilar contract terms can reflect similar bargaining power and commercial goals\" rather than conspiratorial behavior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Elevator Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5526453\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/47/#p51\">\n    502 F.3d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51 (2d Cir. 2007).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For a handful of reasons, the court finds Defendants' alternative explanations unconvincing. First, Defendants examine each form of keyword advertising in isolation, ignoring how any Defendant's unilateral choice to restrict only one form would leave it more vulnerable to competition from the other Defendants. Defendants also overemphasize consumers' brand loyalty. Indeed, viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, hotels' willingness to spend money bidding on branded keywords-and search engines' common practice of auctioning them-reasonably suggest that branded keyword advertising works. That is, even brand-interested hotel consumers are willing to (and do) book rooms from other hotels, depending on the advertisements they see.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Even if Defendants' alternative explanations are plausible, they do not negate the plausibility of Plaintiff's competing explanation: that Defendants would not have unilaterally restricted branded keyword advertising as alleged without a preceding agreement, because doing so would harm their economic interests.

The RPM agreements ensured that (1) \"each OTA would not discount below each hotel website's published rate,\" and (2) \"each hotel was providing each OTA with its lowest online rate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090096\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/997/526/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the OTA defendants allegedly agreed not to compete with each other.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090096\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/997/526/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The court determined that \"common economic experience and the Complaint itself\" offered obvious explanations for the individual RPM agreements, which were the \"real nub\" of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090096\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/997/526/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090096\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/997/526/\">\n    at 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Namely, hotels \"highly value\" \"the right to control online pricing for their rooms,\" and OTAs, \"[h]aving given up the right to discount prices below each Hotel Defendant's published rate,\" would \"naturally want an assurance that competitors will also be prohibited from\" doing so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090096\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/997/526/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090096\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/997/526/\">\n    at 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court next determined that defendants' common motives for the parallel conduct\n   were, \"at best, merely consistent with a conspiracy\"; characterized as \"unsupported conclusion[s]\" plaintiffs' arguments that defendants' actions were against their economic interests; and offered economic explanations for why any hotel-OTA pair would adopt and enforce an RPM agreement absent the conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090096\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/997/526/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090096\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/997/526/\">\n    at 538-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Other alleged \"factual enhancements\" were also insufficient to plausibly suggest a conspiracy, so the court dismissed plaintiffs' antitrust claims without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090096\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/997/526/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090096\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/997/526/\">\n    at 539-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Here, the court has carefully considered Plaintiff's factual allegations concerning branded keyword advertising in the hotel industry, including Defendants' pre-conspiracy use of it and the potential it creates even for brand-interested consumers to change their purchasing behavior in response to strategically-placed advertisements. For the reasons already discussed, Plaintiff goes beyond offering \"unsupported conclusion[s]\" in contending that a Defendant would damage its economic interest by unilaterally adopting the alleged advertising restrictions.\n   <em>\n    In re OTC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090096\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/997/526/\">\n    997 F.Supp.2d at 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court reaches this conclusion even though vertical restrictions on advertisements might be less overtly anticompetitive than the alleged vertical price restrictions in\n   <em>\n    In re OTC\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. 3.) And although Defendants have offered alternative, self-interested explanations for their parallel behavior, the court has concluded that it would be improper at this stage to credit them when Plaintiff has placed Defendants' parallel behavior in a context suggestive of a conspiracy. To the extent the court's findings in\n   <em>\n    In re OTC\n   </em>\n   are inconsistent with this opinion, this court respectfully disagrees with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. 2014 Dallas Hotel Conference and AHLA Board Membership\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiff identifies other circumstances she deems indicative of conspiracy, as well. The court finds these other circumstances less compelling, but addresses them for completeness. Thus, Plaintiff alleges that hotels frequently discussed their frustration with OTAs at industry events and meetings, and that Defendants used the 2014 Dallas Hotel Conference and unspecified \"AHLA meetings\" to discuss and formulate their conspiracy (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39, 43, 45;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. 5.) As Defendants note, however, these allegations lack relevant detail. Plaintiff contends that at the conference, Lesser gave a presentation in which he mentioned that OTAs exert negative pressure on room prices and stated, \"RAISE ROOM RATES aggressively NOW.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) The complaint does not indicate, however, that the OTA comment had any relation to the pricing comment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090096\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/997/526/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Nor does Plaintiff allege that Lesser encouraged hotels to set prices in coordination, let alone fix prices through branded advertising restrictions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090096\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/997/526/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff does not even allege that any Defendant attended Lesser's presentation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090096\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/997/526/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiff's allegations concerning Lugar's presentation at the conference are similarly underwhelming. Plaintiff alleges that Lugar, then the CEO of the AHLA, \"called upon hotels\" to unify, including to \"to stop the 'unauthorized purchase of words.' \" (First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.) But as Defendants point out, Plaintiff takes this comment out of context. Lugar's slides unequivocally demonstrate that her comment concerned OTAs' apparent practice of \"fooling\" consumers by putting hotel names or parts of hotel Internet addresses into links that lead to OTAs' websites-not that hotels wanted OTAs to stop bidding on their branded keywords. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lugar Presentation 35-36.) In addition, although Plaintiff alleges that specific Defendant representatives were on the AHLA board when Lugar gave the presentation, she\n   does not allege that any of them (or any other Defendant representatives) attended the presentation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.) Finally, Plaintiff claims that Defendants formulated and \"arrive[d] at\" their scheme \"through\" the AHLA board members and meetings, but alleges no other details.

Ill. 2011) (\"\n   <em>\n    Kleen I\n   </em>\n   \"), Defendants' actions in this case \"suspiciously followed an important industry conference.\" (Pl.'s Opp. 8.) She alleges, further, that Defendants reached their agreement \"[i]n or about 2015,\" stopped bidding on each other's branded keywords in 2015, entered the vertical agreements with OTAs in 2015, and began sending cease-and-desist letters to affiliate OTAs in 2015. (First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 50-51, 54.) But Plaintiff identifies only one specific meeting that occurred before Defendants allegedly took these actions: the November 2014 Dallas Hotel Conference. As discussed above, Plaintiff fails to plead any facts that plausibly link that conference to Defendants' alleged conspiracy. Furthermore, Plaintiff's allegations concerning\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   in 2015 Defendants reached and executed their agreements are vague. Plaintiff's most detailed allegation in this regard is that Hilton and Marriott reached agreements with OTAs in August 2015 and November 2015, respectively-nine months and a year after the Dallas conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiff's allegations thus differ sharply from those in\n   <em>\n    In re Broiler Chicken Antitrust Litigation\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kleen I\n   </em>\n   , where plaintiffs alleged patterns of meetings closely followed by anomalous market behavior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Broiler Chicken Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523415\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/290/772/#p790\">\n    290 F.Supp.3d at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Here, where Plaintiffs' [sic] have alleged suspicious timing of important industry conferences in January 2008 and 2011, followed by unusual producer\n   actions and market movements, those meetings plausibly help to fill-out the picture of Defendants' alleged conspiratorial agreement.\");\n   <em>\n    Kleen I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3830092\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/775/1071/#p1080\">\n    775 F.Supp.2d at 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is striking that all Defendants repeatedly-twice in each of 2005 and 2006 and once in each of 2007 and 2008-raised their prices soon after an industry event....

In contrast with these cases, Plaintiff's allegations concerning the timing between industry conferences and parallel conduct do not raise suspicions, and therefore do not provide \"factual context suggesting agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    v. Abrupt Shift in Internet Search Results\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff appears to argue that an abrupt, visible change in Internet search results is an additional factual circumstance that plausibly suggests Defendants reached an illegal agreement. Plaintiff, for example, alleges that before 2015, OTAs and competing hotels commonly \"bid[ ] for branded keywords, aggressively competing for those customers' business.\" (First Am. Compl. \u00b6 30 (citing 2013 BrandVerity study).) She also alleges that during that time, consumers searching for a Defendant's branded keyword might see advertisements for not only that Defendant's hotels, but also other Defendants' hotels and OTAs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Plaintiff alleges that as a result of Defendants' conspiracy, the search results now look much different: if advertisements for other Defendants' hotels or OTAs appear at all, they no longer appear at or near the top of the results. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In response, Defendants emphasize Plaintiff's allegation that she \"began to notice\" the change in 2015, 2016, and 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Reply 8; First Am Compl. \u00b6 15.) They argue that a \"gradual adoption of similar practices\" \"over the course of a year or more\" refutes an inference of a preceding agreement because it could just as easily reflect rational, independent responses to common market conditions. (Defs.' Reply 8.) The court disagrees. First, reading Plaintiff's allegation in the light most favorable to her, it can be interpreted as alleging that the shift in search results occurred abruptly, but that Plaintiff herself noticed it gradually. Second, even assuming the shift occurred over a year or more, Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint can reasonably be read to allege that there was a stable pattern of advertising in the market for online hotel rooms followed by a noticeable and lasting change. Considered with the plausible allegations that a Defendant would have harmed its economic interest by unilaterally adopting the advertising restrictions at issue, the court is satisfied that the visible change in search results supports an inference that Defendants agreed to adopt the restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The court recognizes that most of the factual circumstances alleged in Plaintiff's complaint do not provide \"context suggesting agreement, as distinct from identical, independent action.\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, by ceasing to bid on other Defendants' (or OTAs') branded keywords, the independently-acting Defendant would sacrifice opportunities to win direct bookings and decrease the chance that a consumer searching for Defendant would visit its website. And by prohibiting OTAs from bidding on its keywords, the independently-acting Defendant would decrease the likelihood of winning indirect bookings, yet continue to face just as much advertising competition from other Defendants. Plaintiff's allegations in this regard are, if not overwhelming, certainly sufficient to support an inference that Defendants reached a preceding agreement to restrict branded advertising.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So, too, are her allegations that Defendants departed from an established advertising pattern, and that search results reflect the departure.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) Defendants then cite several cases in which courts determined that plaintiffs lacked antitrust standing because their alleged injuries were derivative of harm that buyers and sellers in the relevant market suffered directly. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 &amp; n.11 (citing, among other cases,\n   <em>\n    Midwest Gas Servs., Inc. v.

Compl. \u00b6 61.) Consumers, like Plaintiff, who search for and purchase hotel rooms online are undoubtedly participants in that market. Their alleged injuries are distinct from, not derivative of, harm that online search engines may have suffered. Plaintiff properly asserts claims arising from these injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loeb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11438965\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/469/#p481\">\n    306 F.3d at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Defendants next argue that Plaintiff's claims must fail because, contrary to Plaintiff's allegations, searches for a Defendant's branded keywords do still return advertisements for competing Defendants' hotels and OTAs. Defendants have attached four examples of search results to their motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. 17-18 (citing Exs. A to D to Defs.' Mot. (Google Search Results for \"Honolulu Hyatt,\" \"Detroit Marriott,\" \"Los Angeles Intercontinental,\" and \"Chicago Hilton,\" respectively).) ) Furthermore, Defendants contend that their Google Search Result for \"Honolulu Hyatt\" undermines even Plaintiff's allegation that Defendants manipulated only the search results that appear at the top of the page: the first search result for \"Honolulu Hyatt,\" Defendants say, is a Google Maps box that contains three links, each of which leads to a different webpage that contains links to OTA websites. (Defs.' Mot. 17 (citing Google Search Result for \"Honolulu Hyatt\"); Defs.' Reply, 12 (referring to\n   same).) Plaintiff acknowledges that Defendants' \"Honolulu Hyatt\" search result is \"inconsistent\" with the one she cites in her complaint. (Pl.'s Opp. 15 &amp; n.89;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   First Am. Compl. \u00b6 56). Plaintiff, however, has provided the court with a third example of the search, where the first result is a link to Hyatt's website, not the Google Maps box. (Pl.'s Opp. 15 &amp; n.89; Ex. 1 to Decl. of Zoran Tasic in Supp. of Pl.'s Opp. [81-2].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The court will consider the search results attached to the parties' briefing because they directly relate to, and provide a fuller picture of, the search results Plaintiff cites in her complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    188 LLC v. Trinity Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11422608\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/300/730/#p735\">\n    300 F.3d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735 (7th Cir. 2002) (\"[D]ocuments attached to a motion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff's complaint and are central to his claim.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). The search results contain visibly more advertisements for the owner of the branded keyword-including at the top of the page-than for competitors and OTAs. Notably, even the Google Maps box that appears in the results for Defendants' \"Honolulu Hyatt\" search does not itself contain advertisements for OTAs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. A to Defs.' Mot.) Rather, a consumer sees OTA links only if she clicks Hyatt-labeled links in the Google Maps box, which take her to a different page. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11422608\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/300/730/#p735\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Accepting as true Plaintiff's allegations that pre-2015 searches would likely generate a much wider variety of competitive advertisements, including at the top of the page, the newly submitted search results (along with those cited in Plaintiff's complaint) support Plaintiff's theory that Defendants manipulated the results of searches for their branded keywords.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The court is also unpersuaded by Defendants' related argument that, because advertisements for OTAs and competing hotels still appear somewhere in (or are indirectly accessible from) search results, Plaintiff fails to sufficiently allege proximate causation. Accepting Plaintiff's allegations as true and drawing reasonable inferences in her favor, Plaintiff plausibly alleges that many consumers query Internet search engines using branded hotel keywords to find, compare, and book hotel rooms. She also plausibly alleges that before 2015, Defendants bid on each other's (and OTAs') branded keywords to win those consumers' business. And she plausibly alleges that \"the quality and quantity of informative advertising\" that those consumers see today is inferior to that which they saw before 2015. (First Am.

But for reasons previously discussed, Plaintiff's allegations reasonably permit the inference that hotel consumers' brand loyalty is not absolute: consumers are willing to book hotels from different Defendants depending on the comparative information they see. Plaintiff's allegations-including that many consumers begin their hotel searches by querying Internet search engines with branded keywords-also permit the inference that before 2015, a major form of competition among Defendants was the battle for advertising space associated with those searches. So although Plaintiff does not allege that OTAs \"offered identical rooms at lower prices than\" those on Defendants' websites (Defs.' Mot. 18; Defs.' Reply 14), her allegations nonetheless permit the inference that Defendants feel less pressure to price competitively now than they did before 2015, when consumers were more likely to see competing advertisements at the top of their branded searches. Just as in\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   , therefore, the alleged advertising restrictions in this case could plausibly have caused consumers to pay higher prices for hotel rooms purchased online.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Defendants next argue that Plaintiff does not sufficiently plead proximate causation because the information available to consumers about competing hotel rooms is \"pervasive\" and the alleged advertising restrictions affect only a \"tiny subset\" of it.

Reply 15 (challenging the proposition that \"any advertising restraint itself constitutes an anticompetitive effect no matter how small and regardless of whether it actually affected prices or output\").) Defendants point out that consumers can navigate directly to hotel websites, and that the alleged advertising restrictions do not prevent Defendants from advertising \"against each other\" on price, quality, and other parameters. (Defs.' Mot. 19.) Defendants also point out that the alleged restrictions do not prevent advertisements for non-Defendant-owned hotels from appearing at the top of search results for Defendants' branded keywords. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/#p388\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, Defendants\n   emphasize that consumers can navigate directly to OTA websites. In this vein, Defendants seize on Plaintiff's allegations that OTAs are becoming more popular and continue to exert downward pressure on pricing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/#p388\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The court is not persuaded that to adequately plead proximate causation, Plaintiff must allege that Defendants' conspiracy eliminated all comparative information from the marketplace. In suggesting that Plaintiff must do so, Defendants cite\n   <em>\n    CDC Technologies, Inc. v. IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857736\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/74/#p81\">\n    186 F.3d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 81 (2d Cir. 1999), where the court, on summary judgment, determined that defendant's exclusive dealing arrangements with distributors did not have an anticompetitive effect. Plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    CDC Technologies\n   </em>\n   had offered \"scant evidence\" that the exclusive dealing arrangements \"impeded [plaintiff's] ability to reach the ultimate consumers\" of the product.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857736\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/74/#p81\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Again, in this case the court is enforcing a pleading standard, not requiring Plaintiffs to identify relevant admissible evidence in support of their claim, as it would on summary judgment. Plaintiff here plausibly alleges that Defendants' advertising restrictions affect much more than a \"tiny subset\" of comparative information. Rather, they reduce the likelihood that significant numbers of consumers will see or take the extra step to find such information. Viewing Plaintiff's allegations in the light most reasonable to her, this is true even of OTA websites: OTAs' popularity might be increasing, but the alleged restrictions block consumers' paths to them. And although OTAs may continue to exert negative pressure on pricing, Plaintiff plausibly alleges that they are doing so to a lesser degree now than before the alleged conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   That Plaintiff visited Marriott.com and purchased hotel rooms there does not mean that she has insufficiently pleaded proximate causation, either. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. 18 (quoting First Am. Compl. \u00b6 15).) Indeed, Plaintiff alleges that she visited the Marriott.com website only after she queried Google.com using hotel keywords and noticed fewer competitive advertisements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Am. Compl. \u00b6 15.) As a result, she purchased hotel rooms directly from a Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857736\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/74/#p81\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) These allegations reasonably permit the inference that Defendants' conspiracy operated exactly as intended. The court declines to credit the competing inference that Defendants offer: Plaintiff caused her own injuries by using ineffective search methods. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply 15.) Likewise, Plaintiff's allegation that she navigated directly to Marriott.com to \"save time\" does not necessarily mean she did not incur higher search costs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857736\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/74/#p81\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Rather, on at least one occasion, she first queried an Internet search engine using a branded keyword, and then, unsatisfied with the comparative information she saw, navigated directly to Marriott.com. (First Am. Compl. \u00b6 15.) These allegations adequately plead that searching the Internet for hotel rooms requires more time and effort now than it did before Defendants' alleged conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Defendants' cited cases do not change the court's conclusion that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged proximate causation. For example, although the court in\n   <em>\n    Loeb\n   </em>\n   determined that apportioning damages for copper scrap dealers' harm would be too complex because so many factors affect scrap pricing, it did so based on evidence, including expert analysis, produced during the class certification stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11438965\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/469/#p481\">\n    306 F.3d at 478-80, 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
