INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff American Freedom Defense Initiative (\"American Freedom\") is a non-profit \"human rights organization dedicated to freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of religion, freedom from religion and individual rights.\" Dkt. No. 58, Ex. 7 (Geller Dep. at 15-16). Plaintiffs Pamela Geller (\"Geller\") and Robert Spencer (\"Spencer\") co-founded the organization and are Executive Director and Associate Director, respectively. Geller and Spencer engage in free speech activity through projects involving American Freedom. One such project involves posting advertisements on advertising space offered by various government transportation entities throughout the United States. American Freedom sought to place such advertising on Detroit metropolitan area buses operated by Defendant Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (\"SMART\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   SMART is a governmental agency required to comply with federal and state laws, including the U.S. Constitution. At the times relevant to this lawsuit, Defendant Dennis Hertel (\"Hertel\") was the General Manager for SMART and Defendant Beth Gibbons (\"Gibbons\") was the Marketing Program Manager of SMART. Hertel had decision-making authority to accept or reject advertising pursuant to SMART's advertising guidelines. Gibbons also had decision-making authority with regard to advertisements on SMART buses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 12, 2010, Plaintiffs submitted the following advertisement to SMART for display on its buses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Fatwa on your head? Is your family or community threatening you? Leaving Islam?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Got questions? Get answers! RefugefromIslam.com\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that they entered into a contract with SMART's advertising agent to run the ad. On May 24, 2010, Defendants denied Plaintiffs' request to place the advertisement even though CBS Outdoor, Inc. (\"CBS\"), which administers the SMART advertising program, had determined that the proposed advertisement did not fall into a category prohibited by SMART's Restriction on Content policy. SMART's Restriction on Content policy provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   In order to minimize chances of abuse, the appearance of favoritism, and the risk of imposing upon a captive audience, [SMART] shall not allow the following content:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. Political or political campaign advertising.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. Advertising promoting the sale of alcohol or tobacco.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   3. Advertising that is false, misleading, or deceptive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   4. Advertising that is clearly defamatory or likely to hold up to scorn or ridicule any person or group of persons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   5. Advertising that is obscene or pornographic; or in advocacy of imminent lawlessness or unlawful violent action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Dkt. No. 57, Ex. A at PgID 1011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   American Freedom filed this lawsuit for equitable relief alleging that SMART violated its rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution when SMART prohibited the placement of their advertisement on SMART buses. American Freedom filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, which this Court granted on March 31, 2011. Dkt. No. 24. SMART appealed that decision, and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Court's finding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    American Freedom Defense Initiative v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs and Defendants raise similar issues in their motions, and the Court addresses them in this one opinion. Plaintiffs state the issues as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   1. Whether Defendants created a public forum for the expression of a wide variety of commercial, noncommercial, public-service and public-issue advertisements, including advertisements on controversial subjects, such that their content-based restriction on Plaintiffs' message violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   2. Whether regardless of the nature of the forum, Defendants' content-based advertising guidelines facially and as applied to Plaintiffs' advertisement provide no objective guide for distinguishing between permissible and impermissible advertisements in a non-arbitrary, viewpoint-neutral fashion as required by the U.S. Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   3. Whether Defendants' advertising guidelines facially and as applied to Plaintiffs' advertisement are viewpoint-based in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   4. Whether Defendants' advertising guidelines facially and as applied to Plaintiffs' advertisement violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants express the issues in this way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   1. Whether SMART, through its advertising content policy has created a non-public forum enabling it to limit the types and content of speech displayed on and in its buses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   2. Whether Plaintiffs' advertisement represents political speech that is barred by SMART's constitutional advertising content policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   3. Whether Plaintiffs' advertisement represents speech that is likely to hold a person or group of persons up to scorn or ridicule that is barred by SMART's constitutional advertising content policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   4. Whether SMART appropriately restricted Plaintiffs' advertisement under the viewpoint-neutral advertising content policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   There is no genuine issue of material fact that CBS accepted the American Freedom advertisement and referred it to SMART for review and a decision as to whether it was prohibited under the Restriction on Content policy. SMART ultimately determined that the American Freedom advertisement was prohibited as a political advertisement or an advertisement likely to hold up to scorn and ridicule a group of persons. American Freedom claims SMART's determination was arbitrary and capricious and in violation of American Freedom's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    1. SMART'S Advertising Space is a Nonpublic Forum\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The trial court must first determine the nature of the forum before analyzing whether restrictions on advertising like that imposed by SMART in this case are constitutional.\n   <em>\n    United Food and Commercial Workers Union v.

This Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs state that their advertisements, which they characterize as signs expressing religious freedom, clearly constitute protected speech. Defendants, characterizing Plaintiffs' speech as political and anti-Islam advertisement, do not expressly argue that Plaintiffs' speech is unprotected, but rely on the Supreme Court's finding that \"it is undeniable of course, that speech which is constitutionally protected against state suppression is not thereby accorded a guaranteed forum on all property owned by the state.\"\n   <em>\n    Capitol Square Review &amp; Advisory Bd v.

The SMART Guideline Restricting Scornful Speech is Not in Violation of the Constitution\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Although SMART prevails on its decision to restrict American Freedom's advertisement because of its political nature, the Court addresses the issue of refusal of the advertisement under Defendants' restriction for scorn or ridicule of a group of persons. Plaintiffs argue that the application of the SMART guideline restricting advertising that is \"likely to hold up to scorn or ridicule any person or group of persons\" is also subject to the same arguments they make about political speech. For support, they rely on Gibbons' testimony\n   that she could not determine whether the advertisement was scornful. Plaintiffs argue the advertisement is not intended to \"mock or make fun of anyone\"; that it \"addresses a serious issue.\" Plaintiffs include a number of real and hypothetical examples, questioning whether such advertisements subject a person or group to scorn or ridicule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendants respond in the same vein, citing the testimony of Geller that she fashioned the advertisement after a message proposed by the Islamic Circle of North America (this advertisement was not submitted to SMART but ran in other communities on similar transit systems.) Defendants argue the American Freedom advertisement parodied the Islamic Circle advertisement and denigrated its advertisement. Defendants also argue that the language of American Freedom's advertisement implies that Muslim families threaten their daughters and that the website included on the advertisement refers to the need for \"refuge\" when leaving Islam. Defendants support their explanation for determining that the message of American Freedom's advertisement holds a group of people up to scorn. Plaintiffs do not dispute that their advertisement was an impetus for the advertisement submitted to SMART. Applying the same analysis to determine whether the advertisement was arbitrarily or capriciously restricted, as noted above in the analysis for political advertisements, the Court finds there is no violation of Plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    5.

As Gibbons testified in her capacity as an authorized representative of SMART pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6), the Restriction on Content policy does not distinguish between political or non-political advertising, but each advertisement is reviewed independently for such a determination to be made. When the advertisement at issue was initially reviewed, the determination was made that it was a political advertisement.

Plaintiffs merely argued that Defendants discriminated against Plaintiffs in violation of the Equal Protection Clause because their advertisement is \"politicized\" or its viewpoint \"scornful.\" Plaintiffs did not carry their burden by providing any specific evidentiary support on the threshold element of an equal protection claim-disparate treatment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Scarbrough v.

Plaintiffs did not address the issue of the \"classification\" used by the decision-makers. Because Plaintiffs did not raise any argument as to the classification used by Defendants, Plaintiffs failed to carry their burden that strict scrutiny must be used in analyzing Plaintiffs' equal protection claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment as to the equal protection claim is denied since Plaintiffs failed to carry their burden on the required elements to establish such a claim. The Equal Protection Claim is dismissed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
