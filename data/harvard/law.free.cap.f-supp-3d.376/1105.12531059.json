Recognizing the impact\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   has on the motion, Defendant submitted additional arguments that the Ninth Circuit did not consider in\n   <em>\n    Karingithi.\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 53 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The first argument is that the regulations that define a notice to appear and define when jurisdiction vests in the immigration court improperly conflict with section 1229(a)'s definition of a notice to appear. ECF No. 53 at 2. According to Defendant, the regulations should not be able to modify the definition of a notice to appear in the statute when those regulations are promulgated under the authority granted by the same statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Second, Defendant argues that the Ninth Circuit did not consider whether the Attorney General had the authority to determine that removal proceedings can begin without providing the time-and-place information required by section 1229(a). ECF No. 53 at 4. Essentially, Defendant argues that the relevant regulations were promulgated by the Attorney General ultra vires.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Third, Defendant argues that\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   is not controlling in this case because\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   concerned removal proceedings,\n   not prosecution for illegal reentry. ECF No. 53 at 5. Defendant argues that extending\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   to illegal reentry cases would allow the Attorney General to \"unilaterally establish an element of the crime of illegal reentry.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   These arguments are not persuasive. Defendant's first two arguments essentially ask this Court to determine whether the Attorney General acted lawfully when the regulations at issue were promulgated. If this Court were to accept Defendant's arguments, this Court would be disregarding the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Karingithi.\n   </em>\n   The Court is bound by\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   and cannot disregard that decision, directly or indirectly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant's third argument also is not persuasive. While it is true that\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   concerned removal proceedings rather than illegal reentry, the panel considered the same question that is presently before this Court: whether an immigration judge has jurisdiction over an individual if the notice to appear lacks the time-and-date information for the individual's removal hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n    913 F.3d at 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We consider whether the Immigration Court has jurisdiction over removal proceedings when the initial notice to appear does not specify the time and date of the proceedings.\"). The petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   similarly argued that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   controls in this situation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n    at 1160-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even though the procedural posture of\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   is different from this case, the petitioner asked the same questions and presented the same arguments as Defendant does here, so the answers must be the same. The Court follows the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   does not prevent an immigration judge from obtaining jurisdiction over a person's removal proceedings when the initial notice to appear does not contain the time or date of the removal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n    at 1161-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Arguments Presented at Oral Argument\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On the morning of the hearing for this motion, the Government provided Defendant and the Court with a copy of a \"Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings.\" ECF No. 54-1.

ECF No. 55. The Government argued that the checked boxes on the document seem to indicate that Defendant had received the Notice of Hearing and offered the document as a business record exception to hearsay.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 52 at 2, 7. After hearing argument from both counsel, the Court noted that the document lacked any evidence of authenticity and failed to qualify as a business record exception because there was no competent evidence to lay the foundation for a business record exception. Therefore, the Court excluded the Notice of Hearing as inadmissible hearsay. ECF No. 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Without evidence of a valid Notice of Hearing in the record, Defendant argued that jurisdiction never vested with the immigration court because Defendant never received a valid notice of hearing. As the Government recognized in its brief, the\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   panel held that a Notice to Appear that does not state the time and date of the removal proceedings vests jurisdiction in the immigration court only upon service of a subsequent notice of hearing specifying this information. ECF No. 52 at 7;\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n    913 F.3d at 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Court has no record of a properly-served Notice of Hearing on Defendant that included the time and date of the removal proceedings.

ECF No. 41 at 9-10. Although Defendant's appearance at these hearings indicate that he knew the time and date of his proceedings, without proof that Defendant was served a Notice of Hearing, there is no evidence that Defendant received \"proper notice of the time and place of his proceeding,\" as is required for jurisdiction to vest.\n   <em>\n    Bermudez-Cota\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20441\">\n    27 I. &amp; N.

Until Defendant received that \"proper notice,\" jurisdiction did not vest with the immigration court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   There is insufficient evidence that Defendant's removal proceedings were conducted with jurisdiction. Therefore, the Court considers the removal order entered pursuant to those proceedings invalid. A valid removal order is an essential element in the Government's case.

However, without explaining his statutory eligibility or weighing his positive equities against his negative equities, the immigration judge denied Defendant voluntary departure as a matter of discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530081\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/12/849/#p852\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant never had a chance to make his case for voluntary departure, and the immigration judge failed to explain why she was denying his voluntary departure in spite of his positive equities.

ECF No. 52 at 12-14. First, the Government misconstrues Defendant's due process argument. The due process argument related to Defendant's eligibility for voluntary departure, whereas Defendant's jurisdictional argument concerned his notice to appear. ECF No. 41 at 11. Second, the consequences of the Government's arguments are troubling. If Defendant is deemed to have waived any due process or jurisdiction arguments by simply showing up to the hearing, Defendant would be deprived of an adequate forum in which to present all arguments in his favor. Further, if a person subject to removal proceedings is in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security, who brings him to his immigration hearing, Defendant would be viewed as \"waiving\" his jurisdictional or due process arguments by \"appearing\" at the hearing even though DHS brought him there against his volition. Even if Defendant was not in custody, Defendant would face an impossible choice: show up at the immigration hearing and waive several arguments; or skip the hearing and face the consequences of failing to appear, including a determination of a removal in absentia, and subsequent arrest and detainment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 41-3 at 2. The Court rejects the Government's arguments as to due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   After showing that his due process rights were violated, Defendant also must prove that he was prejudiced in order to prove fundamental unfairness.\n   <em>\n    Ortiz-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319239\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/1202/#p1204\">\n    385 F.3d at 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He could have presented the immigration court with his work and education record, including the college credits he earned while working and supporting himself.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732298\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/671/1036/#p1049\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He also would have been able to explain the circumstances behind his immigration history, which occurred when he was a child under his mother's control and which was one of the reasons that the immigration judge denied his voluntary departure as a matter of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. It is plausible that, had this evidence been submitted, an immigration judge would have granted Defendant voluntary departure. Therefore, the Court finds that Defendant has satisfied the two prongs of the fundamental unfairness element of section 1326(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendant has satisfied all three section 1326(d) elements and shown that his due process rights were violated in the underlying removal proceedings.

Alternatively, even if the immigration court is deemed to have had jurisdiction over Defendant's removal, the immigration judge violated Defendant's due process rights by failing to properly explain the\n   requirements for voluntary departure, weigh the equities, or allow Defendant to develop a record of positive equities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   1.
