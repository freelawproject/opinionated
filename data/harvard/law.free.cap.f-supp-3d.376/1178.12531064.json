Stat. \u00a7 13-1-124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , has been construed to extend jurisdiction to the full extent permitted by the Constitution, so the jurisdictional analysis here reduces to a single inquiry of whether jurisdiction offends due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pro Axess, Inc. v. Orlux Distrib., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280397\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/1270/#p1276\">\n    428 F.3d 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1276 (10th Cir. 2005) ;\n   <em>\n    Archangel Diamond Corp. v.

Personal jurisdiction comports with due process where a defendant has minimum contacts with the forum state and where those contacts are such that assuming jurisdiction does not offend \"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Int'lShoe Co. v. Wash.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    326 U.S. 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 316,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    66 S.Ct. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    90 L.Ed. 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1945). Minimum contacts may be established under the doctrines of general jurisdiction or specific jurisdiction. Where general jurisdiction is asserted over a nonresident defendant who has not consented to suit in the forum, minimum contacts exist if the plaintiff demonstrates that the defendant maintains \"continuous and systematic general business contacts\" in the state.\n   <em>\n    OMI Holdings, Inc. v. Royal Ins. Co. of Canada\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1362702\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/149/1086/#p1091\">\n    149 F.3d 1086\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1091 (10th Cir. 1998). Plaintiff does not argue that defendant is subject to general jurisdiction in Colorado.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 53 at 2 (\"Specific personal jurisdiction over BMW AG complies with Colorado's long arm statute and constitutional due process.\"), 7 (\"BMW AG has sufficient minimum contacts for specific personal jurisdiction in Colorado based on the stream of commerce doctrine.\"). The Court therefore limits its analysis to the issue of specific jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Specific jurisdiction is present only if the lawsuit \"aris[es] out of or relat[es] to the defendant's contacts with the forum.\"\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v.

The specific jurisdiction analysis is two-fold. First, the Court must determine whether a defendant has such minimum contacts with Colorado that the defendant \"should reasonably anticipate being haled into court\" here.\n   <em>\n    World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306135\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/286/#p297\">\n    444 U.S. 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 297,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20S.%20Ct.%20580\">\n    100 S.Ct. 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306135\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/286/#p297\">\n    62 L.Ed.2d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). Within this inquiry, the Court must determine whether the defendant purposefully directed its activities at residents of the forum,\n   <em>\n    Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p472\">\n    471 U.S. 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 472,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p472\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p472\">\n    85 L.Ed.2d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985), and whether plaintiff's claim arises out of or results from \"actions by ... defendant ... that create a substantial connection with the forum State.\"\n   <em>\n    Asahi Metal Indus.

Second, if defendant's actions create sufficient minimum contacts, the Court must consider whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction over defendant offends \"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p109\">\n    at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p109\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court considers several factors as part of this analysis, including: (1) the burden on the defendant; (2) the forum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute; (3) the plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief; (4) the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies; and (5) the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.\n   <em>\n    Burger King Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p472\">\n    471 U.S. at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p472\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Stream of Commerce Framework\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff seeks to establish specific personal jurisdiction under a stream of commerce theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 53 at 7. This theory was first articulated in\n   <em>\n    World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.\n   </em>\n   , where the Supreme Court stated that a \"forum State does not exceed its powers under the Due Process Clause if it asserts personal jurisdiction over a corporation that delivers its products into the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers in the forum State.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306135\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/286/#p297\">\n    444 U.S. at 297-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20S.%20Ct.%20580\">\n    100 S.Ct. 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As plaintiff notes, however, two subsequent Supreme Court decisions have placed the \"proper framework for a stream of commerce analysis ... in flux.\" Docket No. 53 at 7. In\n   <em>\n    Asahi Metal Industry Co.\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court addressed \"whether the mere awareness on the part of a foreign defendant that the components it manufactured, sold, and delivered outside the United States would reach the forum State in the stream of commerce constitutes 'minimum contacts' between the defendant and the forum State such that the exercise of jurisdiction 'does not offend \"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\" ' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p109\">\n    480 U.S. at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p109\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In a plurality opinion, Justice O'Connor answered this question in the negative. She concluded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [t]he \"substantial connection\" between the defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding of minimum contacts must come about by\n   <em>\n    an action of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.\n   </em>\n   The placement of a product into the stream of commerce, without more, is not an act of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p109\">\n    at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p109\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality op.) (internal citations omitted). Justice Brennan, joined by three other justices, filed an opinion concurring in the judgment but disagreeing with Justice O'Connor's stream of commerce analysis. Justice Brennan concluded it was unnecessary to require plaintiffs to show \" 'additional conduct' directed toward the forum before finding the exercise of jurisdiction over the defendant to be consistent with the Due Process Clause.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p109\">\n    at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p109\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Brennan, J., concurring) (bracket omitted).
