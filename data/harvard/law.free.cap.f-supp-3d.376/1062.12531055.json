(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Collection Notes, Ex. 4 to Pl.'s MSJ, ECF No. 23-4). LVAC contends that Plaintiff's alleged oral revocations were too ambiguous to be afforded legal weight. (LVAC's Resp. 21:20-22:16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Upon review of the parties' competing evidence and arguments, the Court finds a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff revoked his consent on the initial December 29, 2016 call.

I don't have the money right now.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The agent replied, \"I do apologize for the inconvenience.... I will try to push that date out for you to give you some time to come up with the payment,\" to which Plaintiff stated, \"thanks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). LVAC's collection notes show that the agent wrote \"CNT PAY AT THIS TIME ... REQ STOP CLLNG.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Collection Notes at 2, Ex. 2 to Pl.'s MSJ, ECF No. 23-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On the one hand, a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff's words, \"I want you guys to stop calling me,\" against the backdrop of LVAC's collection notes, indicate that Plaintiff revoked his consent and that LVAC understood the message. On the other hand, a jury could reasonably determine, based on the remainder of the\n   call, that Plaintiff and LVAC merely agreed to temporarily suspend, or \"push out,\" the calls to allow Plaintiff to come up with his payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. February 15, 2017 Call\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   On the February 15, 2017 call, LVAC's agent again identified himself and asked Plaintiff if was able to make a payment. (Recording of February 15, 2017 Call, Ex. 4 to Pl.'s MSJ, ECF No. 23-6). Plaintiff responded \"I've asked you guys to stop calling me. I don't have the money.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). LVAC's agent summarized the call as follows: \"SD DONT HAVE THE MONEY... STOP CALLING.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Collection Notes at 2, Ex. 2 to Pl.'s MSJ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   No reasonable jury could construe Plaintiff's request as anything other than a clear request that LVAC stop calling him. Unlike the December 29, 2016 call, Plaintiff and the LVAC agent do not engage in any dialogue that could be interpreted as an agreement to merely extend or \"push out\" the date of the next scheduled call. Additionally, LVAC's collection notes summarizing the call lend support to the notion that Plaintiff unambiguously conveyed his revocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Therefore, the Court finds no genuine dispute that Plaintiff revoked his consent as of February 15, 2017. Thus, LVAC's calls using an ATDS after that period violated the TCPA. However, because there is a factual issue as to the clarity of Plaintiff's purported December 29, 2016 revocation, that question will be left to a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order 2:15-24, ECF No. 11). Plaintiff filed his Motion for Leave on April 16, 2018, (ECF No. 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiff erroneously applies the more lenient standard of Rule 15, \"which focuses on the bad faith,\" of the moving party and \"the prejudice to the opposing party.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515958\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/975/604/#p607\">\n    975 F.2d at 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even if the Court were to find an absence of bad faith and no prejudice to LVAC, these findings are immaterial without a preliminary showing of diligence on Plaintiff's part, or else an explanation for the untimely request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515958\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/975/604/#p607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiff claims he did not know of LVAC's additional phone calls at the time he brought this action. (Mot. for Leave 5:1-4). Plaintiff states that screenshots of\n   his cell phone, purportedly showing the correct number of phone calls at issue, were given to LVAC \"early in the litigation,\" and that LVAC \"had them for months before they took Plaintiff's deposition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   6:8-9). This argument is unhelpful for two reasons. First, this reasoning goes toward prejudice to LVAC rather than Plaintiff's diligence in seeking amendment. Second, and more significantly, this concession signifies that Plaintiff knew of the additional calls well in advance of his untimely Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Without identification of when Plaintiff obtained this information in discovery or description of Plaintiff's good-faith attempt to timely amend, the Court cannot discern-one way or the other-whether Plaintiff's efforts were diligent. As such, Plaintiff has not carried his burden of showing good cause under Rule 16.
