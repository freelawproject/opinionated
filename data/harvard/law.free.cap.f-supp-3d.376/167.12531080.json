Huertas Leon (\"Huertas-Leon\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"). The services provided by HHER to the four disabled Plaintiffs were financed by the Family Department's \"Adult Services Program\" (in Spanish, \"Programa de Servicios a Adultos\") (the \"Program\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Between March 27, 2012 and December of 2014, Huertas-Leon allegedly exchanged correspondence with the Trujillo Alto, Carolina Program, as well as the Central Office of the Family Department and its regional director in Carolina, co-defendant Mu\u00f1oz-Marzan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 29 at 10. Through these exchanges, Huertas-Leon said that the elders' developmental disabilities warranted a modification to the payments that they received as part of the Adult Services Program (the \"Program\").\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   In 2013, Huertas-Leon purportedly informed Defendants that behavioral changes seen in one unnamed Program participant required specialized medical services that HHER was unable to provide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 17, 2014, the Family Department revoked HHER's operating license due to its alleged failure to comply with the requisite laws and regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 27 (Exh._1). Huertas-Leon appealed this determination before the Family Department's Adjudicative Board (the \"Board\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 35 at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 6, 2014, Qui\u00f1ones-Fontanez, Cortes-Maldonado, Correa-Delgado and Figueroa-Garcia, personally or through a family representative, apparently sought protective orders enjoining Defendants from transferring or relocating them to other licensed institutions through ex parte requests filed in state court. The state court judge denied their requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 29 at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 8, 2014, three of those four disabled Plaintiffs were transferred to other licensed homes. Cortes-Maldonado was transferred to Ciudad Dorada, and Correa-Delgado and Figueroa-Garcia were transferred to Hogar Shalom.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15. Defendant Mu\u00f1oz-Marzan allegedly removed Qui\u00f1ones-Fontanez from the Program in retaliation for his complaints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. One of the Family Department's social workers, Amanda Roman, intimidated him saying \"I will place you in a mission, close you behind bars and you will not see your family or children ever again.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Figueroa-Garcia's son, Angel Berrios Figueroa, allegedly received similar threats from Family Department officials warning him that the services would be cancelled if he refused to keep her at Hogar Shalom.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1-3 (incorporated or adopted by reference in the amended complaint).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs Qui\u00f1ones-Fontanez, Cortes-Maldonado, Correa-Delgado, and Figueroa-Garcia presented claims under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\" or \"Title II\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012134\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. ; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (\"Section 504\" or \"REHAB\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. ; Puerto Rico's Bill of Rights for Persons with Disabilities, P.R.

In sum, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants discriminated and retaliated against them by removing them from HHER and transferring them into homes that do not provide the special services required by their incapacities, which were ostensibly taken care of at HHER. They contend that the abrupt termination of their stay at HHER constituted a violation of their due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Additionally, Huertas-Leon filed suit as director of HHER, alleging he has standing to sue under Title II of ADA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012203\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ; within the meaning of Section 1 of the Puerto Rico Law Prohibiting Discrimination Against Disabled Persons, P.R.

Huertas-Leon claims that Defendants' decision to revoke HHER's operating license constitutes retaliation for having complained with the Family Department.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 172.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on the allegations summarized above, Plaintiffs request declaratory judgment and preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting Defendants from terminating the services provided to the elder and disabled Plaintiffs at HHER, and from enrolling or transferring them to any other institution without their consent. Additionally, they request a \"preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from denying patients due process, executing service agreements without the elders' or their relatives' consent, and endorsing undesirable missions and shelters with unfit facilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. Finally, they request compensatory damages of no less than $ 1,000,000 for each individual Plaintiff, as well as costs and attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Recent Developments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 20, 2018, the court ordered Plaintiffs to supplement the record with copy of the final determination issued by the Family Department in the administrative proceeding challenging the revocation of HHER's license.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 44. The information was deemed necessary considering that much of Plaintiffs' arguments in opposition to the motion to dismiss hinge on the adequacy of the Family\n   Department's processes and policies (or lack thereof). The court also takes note of their request to be reinstated at HHER \"until administrative proceedings are decided by the state proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dockets No. 35, 44 and 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs informed the court that on January 10, 2019, Huertas-Leon's voluntarily dismissed his appeal before the Department's Adjudicative Board. Again, that appeal challenged administrative decisions and process in connection with the cancellation of HHER's license.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dockets No. 46 and 51. Plaintiffs explained that \"[l]icense renewal was not processed by the Family Department, the shelter became insolvent and was evicted from its premises. Therefore, the owner/licensee notified the appeals body that administrative remedy was moot.\" Docket No. 51 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Notably, Plaintiffs also informed that Cortes-Maldonado and Correa-Delgado had passed away. But Plaintiffs have not followed the process set out in Rule 25 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure -they never requested substitution of the parties or any other available remedy for that matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed R. Civ. P. 25. Given the time elapsed since, the court on its own dismisses Cortes-Maldonado's and Correa-Delgado's claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, only the claims asserted by Huertas-Leon, Qui\u00f1ones-Fontanez, and Figueroa-Garcia remain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When ruling on a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a district court must \"accept as true the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint, draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiff's favor, and determine whether the complaint, so read, limns facts sufficient to justify recovery on any cognizable theory.\"\n   <em>\n    Rivera v.

Even though detailed factual allegations are not necessary for a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, \"a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitlement to relief' requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do [.]\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As noted before, Defendants moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), and the court addresses their arguments in turn. However, because the motion does not seek dismissal of every claim asserted by Plaintiffs, outstanding allegations suggesting First and Fourteenth Amendment claims could linger. For efficiency purposes, the court, on its own, evaluates their plausibility under the applicable standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    A. Plaintiffs' request for preliminary injunctive relief is not warranted\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants ask for dismissal of Plaintiffs' requests for preliminary injunctive relief. A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy that should be granted carefully and sparingly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 65. The burden is on the movant to show the following elements: \"(1) the plaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the potential for irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction; (3) whether issuing an injunction will burden the defendants less than denying an injunction would burden the plaintiffs; and (4) the effect, if any, on the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez-Droz v.

In support, Plaintiffs allege that Huertas-Leon undertook conduct protected when he complained about matters related to the Program administered by the Family Department. They also aver that Huertas-Leon requested services necessary to meet the disabled elders' needs and to accomplish the purposes of the Establishment for the Elderly Act, P.R. LAWS. ANN. tit. 8, \u00a7 351 et seq., and its regulations. Third, Huertas-Leon allegedly suffered an adverse action when the Family Department revoked HHER's operating license on November 17, 2014. Although Defendants vehemently contest Plaintiffs' allegations that HHER's license was revoked as retaliation for Huertas-Leon's complaints, the standard of review at the motion to dismiss stage favors the non-conclusory facts alleged in the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Assessing the causal connection element is somewhat frustrated by Plaintiffs' murky allegations as to the timeline of the events in question. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that Huertas-Leon exchanged correspondence (presumably, complaints) with the Family Department \"[b]etween March 27, 2012 and December [of] 2014.\" Docket No. 29 at 10. However, in their response to Defendants' motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs state that HHER obtained its operating license on November 30, 2012, eight months after Huertas-Leon allegedly began to complain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 35 at 13. Furthermore, HHER's license was apparently revoked on November 17, 2014, yet Huertas-Leon continued undertaking purportedly protected conduct after this date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dockets No. 27 and 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Despite the confusing and at times contradictory statements made by Plaintiffs, the court recognizes that \"for pleading purposes, [they] need not\n   <em>\n    establish\n   </em>\n   this element; the facts contained in the complaint need only show that the claim of causation is plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez-Reyes v.

Because their amended complaint alleges sufficient facts to render the element\n   of causation plausible, Huertas-Leon's retaliation claims under the ADA and Rehab Act survives dismissal-at least for now. Consequently, Defendants' motion to dismiss those claims is hereby DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Qui\u00f1ones-Fontanez\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants retaliated against Qui\u00f1ones-Fontanez when they removed him from the program due to \"his opposition to a replacement mission imposed by force and without his consent,\" as well has his \"exercise or enjoyment of his right to free speech and the right to select a health and shelter provider.\" Docket No. 29 at 22. The amended complaint further alleges that Qui\u00f1ones-Fontanez objected to being removed or transferred from HHER, something that occurred on December 8, 2014. By then, more than three weeks had passed since HHER had lost its license. Significantly, Puerto Rico's Establishment of the Elderly Act makes it a misdemeanor to operate a substitute shelter for qualified adults without a license.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Assuming that Qui\u00f1ones-Fontanez engaged in protected conduct by demanding to remain at HHER or opposing his relocation to any alternate\n   <em>\n    licensed\n   </em>\n   shelter, then he left Defendants with two choices: either let him stay at a shelter without an operating permit, and thus incur in criminal conduct, or relocate the patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Even taking the few factual allegations at face value, the court is hard-pressed to find that there is a plausible retaliation claim.

Plaintiffs' assertion that the state court judge \"declined to issue summons against the Defendant Family Department and declined to take any action at all...\" (Docket No. 29 at 13) defeats any plausible inference that Defendants had knowledge of the protected conduct or speech, and thus, that Plaintiffs' exercise thereof and Defendants' actions were casually linked.

To establish a procedural due process claim, a plaintiff must sufficiently allege that \"he has a property interest as defined by state law and ... that Defendants, acting under color of state law, deprived him of that property interest without a constitutionally adequate process.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Replay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837510\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/778/207/#p213\">\n    778 F.Supp.2d at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   One of the basic guarantees of procedural due process is that \"before a significant deprivation of liberty or property takes place at the state's hands, the affected individual must be forewarned and afforded an opportunity to be heard 'at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.' \"\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez-Droz v.

Again, the non-conclusory facts alleged are that HHER lost its license to operate, which necessarily ended this Plaintiff's stint at the shelter. More importantly, if she was transferred to Hogar Shalom, then she\n   <em>\n    kept receiving payments\n   </em>\n   that she is purportedly entitled to.

Like Figueroa-Garcia, Qui\u00f1ones-Fontanez adequately alleges a legitimate entitlement to the monthly payments received as a part of the Program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Unlike Figueroa-Garcia, however, Qui\u00f1ones-Fontanez alleges he was deprived of the entitlement when Defendants unilaterally and \"abruptly dumped\" him from the Program on December 8, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. If he stopped receiving the payments altogether, and Defendants did not give him prior notice or an opportunity to be heard on the matter, then sufficient facts have been alleged to establish a plausible procedural due process claim. Nevertheless, his recourse is limited to injunctive or declaratory relief. As such, his request for monetary relief on this claim cannot proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Based on the above, the court GRANTS Defendants' motion to dismiss Huertas-Leon's and Figueroa-Garcia's procedural due process claims but DENIES the motion as to Qui\u00f1ones-Fontanez's claim.

Defendants' assertions are correct as a matter of law.
