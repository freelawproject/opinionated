Plaintiff did not ask the County to assign her to work in a department headed by an elected official.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.

The PPM further provides that (1) it intends to ensure that employee retention and separation are based upon an employee's qualifications and fitness and compliant with federal and Kansas laws; (2) it applies to all employees; (3) the tenure of County employees shall be based on reasonable standards of job performance and personal and professional conduct; (4) terminations that are not for cause are discouraged; and (5) terminations by supervisors are subject to Standards of Conduct and Discipline and Grievance Procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The PPM outlines Standards of Conduct,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   \"standards for high quality work performance and conduct,\" as performance expectations which employees must meet or possibly face discipline, including discharge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. When the County discharges, suspends or demotes an employee for poor performance or violation of the Standards of Conduct, the PPM provides a mandatory pre-disciplinary hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. If the County discharges an employee for disciplinary reasons, the PPM provides a right to notice and a hearing, representation by counsel, written notice of the reasons for discharge and an explanation of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition, the PPM provides a right to present oral or written reasons why the County should not suspend or discharge the employee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In discharging plaintiff, the County used none of these procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The PPM also provides a grievance procedure \"to be utilized specifically for claims or dispute by an employee with respect to the interpretation, meaning or application of the provisions of county departmental policies and procedure and does not [include] ADA, disciplinary action, sexual harassment or staffing and salary disputes....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.

Phelan said that he could not help because elected officials could do whatever they wanted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Phelan stated that it would be different if plaintiff worked in a department headed by an appointed official, but different rules applied for employees who worked for elected officials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The County treated employees who worked in departments headed by non-elected officials more favorably than employees who worked in departments headed by elected officials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   From 2012 to 2017, Brenda Cherry served as County Treasurer and supervised plaintiff's employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.

The Court agrees that plaintiff has not stated a plausible claim for relief based on deprivation of a property interest in a pre-termination hearing. As to this claim, the Court sustains defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Regarding her termination, plaintiff asserts that based on County policies and procedures, she was entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard through the grievance procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Response To Motion To Dismiss\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 47) at 25-26. Specifically, in the amended complaint, plaintiff alleges that the PPM provides for the grievance procedure \"to be utilized specifically for claims or dispute by an employee with respect to the interpretation, meaning or application of the provisions of county departmental policies and procedure and does not include[ ] ADA, disciplinary action, sexual harassment or staffing and salary disputes....\"\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 39) \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Defendants assert that the grievance procedure did not apply because plaintiff \"is not arguing about the interpretation, meaning, or application of a policy provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Memorandum\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 44) at 27. Defendants assert that in this case, plaintiff is challenging Maley's right to terminate her employment under K.S.A. \u00a7 19-503, which is a matter of statutory interpretation and does not fall within the purpose of the grievance procedure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28. Defendants' argument misses the mark. In essence, it appears that defendants are arguing that because plaintiff could not have prevailed on her claims, she was not entitled to notice and a hearing under the grievance procedure. The record, however, is not sufficiently developed in this regard. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Allen v. Kline\n   </em>\n   , this Court found that even though the county could not override the district attorney's decision to discharge plaintiffs, the county apparently had authority to conduct grievance hearings to determine whether plaintiffs were entitled to other relief, such as eligibility for future county employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659002\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/507/1150/#p1163\">\n    507 F.Supp.2d at 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court therefore dismisses the equal protection claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Motion For Partial Dismissal\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 43) filed August 10, 2018 is\n   <strong>\n    SUSTAINED in part\n   </strong>\n   . The Court dismisses the following claims: (1) that defendants fired plaintiff because of the fact of her candidacy (part of Count 1); (2) that defendants violated plaintiff's rights to procedural due process by depriving her of property interests in the right to a pre-termination hearing (part of Count 2); (3) that defendants violated plaintiff's rights to procedural due process by depriving her of property interests in continued employment (part of Count 2); and (4) that defendants violated her rights to equal protection (Count 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The following claims remain in the case: (1) against the County, Phelan and Maley, violation of plaintiff's First Amendment rights in firing her in retaliation for statements which she made during her campaign against Maley (part of Count 1); (2) against the County, violation of plaintiff's rights to procedural due process by depriving her of property rights in post-termination grievance procedures (part of Count 2); and (3) against the County and Cherry, failure to pay straight and overtime wages under the FLSA and KWPA (Counts 4 and 5).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The record does not reflect when plaintiff began her employment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    The record is unclear whether the PPM is the same as the handbook referenced above.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    The record does not reflect whether Cherry ran for re-election in 2016.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The record does not state the date of the general election.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The record does not state whether Cherry resigned before her term ended.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Defendants initially moved to dismiss the KWPA claim but subsequently withdrew that portion of their motion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Memorandum\n    </em>\n    (Doc. # 44) at 33-35;\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Reply In Support Of Defendants' Motion For Partial Dismissal\n    </em>\n    (Doc. # 50) filed September 21, 2018 at 26.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    To the extent defendants attempt to submit matters outside the pleadings, see\n    <em>\n     Memorandum In Support\n    </em>\n    (Doc. # 44) at 10-11, the Court declines to consider them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Without providing legal analysis or case citation, defendants conclusively assert that under Rule 9(f), Fed.
