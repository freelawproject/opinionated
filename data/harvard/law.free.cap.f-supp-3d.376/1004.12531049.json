Nebraska law clearly outlines the responsibilities of the Commission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Neb. Const. Art. V, \u00a7\u00a7 28 - 30 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2024-715\">\n    Neb. Rev.

Upon receipt of any such complaint or request, the commission shall make such investigation as it determines to be necessary. The commission shall have the right to subpoena witnesses; to hold hearings; to require the Justice or judge to submit to physical or mental examination by medical experts; to appoint special masters to conduct hearings; to make independent investigations, either by members of the commission or by special investigators employed by the commission; to hold confidential prehearing proceedings with the person or persons filing the complaint or request, or with his or her or their agents or attorneys; and to hold confidential prehearing proceedings with the judge or Justice involved in the complaint or request.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2024-721\">\n    Neb.

It is evident from the allegations of Plaintiff's Complaint that Judge Yardley performed adjudicatory functions as outlined by the statute. Plaintiff complained to the Commission about Judge Ideus and Judge Yardley, with the other Commission members, investigated Plaintiff's complaint and determined that it did not support a finding of a violation of the Judicial Code of Conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 1 at CM/ECF p. 5\n   </em>\n   .) Clearly, Commission members must be able to make these determinations\n   without fear of intimidation or harassment and free from political influence. Moreover, judicial review of Commission action is available through the Nebraska Supreme Court. Thus, the relevant factors weigh in favor of the court finding Judge Yardley is entitled to absolute quasi-judicial immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204469264\">\n    2012 WL 4469264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (weighing factors and finding members of the Arkansas Discipline &amp; Disability Commission were absolutely immune from damages claims in their individual capacities). Accordingly, Plaintiff's individual-capacity claims against Judge Yardley for money damages are barred on the basis of quasi-judicial immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Requests for Declaratory Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff also seeks declaratory relief.
