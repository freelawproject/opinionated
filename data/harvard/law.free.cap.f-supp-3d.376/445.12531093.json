Novinger's is a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. (Doc. 20-1, Ex. A \u00b6 2). Novinger's specializes in the fabrication and installation of interior and exterior wall systems and ceilings as well as spray fireproofing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3). A.J.D. is a New Jersey corporation headquartered in Leonardo, New Jersey. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 10; Doc. 1-2 \u00b6 2). In 1997, A.J.D. applied for and received a certificate of authority to do business in Pennsylvania as a \"foreign business corporation\" with a proposed registered office in Chester, Pennsylvania. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 20-1 at 37-38; Doc. 7-11 \u00b6 4). A.J.D. avers that this registration was related to a particular construction project in Pennsylvania that was completed around 2000, and that A.J.D. has not otherwise engaged in business in the Commonwealth since that time and maintains no physical presence there. (Doc. 7-11 \u00b6\u00b6 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2014, A.J.D. contracted with Journal Square I Urban Renewal, LLC (\"Journal Square\") to provide labor and materials for an apartment building project in New Jersey known as \"Journal Squared - Tower I\" (the \"Project\"). (Doc. 7 \u00b6 13; Doc. 7-2 at 2 \u00b6 2; Doc. 31-1 \u00b6 2). On July 30, 2014, Novinger's entered into a subcontract with A.J.D. whereby Novinger's agreed to fabricate and install a panelized exterior load-bearing wall system on a portion of the Project. (Doc. 1-2 \u00b6 4; Doc. 7 \u00b6 17; Doc. 20-1, Ex. A \u00b6 6). Novinger's executed the subcontract in Pennsylvania and A.J.D. subsequently signed the agreement in New Jersey. (Doc. 7-2 at 3 \u00b6 4; Doc. 19 \u00b6 18). As part of the subcontract, Novinger's was required to keep field fabrication to an \"absolute minimum.\" (Doc. 20-1, Ex. A \u00b6 8). Novinger's maintains that this provision caused Novinger's to fabricate the exterior panels at its plant in Pennsylvania and deliver them to Journal Square in New Jersey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9; Doc. 1-2 \u00b6 5). At the work site in New Jersey, A.J.D. allegedly required Novinger's to reinstall perimeter netting and safety cables daily. (Doc. 1-2 \u00b6 12). Novinger's asserts that it complied but that such a task was beyond the scope of the agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 19 \u00b6 25). Novinger's refused to complete the exterior wall system on the penthouse section of the Project, believing that this work likewise exceeded the subcontract's requirements. (Doc. 7 \u00b6 20; Doc. 19 \u00b6 20; Doc. 21-1, Ex. A \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Novinger's alleges that it satisfied its contractual obligations on April 7, 2017. (Doc. 1-2 \u00b6 7). A.J.D. paid $ 8,856,294.80 to Novinger's by sending checks to its offices in Pennsylvania, but Novinger's contends it is still owed $ 568,987 under the subcontract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9; Doc. 30-1, Ex. A \u00b6 6). Novinger's also claims it is owed $ 171,352 for the daily perimeter netting and safety cable installation, as well as an additional $ 119,946 for having to clean the work area in New Jersey after other subcontractors failed to do so. (Doc. 1-2 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; Doc. 7 \u00b6\u00b6 25-26). In May 2018, Novinger's filed suit against A.J.D. in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, to recover the money it claims A.J.D. owes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-2). A.J.D. removed\n   the case to this court. A.J.D. now moves to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction or, in the alternative, to transfer this case to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The court ordered the parties to provide supplemental briefing on the issue of specific personal jurisdiction. A.J.D.'s motion is now fully briefed and ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), a party may move to dismiss a complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction.

Pennsylvania's Long-Arm Statute grants jurisdiction to the full extent allowed by the United States Constitution. 42 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7\u00a7 5308, 5322(b). Thus, under Pennsylvania law, the inquiry into whether the court may assert personal jurisdiction over a defendant is the same as the constitutional query. Due process requires a plaintiff to show that the out-of-state defendant has \"certain minimum contacts with [the forum] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Int'l Shoe Co. v.

Additional considerations include where the services under the contract were performed and whether the challenging party should have known the services would be performed there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remick v. Manfredy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11140533\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/248/#p256\">\n    238 F.3d 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 256 (3d Cir. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As to the first prong, we find that A.J.D. purposefully directed activity at Pennsylvania in a manner sufficient to support specific jurisdiction. The contract was negotiated in part through the use of telephone and email communication between A.J.D. and Novinger's at their respective offices in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Even though Novinger's went to New Jersey to introduce itself, A.J.D. still directed multiple communications to Novinger's in Pennsylvania regarding negotiation and performance of the contract. Importantly, the terms of the agreement obligated Novinger's to perform much of its work in Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11140533\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/248/#p256\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The contract required that the panels be \"factory formed and complete\" and that on-site fabrication was to be kept to an \"absolute minimum,\" and A.J.D. knew Novinger's would perform this work at its factory in Pennsylvania. (Doc. 20-1, Ex. A \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). A.J.D.'s project manager travelled to Pennsylvania to inspect the panels in Novinger's' fabrication shop. Finally, the terms of the agreement required pre-installation testing of the panels, all of which was-predictably-performed in Pennsylvania. Contrary to A.J.D.'s contention of mere \"unilateral activity\" by Novinger's, these contract provisions and communications demonstrate that A.J.D. purposefully directed activity at Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.J.D. relies on\n   <em>\n    Freedom Forge Corp. v. Jersey Forging Works, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3504596\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/549/99/\">\n    549 F.Supp. 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Pa. 1982), for the proposition that mere assembly of the panels in Pennsylvania and transportation of same to New Jersey does not establish minimum contacts.\n   <em>\n    Freedom Forge\n   </em>\n   is easily distinguishable. In that case, the court held that the \"thin thread\" of sending six purchase orders into Pennsylvania was not enough to create sufficient minimum contacts.\n   <em>\n    Freedom Forge Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3504596\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/549/99/\">\n    549 F.Supp. at 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted above, A.J.D. had much more significant contacts with Pennsylvania. Furthermore, where the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Freedom Forge\n   </em>\n   merely sent purchase orders, the\n   instant contract expressly required off-site panel construction, which Novinger's logically would perform at its Pennsylvania factory. In the matter\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , an agent of A.J.D. also visited the Pennsylvania shop to inspect the panels during the contract's performance, whereas in\n   <em>\n    Freedom Forge\n   </em>\n   no \"agent or officer of the defendant entered Pennsylvania in relation to the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3504596\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/549/99/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Turning to the second prong for specific jurisdiction, we likewise find that the cause of action arises out of and is related to activities A.J.D. directed at the forum state. According to Novinger's, a significant portion of its breach of contract claim involves alleged underpayment for fabrication that was implicitly directed to take place in Pennsylvania. Furthermore, the alleged underpayment that induced the breach of contract claim was sent to Pennsylvania, causing an impact in the forum state on a Pennsylvania corporation. This level of connection and relatedness between the defendant's contacts and the plaintiff's cause of action is sufficient for specific jurisdiction purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704677\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/496/312/#p317\">\n    496 F.3d at 323-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As the first two parts of the test are satisfied, we turn to whether exercising jurisdiction over A.J.D. would comport with \"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704677\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/496/312/#p317\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704677\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/496/312/#p317\">\n    at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Int'l Shoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    326 U.S. at 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    66 S.Ct. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Once minimum contacts are established, there is a presumption of constitutionality in favor of the plaintiff and the defendant \"must present a\n   <em>\n    compelling\n   </em>\n   case that the presence of some other consideration would render jurisdiction unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Burger King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p478\">\n    471 U.S. at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p478\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Factors to consider include the burden on the defendant, the forum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute, the plaintiff's interest in obtaining efficient relief, the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies, and the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704677\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/496/312/#p317\">\n    496 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   324 (citing\n   <em>\n    Burger King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p478\">\n    471 U.S. at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p478\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A.J.D. cannot rebut the presumption of constitutionality of exercising specific jurisdiction. First, A.J.D. is located in New Jersey, a few hours from the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704677\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/496/312/#p317\">\n    496 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   324-25 ;\n   <em>\n    Grand Entm't Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512950\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/988/476/#p482\">\n    988 F.2d at 483-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Pennsylvania has an interest in adjudicating the dispute: Novinger's is a Pennsylvania corporation and the Commonwealth has a \"manifest interest in providing effective means of redress\" when an out-of-state corporation contracts with its residents regarding in-state manufacturing.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704677\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/496/312/#p317\">\n    496 F.3d at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    McGee v.

This is also not case where all the evidence and witnesses are located in a different forum. Finally, Novinger's, as plaintiff, has an interest in being able to litigate where it is based and where its witnesses reside,\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , \"obtaining convenient and effective relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Burger King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p478\">\n    471 U.S. at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p478\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
