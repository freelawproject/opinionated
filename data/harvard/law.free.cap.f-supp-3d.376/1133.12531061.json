In their original complaint, plaintiffs asserted a Rehabilitation Act claim against the State of Colorado, the state Department of Human Services, and the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing alleging that \"the regulatory scheme employed by these Defendants failed in its essential purpose of providing for Angel's health, safety, and wellbeing.\" Docket No. 1 at 17. Specifically, plaintiffs asserted that the regulatory scheme \"actually allowed and failed to safeguard for PASCO\n   <em>\n    hiring\n   </em>\n   a known drug addict, prostitute, drug trafficker[, and] violent offender\" to care for Angel, thereby denying him \"any semblance of equal access to competent medical assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18, \u00b6 58. Elsewhere in the complaint, plaintiffs alleged facts showing that the government defendants - including employees of Jefferson County - failed to respond to numerous reports of child abuse against Ms. Najera.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 1 at 2-3, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 17-18. In their second amended complaint, plaintiffs assert that BCC and JHS violated Angel's rights under the Rehabilitation Act by \"den[ying him] a valid and timely investigation, conclusion and related action in response to the serious complaints of child abuse received by Jefferson County.\" Docket No. 103 at 56, \u00b6 326. The Court finds that plaintiffs' amended Rehabilitation Act claim arises out of the same conduct alleged in the original complaint, namely, the failure of various government entities to take appropriate action in response to complaints of child abuse against Ms. Najera.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Because plaintiffs did not assert a Rehabilitation Act claim against BCC or JHS in the original complaint, the Court must next determine whether defendants received adequate notice of the claim under Rule 15(c)(1)(C). Rule 15(c)(1)(C) contains two requirements: first, that the new party have \"received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending\n   on the merits\"; and second, that the party \"knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party's identity.\" BCC and JHS do not contest that they had notice of the lawsuit. Docket No. 107 at 2 n.2. Accordingly, the only issue is whether plaintiffs have satisfied the second requirement under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court finds that Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is satisfied as to BCC.

Two facts support this conclusion: first, none of the claims in the original complaint were asserted against either county defendant named in the complaint; second, the Rehabilitation Act claim was asserted against all the other government entities responsible for Angel's continued placement in Ms. Najera's home. These facts demonstrate one of three possibilities: (1) that plaintiffs mistakenly omitted the county defendants from the claim-specific allegations; (2) that plaintiffs viewed the county defendants as being inseparable from the state entities; or (3) that plaintiffs misunderstood the role of the county defendants in the events giving rise to their claims. Such mistakes do not \"foreclose a finding that Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) has been satisfied.\"\n   <em>\n    Krupski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641809,12454862\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/538/\">\n    560 U.S. at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641809,12454862\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/538/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, plaintiffs' Rehabilitation Act claim against BCC is not subject to dismissal on statute of limitations grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court reaches the opposite conclusion with respect to JHS. There is no evidence that plaintiffs' failure to name JHS in the original complaint was the result of a mistake. To the contrary, plaintiffs' allegations indicate that they were aware of JHS's role in the events at issue yet consciously decided to name the State Department of Human Services as a defendant instead of the county departments.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 1 at 3-4, 11, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9, 24.

As defendants acknowledge in their motion, plaintiffs' original complaint asserted that Ms. Connell acted with deliberate indifference \"to her statutory and regulatory obligations during th[e] investigation [of child abuse reports against Ms. Najera]; discounted reports from mandatory reporters; failed to acknowledge and recognize the unconscionably poor health condition and low body weight of Angel; and declined to either institute a Dependency and Neglect action or take Angel into protective custody.\" Docket No. 1 at 8, \u00b6 17. These same general allegations continue to form the basis of plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment claim against Ms. Connell.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 103 at 51-52, \u00b6\u00b6 292-98 (alleging that Ms. Connell violated Angel's Fourteenth Amendment rights by (1) failing to investigate his case \"with sufficient acuity and diligence,\" (2) disregarding complaints of abuse, (3) recommending that a case not be opened and that Angel remain in the custody of Ms. Najera, and (4) deciding not to inform the court that a Dependency and Neglect proceeding was required). Rather than interjecting entirely new facts, plaintiffs' allegation that Ms. Connell piggy-backed her investigations in order to avoid statutory and regulatory obligations amplifies the facts asserted in the original complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204105175\">\n    2007 WL 4105175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (finding that plaintiff's amended complaint related back to her original complaint where allegations asserted in the original complaint were \"at least a partial basis for plaintiff's [amended] First Amendment claim\" and thus sufficient to put defendants on notice of that claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court reaches the same conclusion as to plaintiffs' wrongful death claim. Defendants argue that plaintiffs did not assert a wrongful death claim against Ms. Connell until October 25, 2017. Docket No. 70 at 2. While that is true, the original complaint did assert a \u00a7 1983 claim against Ms. Connell as well as a wrongful death claim against PASCO and Ms. Najera.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1 at 14-18. Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claim against Ms. Connell was based on allegations that she breached her duties to Angel by failing to take appropriate \"corrective action\" to protect him from harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, \u00b6 47.

Thus, although the wrongful death claim in the second amended complaint constitutes a new claim against Ms. Connell, it arises out of the same facts asserted in plaintiffs' original complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204105175\">\n    2007 WL 4105175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (finding that newly asserted First Amendment claim was based on the same general set of facts alleged in the original complaint).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants contend that plaintiffs' allegations regarding \"willful and wanton conduct\" do not provide any notice of the facts underlying plaintiffs' wrongful death claim and \"are not entitled to an assumption of truth.\" Docket No. 107 at 2. As to the first point, the Court has already found other allegations in the original complaint sufficient to place Ms. Connell on notice of the factual basis for plaintiffs' wrongful death\n   claim. As to the second point, defendants appear to challenge the sufficiency of plaintiffs' allegations under Rule 12(b)(6). However, the only issue before the Court is whether plaintiffs' wrongful death claim satisfies the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B). The Court finds that it does. Accordingly, defendants are not entitled to dismissal of plaintiffs' wrongful death claim against Ms. Connell on statute of limitations grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

Instead, they argue that \"there was good cause for [their] three-week delay in service\" because plaintiffs' counsel (1) learned, sometime after June 2017, that his former law firm was not continuing to represent plaintiffs; (2) promptly entered an appearance in the case on July 14, 2017 and attempted to serve all defendants on August 1, 2017; (3) was informed for the first time on August 1, 2017 that Ms. Connell no longer worked for Jefferson County; and (4) promptly hired an investigator to locate and serve Ms. Connell on August 24, 2017.
