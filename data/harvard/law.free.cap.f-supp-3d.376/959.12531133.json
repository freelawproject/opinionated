Wright, United States District Judge\n   This matter is before the Court on the February 11, 2019 Report and Recommendation (R &amp; R) of United States Magistrate Judge Katherine M. Menendez. (Dkt. 33.) The R &amp; R recommends granting in part the petition for a writ of habeas corpus of Petitioner Bolus A. D. (B.D.). (Dkt. 1.) Respondents filed timely objections to the R &amp; R, and B.D. responded to those objections. For the reasons addressed below, this Court adopts as modified the R &amp; R and grants in part B.D.'s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Having been convicted of motor-vehicle theft in January 2016 and second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon in December 2017, B.D., a native and citizen of Sudan, was taken into custody by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on December 22, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (providing that the United States Attorney General \"shall take into custody any alien who ... is deportable by reason of having committed\" crimes of moral turpitude, aggravated felonies, controlled substance-crimes, and certain firearm offenses). On June 18, 2018, an immigration judge ordered B.D. removed from the United States and deported either to Sudan or to South Sudan because of B.D.'s motor-vehicle theft conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   B.D. subsequently filed this habeas petition, and he appealed the immigration judge's order to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). Concluding that B.D.'s conviction of motor-vehicle theft is not an aggravated felony conviction as defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(G), the BIA sustained B.D.'s appeal and remanded the case to the immigration judge. Shortly thereafter, ICE initiated removal proceedings based on B.D.'s December 2017 conviction of second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon. An immigration judge subsequently ordered B.D. removed, and B.D. appealed. While his appeal of the removal decision is pending, B.D. also has petitioned the Olmsted County District Court for post-conviction relief arising from B.D.'s December 2017 second-degree assault conviction. B.D. remains in ICE custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Respondents object to two conclusions of the R &amp; R supporting the recommendation to grant B.D.'s petition for habeas relief: (1) that B.D.'s continued detention without an individualized bond hearing violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and (2) at any bond hearing ordered, it is the government's burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that continued detention of B.D. is warranted because he presents a risk of flight or danger to the community. A district court reviews de novo those portions of the R &amp; R to which specific objections are made.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

But the government maintains that habeas relief in the form of a bond hearing for an alien detained pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) should be granted only in \"extraordinary cases.\" Applying this reasoning, the government contends that the R &amp; R erroneously concluded that this is one such extraordinary case.

Because B.D. has been detained for more than 16 months, well beyond the \"brief\" period of detention contemplated\n   in\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   , the first factor weighs heavily in B.D.'s favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/#p523\">\n    538 U.S. at 529-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/#p523\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liban\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530352\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/367/959/#p962\">\n    367 F.Supp.3d at 963-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201238834\">\n    2019 WL 1238834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (concluding that 12-month detention was not \"brief\");\n   <em>\n    Abdulkadir\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%207048363\">\n    2018 WL 7048363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (concluding that 9-month detention was not \"brief\");\n   <em>\n    Muse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204466052\">\n    2018 WL 4466052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (concluding that 14-month detention was not \"brief\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When evaluating the second factor, the likely length of continued detention in the absence of judicial relief, courts consider the anticipated duration of the entire judicial and administrative process.\n   <em>\n    Muse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204466052\">\n    2018 WL 4466052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ly v.

Although this Court declines to predict the BIA's ruling on B.D.'s current appeal or when it will issue, an appeal of the BIA's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is more than plausible and perhaps is likely. As such, B.D. may be detained for several more months as his case continues to proceed through both the administrative and judicial process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204466052\">\n    2018 WL 4466052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (estimating that a detainee who had \"just appealed\" a removal order to the BIA and would likely appeal any adverse decision to the Eighth Circuit \"could easily be detained another 18 months or more\"). This factor also weighs in B.D.'s favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The third factor considers the conditions of confinement. B.D. is subject to civil detention, not criminal incarceration. But there is a direct correlation between the strength of B.D.'s argument that he is entitled to a bond hearing and the degree to which the conditions of B.D.'s confinement resemble penal confinement.\n   <em>\n    Muse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204466052\">\n    2018 WL 4466052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Chavez-Alvarez v.

As his conditions of confinement are indistinguishable from criminal incarceration, this factor also weighs strongly in B.D.'s favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As the fourth and fifth factors, the Court also considers the nature and extent of any delays caused by the detainee and the government respectively. Here, neither party has engaged in dilatory tactics. And each party has advanced substantive arguments addressing the positions taken throughout this administrative and judicial process. As such, these factors weigh equally as to each party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The final factor contemplates the likelihood that the proceedings will culminate in a final removal order. But, as this Court is not in a position to weigh the merits of either the government's grounds for removal or B.D.'s appeal, this factor is neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In sum, the factors addressed here weigh in favor of granting B.D. habeas relief in the form of an individualized bond hearing. In particular, the length and conditions of B.D.'s detention weigh heavily in B.D.'s favor, and the government has not established a similarly weighty justification for continuing to hold B.D. without an individualized determination that he presents either a flight risk, a danger to the community, or both. For these reasons, the Court adopts the R &amp; R's recommendation to order an immigration judge to conduct a bond hearing within 30 days. At the bond hearing, the parties shall have the opportunity to present evidence and arguments addressing whether B.D., if released, presents a risk of flight or a danger to the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The R &amp; R also recommends concluding that it is the government's burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that B.D. presents a flight risk or a danger to the community. The government objects to this recommendation. The R &amp; R observes that Section 1226(c) is silent on this issue; and neither the Supreme Court of the United States nor the Eighth Circuit has addressed either which party bears the burden of proof at a bond hearing on continued detention under Section 1226(c) or the quantum of proof that is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court is not persuaded that due process requires this Court prospectively to order an immigration judge to adhere to a specific standard of proof at a bond hearing. As no court in this district or in the Eighth Circuit has reached that conclusion, and as no injury has occurred that is attributable to an incorrectly assigned burden and standard of proof, this Court declines to render an advisory opinion. Because the burden of proof and the quantum of proof at the bond hearing are decisions for the immigration judge in the first instance, the Court declines to adopt the R &amp; R's recommendation as to either.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204466052\">\n    2018 WL 4466052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.
