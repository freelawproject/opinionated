Wood, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs Aaron C. Passmore and Jerry O. Griffin are pretrial detainees confined at Will County Adult Detention Facility (\"WCADF\"). Plaintiffs claim that they suffered skin irritations on their genitals from dirty underwear and were denied medical treatment for their symptoms. Plaintiffs thus have brought this lawsuit pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging violations of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and naming as Defendants Will County, WCADF Warden Brad Josephson, in his official capacity, and current and former Will County employees Michael O'Leary, Brian Fink, Mike Kelley, and Kelly Bargo, in their individual capacities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants now move for summary judgment. (Dkt. No. 69.) For the following reasons, their motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At all times relevant to their complaint, Plaintiffs were pretrial detainees at WCADF. (Defs.' R. 56.1 Stmt. of Mat. Facts in Support of Summ. J. (\"DSMF\") \u00b6 1, Dkt. No. 71.) Defendant Will County is a unit of local government operating within the State of Illinois. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) Defendant Kelley serves as Sheriff of Will County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) Defendant O'Leary previously served as Warden of WCADF but later was succeeded in that position by Defendant Josephson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Defendant Fink served as Deputy Chief of Operations at WCADF, and Defendant Bargo, an employee of the Will County Sheriff's Office, served as the laundry assistant there. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5.) Bargo has been employed as a laundry assistant since August 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) Her duties include supervising \"tenders,\" detainees who are responsible for doing laundry at WCADF. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Bargo reports to the Deputy Chief of Support Services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. WCADF's Laundry Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   WCADF's laundry process was established before Bargo began working as a laundry assistant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) WCADF uses four washing machines to launder detainees' underwear, socks, T-shirts, towels, and sheets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) These clothing items for all 800-900 inmates are mixed together indiscriminately. (Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' Supplemental R. 56.1 Stmt. of Disputed [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] Mat. Facts (\"DRMF\") \u00b6 82, Dkt. No. 76.) No one checks the underwear for urine or fecal stains before placing it into the washing machine. (DSMF \u00b6 16.) According to Bargo, soap and bleach are added to the washing machines automatically. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) The soap and bleach lines are checked and filled by the maintenance staff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.) And the machine does not give an alert or warning if it is low on soap or bleach. (Pl.'s R. 56.1 Resp. to Defs.' Stmt. of Mat. Facts (\"PRMF\") \u00b6 13, Dkt. No. 72-1.) Bargo does not know how much soap or bleach goes into each load. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She checks whether soap is present by looking for bubbles, and if she does not see any, she turns off the machine and notifies the maintenance staff. (DSMF \u00b6 14.) However, Bargo cannot visually check in the same way whether bleach is present. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Passmore testified that he could not smell any soap or bleach on the stained underwear. (PRMF \u00b6 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Once laundry is washed and dried, it is folded, placed on the laundry cart, and randomly distributed to the detainees. (DSMF \u00b6 17.) Tenders are instructed to look at the underwear as they fold it and check for damage or stains. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Tenders are also instructed that if they would not wear the underwear themselves, they should not put it on the cart for distribution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) For example, if he sees urine or fecal stains, the tender should dispose of the underwear and log the disposal by indicating size and color. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Detainees exchange their clothing items, including underwear, twice per week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Tenders bring carts of laundered clothing into the general housing units and distribute the laundry under the supervision of Bargo or another laundry assistant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) At this point, detainees exchange their worn clothing items and check their newly-received items for sizing and damage, such as holes or stains. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) According to Bargo, detainees occasionally wish to exchange their underwear due to damage, but no one has ever complained to her about stains. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58, 61.) Plaintiffs dispute this claim, as both testified that they complained to Bargo about receiving stained underwear but she did not allow them to exchange it. (PRMF \u00b6\u00b6 58-59.) Bargo further testified that no detainee has ever complained to her about a genital\n   rash, but if someone had done so, she would have offered him a \"bio bag\" for his underwear. (DSMF \u00b6 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Passmore's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Passmore became a pretrial detainee at WCADF on April 7, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) From the start, he received stained underwear, but he did not start experiencing any symptoms until June 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That month, Passmore asked to exchange his stained underwear, but Bargo denied his request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Passmore had already left the distribution area and returned to his cell before seeking the exchange, however. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) And Bargo testified that she may refuse an exchange if the detainee fails to check the item before accepting it and leaving. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) A few days later, Passmore developed a red, itchy rash on his groin area and on his inner thighs and buttocks, which lasted a couple of months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) The rash started off as \"bumps,\" then \"turned reddish and started to become raw.\" (DRMF \u00b6 68.) According to Passmore, the rash affected his ability to move and walk around and caused a stinging sensation when his thighs rubbed together and when he defecated. (PRMF \u00b6 35.) Passmore had never experienced a genital rash before his admission to WCADF. (DRMF \u00b6 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Then, in October or November 2014, Passmore developed another rash in the same area, which lasted for about two or three months. (DSMF \u00b6 28.) Passmore testified that this time, he complained of the \"dirty, brown stained underwear\" to Bargo and asked for an underwear exchange before leaving the distribution area, but Bargo again denied his request. (DSMF \u00b6 29; Pls.' Stmt. of Add'l Facts that Raise a Genuine Dispute (\"PSAF\") \u00b6 77, Dkt. No. 72-1.) Passmore subsequently developed a third rash in March 2015, after he again received stained underwear. (DSMF \u00b6 30.) At this point, Passmore tried to wash the underwear but ultimately decided to stop wearing it altogether. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Passmore put in three healthcare requests in October and November 2014 regarding the rash. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) He also filed grievances about the dirty underwear in November 2014, March 2015, and April 2015, but the issue was never addressed. (DRMF \u00b6 73.) In addition, Passmore spoke to a nurse about the rash in November 2014, but he did not consult a doctor. (DSMF \u00b6 33.) On October 16 and 21, 2014, Passmore saw a doctor for low back pain and attempted to discuss his rash, but the doctor advised him to submit a separate request slip. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Griffin's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Griffin became a pretrial detainee at WCADF in May 2014. Upon his arrival, Griffin was assigned to the medical unit or \"M-pod\" at WCADF, where he stayed until August 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) After his arrival at WCADF, Griffin immediately began experiencing issues with dirty underwear. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) He developed \"bumps\" on the right side of his genitals and in between his thighs for a little over a week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) However, even though Griffin told the doctor about his rash and submitted one or more medical slips about it, he did not receive any medical attention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In August and September 2014, when Griffin was no longer housed in the M-pod, he requested an underwear exchange, but Bargo would not allow it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) When Griffin washed the underwear on his own, he noticed that his symptoms improved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) Like Passmore, Griffin had never experienced a genital rash before his admission to WCADF. (DRMF \u00b6 80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Griffin complains of several other incidents of mistreatment in addition to the dirty underwear issue. As mentioned above, Griffin was assigned to the M-pod\n   upon his arrival at WCADF in May 2014 until August 2014; this was due to his need for treatment for an orbital (eye socket) fracture. (DSMF \u00b6 46.) Griffin claims that WCADF medical staff mistreated his fracture and denied him pain medication. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But Griffin's orbital fracture was seen by medical staff every two weeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Griffin was also taken to Loyola Hospital twice during this time period, where doctors checked his vision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) Griffin was offered Tylenol for his eye pain, but he refused. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In addition, Griffin claims that while he was housed in the M-pod, the lights would stay on all night, and unidentified staff entering the unit either intentionally slammed the doors or failed to prevent the doors from slamming shut. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) These conditions gave Griffin a headache. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Griffin also did not have access to the outside while housed in the M-pod, which he claims deprived him of fresh air. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, Griffin asserts that he was humiliated during several strip searches. On October 10, 14, and 15, 2014, Griffin was subjected to strip searches as part of a unit-wide shakedown. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) The strip searches were performed by male corrections officers, but several female corrections officers were also present at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.) The female officers were walking past Griffin's cell or located 10 to 20 feet away from the area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In their motion for summary judgment, Defendants argue that the undisputed evidence shows Plaintiffs cannot prove their claims, that Will County is not liable for the alleged constitutional violations, and that the individual Defendants are protected by qualified immunity. Summary judgment is proper \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Summary judgment will be denied if \"a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Passmore has not shown that his rash was diagnosed by a physician; his only evidence is after-the-fact opinion testimony from a nurse practitioner, Tiffany Ferguson, that the symptoms Passmore described are consistent with irritant contact dermatitis. But Ferguson also testified that the dermatitis was not chronic or life-threatening and did not pose a risk of lingering disability. And Passmore's own testimony demonstrates that the rash faded on its own after a few months.

Griffin's proffered evidence fails to meet this standard. And once again, Griffin has not put forward evidence that he complained about the lights or slamming doors.

By contrast, here, Griffin's allegations span a wide spectrum of issues, ranging from unsanitary conditions to lack of medical care, noise and light disturbances, and humiliation tactics. Griffin does not identify the deprivation of any specific need, instead asking the Court simply to conclude that \"the conditions of confinement amounted to a constitutional violation.\" (Pl.'s Mem. in Resp. to Defs.' R. 56 Mot. for Summ. J. at 3, Dkt. No. 72.)
