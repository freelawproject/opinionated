However, Ms. Howell provided the following response to Murphy's request for the presence of his spiritual advisor:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   We do not permit a non-TDCJ employee be present in the execution chamber during the execution, which precludes Mr. Murphy's spiritual advisor from being present.

Murphy has a clear right to relief pursuant to the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2.

Ray requested the presence during his execution of a spiritual advisor who was not authorized according to prison policy. Ray brought suit under \u00a7 1983 raising similar complaints\n   under the Establishment Clause and RLUIPA. After reviewing Ray's significant litigation history and his previous opportunities to challenge the prison policy, the federal district court found that he did not merit a stay:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In short, Ray has been dilatory in filing this action.

The Eleventh Circuit emphasized that Alabama statutory law did not make clear that Ray's requested spiritual advisor could not be present in the execution. Also, the relevant prison policies were confidential and not available for review earlier. Without some evidence that Ray knew or should have known of the prison policy, the Eleventh Circuit found that \"Ray has provided an altogether plausible explanation for why the claims were not filed in district court sooner and the state has neither argued nor produced any evidence that the petitioner was aware that the claims were available at an earlier date.\"\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520093\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/915/689/#p702\">\n    915 F.3d at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Murphy presents two arguments to differentiate his case from the Supreme Court's action in\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   . First, Murphy sent an email request to TDCJ a month, rather than only days, before his execution. Second, Murphy alleges that he \"began seeking relief in the state courts even before TDCJ expressly denied his request.\" (Docket Entry No. 1, p. 14)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   case, however, did not focus only on the number of days remaining before execution when the inmate filed\n   suit. The district court stayed his execution because he knew, or should have known, that he needed to file suit much earlier. Murphy knew, or should have known, of the policy long before he sent TDCJ general counsel an email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Murphy has been on death row since 2003. He has been a follower of Buddha for several years and has associated with the same spiritual advisor for some time. Since 2012, at least, TDCJ policy has only allowed for the presence of TDCJ employees during the execution process. Murphy alleges that \"TDCJ's policy is identical to Alabama's in all relevant aspects ....\" (Docket Entry No. 1, p. 13) He fails, however, to acknowledge a crucial difference. TDCJ execution policy is not confidential. Murphy had reason to know since its adoption that TDCJ policy would not allow the presence of his spiritual advisor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In November of 2018 the United States Supreme Court denied the petition for certiorari review from the Murphy's federal habeas action. The state district court set his execution date a month later. Murphy did nothing to communicate to TDCJ his desire for the presence of his spiritual advisor until 29 days remained before his execution. Murphy gave TDCJ little time to decide whether to vary its policy. And Murphy gave TDCJ little time to litigate any legal challenge that would follow. Once informed that TDCJ would not deviate from its policy, Murphy waited over two weeks to file litigation in state court. He filed this action only two days before his execution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Given the State's significant interest in enforcing its criminal judgments ... there is a strong equitable presumption against the grant of a stay where a claim could have been brought at such a time as to allow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay.\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.
