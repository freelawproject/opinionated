McFADDEN, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Velma Olu-Cole sued the E.L. Haynes Public Charter School (\"Haynes\") on behalf of her minor son, M.K. She alleges that Haynes violated M.K.'s rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"). She seeks compensatory education for M.K. and attorneys' fees for litigating an administrative due process claim on his behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Haynes moved to dismiss these claims, arguing in the alternative that it should be granted summary judgment. Ms. Olu-Cole cross-moved for partial summary judgment. After assessing the parties' arguments, Magistrate Judge Harvey recommended that Haynes's motion be denied and Ms. Olu-Cole's cross-motion be granted. The Court agrees and, for the reasons explained below, adopts the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Report and Recommendation comprehensively describes the background and history of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. &amp; R. at 2-7, ECF No. 28. To summarize, M.K. is a high school student at Haynes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. He has a disability, \"Emotional Disturbance,\" that the IDEA covers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because of this, Haynes must develop and implement an individualized educational program to help M.K. meet his academic needs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   M.K. has a history of behavioral problems.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hearing Officer Determination, ECF No. 19-1 at 60. In 2017, he attacked another student, repeatedly punching the student in the face.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62. The victim was \"left with a concussion and suffered memory loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the fight, Haynes suspended M.K. for 45 days. R. &amp; R. at 3. The school investigated the incident and found that his conduct was a manifestation of his disability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Haynes then sought to remove M.K. and have him placed in a \"therapeutic, nonpublic, special education day school.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Because Ms. Olu-Cole did not consent, the school submitted its request to the District of Columbia's Office of the State Superintendent of Education (the \"Superintendent's Office\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The Superintendent's Office refused to require a change of school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. It found that \"with a robust [individualized educational program], supported by other appropriate interventions, [Haynes] can successfully serve students with similar circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Still, Haynes continued to seek M.K.'s removal. It filed an administrative due process complaint with the Superintendent's Office. ECF No. 19-1 at 9-13. The school argued that M.K.'s \"verbally and physically aggressive behavior pose a significant safety risk to others\" and to himself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at\n   12. It therefore requested that the Superintendent's Office require Ms. Olu-Cole to consent to a change in M.K.'s school placement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While this administrative due process claim was pending, Ms. Olu-Cole filed her case here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1. She noted in her complaint that \"Haynes is refusing to allow M.K. to attend classes\" in violation of IDEA's \"stay put provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. This provision requires that, during any due process proceedings, a child \"shall remain in [his] then-current educational placement.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j). Ms. Olu-Cole argued that Haynes violated the stay-put provision by keeping M.K. out of school past his 45-day suspension. Compl. 12. She sought a Temporary Restraining Order and a Preliminary Injunction to allow him to return to school. Compl. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After hearing oral arguments, the Court denied these requests for relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Court's February 2, 2018 Minute Order;\n   <em>\n    Olu-Cole v.

She argued that the measures Haynes had taken to address M.K.'s disability were inadequate, and that the school had therefore denied M.K. the \"free appropriate public education\" the IDEA requires.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39. She sought compensatory education \"to remedy the denial(s) of [a free appropriate public education] up to, but\n   <em>\n    excluding\n   </em>\n   , the denial ... stemming from the violation of M.K.'s stay-put rights after January 26[, 2018].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Hearing Officer found that M.K. was entitled to compensatory education.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71. He ordered Haynes to provide M.K. \"fifty hours of individual tutoring\" and \"twenty hours of counseling.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Still pending here are Ms. Olu-Cole's claim for \"compensatory education for any violations of [the IDEA's] stay put [provision]\" and her request for attorneys' fees. Am. Compl. 13-15, ECF. No. 15. Haynes seeks dismissal of these claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss (\"Def.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 19. The school argues that the compensatory education request is now moot because of the Hearing Officer's decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Haynes also suggests that the Court should not permit Ms. Olu-Cole to seek attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It asserts that, because the school's administrative action to remove M.K. was \"voluntarily withdrawn,\" Ms. Olu-Cole is not a \"prevailing party\" as defined by the IDEA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Magistrate Judge recommends rejecting these arguments. He believes that Ms. Olu-Cole's claim for compensatory education is not moot, and that she was a prevailing party because the Hearing Officer dismissed Haynes's complaint with prejudice. Haynes filed timely objections to these recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Federal courts \"lack jurisdiction to decide moot cases because their constitutional authority extends only to actual\n   cases or controversies.\"\n   <em>\n    Iron Arrow Soc'y v.

It argues, for example, that Ms. Olu-Cole's consent was \"neither sought nor required\" for the 45-day suspension the school imposed on M.K.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Haynes also suggests that, in seeking to change M.K.'s school placement, \"this change was not necessarily intended to be 'permanent.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Report and Recommendation does not suggest, for instance, that Ms. Olu-Cole's consent was required for the suspension.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. &amp; R. at 3. And the school's authority to suspend M.K. for 45 days and place him in an interim alternative educational setting is not at issue. Nor does Haynes's intent about M.K.'s placement in another school matter. The facts are that Haynes sought to move M.K. to another school, that Ms. Olu-Cole objected, that the Superintendent's Office declined to require Ms. Olu-Cole to consent, and that Haynes's administrative complaint was dismissed with prejudice. The Court therefore overrules this objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Haynes alleges that the Magistrate Judge failed to consider expert testimony presented during the administrative due process proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Obj. to R. &amp; R. at 2-6. This testimony, the school argues, shows that the Hearing Officer's decision \"remedied the claim for compensatory education in this case,\" thus making it moot.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Not so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ms. Olu-Cole raises two distinct claims. In her administrative due process complaint, she sought relief for \"up to, but\n   <em>\n    excluding\n   </em>\n   ,\" Haynes's alleged violation of IDEA's stay-put provision, which occurred after January 26, 2018. ECF No. 19-1 at 39 (emphasis in original). This request is unambiguous. And Ms. Olu-Cole explicitly emphasized her desire to cabin the relief she sought.

And it is also true that the remedy the Hearing Officer ordered does not specify whether the compensatory education is for all the time M.K. was out of school.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 19-1 at 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   But at the motion to dismiss stage, the Court must \"afford [Ms. Olu-Cole] the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Jeong Seon Han\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270683\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/95/#p103\">\n    223 F.Supp.3d at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither the expert testimony nor the Hearing Officer's decision unambiguously show that the relief Ms. Olu-Cole was granted extends to her allegations of a stay-put violation. Based on the Hearing Officer's descriptions of the questions presented to him, it is plausible that the remedy he ordered did not cover the period after January 26, 2018.

In that action, Haynes sought to force a change in M.K.'s school placement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 19-1 at 12. The school then moved to withdraw its complaint without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.

And by successfully seeking a dismissal with prejudice, she ensured that Haynes cannot again seek removal based on M.K.'s prior conduct. This\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   effect shows a change in the legal relationship between Ms. Olu-Cole and Haynes. She is thus a \"prevailing party\" under the IDEA and may seek attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Haynes's protestations are unavailing.
