Defendants moved to dismiss the ERISA and unjust enrichment claims entirely, and moved to dismiss the FLSA and state law overtime claims brought by the dentist Plaintiffs. The ERISA claims have since been stayed. (Dkt. 69.) The remaining claims at issue here are (1) the unjust enrichment claims of all Plaintiffs, and (2) the overtime FLSA and state law claims of the dentist Plaintiffs. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Second Amended Complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleges that, beginning some time before 2002, MetLife hired licensed dentists and dental hygienists as consultants to evaluate claims for benefits submitted by policyholders, participants, and beneficiaries in employee benefit plans (the \"Dental Consultants\"). (Dkt. 49 (\"SAC\") \u00b6 1.) The Dental Consultants included licensed dentists-Plaintiffs Carol McNeely, Shilpa Vlk, George Bernhard, David T. Rudziewicz, and Frederick DeMaio (the \"Dentist Plaintiffs\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   )-and dental hygienists-Plaintiffs Deborah Joyce, Donna Kobielski, and Donna Molta. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Compensation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   MetLife compensated the Dental Consultants as independent contractors even though, until November 2017, it determined and controlled all aspects of the performance of their duties to an extent that made them employees, not independent contractors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.) On October 31, 2017, MetLife rewrote its contract to explicitly call the Dental Consultants independent contractors, and changed some of its practices to treat them more like independent contractors. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 40-41; Dkt. 49-1 (\"Prior Contract\") \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3; Dkt. 49-2 (\"New Contract\") \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   MetLife did not pay the Dental Consultants on a salary basis, did not pay overtime when they worked more than forty hours in a week, and did not pay on a biweekly basis. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 101-03, 108, 115; Prior Contract \u00b6 1; New Contract \u00b6 3.) Instead, MetLife paid them monthly based on the number of hours worked times a contracted rate per hour, without overtime pay. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Dental Consultants did, however, receive bonuses in the form of temporary increases in hourly\n   rates based on the number of claims that they as a group were able to process during high-volume times. (SAC \u00b6 93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Dental Consultants were not offered certain employee benefits that generally were available to MetLife employees, including a variety of largely employer-paid insurance plans and a defined benefit pension plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 119.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   MetLife did not pay the employer portion of FICA taxes for the Dental Consultants' wages, and did not withhold the employee portion from their monthly pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 133; New Contract \u00b6 3.) As a result, the Dental Consultants paid the combined employer and employee amount of FICA taxes. (SAC \u00b6 134.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Duties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Dental Consultants' primary duties were to review claims for services, which involved reviewing clinical information submitted by treating dentists and evaluating whether the services rendered-such as crowns, bridges, onlays, implants, or periodontal treatments-were dentally necessary, to assist MetLife in deciding whether to pay for services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72, 105.) Dental Consultants could recommend that an alternate, less expensive benefit be applied to a service, and if MetLife adopted the recommendation, benefits would be paid based only upon the less costly service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Prior Contract listed the Dental Consultants' duties as: \"a) Reviewing dental claims and rendering your professional opinion; b) Providing advice and counsel to the Claims Office staff; c) Communicating via telephone with submitting dentists to explain and clarify dental claims; and, d) Training Dental Consultants, as may be required.\" (Old Contract \u00b6 2.) These four duties are also described in the schedule of services under the New Contract, and a fifth service is added: \"Assisting MetLife's Claims Office Staff and Special Investigation Unit with potential fraudulent dental claims submissions and fraud investigations, including abuse and overutilization.\" (New Contract Sched. A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Dental Consultants were not practicing dentistry. (SAC \u00b6 105.) They did not have patient-provider relationships with any of the policyholders, participants, or beneficiaries, did not diagnose the patients' dental needs for the purpose of providing services to those patients, and did not assist or advise the practicing dentist in providing services to the patient.

As their argument goes, the Dental Consultants had to pay their own and the employer share of FICA taxes to the IRS, and MetLife unfairly benefitted as a result, to the Dental Consultants' detriment.
