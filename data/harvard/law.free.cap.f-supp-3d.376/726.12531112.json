Gilbert Sanchez, an employee of Smart Fabricators of Texas, LLC, did welding work on different drilling rigs. (Docket Entry No. 1-2 at 3). In August 2018, while working on the Enterprise 263, a jacked-up drilling rig owned and operated by Enterprise Offshore Drilling LLC, Sanchez tripped on a pipe and injured his ankle and back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Sanchez sued Enterprise Offshore Drilling and Smart Fabricators in state court, asserting negligence and unseaworthiness claims and seeking medical expenses, lost wages, and exemplary damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Enterprise Offshore Drilling and Smart Fabricators removed, arguing that this court has subject-matter jurisdiction because Sanchez's injury occurred while he was working on a drilling rig jacked up on the Outer Continental Shelf.
