New Venture's business requires effective advertising and marketing; New Venture relies on television, radio, print media, its online website, and social media for its advertising. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7. Prior to March 2018, New Venture relied on in-house resources and regional advertising agencies to carry out its advertising and marketing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Because of its growing national platform and a desire to improve marketing efforts, in late 2017 and early 2018, New Venture began looking for a national advertising agency to take over its advertising and marketing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant DeVito Verdi is a New York-based advertising agency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. In 2018, New Venture and DeVito Verdi began discussions for DeVito Verdi to become New Venture's principal advertising agency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. For several years prior to these discussions, DeVito Verdi had solicited New Venture's business. For instance, in 2014, Paul McCormick, DeVito Verdi's executive vice president of account management, sent an email to Brian Hostetler, vice president of marketing for New Venture, who was located in Virginia, about an advertising campaign DeVito Verdi had done for Tribe Hummus. Hostetler Decl. \u00b6 9, ECF No. 10, Ex. B.

Strelitz, the chief executive officer of New Venture, would not agree to hire DeVito Verdi until he personally met with DeVito Verdi. Verdi Decl. \u00b6 13. Therefore, the parties held an inperson meeting at New Venture's store in Chicago, Illinois.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. At that meeting, the parties reached an agreement on DeVito Verdi's engagement as New Venture's advertising agency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, DeVito Verdi drafted a letter agreement for the engagement and sent it to New Venture in Virginia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. However, this was not the final contract. Following edits and further negotiation, New Venture put the agreement on its letterhead, and sent it back to DeVito Verdi in New York City, where DeVito Verdi executed the agreement on March 23, 2018 (the \"Agreement\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16; Hostetler Decl. \u00b6 15; Compl. \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The agreement provides that DeVito Verdi would provide work in four separate categories, with a flat monthly payment from New Venture for each category of work: (a) Strategy and Creative; (b) In-Store Communications Creative; (c) Public Relations and Social Media; and (d) Digital, Website Development, Optimization, SEO, SEM.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Agreement, ECF No. 1, Ex. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The agreement further provides that New Venture must approve every advertisement and will own all finished product.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1(a). It also states that New Venture must reimburse DeVito Verdi for out-of-pocket expenses, but only expenses authorized by New Venture.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Moreover, it provides that New Venture will be responsible for booking all business travel, i.e. all travel was subject to Plaintiff's approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pursuant to the agreement, DeVito Verdi commenced work for The Dump on or after March 26, 2018. Following the execution of the agreement, representatives of New Venture went to DeVito Verdi's offices in New York to discuss DeVito Verdi's work on two occasions. Verdi Decl. \u00b6 21. Employees of DeVito Verdi visited New Venture's store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and traveled to North Carolina to view how and where New Venture purchases its inventory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. At no point did any DeVito Verdi employee visit Virginia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. The parties exchanged several emails and telephone calls during their contractual relationship.

Compl., ECF No. 1. Count I of the Complaint alleges breach of contract or in the alternative, unjust enrichment,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-43;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Count II alleges fraudulent inducement,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-60; Count III alleges a breach of fiduciary duty,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-65; and Count IV seeks a declaratory judgment that Defendant is in breach of its obligations and Plaintiff has no continuing obligations under the agreement,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-68.

Here, the parties reached an oral agreement in Illinois. Subsequently, DeVito Verdi sent a draft contract from New York to New Venture in Virginia. New Venture made changes and sent the contract back from Virginia to DeVito Verdi in New York. This constituted a new offer, and the contract was executed in New York when DeVito Verdi signed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A contract which is accepted and becomes effective in another forum generally will not satisfy the minimum contacts necessary for the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Luke v.

Applying Virginia's choice of law provisions, either Illinois or New York law (depending on whether the oral agreement or the final written contract governed) would govern questions about the nature, validity, and interpretation of the contract, rather than Virginia law. Thus, the Defendant availed itself of either Illinois or New York law, but Defendant did not avail itself of Virginia law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Further, the fact that New Venture sent the contract from Virginia to DeVito Verdi in New York is a critical distinction between this case and those cited by Plaintiff.

Jurisdiction Based on Performance of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Next, the Court looks at whether DeVito Verdi's actions as to the performance of the contract is a sufficient basis for the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction. New Venture argues that the continuing relationship and ongoing obligations created by the agreement is sufficient to establish jurisdiction. Specifically, Plaintiff points out that Defendant was to obtain Plaintiff's approval in Virginia before producing or running any advertisement, all business travel had to be booked by Plaintiff, and all produced advertisements became the property of New Venture. Plaintiff's arguments are unavailing because they focus on New Venture's own obligations under the contract. It is true that New Venture had to approve the advertisements, book travel, pay DeVito Verdi its monthly fee, and accept ownership of work product - all from its headquarters in Virginia. However, that is insufficient to establish jurisdiction over DeVito Verdi. As courts have explained \"the plaintiff cannot be the only link between the defendant and the forum.

Therefore, the fact that a contract envisions one party discharging its obligations in the forum state cannot, standing alone, justify the exercise of jurisdiction over another party to the contract. To hold otherwise would subject a party like DeVito Verdi to the whims of its counterparty; for instance, if New Venture had performed its obligations from its store in Texas or moved its headquarters, DeVito Verdi would suddenly be subject to personal jurisdiction in those forums through no action of its own.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Danville Plywood Corp. v.

DeVito Verdi did not have to provide media strategy in Virginia. The facts before the Court suggest that New Venture went to DeVito Verdi's New York office on two occasions. It is also not apparent that the clause regarding store visits contemplates activity in Virginia. In fact, DeVito Verdi visited New Venture's store in Philadelphia, not Virginia. The review of the in-store elements could also have been done by visiting a store outside of Virginia. And again, the facts suggest otherwise; DeVito Verdi's work for in-store elements was for New Venture's store in Chicago. Verdi Decl. \u00b6 30. Finally, not only is the Complaint devoid of any allegation that the contract contemplated performance in Virginia, it actually suggests the parties contemplated work outside of Virginia. For instance, the Complaint states that New Venture hired DeVito Verdi because of \"its growing national platform.\" Compl. \u00b6 8. That is, it appears New Venture wanted to focus on growth outside of Virginia. Even the allegations of DeVito Verdi's breach of the contract suggest performance outside of Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 31(c) (\"As\n   <em>\n    part of opening a new store in Chicago\n   </em>\n   , New Venture held a critical meeting to discuss the opening and related in-store issues.

This lack of contemplation of performance in Virginia distinguishes this case from those cited by Plaintiff.

Here, Defendant has not engaged in any physical contacts with Virginia. At no point did DeVito Verdi send an employee or representative to Virginia, and it does not appear that Defendant sent any physical mail or goods following the execution of the contract.

Cumulative Contacts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The remaining concern, therefore, is whether viewing all of Defendant's contacts cumulatively can be a basis for the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction. In an analogous case, the Fourth Circuit found that \"[a]lthough [Plaintiff] argues that [Defendant] reached out to it in Virginia, this assertion, even when coupled with the cited [subsequent] communications, is not enough to overcome the factors noted above. On these facts, [Defendant's] contact with Virginia was simply too attenuated to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Consulting Engineers Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3479972\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/273/#p277\">\n    561 F.3d at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed, in this case, Defendant's contacts with Virginia are also limited to the solicitation of New Venture's business prior to the contract and communications with New Venture following the contract. Thus, this is also too attenuated to overcome the factors that indicate personal jurisdiction does not exist over this matter - New Venture sent the contract to New York for execution, the terms of the contract are governed by a foreign state's laws, the lack of physical contact in Virginia by Defendant, the terms of the contract do not clearly evidence intention of performance in Virginia, and actual performance of the contract outside of Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that Defendant availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Constitutional Reasonableness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The parties do not contest the second element of the Fourth Circuit's test for specific personal jurisdiction - whether the claim arises out of DeVito Verdi's activities in Virginia - but do contest the third element - constitutional reasonableness of asserting jurisdiction. The \"reasonableness\" requirement looks at whether the defendant had \"clear notice that it is subject to suit [in the forum state], and can act to alleviate the risk of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance, passing the expected costs on to customers, or, if the risks are too great, severing its connection with the State.\"\n   <em>\n    World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306135\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/286/#p297\">\n    444 U.S. at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306135\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/286/#p297\">\n    100 S.Ct. 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Courts may consider \"(1) the burden on the defendant of litigating in the\n   forum; (2) the interest of the forum state in adjudicating the dispute; (3) the plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief; (4) the shared interest of the states in obtaining efficient resolution of disputes; and (5) the interests of the states in furthering substantive social policies.\"\n   <em>\n    Consulting Engineers Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3479972\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/273/#p277\">\n    561 F.3d at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   While it is true that Defendant solicited New Venture's business in Virginia, Defendant would bear at least some burden if it were forced to defend the litigation in Virginia. DeVito Verdi is based in New York, and its principals and witnesses would have to travel from New York to Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

The parties met in Illinois and reached an oral agreement there; Plaintiff sent Defendant a contract from Virginia to New York, and the contract was executed in New York. Although New Venture argues that Virginia has an interest in defending the rights of its citizen corporations, in this instance, its citizen, New Venture, availed itself of the laws of other states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   It also cannot be said that any unfairness results to Plaintiff. Plaintiff clearly availed itself of foreign states' laws. New Venture is also a sophisticated corporation, and can afford to bring a lawsuit in another state. Further, New Venture is not left with little recourse; it has numerous appropriate fora in which to bring a suit; and jurisdiction is likely proper in Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina based on the parties' dealings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, the Court looks at consistency and public policy concerns. Although unaddressed by the parties, other courts, which have looked at the personal jurisdiction question in the context of advertising agencies, have found that an advertising agency is generally only subject to personal jurisdiction in states where they have directed some activity.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lions Gate Entm't Inc. v.

Cal. 2016) (finding that a New York-based advertising agency was subject to jurisdiction in California because they knew that the copyright holder was in California, had contact with California and infringed upon the copyright anyway). Here, DeVito Verdi did not direct any activity in Virginia, such as by placing commercials on television or in DeVito Verdi's Virginia stores. Rather, the contract envisions Defendant producing an advertisement once approved by Plaintiff; once produced, the advertisement becomes the property of Plaintiff who then directs placement of the advertisement. Agreement \u00b6 1(a). To hold that this is sufficient for personal jurisdiction as New Venture suggests would subject professional service firms like advertising agencies and law firms to suits in a state merely because their clients do business there. The Court is not aware of any case that has permitted such an expansive view of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, the Court finds that it would not be constitutionally reasonable to exercise jurisdiction on the facts and allegations before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Leave to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff requests that New Venture be granted leave to amend if any of the claims are found insufficient.
