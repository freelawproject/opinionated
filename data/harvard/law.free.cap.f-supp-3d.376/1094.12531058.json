Defendant Emmanuel Venegas-Vasquez (\"Venegas-Vasquez\") is charged with one count of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(5). That statute makes it unlawful for an alien who is \"illegally or unlawfully in the United States\" to possess a firearm or ammunition. Venegas-Vasquez contends that he was not illegally or unlawfully in the United States, and thus the indictment should be dismissed\n   for failure to allege an element of the offense. Venegas-Vasquez relies upon two facts, which the Government does not dispute. First, in January 2015, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") granted Venegas-Vasquez Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\"). Second, in 2016, USCIS \"paroled\" Venegas-Vasquez into the United States, pursuant to \u00a7 212(d)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(9)(B)(iii). Based on these facts, Venegas-Vasquez argues that he was not illegally or unlawfully in the United States at the time the indictment alleges he was in possession of two firearms, May 26, 2018. The Government responds by arguing that Venegas-Vasquez did not have legal or lawful status in the United States and that is all that is required under that element of \u00a7 922(g)(5). The Court concludes that \u00a7 922(g)(5)(A) is grievously ambiguous regarding whether the phrase \"illegally or unlawfully in the United States\" refers to either presence or status. Because this element defines the conduct that constitutes a crime, under the rule of lenity Venegas-Vasquez may not be prosecuted for this offense. Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Venegas-Vasquez is an alien citizen of Mexico. It is not disputed that Venegas-Vasquez unlawfully entered the United States as a child in 2001. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") records show that Venegas-Vasquez has applied for neither citizenship nor residence in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In September 2014, Venegas-Vasquez applied to USCIS under the DACA program. On January 22, 2015, USCIS granted Venegas-Vasquez DACA, and renewed his DACA in January 2018. In January 2015, the USCIS also provided Venegas-Vasquez with an employment authorization card, allowing him to work in the United States. In February 2015, the Social Security Administration issued a social security number to Venegas-Vasquez. In addition, in March 2016, Venegas-Vasquez applied for permission to travel to Mexico to visit his family. USCIS authorized Venegas-Vasquez for parole back into the United States under \u00a7 212(d)(5) of the INA, and Venegas-Vasquez was paroled back into the United States in 2016.

Police arrived and took Venegas-Vasquez into custody. With Venegas-Vasquez' consent, the police searched his truck and found a loaded 9mm handgun and a loaded AK-47 style assault rifle. On February 4, 2018, a federal grand jury indicted Venegas-Vasquez for one count of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Rule 12(b)(3)(B)(v) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\"allows a defendant to file a pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment for failure to state an offense if the motion can be determined without a trial on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Black's Law Dictionary defines \"unlawful\" as \"not authorized by law; illegal.\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1675 (9th ed. 2009). Section 922(g)(5) uses these terms in their adverb form, modifying the phrase \"in the United States.\" These dictionary definitions do not resolve a potential textual ambiguity in the statute, as argued by the parties: whether \"illegally or unlawfully in the United States\" means illegal or unlawful \"presence\" or illegal or unlawful \"immigration status.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The statute does not expressly use the terms \"present\" or \"presence;\" nor does it use the terms \"status\" or \"immigration status.\" Venegas-Vasquez emphasizes that by referring to individuals who are illegally or unlawfully\n   <em>\n    in the United States\n   </em>\n   , the focus of \u00a7 922(g)(5) is on the lawfulness of a person's physical presence in the United States, not their immigration status. In response, the Government emphasizes the lack of any mention of the word \"presence\" in the statute. The Supreme Court has cautioned that \"we ordinarily resist reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Dean v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653381\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/568/#p572\">\n    556 U.S. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 572,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653381\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/568/#p572\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653381\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/568/#p572\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). The Court notes, however, that the word \"in,\" which does appear in \u00a7 922(g)(5), is more naturally read to relate to physical or geographical presence, rather than a status, such a immigration status, and that neither \"presence\" nor \"status\" appears in the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Ninth Circuit has confirmed that physical presence was one of the elements\n   required for an alien to be \"\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   the United States\" for the purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(5)(A).\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

Although this case offers some support to Venegas-Vasquez' interpretation of the statute,\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Perera\n   </em>\n   did not address the specific question relevant to this case, namely the definition of \"\n   <em>\n    illegally or unlawfully\n   </em>\n   \" in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Perera\n   </em>\n   did note, however, \"the confluence of immigration law and criminal law inherent in \u00a7 922(g)(5)(A)\" and found that it was necessary to use immigration law definitions in interpreting that statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996931\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/932/#p935\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996931\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/932/#p935\">\n    at 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court therefore rejects the Government's argument that this Court should not look to immigration law definitions when interpreting the criminal statute of \u00a7 922(g)(5)(A). Instead, the Court considers the meaning of both \"presence\" and \"status\" under federal immigration law to analyze whether either term appropriately expresses the meaning of \u00a7 922(g)(5), and to analyze Venegas-Vasquez' argument that he was not unlawfully present, either because of his receipt of DACA or because he was paroled into the United States, or both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

At a minimum, therefore, this FAQ shows what the Government was itself communicating to recipients of DACA, including Venegas-Vasquez, that they were \"lawfully present in the United States\" while their deferred action is in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court therefore concludes that Venegas-Vasquez was not \"unlawfully present\" because his deferred action is a period of stay authorized by the Attorney General. The Court also concludes, however,\n   that Venegas-Vasquez has no formal immigration status based on his receipt of DACA. As a result, if \"illegally or unlawfully in the United States\" in \u00a7 922(g)(5) means or requires illegal or unlawful\n   <em>\n    presence\n   </em>\n   , then Venegas-Vasquez was not illegally or unlawfully in the United States, and the indictment must be dismissed. If, however, \"illegally or unlawfully in the United States\" means illegal or unlawful\n   <em>\n    immigration status\n   </em>\n   , then Venegas-Vasquez was illegally or unlawfully in the United States, and the indictment should not be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Government is correct that Congress did not contemplate DACA when it enacted \u00a7 922(g)(5), because DACA was first announced in 2012, and \u00a7 922(g)(5) became law in 1968. The Court, however, also finds persuasive Venegas-Vasquez's argument concerning the legislative history of \u00a7 922. The legislative history of that statute indicates that Congress intended this criminal law to apply to individuals who could \"not be trusted to possess a firearm without becoming a threat to society.\" 114 Cong. Rec. 14, 773 (1968). Congressman Emanuel Celler, the House Manager of the Act, stated the \"bill seeks to maximize the possibility of keeping firearms out of the hands of such persons\" as \"drug addicts, mental incompetents, persons with a history of mental disturbances, and persons convicted of certain offenses ....\" 114 Cong. Rec. 21, 784 (1986).
