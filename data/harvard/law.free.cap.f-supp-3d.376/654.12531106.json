Bauman\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court clarified that general jurisdiction over corporate defendants will only exist in three circumstances: (1) in the forum where the defendant is incorporated; (2) in the forum where the defendant has its principal place of business; and (3) in a forum where a \"corporation's affiliations with the [forum] are so continuous and systematic as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum State.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/117/\">\n    571 U.S. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 138-39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n    187 L.Ed.2d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, Defendant is a Texas limited partnership that maintains its principal place of business in McKinney, Texas. As such, the only way this Court can have personal jurisdiction over Defendant is if Defendant's contacts with South Carolina are so continuous and systematic as to\n   render it essentially at home in South Carolina.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 139,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant sells its toys through three brick and mortar stores in South Carolina as well as online to South Carolina consumers. In its Response to Defendant's Motion, Plaintiff contends that Defendant's website now lists nine hobby shops in South Carolina that distribute Defendant's products. Regardless of the number of brick and mortar stores Defendant distributes its products through or the volume of Defendant's online sales in South Carolina, the Supreme Court has emphasized that sales-even when sizeable-in a forum are not sufficient to confer general jurisdiction, as doing so would subject many corporate defendants to personal jurisdiction in every State.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Were it otherwise, \"any substantial manufacturer or seller of goods would be amenable to suit, on any claim for relief, wherever its products are distributed.\"\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/915/\">\n    564 U.S. at 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/915/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Measured against the Supreme Court's mandate in\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Daimler AG\n   </em>\n   , South Carolina is not a forum in which it would be permissible to subject Defendant to general jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As detailed below, however, this finding is not determinative, as there are sufficient contacts to confer specific jurisdiction over Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Specific Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant contends the Court lacks specific personal jurisdiction because there is no affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy. Specifically, Defendant argues that \"cease-and-desist letters do not form the basis for personal jurisdiction.\" ECF No. 14-1 at 8 (citations omitted). For the reasons set forth below, the Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant is correct that \"the court cannot, consistent with Due Process, find exercise of personal jurisdiction over Defendants permissible based solely on one isolated contact in which Defendants deposited a [mailing] into the U.S. Mails addressed to South Carolina.\"\n   <em>\n    Jarrett v. State of North Carolina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7848016\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/868/155/#p158\">\n    868 F.Supp. 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158 (D.S.C. 1994). That, however, is not the case here. Defendant, a limited partnership engaged in the sale of toys in South Carolina, sent a cease-and-desist letter to Plaintiff as well as a number of retailers that sell Plaintiff's toys. While the Fourth Circuit has not directly addressed the issue at bar, a number of other circuit courts have found specific jurisdiction in similar cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Dudnikov v. Chalk &amp; Vermilion Fine Arts, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Judge (now Justice) Gorsuch, writing for the Tenth Circuit, found personal jurisdiction under similar facts.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047993\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/1063/\">\n    514 F.3d 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2008). In that case, the plaintiffs were eBay sellers who sold a variety of fabrics from their home in Colorado.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047993\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/1063/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047993\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/1063/\">\n    at 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Several of the plaintiff's prints contained images imitating a famous artist.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047993\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/1063/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The defendants, the owners of the rights to the artist's images, saw the plaintiff's eBay page, concluded that the plaintiff's fabrics infringed their copyrights, contacted eBay in California who then suspended the plaintiff's account, and emailed the plaintiffs a cease-and-desist letter, which threatened a federal lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047993\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/1063/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Before the defendants could file suit, the plaintiffs initiated an action in federal district court in Colorado seeking a declaration that\n   their prints did not infringe defendants' copyrights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047993\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/1063/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The defendants moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, and the district court granted the motion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047993\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/1063/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047993\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/1063/\">\n    at 1067-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On appeal, the Tenth Circuit noted that the defendants went well beyond simply sending the plaintiffs a cease-and-desist letter, emphasizing the defendants' mailing of a notice of infringement to eBay and characterizing the plaintiffs' actions as \"an effort to reverse ... the intended consequences of defendants' [notice] which [plaintiffs] incurred in Colorado.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047993\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/1063/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047993\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/1063/\">\n    at 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the Tenth Circuit reversed the district court's grant of the defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Several other circuit courts have similarly held that extrajudicial enforcement attempts, coupled with a cease-and-desist letter, can form the basis for specific personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bancroft &amp; Masters, Inc. v. Augusta Nat'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243320\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/223/1082/\">\n    223 F.3d 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2000),\n   <em>\n    overruled in part on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yahoo! Inc. v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme Et L'Antisemitisme\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881117\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/1199/#p1207\">\n    433 F.3d 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1207 (9th Cir. 2006) (en banc). While the Federal Circuit has reached varying results on the relevant questions in different cases, the court recently found specific personal jurisdiction in a case where there were \"cease-and-desist letters combined with ongoing business in the forum state.\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell Pet Co. v. Miale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842340\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/542/879/#p883\">\n    542 F.3d 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 883 (Fed. Cir. 2008). In doing so, the Federal Circuit favorably cited both\n   <em>\n    Dudnikov\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bancroft &amp; Masters\n   </em>\n   , embracing the rule that specific jurisdiction is appropriate when \"[r]ather than simply sending a cease-and-desist letter to the plaintiffs, the defendants [have] 'communicated their complaint to a third party with the intent that the third party take action directly against plaintiff's business interests....' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842340\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/542/879/#p883\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842340\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/542/879/#p883\">\n    at 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dudnikov\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047993\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/1063/\">\n    514 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1082 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Based on the Court's review of the cases, there does not appear to be a pure circuit split on this issue as Defendant intimates in its briefing. Rather, these circuit courts have adopted a rule where the district court must conduct a fact-specific inquiry into what actions other than the sending of a cease-and-desist letter have occurred in a case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campbell Pet Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842340\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/542/879/#p883\">\n    542 F.3d at 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases where the Federal Circuit has found such additional conduct confers specific personal jurisdiction). This rationale is in accord with guidance from the Supreme Court. In\n   <em>\n    Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of \" 'there be[ing] some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus, invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n    471 U.S. at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hanson v.

A defendant need not be physically present in a state to meet this jurisdictional requirement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 476,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, \"[s]o long as a commercial actor's efforts are 'purposefully directed' toward residents of another State, [the Supreme Court has] consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat personal jurisdiction there.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In order to satisfy the purposeful direction requirement, the defendant must have: (1) committed an intentional act; (2) that was expressly aimed at the forum state; and (3) caused harm, the brunt of which is felt by the plaintiff in the forum state.\n   <em>\n    Calder v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/#p789\">\n    465 U.S. 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 789-90,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/#p789\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/#p789\">\n    79 L.Ed.2d 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). \"[T]he express aiming test focuses more on a defendant's intentions-where was the focal point of its purposive efforts-while the latter requirement concentrates on the consequences of the defendant's actions-where was the alleged harm actually felt by the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Dudnikov\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047993\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/1063/\">\n    514 F.3d at 1075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Applying these well-established jurisdictional principles, the Court holds that Plaintiff has established a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of specific personal jurisdiction. To that end, the Court finds that the three required elements detailed above are met. First, Defendant committed intentional acts by mailing Plaintiff a cease-and-desist letter and by mailing cease-and-desist letters to six of Plaintiff's retailers. Second, Defendant's intention in doing this was to negatively impact Plaintiff's sales, with Defendant's conduct directed toward Plaintiff in South Carolina. Finally, the brunt of the harm-measured in lost sales-was felt by Plaintiff in South Carolina. Therefore, the Court finds that the extrajudicial enforcement efforts undertaken by Defendant are sufficient to establish specific personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Moreover, the Court holds that a finding of personal jurisdiction in South Carolina comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. \"The Supreme Court made clear that [this] factor is to be applied sparingly. When a defendant seeks to rely on the 'fair play and substantial justice' factor to avoid the exercise of jurisdiction by a court that otherwise would have personal jurisdiction over the defendant, 'he must present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.' \"\n   <em>\n    Campbell Pet Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842340\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/542/879/#p883\">\n    542 F.3d at 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Burger King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n    471 U.S. at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p475\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).
