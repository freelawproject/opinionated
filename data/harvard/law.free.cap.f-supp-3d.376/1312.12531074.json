His complaint seeks to represent a class of individuals that have had their security deposits improperly withheld by Defendants. The complaint defines the proposed class as \"Ryan Whelan and any citizen of Georgia\" who \"had all or some of their security deposit\" not returned within one month of terminating their lease due to alleged damage to the premises and who did not receive a comprehensive, itemized list of the alleged damages from Defendants within three days of termination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.

Doc. No. [1-8]. Mr. Diego attests to two facts: (1) as of January 11, 2019, Defendant Wesley Apartment Homes managed twelve apartment complexes with approximately 4,700 units and an average security deposit of $ 500, and (2) in his experience, \"the average turn-over rate in an apartment community is 65% per year.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051194\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/909/#p913\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants' Notice of Removal (which is not evidence) then attempts to spin these two \"facts,\" along with allegations in the complaint, into a $ 5,000,000 amount in controversy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

Defendants have shown a \"conceivable\" scenario. The problem is that their evidence does not establish that their scenario is\n   <strong>\n    more likely than not\n   </strong>\n   the case. While the Court can make reasonable inferences and deductions from the evidence presented, Defendants do not present enough evidence for the Court to find that Defendants' math, more likely than not, represents a fair estimate of the amount in controversy. Too many unsupported assumptions are required to reach Defendants' desired result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   First, Defendants' calculation relies on Mr. Diego's assertion that \"as of January 11, 2019\" Defendants managed 4,700 units. Defendants do not give any indication whether this number was relatively consistent over the twenty-year period that their calculations cover. Therefore, for it to be more likely than not that Defendants' estimate is accurate, the Court must assume that Defendants manage the same number of units today as they did in 1998. Although Defendants do not have to prove their numbers with certainty, the Court must be relatively confident that this number accurately represents the potential number of units over a twenty-year period in order to base its conclusions regarding the amount in controversy on it. Should that number have varied substantially over the twenty-year period described in Plaintiff's complaint that would have a drastic impact on Defendants' number of 61,100 departing tenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Additionally, Defendants rely on Mr. Diego's assertion that the \"average\" turnover rate for \"an\" apartment community is 65%. Defendants do not allege their actual turnover rate (presumably a number within their possession), but rely on an average that is not geographically specific, nor is it linked to complexes with similar characteristics (i.e., price-point, amenities, etc.) to Defendants' complexes. Therefore, for it to be more likely than not that Defendants' estimate is accurate, the Court must assume that Defendants' turnover rate is the same as the average. Perhaps Defendants are particularly excellent apartment managers and retain an unusually high number of their tenants, or perhaps Defendants operate in an extremely tight housing market and therefore have an unusually low turnover rate. If Defendants' actual turnover rate varies from the average turnover rate, it significantly impacts Defendants' math.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Furthermore, Defendants' assume a security deposit of $ 300 (Plaintiff's whole security deposit) for all of its purported 61,100 departing tenants, despite the fact that only a portion of a security deposit may have been withheld for some class members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. [1-2], pp. 11 (defining class members as those \"who had all\n   <strong>\n    or some\n   </strong>\n   of their security deposit not returned\") (emphasis added). Granted, Defendants did not rely on the $ 500 average security deposit described in Mr. Diego's declaration, and perhaps using Plaintiff's number was an attempt to account for partial withholdings. However, Defendants' assumption also does not account for the differences in \"average\" security deposits over a twenty-year period. Therefore, for it to be more likely than not that Defendants' estimate is accurate, the Court must assume that $ 300 is a fair\n   estimate of each plaintiff's damages, despite both inflation over a twenty-year period and the possibility of only partial withholding of deposits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Even if the Court were to accept the accuracy of these numbers at face value, based on inferential jumps from Mr. Diego's affidavit and Plaintiff's complaint, Defendants' calculations involve other numbers for which the Court has no evidentiary basis from which to make assumptions about their accuracy. For example, after multiplying 4,700 units by a 65% turnover rate for the twenty-year period described in the complaint, and multiplying that number by Plaintiff's security deposit tripled (for statutory damages), Defendants randomly assume that 10% of those departing tenants had their security deposit improperly withheld. Defendants provide no basis for this 10% assumption. A different random assumption produces a drastically different result. If the Court assumes that 5% of the tenants had their deposits improperly withheld, the damages amount to $ 2,749,500.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even adding on another 25% of that in attorneys fees (assuming that number is reasonable, since Defendants never established why 25% was a reasonable estimation of attorneys' fees), the total amount only reaches $ 3,436,875.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Perhaps most importantly, Defendants do not adjust their number of 61,100 departing tenants in any way to accommodate for how many of those tenants were Georgia citizens as of the date of removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. [1-2], p. 11 (defining the class as \"Ryan Whelan and any citizen of Georgia\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(7) (\"Citizenship of the members of the proposed plaintiff classes shall be determined ... as of the date of filing the complaint ... or, if the case stated by the initial pleading is not subject to Federal jurisdiction, as of the date of service by plaintiffs of an amended pleading, motion, or other paper, indicating the existence of Federal jurisdiction.\"). Even if all of Defendants' other numbers are assumed true-those arrived at through inferential leaps from the submitted evidence and those that are just randomly asserted-it is inconceivable that all of Defendants' former tenants over a twenty-year period were Georgia citizens at the time of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Therefore, Defendants' calculations most assuredly overestimate the amount in controversy in this case. Their calculations may be plausible, but that does not mean that they \"more likely than not\" reflect the amount in controversy in this case. And,\n   <strong>\n    that\n   </strong>\n   is Defendants' burden-to show by a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., it is more likely than not) that the amount in dispute is sufficient to confer federal jurisdiction. Because Defendants have not met their jurisdictional burden, remand is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although the Court finds that Defendants have not met their jurisdictional burden with respect to the amount in controversy, in light of Plaintiff's request for the fees and costs associated with an \"objectively unreasonable\" removal (see Doc.

In fact, in one of the cases cited by Defendants, the Seventh Circuit acknowledged that plaintiffs could define their class in such a way as to fit within the CAFA home-state exception and even stated that the plaintiffs in that case \"could have guaranteed that the suit would remain in state court\" if they had defined their class as citizens of the home state.\n   <em>\n    In re Sprint Nextel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3517411\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/593/669/#p674\">\n    593 F.3d at 673, 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, they note that the Eleventh Circuit has not ruled on this issue. Doc. No. [10], pp. 9-10. While binding precedent may not exist within this Circuit, Defendants provide no reason why the Court should not be persuaded by the precedent of the First, Fourth, and Seventh Circuits. Nor do Defendants provide any conflicting rulings from other Circuits. Second, Defendants contend that because the class period spans twenty years, some of the class members may have moved to another state or country. Doc. No. [10], p. 5. Therefore, Defendants seem to argue, the class would contain citizens of states other than Georgia. But, if former tenants have moved out of the state, they are ineligible to be class members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dennison v.

The class is defined as citizens of Georgia and membership in the class will depend upon citizenship at the time of filing or removal.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants overarching argument is that, because Plaintiff offers\n   <strong>\n    no\n   </strong>\n   evidence of the class members' likely citizenships, Plaintiff fails to meet his evidentiary burden. However, as the Seventh Circuit stated, \"it doesn't take any evidence to establish that [Georgia] citizens make up at least two-thirds of the members of a class that is open only to [Georgia] citizens.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sprint Nextel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3517411\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/593/669/#p674\">\n    593 F.3d at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, Defendants had at least an arguably colorable basis for seeking removal. Despite the Court finding that Defendants did not meet their jurisdictional burden, Defendants put forth a jurisdictional argument that was not unreasonable on its face. Defendants' arguments regarding the home-state exception were more problematic. But, in the end, the lack of Eleventh Circuit binding precedent saved their assertions from being legally frivolous. Second, the Court finds no \"unusual circumstances\" in the present case that would warrant awarding attorneys\n   fees despite Defendants objectively reasonable basis for attempting removal.
