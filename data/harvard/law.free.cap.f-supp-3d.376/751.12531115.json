The defective transmission allegedly causes the Class Vehicles to slip, buck, kick, jerk, and harshly engage; \"has premature internal wear, sudden acceleration, delay in downshifts, delayed acceleration and difficulty stopping the vehicle, and eventually suffers a catastrophic failure\" (\"Transmission Defect\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 248.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that GM thus: (1) breached a written warranty in violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (\"MMWA\"), (2) breached express or implied warranties, (3) committed common law fraud, (4) engaged in deceptive and unfair trade practices in violation of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"FDUTPA\"), and (5) was unjustly enriched.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 308-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff brings his claims on behalf of a nationwide or a Florida class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 304.

GM's preferred reading inserts a comma into the Warranty. But the Warranty does not contain GM's proffered comma.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the Warranty's plain language demonstrates that the phrase \"related to materials or workmanship\" modifies \"normal characteristics of the vehicle\" and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"any vehicle defect.\" The Warranty therefore covers \"any vehicle defect\" except for slight noise, vibrations, or manufacturing defects related to \"normal characteristics of the vehicle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   GM maintains that the Court's interpretation creates an absurdity because the Warranty's next sentence provides that \"[n]eeded repairs will be performed using new, remanufactured, or refurbished parts\" and replacement parts could not remedy a design defect. ECF 23-2, PgID 433. But the Warranty's language covers\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   design defects and abnormal \"characteristics of the vehicle related to materials\n   or workmanship.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Replacement parts would satisfactorily remedy abnormal characteristics of the vehicle.

That case is distinguishable from Plaintiff's because here Plaintiff relies on a written warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Fourth, GM relies on a decision from litigation in Missouri about its anti-lock brake products. The Missouri case considered whether GM warranted that \"the vehicles [would be] free of defects.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Gen. Motors Corp. Anti-Lock Brake Prods. Liab.

To the extent\n   <em>\n    Anti-Lock Brake\n   </em>\n   addressed warranties that provided coverage for defects only in material or workmanship, GM has not shown that the \"GM warranties for the 1990, 1993 and 1994 Chevy light trucks\" contained the same language as the Warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Based on the plain language of the Warranty, and in light of the limited persuasiveness of the cases relied on by GM, the Court will not accept its construction of the Warranty. The Warranty therefore covers, in relevant part,\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   vehicle defect\n   <em>\n    except for\n   </em>\n   \"normal characteristics of the vehicle related to materials or workmanship.\" ECF 23-2, PgID 433.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    C. Whether the Warranty Covers the Transmission Defect.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Having defined the scope of the Warranty's coverage, the Court must now consider whether Plaintiff pleaded a covered defect. GM's argument primarily relies on its position that the Warranty covers only manufacturing defects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 23, PgID 403-06. Consistent with its interpretation of the Warranty, GM argues that Plaintiff pleads only a \"design defect.\" But the Warranty covers both manufacturing defects that are abnormal characteristics of the vehicle and design defects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the Transmission Defect is both a \"concealed manufacturing and design defect.\" ECF 18, PgID 249-50. Plaintiff further claims that the Transmission Defect \"results from a poor design and/or failures in the manufacturing process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 258. Plaintiff also argues that the \"Transmission Defect is inherent in each of the Class Vehicles.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 250. And the Class Vehicles include\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   2015-17 GMC Canyon and Chevrolet Colorados. Taken together, Plaintiff pleads that the Transmission Defect is a design defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Even if Plaintiff did not plead a design defect, he pleaded an abnormal characteristic of the vehicle related to materials or workmanship. To find otherwise would require GM to adopt the argument that it intended for the 6L50 transmission to slip, buck, kick, jerk, and harshly engage; to prematurely wear internally; to suddenly accelerate, delay in downshifts, delay acceleration; or to stop with difficulty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 248 (describing the effects of the defect);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A (manufacturing defects occur when a product performs differently than intended).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Under either interpretation, Plaintiff states a claim for breach of an express warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Implied Warranty\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that GM breached an implied warranty. \"[U]nder Florida law, a plaintiff cannot recover economic losses for breach of implied warranty in the absence of privity.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanchez-Knutson v.
