In the case of\n   <em>\n    United States v. McNeal\n   </em>\n   , the Court considered\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   challenges from two defendants who alleged that their convictions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) for brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence should be set aside because armed bank robbery did not constitute a crime of violence. In analyzing the rule, the Fourth Circuit held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Our sister circuits have uniformly ruled that other federal crimes involving takings \"by force and violence, or by intimidation,\" have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force. Earlier this year, for example, the Eighth Circuit concluded that robbery in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202111\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   satisfied the similarly worded force clause in the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), because it required a taking \"by force and violence, or by intimidation.\" The Second and Eleventh Circuit reached the same conclusion with respect to the carjacking statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   The logic of those decisions is straightforward. A taking \"by force and violence\" entails the use of physical force. Likewise, a taking \"by intimidation\" involves the threat to use such force. As the Seventh Circuit explained in its\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   decision, \"there is no 'space' between 'bank robbery' and 'crime of violence' because \"violence in the broad sense that includes a merely threatened use of force is an element of every bank robbery.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Put succinctly, ... Bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(a), \"by force and violence,\" requires the use of physical force. Bank robbery under \u00a7 2113 (a), \"by intimidation\" requires the threatened use of physical force. Either of those alternatives includes an element that is \"the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force,\" and thus bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(a) constitutes a crime of violence under the force clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This case is not relevant to Mr. Norman's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Next Mr. Norman cites\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   When determining the sentence for a predicate offense, no weapon enhancement can be applied if the defendant is also convicted of using a firearm in connection with a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 924(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Or, they could have unanimously agreed that he possessed a firearm at some point during the Hobbs Act conspiracy, but not during the drug trafficking crime. Either way, a general verdict of guilty does not reveal any unanimous finding by the jury that the defendant was guilty of conspiring to carry a firearm during one of the potential predicate offenses, all of predicate offenses, or guilty of conspiring during some and not others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The present case has no such confusing language, which distinguishes it from\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, Mr. Norman cites\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Shuti v.

U.S.S.G. 4B1.1 (a) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Tennessee's Habitual Drug Offenders statute reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (a) It is an offense for a defendant to knowingly:(1) Manufacture a controlled substance; (2) Deliver a controlled substance; (3) Sell a controlled substance; or (4) Possess a controlled substance with intent to manufacture, deliver or sell the controlled substance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-17-417\">\n    Tenn.

United States\n   </em>\n   and other cases in support of his argument. In\n   <em>\n    Mathis v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), the Supreme Court held that a prior conviction for a predicate violent felony offense listed in the ACCA, referred only to the usual or generic versions and not to all variants of the offenses. An element of the crime of conviction is broader than an element of the generic offense when the crime of conviction enumerates various alternative factual means of satisfying a single element. It appears that Mr. Norman seeks to address the \"knowingly\" language included in the statute, arguing that such language differs from the generic definition of Controlled Substance offenses. It does not, however, enumerate various alternative factual means of meeting a single element. Norman's contrary argument is therefore without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    Mr. Norman Was Properly Sentenced as a Career Offender Based on His Criminal History, Existing Case Law, and Guideline Provisions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Mr. Norman's criminal history clearly establishes his status as a career\n   offender. In the Presentence Investigation Report, the Probation Service noted that Mr. Norman was convicted of three controlled substances offenses: Possession of a Controlled Substance with Intent to Deliver in 1995, Possession of a Controlled Substance in 2005, and Sale of a Controlled Substance in 2006. (PSR at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 21, 23). Put simply, the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   decision had no impact on the definition of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A), as the Supreme Court specifically held that its decision \"does not call into question application of the Act to the four enumerated offenses, or the remainder of the Act's definition of a violent felony.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2563.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1 provides for enhanced sentences for career offenders, providing that a defendant is a career offender if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Even in the absence of the residual clause, Mr. Norman clearly qualifies as a Career Offender under the previous sentencing Guidelines and under the amended Guidelines that became effective on August 1, 2016. Mr. Norman was convicted in the present case of two armed bank robberies within days of each other. Evidence at the plea hearing established that he threatened the bank tellers with a pistol. Armed bank robbery has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of violence, and the facts in the instant case support the court's finding that Mr. Norman committed the bank robberies by force, violence and intimidation, and placed in jeopardy the life of another with a weapon or destructive device. The crime of which he was convicted is clearly a crime of violence, whether looking at the statute categorically or the specific evidence presented to the court. The Career Offender provisions are clearly applicable, and Mr. Norman was sentenced accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    Mr. Norman Endangered the Life of a Law Enforcement Officer; Thus, His Sentencing Score Was Properly Enhanced\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Mr. Norman finally argues that his sentence was incorrectly enhanced two levels for fleeing and eluding a law enforcement officer because U.S.S.G. 3C1.2, too, uses similar language to the invalidated residual clause of the ACCA. U.S.S.G. 3C1.2 gives the following definition for Reckless Endangerment During Flight:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   If the defendant recklessly\n   <em>\n    created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury\n   </em>\n   to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer, increase by 2 levels.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   (emphasis added). Mr. Norman fled the scene to avoid arrest, causing a head-on collision with a patrol car occupied by a law enforcement officer. (PSR \u00b6\u00b6 29). Thus, in fleeing, he recklessly endangered the lives of the officer and other drivers in the area. As the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the invalidity of the residual clause in \u00a7 924(e) does not automatically invalidate similar language in the Guidelines. For the reasons set forth above, the two-level enhancement for fleeing and eluding law enforcement officers was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In sum, none of Mr. Norman's grounds for relief has merit, and the instant motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence\n   will be denied. A final judgment consistent with this memorandum opinion will issue today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   SO ORDERED, this, the 26th day of March, 2019.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
