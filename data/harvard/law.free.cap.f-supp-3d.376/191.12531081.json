INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This year, Patriots' Day in Massachusetts\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the deadline for filing federal\n   taxes share a date: today, April 15. It is fitting, then, that the Court today explains its decision to allow the plaintiffs, Puerto Rico residents, to challenge their ineligibility for certain federal benefits programs. This motion calls on the Court to consider whether the complaint adequately alleges that Congress has failed to comply with its obligation to provide each and every American equal protection of the laws. The Government chiefly defends Congress's decisions to exclude Puerto Rico residents from some federal benefits programs on the ground that Puerto Rico residents do not pay income taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Yet not only do Puerto Ricans contribute to the general treasury, but also Puerto Rican patriots have paid the ultimate price for their country -- the United States of America -- since its founding. Puerto Ricans aided the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War and, since Puerto Rico's cession from Spain, fought in the United States military \"in every major United States military engagement from World War I onward, with the soldiers of Puerto Rico's 65th Infantry Regiment distinguishing themselves in combat during the Korean War.\" Shannon Collins,\n   <em>\n    Puerto Ricans Represented Throughout U.S. Military History\n   </em>\n   , United States Department of Defense (Oct. 14, 2016), https://dod.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/974518/puerto-ricans-represented-throughout-us-military-history/. Puerto Rican service in the United States military has continued to this day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   All told, more than 116,000 Puerto Ricans have served and more than 1,225 have given their lives in service of the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Of course, these facts themselves do not dispose of the legal issues that this case presents. As a lower court in a multi-level court system, this Court obeys higher courts' commands. The Court nonetheless approaches this case with two fundamental legal principles in mind: (1) the Fifth Amendment guarantees the equal protection of the laws,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bolling\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sharpe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11301453\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/347/497/#p499\">\n    347 U.S. 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11301453\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/347/497/#p499\">\n    74 S.Ct. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20L.%20Ed.%20884\">\n    98 L.Ed. 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1954), and (2) Puerto Ricans are American citizens, and have been so for over 100 years,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Jones Act, Pub.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 91-116, ECF No. 1. The defendants Alex Azar, Secretary of Health and Human Services; Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture; Nancy A. Berryhill, Deputy Commissioner for Operations of Social Security; and the Social Security Administration (collectively, the \"Government\") moved to dismiss the Plaintiffs' complaint for lack of\n   subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.

The Court has federal question jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs' claims given their inability first to receive review in an administrative forum. The Plaintiffs also adequately allege they have standing to sue; to the extent that discovery may reveal otherwise, the Government may object to standing again. Finally, the complaint constructs a plausible case that Congress's choice to exclude Puerto Rico residents from SSI, SNAP, and LIS lacks a rational basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

For example, prior to 1996, Congress enacted various tax incentives targeted at growing the private sector in Puerto Rico. During that time, a rational legislator might have feared that extending welfare benefits, while at the same time not levying income taxes, not only might have cancelled out those tax incentives, but also might have sabotaged the Congressional goal by deterring Puerto Rico residents from private sector employment. The allegations in the complaint appear to undermine the vitality of that particular theory, however. To wit, since the Supreme Court handed down those cases, Congress repealed Puerto Rico's business tax incentives and seemed to have raised taxes on Puerto Rico manufacturers, while Puerto Rico's economy has slumped further.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     De Lea,\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84684\" index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/663/\">\n       supra\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84684\" index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/663/\">\n      ;\n     </extracted-citation>\n     Pub.
