SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises from the foreclosure sale of property to satisfy a homeowners' association lien. Before the Court are three motions: (1) Defendant Inspirada Community Association's (\"HOA\") motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 109); (2) Plaintiff Bank of America, N.A.'s (\"BANA\") motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 110); and (3) Defendant SFR Investments Pool 1, LLC's (\"SFR\") motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 111). The Court has reviewed the parties' responses (ECF Nos. 115, 116, 117, 118) and replies (ECF Nos. 119, 120, 121). The Court also has reviewed the supplemental briefs that the parties submitted (ECF Nos. 123, 124 (errata), 125) in response to the Court's order (ECF No. 122) allowing the parties to address the applicability of a recent Nevada Supreme Court case\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the facts of this case. For the following reasons, the Court denies BANA's motion for summary judgment, grants SFR's motion for summary judgment, and denies the HOA's motion for summary judgment as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. RELEVANT BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise indicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Kyle and Kelly Schramm (\"Borrowers\") purchased real property\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Property\") within the HOA on September 2, 2008, with a $ 281,975 loan (\"Loan\"). (ECF No. 110-1 at 2-3, 12.) The Loan was evidenced by a note (\"Note\") and secured by a first deed of trust (\"DOT\") that named Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\"MERS\") as the nominee beneficiary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) MERS assigned the DOT to a company in May 2011 that merged into and with BANA. (ECF No. 110-3 at 2 (assignment); ECF No. 110-4 at 2 (certificate of merger).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Borrowers failed to pay HOA assessments, and the HOA recorded the following notices through its agent, Leach Johnson Song &amp; Gruchow (\"Leach\"): (1) notice of delinquent assessment on January 4, 2011 (ECF No. 110-5 at 2-3); and (2) notice of default and election to sell on March 25, 2011 (ECF No. 110-6 at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   BANA asked Leach to identify the superpriority amount of the HOA's lien and offered to pay that amount on April 22, 2011. (ECF No. 110-7 at 5-6.) Leach refused to provide any account information to BANA unless BANA obtained the Borrowers' authorization to release their assessment account records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) The authorization form required the Borrowers to consent to a $ 150 fee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) It does not appear that BANA and Leach communicated further after this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The HOA recorded a notice of sale on May 14, 2012. (ECF No. 110-9 at 2-4.) The HOA sold the Property to SFR on April 18, 2013 (\"HOA Sale\") for $ 14,000. (ECF No. 110-10 at 2-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   BANA asserts the following claims in its Complaint: (1) quiet title/declaratory judgment against all Defendants; (2) breach of\n   NRS \u00a7 116.1113 against the HOA and Leach; (3) wrongful foreclosure against the HOA and Leach; and (4) injunctive relief against SFR. (ECF No. 1 at 6-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   SFR asserted a counterclaim and crossclaim for quiet title and injunctive relief against BANA and the Borrowers. (ECF No. 25 at 9-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"The purpose of summary judgment is to avoid unnecessary trials when there is no dispute as to the facts before the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Nw.

Supremacy Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   BANA argues that the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution prevents extinguishment of the DOT because the DOT is federally insured. (ECF No. 110 at 13-17.) The Court disagrees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PHH Mortg. Corp. v.

Equitable Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Nevada Supreme Court has held that \"courts retain the power to grant equitable relief from a defective foreclosure sale.\"\n   <em>\n    Shadow Wood Homeowners Ass'n v. N.Y. Cmty. Bancorp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=366%20P.3d%201105\">\n    366 P.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1110 (Nev. 2016). For instance, a court may set aside a sale where there is inadequacy of price as well as proof of slight evidence of fraud, unfairness, or oppression.\n   <em>\n    Nationstar Mortg., LLC v. Saticoy Bay LLC Series 2227 Shadow Canyon\n   </em>\n   , --- Nev. ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=405%20P.3d%20641\">\n    405 P.3d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 643, 648 (2017) (also stating inadequacy of price \"should be considered with any alleged irregularities in the sale process to determine whether the sale was affected by fraud, unfairness, or oppression\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Adequacy of sale price aside, BANA has not demonstrated fraud, unfairness, or oppression. BANA relies on the following indicia of unfairness: the HOA foreclosed despite BANA's tender and the parties faced massive legal uncertainty when the HOA foreclosed. (ECF No. 110 at 18-19.) The first argument is unpersuasive as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section IV(A). The second argument is also unpersuasive. As the Court has noted in a similar case, legal uncertainty put the parties on equal footing.\n   <em>\n    Nationstar Mortg. LLC v. Highland Ranch Homeowners Ass'n\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-cv-00375-MMD-CBC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201173339\">\n    2019 WL 1173339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D. Nev. Mar. 13, 2019). Thus, BANA has not shown entitlement to equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Accordingly, the Court denies BANA's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    V. SFR'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (ECF NO. 111)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   SFR argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on BANA's claim for quiet title/declaratory relief and its counterclaim and crossclaim seeking the same because the HOA Sale extinguished the DOT. (ECF No. 111 at 8.) The Court agrees. SFR is entitled to summary judgment because a valid HOA sale extinguishes the DOT.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SFR Invs. Pool 1 v. U.S. Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20Nev.%20742\">\n    130 Nev. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%20408\">\n    334 P.3d 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 413 (2014) (holding that foreclosure sale on the superpriority portion of an HOA lien extinguishes all prior security interests). Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment in favor of SFR on BANA's claim for quiet title/declaratory judgment as well as SFR's counterclaim and crossclaim for quiet title. The Court declares that the HOA Sale extinguished the DOT. The Court also orders the lis pendens on the Property expunged. The Court dismisses BANA's remaining claims-for breach of NRS \u00a7 116.1113 and wrongful foreclosure against the HOA and Leach-as moot. Given that this ruling terminates claims against the HOA, the Court will deny the HOA's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 109) as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court notes that the parties made several arguments and cited to several cases not discussed above. The Court has reviewed these arguments and cases and determines that they do not warrant discussion as they do not affect the outcome of the motions before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It is therefore ordered that SFR's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 111) is granted. The Court declares that the HOA Sale extinguished the DOT. The Court also orders that the lis pendens on the Property located at 3144 Monet Sunrise Ave., Henderson, NV 89044 be expunged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   It is further ordered that BANA's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 110) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   It is further ordered that the HOA's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 109) is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   It is further ordered that the Clerk of Court enter judgment in favor of SFR on BANA's quiet title/declaratory relief claim as well as SFR's counterclaim and crossclaim for quiet title in accordance with this order and close this case.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <em>\n     Bank of Am., N.A. v.
