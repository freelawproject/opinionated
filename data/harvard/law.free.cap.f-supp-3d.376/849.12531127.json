(Fourth Am. Compl. [90] \u00b6 11.) Mr. Taylor suffered from superior vena cava (\"SVC\") syndrome and end-stage renal disease. His condition was deteriorating,\n   and he signed two \"do not resuscitate\" orders while under the care of another doctor who is not party to this suit. At approximately 8:10 on the morning of September 30, Plaintiff Dr. Wilson was called to care for Mr. Taylor. As a complication of Mr. Taylor's SVC, his windpipe was collapsing, and he had refused a breathing tube. His death was imminent; he was struggling to breathe, gasping for air, and \"flailing about\" when Dr. Wilson arrived. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16.) At 8:16, Mr. Taylor's windpipe fully collapsed, \"cutting off all oxygen.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.) He was, however, still fully conscious. With the do-not-resuscitate orders in place, Dr. Wilson \"believed he was morally and professionally obligated ... to do everything within his power to relieve Taylor's conscious suffering as Taylor slowly went through the agonizing process of suffocating to death.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.) Dr. Wilson twice administered morphine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 20.) He then began to inject Mr. Taylor with 40 milliequivalents (m/eq) of potassium chloride, a drug that is lethal in a dose of 240 m/eq.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.) Dr. Wilson intended the selected dose to render Mr. Taylor \"unconscious during the final stages of [his] process of death.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"As Dr. Wilson began the injection, however, Taylor's heart stopped from lack of oxygen due to the natural progression of his underlying disease,\" and Taylor was pronounced dead at 8:25AM. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.) At least two other doctors were present at the time of Mr. Taylor's death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 43, 45.3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Mitra Kalelkar at the Cook County Medical Examiner (\"CCME\") conducted an autopsy on October 1, 1998. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.) The autopsy was not conclusive, and Dr. Kalelkar \"listed the cause of Taylor's death as uncertain 'pending' the return of the lab/toxicology results on Taylor's blood.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Later that same day, before receiving the results, but after having a conversation with an unidentified person who told Dr. Kalelkar a \"story\" about Dr. Wilson using potassium chloride, Dr. Kalelkar determined that Taylor's death was a homicide from potassium chloride intoxication. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 39, 42.) The lab results that came back on October 2 were inconsistent with that determination; the report found \"that Taylor had a normal potassium level at the time of his death, which meant that the potassium chloride injection had not reached [his] heart by the time of [his] death.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39.) Dr. Kalelkar never reviewed those lab results, however, and did not change the homicide determination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following the autopsy, Dr. Kalelkar notified the Olympia Fields Police Department that Mr. Taylor's death was a homicide, and CCME released Mr. Taylor's body for cremation on October 6, foreclosing the possibility of a second-opinion autopsy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41.) On October 7, Dr. Kalelkar and her boss met with Dr. Andrew Gorchynsky and Thomas Glasgow of the IDFPR Department of Professional Regulation (\"DPR\"). Dr. Gorchynsky was the Chief Medical Coordinator for the DPR, \"responsible for reviewing complaints against Illinois doctors, and for making recommendations regarding the investigation and disposition of those complaints.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.) Glasgow was the Chief of Medical Prosecutions at DPR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.3.) \"At this meeting, Kalelkar informed Gorchynsky and Glasgow that her conclusion as to the cause of death (potassium chloride intoxication) and the manner of death (homicide) was not based on any scientific or medical testing on the body of Taylor, or the analysis of any lab results on Taylor's blood.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.) After a \"cursory\" review of some of Mr. Taylor's medical records, but without interviewing any witnesses, reviewing any \"chart notes prepared by the other doctors who were present at the time of Taylor's death,\" or consulting any expert materials, Gorchynsky and Glasgow determined that they agreed with Dr. Kalelkar's homicide determination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.) Dr. Wilson alleges that this is because \"Gorchynsky, Glasgow, and Doe Defendants 1-5,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   were of the [incorrect] belief the potassium chloride, upon injection, would immediately cause Taylor's heart to stop.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.2.) Had they conducted an adequate investigation, Gorchynsky and Glasgow would have learned, among other things, that Mr. Taylor's heart stopped just \"as the [potassium chloride injection] was being given\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.3); that the 40 m/eq dose was non-fatal (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.1); and that Mr. Taylor's potassium level was normal at the time he died. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Based on their conclusion that Dr. Wilson intended to kill Mr. Taylor, Gorchynsky, Glasgow, and Doe Defendants 1-5 \"decided that the [DPR] should file a Complaint against Dr. Wilson seeking the revocation of [his] medical license\" on October 9, 1998 \"for his alleged intent to kill his patient.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 48, 49.) They also sought \"an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   summary suspension of Dr. Wilson's medical license,\" filing a Petition for Temporary Suspension\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   with the Director of the IDFPR, Nikki Zollar. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 49, 50.) Attached to the petition was an affidavit from Dr. Gorchynsky representing that he had \"reviewed medical records and other documents\" pertaining to Mr. Taylor's treatment, and that the \"above records document\" that Dr. Wilson \"injected Henry Taylor with Potassium Chloride for the purpose of causing Henry Taylor's death.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50 (quoting Ex. 21 to\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264919\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/509/#p513\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).) The Director entered an order suspending Dr. Wilson's medical license on October 9, 1998. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.) Mr. Wilson\n   never had an opportunity to be heard prior to the suspension. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the suspension, Plaintiff alleges, \"certain members of the Department discovered that the Department's charges against Dr. Wilson were totally without merit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54.) \"[T]he Department was specifically told by one of its prosecutors ... that it couldn't prove the charges against Dr. Wilson ... [and prosecutor William McLaughlin] (whose job it was to stay in contact with the Cook County State's Attorney's Office on its investigation of Taylor's death) [informed the Department] that Taylor didn't have a chance to live.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55.) In November 1998, the Medical Disciplinary Board (\"MDB\") of the IDFPR did withdraw the charge that Dr. Wilson had injected Mr. Taylor \"for the purpose of causing\" his death from its complaint, but it continued with Dr. Wilson's prosecution, and it left the summary suspension order in place. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In April 1999, Dr. Wilson and his attorneys met with Glasgow and an assistant prosecutor from the Department \"to discuss the progress of the license revocation proceedings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58.) At that meeting, Glasgow allegedly \"told Dr. Wilson that he did not care about Dr. Wilson's 5th Amendment rights [to due process], that [the Department] would revoke his license to practice medicine, and ... that if [Glasgow] were the prosecuting States [sic] Attorney[,] he would have Dr. Wilson locked up and tried for murder because Dr. Wilson murdered Mr. Taylor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (modifications in original) (quoting Attorney Edward Nielsen's Affidavit, Ex. 26 to\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264919\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/509/#p513\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).) Glasgow also allegedly stated that \"he would not consider lifting the suspension on Dr. Wilson's license because Dr. Wilson is a danger to society.\" (Fourth Am. Compl. [90] \u00b6 58 (quoting Attorney Denise Nalley's Affidavit, Ex. 27 to\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264919\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/509/#p513\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).) By the end of September 1999, the Cook County State's Attorney's Office had determined that it would not press charges against Dr. Wilson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Fourth Am. Compl. [90] \u00b6 59.) At that time, Dr. Wilson's medical license remained suspended under the summary suspension order, and he had not yet had a hearing with the IDFPR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Around the same time, several other events occurred. Then-director of the DPR\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Leonard Sherman stated in a televised interview: \"I think he [Dr. Wilson] is always within his rights to come in and say that the danger to the public no longer exists and make his argument.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60.) Glasgow allegedly informed Dr. Wilson's attorney that \"unless Dr. Wilson admitted his wrongdoing by use of potassium chloride, and further agreed to a sentence of discipline ..., the MDB 'w[ould] find against Dr. Wilson' at the [upcoming] formal hearing ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63.) \"Glasgow made it clear to Dr. Wilson's attorney ... that regardless as to what the facts or evidence at the upcoming hearing turned out to be, Dr. Wilson 'would lose before the [Disciplinary] Board.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Wilson's IDFPR revocation hearing finally took place before a hearing officer in November 1999.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Memorandum Opinion\n   and Order, Ex. 30 to Fourth. Am. Compl. [90-2], at 2.) Illinois law establishes the procedures for such hearings. The IDFPR Secretary (in this action, also referred to as the Director\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) has \"the authority to appoint an attorney duly licensed to practice law in the State of Illinois to serve as the hearing officer in any action to suspend, revoke ... or take any other disciplinary action with regard to a [medical] license.\" 225 ILL. COMP. STAT. 60/35. After conducting a hearing, during which \"the accused person shall be accorded ample opportunity to present in person, or by counsel, such statements, testimony, evidence and argument as may be pertinent,\" that hearing officer \"shall report his findings and recommendations to the ... [MDB] within 30 days of the receipt of the record.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264919\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/509/#p513\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 60/35, 60/37(a). The MDB then has \"60 days from the receipt of the [hearing officer's] report to review the report ... and present their findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendations to the [IDFPR] Secretary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264919\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/509/#p513\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 60/35. Once the MDB has made its recommendation, the Secretary \"may take the action recommended by the [MDB],\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264919\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/509/#p513\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 60/40(b), or the Secretary may \"disagree[ ] with or take[ ] action contrary of the recommendation, ... fil[ing] with the [MDB] his or her specific written reasons of disagreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264919\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/509/#p513\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 60/44.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that his first hearing was a \"sham.\" (Fourth Am. Compl. [90] \u00b6 67.) The hearing officer ultimately \"recommended that Dr. Wilson's medical license be suspended for a minimum of five years\"; the MDB issued its findings to the IDFPR Director, and the Director adopted that recommendation, suspending Dr. Wilson's license through October 9, 2003.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66.) Following the hearing, Prosecutor McLaughlin ran into Dr. Wilson in a restaurant. McLaughlin allegedly told Dr. Wilson, among other things, that the IDFPR \"had 'blackballed' Dr. Wilson from the start,\" that \"the [MDB] Board had it out for\" him, that the hearing officer \"had 'his strings ... pulled [from above],' \" and that Glasgow \"had it out for\" Dr. Wilson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Dr. Wilson subsequently sought review of the administrative decision by the Circuit Court of Cook County. In April 2002, that court reversed the Department's decision on grounds discussed in this court's prior opinion.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201073072\">\n    2016 WL 1073072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (detailing IDFPR's subsequent appeal). The case was eventually remanded to the IDFPR in October 2004. This next round of IDFPR proceedings was not an improvement over the first: Plaintiff alleges that the hearing officer \"refused to allow Dr. Wilson to substitute his rebuttal expert witness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72.) \"[I]t took over 10-1/2 months for [the hearing officer] to rule on Dr. Wilson's Motion for Substitution of Expert Witness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73.) Subsequently, the MDB issued further findings to the Director on November 1, 2006 without notice to Dr. Wilson,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Director again affirmed Dr. Wilson's suspension. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72.) \"[I]t took an additional 8-1/2 months before the Director entered a final order.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73.) Ultimately, it took the Department \"just under 20 months to enter a final decision\" on remand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Wilson again appealed to the Circuit Court in August 2007, and that court again reversed the hearing officer's determination, remanding to the agency on May 9, 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Dr. Wilson's re-hearing before a hearing officer took place on October 29, 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75.) The hearing officer issued his recommendation of a five-year suspension on March 11, 2009, and the recommendation was adopted by the Director\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   on July 21, 2009. The Department's decision to suspend Dr. Wilson's medical license was again reversed and remanded by the Circuit Court of Cook County on July 25, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   It is unclear when the fourth and final round of agency proceedings occurred. The hearing officer issued his report and recommendation on April 15, 2012; that recommendation was ultimately accepted by the MDB on May 16 and adopted by Director Stewart,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   but Stewart apparently never entered the recommendation as a final order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78.) In March 2013, the MDB issued \"new\" findings, mirroring the May 16 findings from the prior year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Director Stewart then entered a final order on April 26, 2013. Dr. Wilson contends that \"it was not proper for Stewart to support the Department's decision in its license revocation proceedings against Dr. Wilson by reference to [these] alleged 'facts' that were not introduced on the record during the course of a hearing, with no notice to Dr. Wilson and no opportunity for cross examination or to put on rebuttal evidence.\" (Fourth Am. Compl. [90] \u00b6 80.) Dr. Wilson again appealed in the Circuit Court. On May 21, 2014, the Circuit Court of Cook County again reversed the Department's suspension of Dr. Wilson's license,\n   this time on the merits. (Order, Ex. 2 to Third Am. Compl. [86-1].) Pursuant to that court's final judgment order, Dr. Wilson agreed to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   hold his license to practice medicine in abeyance pending (a) completion of all reasonable, necessary, and appropriate continuing medical education courses as reasonably required by the [IDFPR] ... (b) successful completion of all reasonable, necessary and appropriate competency testing as reasonably required by the [IDFPR] for the practice of medicine in the State of Illinois; and (c) all other reasonable, necessary and appropriate requirements for the practice of medicine in the State of Illinois as the [IDFPR] may reasonably require, consistent with the Court's May, 21 2014 order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The IDFPR did not appeal, and the Cook County Circuit Court's decision stands.

Count I of the Fourth Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants Gorchynsky, Glasgow, Doe Defendants 1-5, and Doe Defendants 21-30 violated Dr. Wilson's Fourth Amendment rights by unreasonably seizing his medical license. Count I also alleges that Defendants violated Plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment due process rights by interfering with Dr. Wilson's property interest in his license and his liberty interest in continuing with his chosen profession. Count II alleges that Defendants Gorchynsky, Sherman, Stewart, Doe Defendants 6-10, and Doe Defendants 21-30 are liable for the violations of Dr. Wilson's Fourth Amendment and due process rights under a supervisory responsibility theory. Count III similarly alleges that Defendants Stewart, Doe Defendants 11-20, and Doe Defendants 21-30 \"failed to act in reckless disregard of Dr. Wilson's constitutional rights.\" Count IV levies a \"stigma-plus\" due process claim against Defendant Sherman for statements Sherman made in a televised interview. Count V alleges that all Defendants conspired to violate Dr. Wilson's constitutional rights. Count VI charges Gorchynsky, Glasgow, Sherman, Stewart, Doe Defendants 1-5, Doe Defendants 6-10, and Doe Defendants 21-30 with malicious prosecution under Illinois law. Count VII claims that the IDFPR and the State of Illinois are liable to Dr. Wilson for the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   summary suspension of his medical license pursuant to 225 ILL. COMP.

(Fourth Am. Compl. [90] \u00b6\u00b6 60, 92.) During the television interview, Defendant Sherman stated, \"I think he [Dr. Wilson] is always within his rights to come in and say that the danger to the public no longer exists and make his argument.\" None of the six factors laid out in\n   <em>\n    Heyde\n   </em>\n   suggest that Sherman's interview was quasi-judicial in nature.

Similarly, Sherman's statement to the news press has no functional tie to IDFPR's adjudication of Dr. Wilson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Nor does Sherman's supervisory role support a quasi-judicial immunity defense. As Director, Plaintiff alleges that Sherman was \"in charge of setting policy and overseeing the overall conduct of the employees of the [DPR],\" and was tasked with \"ensuring that a doctor who was charged with disciplinary action ... is accorded all requisite due process rights, including the fair and timely prosecution of claims asserted against that doctor.\" (Fourth Am.

In this case, Dr. Wilson has made a colorable argument that Stewart made serious procedural errors in issuing his April 2013 suspension order. That is not enough, however, to defeat Stewart's claim of quasi-judicial immunity for his signing of the April 2013 suspension order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

As explained above, Gorchynsky and Glasgow are both absolutely immune from any damages claims brought as a result of their evaluation of the evidence against Dr. Wilson and their decision to seek the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   suspension of his medical license.

The Fourth Amendment grants people the right \"to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. Neither Plaintiff nor Defendants have established whether Dr. Wilson's medical license is a \"paper\" or \"effect\" subject to seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Dr. Wilson's attempt to establish that the medical license does fall within the Amendment's protections is not convincing. He argues in his brief that he has a \"constitutionally protected property interest in his license\"-but a protected property interest is a requirement for a due process claim, not a Fourth Amendment claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   His citation\n   to\n   <em>\n    Oliver v.

Finally, Dr. Wilson tries to argue that his \"liberty interest in continuing with the practice of medicine\" falls within the Fourth Amendment. (Pl.'s Resp. to Dfs.' Motion to Dismiss [98], at 4.) But that, too, is a due process argument. Defendants, for their part, only make the blanket statement that \"a professional license [is not a] tangible 'effect' \" under the Fourth Amendment, and they cite only unpublished district court opinions from other districts in support of that statement. (Dfs.' Memo. in Support of Motion to Dismiss [95], at 3.)

(Fourth Am. Compl. [90] \u00b6\u00b6 86, 87.) As explained above, Glasgow and Dr. Gorchynsky are absolutely immune from \u00a7 1983 claims for their evaluation of the evidence against Dr. Wilson and for their role in initiating the license revocation proceedings.

License Revocation Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Count II alleges that Gorchynsky, Sherman, and Stewart violated Dr. Wilson's procedural due process rights over the course of the license revocation hearings. \"The Department\" allegedly \"blackballed\" Wilson \"from the start,\" (Fourth Am. Compl.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 92, 93-95.) Count III similarly alleges that Stewart \"failed to act[,] in reckless disregard of Dr. Wilson's constitutional rights,\" even though he \"knew, must have known, or should have known, that the Department's prosecution of its claims ... was not proceeding in an expeditious manner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The court cannot determine that Gorchynsky is immune from liability for his continued role in Dr. Wilson's license revocation\n   proceedings because the complaint lacks any detail about Gorchynsky's actions after the filing of the initial department complaint. Dr. Wilson's Fourth Amended Complaint contains only one allegation of any additional involvement in Dr. Wilson's prosecution on Gorchynsky's part, beyond the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   summary suspension stage: he alleges that Gorchynsky participated \"individually, jointly, and in conspiracy [with Sherman, Stewart, Does 6-10, and Does 21-30] in the decision not to withdraw the summary suspension of Dr. Wilson's medical license and to continue the prosecution of [the IDFPR's] baseless claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 95.) The court is unable, from that allegation, to determine whether Gorchynsky's activity may have been prosecutorial in nature.

Wilson's due process claim for the license revocation proceedings is dismissed as against Gorchynsky.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The allegations against Sherman and Stewart are more complex. Sherman and Stewart were both Directors of the DPR for unspecified periods of time. (Fourth Am. Compl. [90] \u00b6\u00b6 9.4-9.5.) In Count II, Plaintiff alleges that both Sherman and Stewart, as Directors of the DPR, \"were in charge of setting policy and overseeing all conduct of the employees of the DPR, including investigators and prosecutors, and ensuring that a ... [charged doctor] is accorded all requisite due process rights.\" (Fourth Am. Compl. [90] \u00b6 92.) Dr. Wilson alleges that both Directors \"knew, must have known, or should have known, that the manner that the Department was prosecuting its claims against Dr. Wilson was part of the Department's vendetta against Dr. Wilson, and part of a cover-up because of the Department's initial failure to adequately investigate Dr. Wilson's conduct in connection with the death of Taylor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Wilson also alleges that Sherman and Stewart, too, \"participated in the decision not to withdraw the summary suspension ... and to continue the prosecution of\" Dr. Wilson.

Dr. Wilson \"may not rely on the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   to hold supervisory officials liable for the misconduct of their subordinates....

Direct personal involvement may not be required if a plaintiff claims that a supervisor failed to intervene in the deprivation of plaintiff's constitutional rights: \"An official satisfies the personal responsibility requirement of section 1983 if she acts or fails to act with a deliberate or reckless disregard of plaintiff's constitutional rights, or if the conduct causing the constitutional deprivation occurs at her direction or with her knowledge and consent.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Wilson does allege that Sherman participated in a decision not to withdraw the proceedings against him; as described above, that statement is insufficient alone to state a claim. Further, the factual allegations in the complaint do not support a reasonable inference that Sherman failed to act with a deliberate or reckless disregard of Dr. Wilson's due process rights. The Complaint alleges that Sherman was in charge of the DPR at some point, and, as noted, alleges that he \"knew, must have known, or should have known\" about the \"vendetta against Dr. Wilson,\" and that \"the Department was specifically informed\" that its \"charges against Dr. Wilson were without merit.\" (Fourth Am. Compl. [90] \u00b6 92.) Assuming these facts are true, they still require a chain of inferences that is too attenuated; they do not suggest that Sherman deliberately turned a blind eye to evidence he was aware of, nor that he acted with reckless disregard, nor that he himself was specifically informed of the merits of Wilson's case.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Stewart signed the April 2013 order suspending Dr. Wilson's medical license, but as described above, Stewart has quasi-judicial immunity for the issuing of the final order. Still, the April 2013 order came after months of inaction from the DPR and IDFPR-inaction of which Stewart was aware. Stewart acknowledged and justified the delays in his April Order by blaming them on \"a number of uncontrollable issues, including the retirement of the lead prosecutor, shortages in staffing, and misplaced records.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)

Both Plaintiff and Defendant have offered an analysis of Plaintiff's \"stigma-plus\" due process claim; regrettably, the court concludes that neither side proceeds under the correct legal framework.

But this court does not need to be persuaded when the Seventh Circuit has already established a legal framework that the parties simply overlook.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Still, the court finds that Dr. Wilson's claim fails.

In\n   <em>\n    Hinkle\n   </em>\n   , Wayne County Sherriff Jimmy Hinkle was accused of sexually abusing his step-daughter. The step-daughter later admitted that she had falsified the accusations, but not until an Illinois State Police investigation was opened by investigator Rick White. During the course of the investigation, \"the accusations [against Hinkle] became well-known in the community because White talked to a lot of people with whom he had no business sharing details of the investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277764\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/764/#p768\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277764\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/764/#p768\">\n    at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The prosecutor ultimately \"declined to press charges,\" and Hinkle sued White and his\n   supervisor, alleging that by spreading rumors about him, they deprived him of his liberty interest in his employment as law enforcement management. He did not directly challenge the investigation, itself, as violating his due process rights. The Seventh Circuit affirmed the lower court's grant of summary judgment for Defendants, finding under the stigma-plus test that \"the defendants did nothing to alter Hinkle's legal status. Rather, reading the facts in the light most favorable to Hinkle, the defendants defamed him. Even if that defamation seriously impaired his future employment prospects, the state did not alter his legal status.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like\n   <em>\n    Hinkle\n   </em>\n   , Sherman's statement to the press here did not alter Dr. Wilson's legal status-the license revocation proceedings may have, but Wilson has challenged those proceedings under a stigma-plus theory.

Conspiracy Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, in Count V, Dr. Wilson asserts that all Defendants participated in a conspiracy to violate his constitutional rights. The parties' briefing on the conspiracy claim is again lacking. As discussed above, Glasgow is immune from the only Constitutional claim levied against him. With respect to the other Defendants, none of whom have full immunity, Defendants assert that no claim for conspiracy can stand when there are no underlying constitutional violations. (Df. Gorchynsky's Motion to Dismiss Second Am. Compl. [22], at 7.) But Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment claims and a procedural due process claim against Stewart have survived this motion. Plaintiff, for his part, does not address the conspiracy claim at all in his response to Defendants' motion to dismiss.
