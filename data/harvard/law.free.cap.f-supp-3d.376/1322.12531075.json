Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Thompson filed this suit under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (\"ACPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), against five anonymous Defendants. He alleges that Defendants have unlawfully registered a domain name that infringes upon the putative trademark \"dar4ptc.\" This stands for \"Dar for Peachtree City,\" using the common acronym for Peachtree City, Georgia, PTC, in combination with Thompson's first name, Dar. Thompson argues that he owns a trademark in this phrase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a candidate for mayor of Peachtree City, Georgia, Thompson and his campaign committee settled upon \"dar4ptc\" as the slogan for his campaign and domain website. But when Thompson attempted to\n   purchase the domain name through GoDaddy.com, it was unavailable. Thompson avers that whoever registered the domain name did so without a legitimate purpose, in violation of the ACPA. Because the registrant of \"dar4ptc.om\" is unknown to him, Thompson initiated this lawsuit against the registrant and other alleged wrongdoers under the pseudonym of \"John Does.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 8, 2018, the Court quashed [16] a subpoena issued by Thompson on non-party GoDaddy.com because Thompson failed to demonstrate entitlement to premature discovery; he had not made a threshold showing of entitlement to relief under the trademark laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 22, Thompson filed an amended complaint [17] and a second motion [18] for early discovery. On May 8, the Court denied [20] Thompson's motion because he once again failed to state a claim. The Court further ordered Thompson to show cause as to why the case should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response, Thompson filed a motion [22] for leave to amend, which the Court granted [27]. The second amended complaint [28] then became the operative pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants now move to dismiss this complaint. On February 11, 2019, the Court held a hearing on the motion. All motions are now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

However, in the interim both sides obtained new counsel.

Thompson also seeks to strike Defendants' reply brief. These motions are addressed following the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To establish a prima facie claim under the ACPA, Thompson must demonstrate that (1) Defendants have registered, trafficked in, or used a domain name; (2) the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a mark owned by Thompson; (3) the mark was distinctive at the time Defendants registered the domain name; and (4) Defendants committed the alleged infringement with a bad-faith intent to profit from Thompson's mark.\n   <em>\n    Direct Niche, LLC v.

Rather, they argue that the ACPA requires use (a necessity for ownership of a common law trademark) of a valid trademark\n   <em>\n    at the time of the alleged infringement\n   </em>\n   , i.e., when Defendants registered the offending domain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Thompson responds by asserting that the text of the ACPA does not require that he show use at the time of registration; rather, the only thing that he must show is that the mark was distinctive at the time of registration. His argument is based on the text of the ACPA, which protects marks that are either distinctive \"at the\n   time of registration,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A)(i)(I), or \"famous at the time of registration,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1125(d)(1)(A)(ii)(II). Thompson correctly points out that the statute does not on its face require\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   at the time of registration. But that, unfortunately, does not settle the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A determination of what the ACPA requires \"begins with the statutory text, and ends there as well if the text is unambiguous.\"\n   <em>\n    BedRoc Ltd., LLC v.

As relevant to this case, the text of ACPA provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A person shall be liable in a civil action by the owner of a mark ... if ... that person ... uses a domain name that ... in the case of a mark that is distinctive at the time of registration of the domain name, is identical or confusingly similar to that mark ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A)(ii)(I).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Examining the plain text, there is no explicit use requirement related to the time of the domain registration. However, an obvious implication from the text of the statute is that there must be a \"mark\" capable of being distinctive at the time of registration. After all, it does not say \"in the case of a\n   <em>\n    phrase\n   </em>\n   that is distinctive\"; rather, the statute plainly contemplates that there be a mark. So then, what is a mark under the ACPA?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The ACPA defines a mark as including a trademark.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A trademark is defined as \"any word ... used by a person ... to identify and distinguish his or her goods, including a unique product, from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1127. The phrase \"used by a person\" demonstrates two things. On a very simple level, it shows that the statute contemplates that the mark at issue in an ACPA action would, in fact, be used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   More importantly for purposes of this Court's analysis, it suggests that the ACPA is to be applied consistently with traditional principles of trademark law, and is not, as Thompson contends, a\n   <em>\n    sui generis\n   </em>\n   enactment. The Supreme Court has called \"longstanding ... the principle that '[s]tatutes which invade the common law ... are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, even if the phrase \"dar4ptc\" was inherently distinctive-as the Court previously concluded because it fit the parameters of a suggestive trademark,\n   <em>\n    Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481077\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/763/#p768\">\n    505 U.S. 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 768,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481077\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/763/#p768\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481077\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/763/#p768\">\n    120 L.Ed.2d 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) -no actionable ACPA claim arises unless, at the time of registration, Thompson had an enforceable trademark right created by use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendants are correct that Thompson has pled no use of the mark at or before the time Defendants registered the domain names on July 15, 2017. Previously, the Court found that Thompson's campaign was launched in July. This was erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Based on its erroneous conclusion, the Court concluded that \"dar4ptc\" would have been associated in the mind of the public with his campaign at the time Defendants registered the domains, giving him some potential trademark rights at the relevant time. But due to the Court's reevaluation of when Thompson launched his campaign, this conclusion no longer holds. Under the present averments, Thompson's use of the mark in a public manner did not occur until weeks after the domain was registered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Thus, Thompson fails to state a claim for infringement of a \"mark that is distinctive at the time of registration\" because at that time there was no mark; that is, Thompson had not yet acquired enforceable rights to the putative common law mark \"dar4ptc\" through actual use in commerce.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A)(ii)(I).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Even if the mark technically existed as a distinctive, but unused, mark at the time of registration, courts have recognized that \"a trademark owner generally cannot sue for and recover damages for infringement that occurred prior to the owner acquiring the mark.\"\n   <em>\n    Ricks v.

Nev. 2010). In\n   <em>\n    Ricks\n   </em>\n   , the Court denied summary judgment due to an issue of fact \"as to whether the LLC owned the ... mark at the time of any alleged [ACPA] infringement ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4118860\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/727/936/#p957\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the Court has explained already, without use of a common law mark Thompson would have no ownership of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   True,\n   <em>\n    Ricks\n   </em>\n   dealt with the assignment of pre-existing trademark rights, whereas here \"dar4ptc\" was presumably a new trademark. But there is no legitimate distinction between these situations. The issues are the same: At the time of the alleged infringement, Thompson lacked a protectable interest in the mark because he had not yet appropriated the mark through use. It would defy principles of standing and causation for a trademark plaintiff to assert infringement of a trademark right that he did not have at the time the alleged infringement occurred simply because he later acquired the rights to the infringed mark.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court takes solace in the fact that, though unfortunate, its conclusion is consistent with several well-settled principles of trademark law. First, the \"basic rule of trademark law that a concept or an idea for a new trademark is not itself a 'trademark.' \" MCCARTHY ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   p. 7, \u00a7 16:11. \"[A] business plan or concept for a new trademark does not in itself establish protectable trademark rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Here, until Thompson used his mark, it was merely an idea, a concept, of a mark he had for his campaign. He had nothing to protect from anyone-including cybersquatters-at the time the infringement occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court's conclusion is also consistent with the principle that standing to sue based on injury from alleged trademark infringement accrues to the owner of the mark at the time of infringement.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Insect Sci. Res., LLC v. Timberline Fisheries Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:07-cv-2662-JEC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%20431233\">\n    2010 WL 431233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 4, 2010) (\"[Plaintiff] did not own the ... mark at the time of infringement or any other time. Because plaintiff had never owned the mark, plaintiff could not have suffered a legally cognizable injury when the infringement occurred.\" (citation omitted));\n   <em>\n    cf. also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nutritech Sols., Ltd. v. Matrix Nutrition, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. cv 06-461-PHX-MHM,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201424337\">\n    2007 WL 1424337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (D. Ariz. May 11, 2007) (\"[T]o sue for patent, and for argument's sake for a trademark violation, requires either (1) ownership of the patent or trademark\n   <em>\n    at the time of the infringement\n   </em>\n   or (2) subsequent ownership of the trademark and the assignment of claims of past infringement.\" (emphasis added)). Thus, where a trademark plaintiff, like Thompson, had no rights at the time of infringement, he generally lacks standing to bring suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   It would be a strange result if, even accepting Thompson's argument that distinctiveness is all that must be shown at the time of infringement, he could predicate his infringement action on a time prior to his-or anyone's-appropriation of the \"dar4ptc\" mark. While it seems obvious that Defendants acted in bad faith by registering the domain and that they effectively \"stole\" Thompson's idea for his campaign, his remedy does not lie in trademark infringement because he lacked trademark rights at the relevant time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Accordingly, the Court is compelled by the structure of the ACPA and the operating principles of trademark law to arrive at its conclusion, though it is satisfied that Defendants did something \"wrong.\" Judicial intuitions, however, do not create a basis for sustaining a cause of action. And as this Court understands the statute, in the absence of evidence that Thompson used the mark at the time the domains were registered, he fails to state a claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Thompson contests the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Even if Does were correct about the alleged misconduct, the Court is not inclined to grant sanctions because the requisite causal connection between the alleged misconduct and the multiplication of these proceedings is absent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peterson v.

The hearing on the motion to dismiss was also granted at the\n   <em>\n    Defendants'\n   </em>\n   request-not Thompson's. While the issues may have been a little clearer a little sooner had Thompson or his counsel owned up to the factual mistake sooner, the Court did not rely on\n   <em>\n    counsel's\n   </em>\n   misstatement, nor does the Court find that it caused the proceedings to be multiplied. Rather, this effect was accomplished by the nature of the questions in this case and the procedural gymnastics bringing us to the present day.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court grants Defendant's motion [33] to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The Court denies both Defendants' motion [41] for sanctions and Thompson's motion [47] to strike. The Clerk is directed to close the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED this 18th day of April, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    At this stage the facts as averred in Thompson's second amended complaint [28] are assumed to be true.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Thompson contends that Defendants' present motion to dismiss is an improper successive motion because it duplicates the analysis conducted by the Court in the motions for early discovery, to quash, and to amend. However, this is the first motion to dismiss that has been filed. It is therefore not successive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The Court also disagrees with Thompson's analogy to trademark applications based on an intent to use. This scheme \"does not, by itself, confer any rights enforceable against others, [though] it does give an applicant the right to engage in the statutorily prescribed application procedure.\"\n    <em>\n     Aktieselskabet AF 21.

Cir. 2008). The Court holds that Thompson must demonstrate the use of a mark at the time the offending domains are registered in order to establish rights enforceable by the ACPA. The intent-to-use regime provides no such thing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Of course, the assignment rights to a trademark can include pre-assignment infringement causes of action. But these \"are disfavored, and they are allowed only when the right to sue is clearly spelled out in a valid assignment.\"\n    <em>\n     H &amp; J Foods, Inc. v.

Thompson's alleged trademark was not assigned to him. Further, the \"dar4ptc\" mark did not exist as a trademark prior to Thompson using it, which occurred\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    the infringement. Thus, there were no pre-existing rights that could have inhered when (if) he eventually acquired ownership of the mark through use.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The Court notes that if the Defendants\n    <em>\n     re-registered\n    </em>\n    the domains, to the extent that Thompson has rights in \"dar4ptc\" at that time, he may have a cause of action against them.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jysk Bed'n Linen v.
