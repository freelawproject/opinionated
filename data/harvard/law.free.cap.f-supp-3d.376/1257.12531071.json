ALTONAGA, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   On March 11, 2019, Magistrate Judge McAliley entered a Report [ECF No. 251] on Plaintiff, Federal Trade Commission's Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 228]. Judge McAliley recommends the Court grant Plaintiff's Motion and enter a permanent injunction against\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Defendants,\n   Dustin Pillonato and Justin Ramsey. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 1289-90). On March 18, 2019, Defendants timely filed their Objections [ECF No. 253] to the Report. Plaintiff filed its Response to Defendants' Objections [ECF No. 255] (\"Pl.'s Resp. to Objs.\") on March 21, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   When a magistrate judge's \"disposition\" has properly been objected to, as is the case here, district courts must review the disposition\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3). Defendants timely filed objections to the Report (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Objs.), and so the Court reviews the record\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . The Court has carefully reviewed the parties' written submissions, the record, and applicable law. For the following reasons, Judge McAliley's Report is affirmed, and Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Report details the relevant facts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 1274-81). Judge McAliley relies on Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [ECF No. 229] (\"Pl.'s SOF\"), as Defendants failed to file their own statement of material facts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 1274 (citing cases) ). The Court agrees and fully adopts Plaintiff's facts here. Given Defendants' status as\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigants, however, the Court also considers all evidence Defendants reference in their briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For brevity, the undersigned outlines the general nature of the case, reserving specific reference to the evidence in her analysis below. The dispute involves Plaintiff's allegations against various companies and their principals for deceptive representations, unfair billing practices, and abusive telemarketing practices. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   First Amended Complaint [ECF No. 109] ). Every Defendant in the case, other than Pillonato and Ramsey, as principals of Pointbreak Media, LLC and Modern Source Media LLC (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17), has either settled or has defaulted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to enter summary judgment, a permanent injunction, and a money judgment for $ 3,367,666.30, jointly and severally, against Pillonato and Ramsey. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mot.). Plaintiff moves for summary judgment on all claims for which Pillonato and Ramsey are named as Defendants: (1) Section 5(a) of the FTC act for alleged misrepresentations to induce consumers to purchase \"claiming and verifying\" and Citation Program services under both a personal liability and common enterprise theory (Count I) (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 208-10); (2) Section 5(a) of the FTC Act for Pointbreak Media's unfair billing practices (Count II) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 211-13); and (3) Telemarketing Sales Rule (\"TSR\"), 16 C.F.R. section 310.4(b), arising from Pointbreak Media's initiation of unlawful prerecorded messages and robocalls to numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry (Counts III and IV) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 224-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties have completed extensive briefing. In all, Plaintiff filed its Motion, Reply [ECF No. 241], and Response to Defendants' Objections. Defendants filed a Response [ECF No. 234], Surreply [ECF No. 244], and their Objections to the Report. Plaintiff's Motion is ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In her Report, Judge McAliley thoughtfully addresses every argument Defendants raise in opposition to Plaintiff's Motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 1281-87). The Magistrate Judge also references the arguments in Plaintiff's Motion that Defendants do not challenge. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). Having had the benefit of reviewing Defendants' Objections, the undersigned addresses the merits of Plaintiff's Motion by evaluating the four claims against Pillonato and Ramsey. The Court concludes by addressing,\n   and ultimately rejecting, Defendants' remaining objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Count I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In Count I, Plaintiff alleges Pillonato and Ramsey made false, misleading, and unsubstantiated representations, in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 210). Section 5 prohibits \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). To establish a violation of Section 5, Plaintiff must prove: \"(1) there was a representation, (2) the representation was likely to mislead customers acting reasonably under the circumstances, and (3) the representation was material.\"\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v. Tashman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9343595\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/1273/#p1277\">\n    318 F.3d 1273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1277 (11th Cir. 2003) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff has established all the elements of a claim under Section 5(a) as a matter of law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 1281). Defendants have not challenged this conclusion in either their briefing before or after the Report. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Resp.; Surreply; Objs.). The Court has independently reviewed the evidence and agrees there is no genuine dispute of material fact that Pointbreak Media's robocalls and live sales agent calls violated Section 5(a). In so doing, the undersigned fully adopts the Report's analysis on Count I here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 1281-83).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   But the Court's analysis does not stop there, for Plaintiff asks the Court to hold Pillonato and Ramsey liable\n   <em>\n    for the conduct of Co-Defendants\n   </em>\n   , Modern Spotlight LLC, Modern Spotlight Group LLC, Perfect Image Online LLC, National Business Listings LLC, and DCP Marketing LLC (the \"Co-Defendants\") under a common enterprise theory. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9343595\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/1273/#p1277\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9343595\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/1273/#p1277\">\n    1282-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Plaintiff also asks the Court to find Pillonato and Ramsey liable for the conduct of the Co-Defendants under a personal liability theory. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9343595\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/1273/#p1277\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9343595\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/1273/#p1277\">\n    1284-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Court addresses both theories of liability in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    i. Common Enterprise Liability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court first turns to common enterprise liability. \"When a common enterprise exists, each corporation may be held liable for the others' violations.\"\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v. Life Mgmt. Servs. of Orange Cty., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528706\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/350/1246/#p1257\">\n    350 F.Supp.3d 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1257 (M.D. Fla. 2018) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Pillonato and Ramsey do not dispute that Modern Source Media, Perfect Image Online, National Business Listings, and DCP Marketing, along with Pointbreak Media, were part of a common enterprise. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Resp., Surreply; Objs.). After reviewing the record and applicable law, the Court agrees that Modern Source Media, Perfect Image Online, National Business Listings, DCP Marketing, and Pointbreak Media were part of a common enterprise. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 1282-84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants only dispute the Magistrate Judge's conclusion that Modern Spotlight and Modern Spotlight Group (the \"Modern Spotlight Defendants\") are also part of the common enterprise. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 1-4; Surreply 1-2; Objs. \u00b6 1). In support, Defendants supply the Declaration of Michael Pocker, another Defendant in the case and the principal of the Modern Spotlight Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 10-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Pocker's statement reflects that the Modern Spotlight Defendants\n   <em>\n    traded\n   </em>\n   office space and Modern Spotlight\n   <em>\n    subleased\n   </em>\n   office space from Pointbreak Media. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528706\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/350/1246/#p1257\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Pocker also states while some employees worked for both Pointbreak Media and the Modern Spotlight Defendants, no employees worked for the entities simultaneously. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528706\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/350/1246/#p1257\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). To Defendants, this declaration creates an issue of material fact whether the Modern Spotlight Defendants were part of the common enterprise. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528706\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/350/1246/#p1257\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under the FTC Act, \"a corporate entity can be held liable for the conduct of other entities where the structure, organization, and pattern of a business venture reveal a common enterprise or a maze of integrated business entities.\"\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v. Lanier Law, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=715%20F.%20App%27x%20970\">\n    715 F. App'x 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 979 (11th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In determining if a common enterprise exists, courts consider whether the businesses \"share office spaces and employees, commingle funds, coordinate advertising efforts, and operate under common control.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=715%20F.%20App%27x%20970\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). While courts are expected to weigh these factors, they are primarily tasked with evaluating the \"pattern and frame-work of the whole enterprise.\"\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v. HES Merch. Servs. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 6:12-cv-1618-Orl-22KRS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206863506\">\n    2014 WL 6863506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (M.D. Fla.

App'x 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Report describes the extensive cooperation between the Modern Spotlight Defendants and Pointbreak Media and Modern Source Media to induce customers to purchase their services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 1282-84). For example, the companies shared client data. Modern Spotlight Group sold its claiming and verification customer leads exclusively to Modern Source Media; and Modern Source Media sold its Citation Program services exclusively to Modern Spotlight Group customers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 56, 58). Modern Spotlight Group also scheduled Citation Program sales calls for Modern Source Media; and Modern Source Media provided phone numbers to Modern Spotlight Group, which placed claiming and verification robocalls to those numbers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Michael Pocker [ECF No. 229-111] \u00b6 57;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Declaration of Michael Pocker [ECF No. 241-2] \u00b6 4). Tellingly, Modern Source Media's own employees do not distinguish between Modern Source Media and Modern Spotlight Group, telling consumers the companies were a single business. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. to Objs. 3-4). Ramsey acknowledged that Pointbreak Media was completely dependent on Modern Spotlight Group for its survival. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   December 14, 2017 E-mail from Ramsey to Pillonato [ECF No. 229-59] 3 (stating \"all ... we have ... \"[r]ight now its [sic] pocker and pocker only.\" (alterations added) ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Report also highlights the following undisputed evidence, which in the aggregate, most certainly shows a common enterprise existed between Pointbreak Media and the Modern Spotlight Defendants: (1) Pointbreak Media and Modern Spotlight shared a credit card merchant account; (2) Pointbreak Media and the Modern Spotlight Defendants used similar robocall and live sales agent scripts; (3) Pocker, Pillonato, and Ramsey discussed the companies' sales scripts with each other; (4) Pointbreak Media's office space and employees became Modern Spotlight Group's offices and employees; and (5) Modern Spotlight Group used similar customer contracts and welcome emails as Pointbreak Media. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 1283-84 (citing Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7, 14, 15, 27, 28, 29) ). These \"undisputed facts demonstrate that the [Modern Spotlight Defendants] operated as part of a common enterprise with the other Corporate Defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307571\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/156/1202/#p1208\">\n    156 F.Supp.3d 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1208 (D. Nev. 2015) (alteration added) (entering summary judgment for the FTC and finding common enterprise liability existed where entities commingled funds and coordinated their sales efforts).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Despite this compelling, conclusive, and indisputable record evidence, Defendants ask the Court to consider, in rigid form, the factors of shared office space, shared employees, and common control. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 2). The crux of Defendants' argument is that a triable issue of fact exists on the question of common enterprise liability because Pointbreak Media and the Modern Spotlight Defendants did not\n   <em>\n    simultaneously\n   </em>\n   share employees and office space. This argument fails to persuade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v. Life Management Services of Orange County, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528706\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/350/1246/#p1257\">\n    350 F.Supp.3d 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Fla. 2018), is instructive. There, the court was similarly tasked with determining whether common enterprise liability existed between two companies, Loyal and LMS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528706\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/350/1246/#p1257\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528706\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/350/1246/#p1257\">\n    at 1257-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The indisputable record evidence overwhelmingly supported a common enterprise finding, including a shared merchant account and LMS submitting identical scripts and documents as Loyal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528706\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/350/1246/#p1257\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528706\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/350/1246/#p1257\">\n    at 1258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That the companies' addresses were \"overlapping\" although not identical did not alter the court's conclusion that the evidence was so one-sided for the FTC to prevail on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528706\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/350/1246/#p1257\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (footnote call number and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   So, too, here the undisputed material facts dictate summary judgment in Plaintiff's favor on the question of common enterprise liability. Contrary to Defendants' insistence, common enterprise liability does not require a finding of\n   <em>\n    contemporaneous\n   </em>\n   shared employees and office space. Plaintiff need not \"prove any particular number of entity connections\" or \"any specific connection.\"\n   <em>\n    F.T.C v. Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794118\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/574/714/#p722\">\n    574 F.Supp.2d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 722 (S.D.

Rather, Plaintiff must show that Pointbreak Media and the Modern Spotlight Defendants \"maintained an unholy alliance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794118\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/574/714/#p722\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This, Plaintiff has done. Because Mr. Pocker's Declaration \"is insufficient evidence 'for a jury to return a verdict' in [Defendants'] favor\" on the question of common enterprise, \"summary judgment [is] appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Lanier Law, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=715%20F.%20App%27x%20970\">\n    715 F.

The Eleventh Circuit recently explained that \"knowledge may be established by showing that the individual had actual knowledge of the deceptive conduct, was recklessly indifferent to its deceptiveness, or had an awareness of a high probability of deceptiveness and intentionally avoided learning of the truth.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239501\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/1228/#p1233\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants initially contested a finding of personal liability with respect to the Modern Spotlight Defendants' deceptive sales, focusing on the \"control\" element of the personal liability inquiry. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 3). But Pillonato and Ramsey\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   personally liable for the Modern Spotlight Defendants' deceptive sales because they\n   <em>\n    directly participated\n   </em>\n   in the deceptive sales practices. Indeed, Pillonato and Ramsey (1) provided phone numbers for the Modern Spotlight Defendants to robocall and a merchant account for them to use; (2) shared welcome emails and contracts with them; and (3) coordinated with the Modern Spotlight Defendants on how to transfer customers to Modern Source Media. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 27, 29;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Declaration of Michael Pocker \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6, 9-10). As Plaintiff points out, day-to-day involvement of the Modern Spotlight Defendants' activities is unnecessary to establish direct participation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. to Objs. 7). Where individuals obtained merchant bank accounts for an entity, as Pillonato and Ramsey did for Modern Spotlight (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 27), they directly participated in the entity's wrongdoing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v. J.L.

Cal. 2000). Plaintiff has established that Pillonato and Ramsey directly participated in the Modern Spotlight Defendants' deceptive sales practices as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In their briefing since the Report, Defendants no longer challenge the indisputable evidence that they either participated directly in deceptive sales practices (in the case of some members of the common enterprise like the Modern Spotlight Defendants) or had the authority to control them. Nor could they. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 1284-85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Instead, Pillonato and Ramsey now argue a triable issue of fact exists on the knowledge element of the personal liability inquiry. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objs. \u00b6 7). Specifically, Defendants insist they could not have known of the other entities' deceptive practices when they opposed all illegal activities and instructed employees to not mislead customers into thinking Pointbreak Media and Google were one and the same. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11509449\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/99/1176/#p1206\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). In support, Defendants supply Pointbreak Media's co-owner, Beau Strickland's testimony, stating Ramsey and Pillonato opposed all illegal activities. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11509449\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/99/1176/#p1206\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court must again disagree with Defendants. Mr. Strickland's testimony amounts to a \"mere scintilla of evidence\" in the context of the entire record establishing Pillonato and Ramsey certainly had or\n   <em>\n    should have had\n   </em>\n   knowledge of Pointbreak Media's deceptive practices, as well as the deceptive practices of all the other entities. (Report 1284-85 (citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Indeed, at a minimum, Pillonato and Ramsey should have known of the entities' (including the Modern Spotlight Defendants') deceptive sales practices. Even if Defendants' \"protestations [they were] not aware of the content of the scripts, the texting, or any other illegal behavior\" were true, that would be \"only because [they] intentionally avoided discovering [them] despite knowing that there was a high probability that [the entities were] engaging in\" deceptive sales practices.\n   <em>\n    Primary Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12413871\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/713/805/#p806\">\n    713 F.

Count II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Pillonato and Ramsey do not challenge the Magistrate Judge's findings as to Count II. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Objs.). The undersigned\n   has reviewed the Report, the record, and the applicable law. For the reasons discussed in detail in the Report, the Court agrees Plaintiff has established the absence of a triable issue of fact on the elements of a claim of unfair billing practices under Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 1285-86). Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against Pillonato and Ramsey on Count II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Counts III and IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Counts III and IV involve allegations Pillonato and Ramsey violated the TSR. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 224-227). These claims arise from the robocalls Pointbreak Media made, including millions of calls to telephone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry. The undisputed evidence supports, and Defendants do not dispute, that (1) Pointbreak Media was a telemarketer and a seller under the TSR; and (2) Pointbreak Media, with Pillonato and Ramsey's knowledge, initiated robocalls, including robocalls to telephone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 1286).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In their initial briefing, Pillonato and Ramsey argued Pointbreak Media calls should benefit from the business-to-business exception. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 6). The TSR exempts \"[t]elephone calls between a telemarketer and any business to induce the purchase of goods or services ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20310.6\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7) (alterations added). The Magistrate Judge correctly rejected Defendants' unsupported and conclusory assertion that any calls from Pointbreak Media received by non-businesses were made in error. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 1287). Even if this assertion were supported by the evidence, Defendants' subjective intentions are irrelevant, as the business-to-business exemption only applies to telephone calls\n   <em>\n    between\n   </em>\n   telemarketers and businesses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20310.6\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Inc21.com Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4166912\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/745/975/#p1007\">\n    745 F.Supp.2d 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1007 (N.D. Cal. 2010) ) ). Plaintiff thus prevails on summary judgment against Defendants on Counts III and IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Miscellaneous Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants' remaining objections all fail to persuade. First, contrary to Defendants' contention (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Objs. \u00b6 6), the Magistrate Judge correctly recommended a proposed judgment of $ 3,367,666.30 against Pillonato and Ramsey. Under the FTC Act, \"courts have justly imposed joint and several liability where a common enterprise exists.\"\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v. WV Universal Mgmt., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267028\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/1234/#p1240\">\n    877 F.3d 1234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1240 (11th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted). And \"[i]f an individual may be held personally liable for corporate violations of the FTC Act ... nothing more need be shown to justify imposition of joint and several liability for the corporation's restitution obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v. Commerce Planet, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146856\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/593/#p600\">\n    815 F.3d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 600 (9th Cir. 2016) (alterations added). Finally, \"[i]f two or more defendants jointly cause harm, each defendant is held liable for the entire amount of the harm; provided, however, that the plaintiff recover only once for the full amount.\"\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604669\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1626/#p1631\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1631,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604669\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1626/#p1631\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (alteration added; citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants' objection ignores \"well-established principles of joint and several liability.\" (Pl.'s Resp. to Objs. 9). The case law makes clear that although Plaintiff cannot collect from Pillonato and Ramsey any amount it has already recovered from the other named Defendants, that limitation does not change the amount of the money judgment. This objection is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants also object to the recommended bans on telemarketing and remotely created payment orders (\"RCPO[s]\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objs. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). While the\n   Court could reject these two objections on the basis that Defendants failed to raise them in their Response or Surreply, the Court exercises its discretion to review them on their merits given Defendants'\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendants contend the RCPO ban is overbroad because it will prevent them from accepting \"any all checks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). Not so. The Proposed Final Order of Permanent Injunction and Monetary Judgment [ECF No. 251-1] (\"Proposed Final Order\") only prohibits Defendants from accepting a check if it is \"initiated or created by or on behalf of the payee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   5). As Plaintiff notes, an RCPO \"is created not by the party on whose account it draws (the payor), but rather by the party accepting payment (the payee).\" (Pl.'s Resp. to Objs. 9). Because Defendants may still accept checks written by their customers, the Proposed Final Order is not overbroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants also object to the telemarketing ban in the Proposed Final Order because it \"effectively prohibit[s] them from using a telephone in any manner whatsoever in conducting any business whatsoever ....\" (Objs. \u00b6 5 (alterations added) ). Defendants are again mistaken. The Proposed Final Order only precludes Pillonato and Ramsey from using telephones as part of a telemarketing sales campaign. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Final Order 5). Defendants are otherwise free to use telephones in connection with any job or business. Given Defendants' history of unlawful marketing (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Report 1280), the telemarketing ban in the Proposed Final Order is not overbroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants' objection to the Proposed Final Order's requirement they turn over certain items of jewelry to the Receiver because they purportedly do not possess the requested items fares no better. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objs. \u00b6 3). Plaintiff has supplied receipts showing Ramsey purchased the jewelry. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Certification of Records of Regularly Conducted Activity [ECF No. 241-3] ). This evidence corroborates the adverse inference that can be drawn from Defendants' Fifth Amendment invocation when asked questions about the items at their depositions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. to Objs. 10 (citations to the record omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, Defendants ask \"to be heard on the terms of the injunction,\" in the event the Court does not accept their other objections. (Objs. \u00b6 8). Defendants have had the benefit of\n   <em>\n    multiple\n   </em>\n   rounds of briefing, including raising objections pertinent to the terms of the Proposed Final Order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-5). The undersigned sees no need for yet another round of motion practice on the scope of the permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Altonaga referred to me. (ECF Nos. 228, 245). Pillonato and Ramsey filed an Opposition, and the FTC filed a Reply to which Pillonato and Ramsey,\n   with leave of Court, filed a Sur-Reply. (ECF Nos. 234, 241, 243, 244). I have carefully considered the parties' memoranda of law, the pertinent portions of the record and the applicable law. For the reasons set forth below, I recommend that the Court grant the FTC's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This is an action for violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule, promulgated pursuant to the Telemarketing Act, that alleges the defendants engaged in deceptive representations, unfair billing practices and abusive telemarketing practices. The FTC's Amended Complaint seeks monetary and injunctive relief against several companies and their principals, including Pillonato and Ramsey and their companies Pointbreak Media, LLC, DCP Marketing, LLC, Modern Source Media, LLC, National Business Listings, LLC and Allstar Data, LLC. (ECF No. 109). Early in this lawsuit, the Court entered a preliminary injunction against Pillonato and Ramsey and each of their companies, with the exception of Allstar Data and National Business Listings. (ECF No. 64). The FTC now asks this Court to enter final summary judgment against Pillonato and Ramsey and a permanent injunction and a money judgment in the amount of $ 3,367,666.30 against both of them, jointly and severally.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF Nos. 228 at 24; 241 at 1 n.1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Undisputed Material Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Relying on the FTC's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"SUMF\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court sets forth below those undisputed material facts necessary to resolve the motion for summary judgment. Unless otherwise noted, the Court cites to the pertinent paragraphs of the SUMF. The Court does this having thoroughly reviewed the evidence the FTC cites in in the SUMF in support of each assertion, and having confirmed that each assertion relied upon in this report and recommendation is supported by some, if not all, of the cited evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court finds the following facts to be undisputed for several reasons. First and foremost, Pillonato and Ramsey did not file their own statement of material facts as required by Local Rule 56.1(a). \"All material facts set forth in the movant's statement...will be deemed admitted unless controverted by the opposing party's statement [of material facts], provided that the Court finds that the movant's statement is supported by evidence in the record.\" S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(b). The Court recognizes that Pillonato and Ramsey are\n   not represented by counsel, but their\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status does not excuse their compliance with the Local Rules of this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

The Court may therefore deem the facts set forth in the SUMF as admitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

(ECF No. 234). Their Opposition does include a declaration from a co-defendant and a deposition excerpt from a co-owner of Pointbreak, but none of the information contained therein is inconsistent with the SUMF. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 234 at pp. 10-17\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 229 at \u00b6\u00b6 24-31). \"[T]he nonmoving party must offer more than a mere scintilla of evidence for its position; indeed, the nonmoving party must make a showing sufficient to permit the jury to reasonably find on its behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    Picardat v.

Pointbreak and Modern Source also conducted a telemarketing operation that targeted those consumers who had already purchased \"claiming and verification services,\" and used false promises of top placement in search results, to persuade them to purchase, for a significant recurring monthly fee, a purported search engine optimization service called the \"Citation Program.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Robocalls\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Pointbreak, Modern Spotlight and Perfect Image placed robocalls to consumers weekly, and sometimes daily, over a period of several months in 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4). During the seven-week period between July 3, 2017 and August 25, 2017, Pointbreak alone made nearly 75 million robocalls, nearly 15 million of which were to telephone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry (\"DNC Registry\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6; ECF No. 229-87 at 3-4). The robocalls were the first stage of the Defendants' telemarketing scheme. They contained false threats of removal from Google and, with respect to Pointbreak, false statements of affiliation with Google. (ECF No. 229, SUMF, at \u00b6\u00b6 5-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For example, a robocall from Pointbreak identified the caller as a \"data service provider for Google and Bing...This is your final notice. If you do not act soon, Google will label your business as permanently closed. Press one now to speak with me or another Google specialist. Did you know that 74 percent of your customers search online before making a purchase? If your Google listing is shut down, you will lose on all of those potential customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5). Another robocall identified Pointbreak as a \"third party service provider for Google.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   A robocall from Modern Spotlight told the consumer that \"Your Google Business listing may be inactive. Immediate action is required. Please press one to speak with a representative and avoid being removed from Google.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7). Perfect Image used a similar robocall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In fact, Pointbreak had no affiliation or association with Google, and Google does not remove a business from search results or label it \"permanently closed\" if the business owner does not claim and verify the business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Live Sales Pitches\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Those consumers who pressed one in response to the robocalls were transferred to a live sales agent for either Pointbreak, Modern Spotlight, Perfect Image or National Business Listings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-15). These sales agents used a host of false representations to sell consumers a purported \"claiming and verification\" service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-15, 19-23). For example, the sales agents claimed various forms of affiliation with Google, including that they were an \"authorized Google My Business\" agency or representative, an \"affiliate branch,\" a \"subsidiary that Google hires,\" a \"third party basically contracted by Google\" or a \"Google Business Partner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). In truth, Google had no affiliation or association with either Pointbreak, Modern Spotlight, Perfect Image or National Business Listings, it had not contracted with those Defendants, nor did it approve, sponsor or\n   endorse their services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19). None of these Defendants were a service provider for Google, or an authorized \"Google My Business agency.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The sales agents told consumers they would face adverse consequences if they did not claim and verify their business with Google, which was untrue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10-12, 20). For example, sales agents stated that (i) \"Over the next 6-8 months businesses that are not claimed and verified with Google run the risk of possibility [sic] being removed from the search engine or pushed so far down the search engine that no one will find you,\" (ii) failure to claim and verify the business \"is causing your listing to NOT display, or display IMPROPERLY, and MAY be at risk of being removed,\" and (iii) purchase of the claiming and verifying service was necessary to \"avoid removal\" from Google, and refusal to do so would cause the business listing to be \"removed entirely from the search engine\" or \"removed from the internet.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10-12) (emphasis in original). In truth, Google does not remove a business from search results if the owner does not claim and verify the business, and Google search results include unclaimed and unverified businesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Sales agents tried to convince consumers to purchase their services by promising that the claiming and verification process included \"registering\" or \"claiming\" keywords, which would allow the business to be prominently displayed in search results. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 21-22). For example, Pointbreak and NBL sales agents told consumers that \"part of the claiming and verification process is registering your keywords, so you come up prominently when someone is searching for your goods and services.\" (ECF Nos. 229-32 at 40; 229-35 at 2). Modern Spotlight and Perfect Image similarly claimed that keywords are \"one of the most important parts of the verification process.\" (ECF No. 229-112 at \u00b6 7, p. 14). Some Pointbreak sales agents stated that the assigned keywords would be unique to the business, or that the keywords would give the business top placement in search results. (ECF No. 229, SUMF, at \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   These promises were false. The claiming and verification process does not include claiming or registering specific keywords. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21). A third party cannot guarantee that a business \"will appear in a particular place in Google search results for any given search term,\" (ECF No. 229-104 at 37:15-18), or that the listing will appear on the top or first page of Google search results, because Google uses proprietary algorithms to determine the order of search results. (ECF No. 229-104 at 38:21-25, 39:7-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   These Defendants fraudulently charged hundreds of dollars for their claiming and verification service, when not even Google charges businesses to claim, verify and manage their business listings. (ECF Nos. 229-111 at \u00b6 24; 229-35 at 5; 229-32 at 43; 229-3 at \u00b6 5). Consumers purchased their services relying on Defendants' misrepresentations. (ECF No. 229, SUMF, at \u00b6 23). The one-time fee that consumers paid Pointbreak for the claiming and verification service ranged between $ 300-$ 500. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16; 229-12). There is no evidence that Pointbreak's customers benefitted from its services. In fact, for some customers, Pointbreak never provided claiming and verification services, and other customers reported that they saw no change in search results, even when searching for the\n   claimed keywords. (ECF No. 229, SUMF, at \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Pointbreak, and later Modern Source, would call customers after they purchased the claiming and verification service to sell yet another service, the \"Citation Program.\" Again, they made false claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). The sales agents reiterated that they were affiliated with Google, and told consumers that Google uses an \"online visibility score\" based on \"52 directories [that] GOOGLE uses to decide who's credible and relevant and who's not\" to determine where to place the business listing in search engine results. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18; ECF Nos.229-36 at 5-6; 229-6 at \u00b6 10; 229-7 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10). They described the Citation Program as \"get[ting] [the business] listed on every one of these directories, and over the next 30 days and [sic] we'll take your visibility score...to 100% accurate and correct.\" (ECF No. 229-36 at 6). The sales agents then guaranteed success, telling the consumer that the Citation Program \"...isn't something that we think is going to work. This is something we know is going to work. It works every single time without exception...It's increasing your coverage every month. It's also increasing your ranking so you're coming up at the very top of the search.\" (ECF Nos. 229, SUMF, at \u00b6 18; 229-36 at 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In fact, Google uses a proprietary algorithm to determine the order of search results, but contrary to the sales claims, that algorithm does not \"boil down to an online visibility score based on an association with 52 main directories.\" (ECF No. 229-104 at 40:17-41:2). Google does not use 52 directories to determine which businesses are credible and relevant, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:9-13), nor does it use a visibility score to determine search results. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:6-9). In truth, a third party cannot guarantee that a business will appear prominently in Google search results for any given search term. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38:10-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Consumers purchased the Citation Program in reliance on these misrepresentations. (ECF Nos. 229, SUMF, at \u00b6 23). They paid Pointbreak or Modern Source a one-time fee, between $ 499.99 and 849.99, and a recurring charge of $ 169.99 per month. (ECF No. 229-6 at \u00b6 10; 229-7 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10; 229-8 at \u00b6 9; 229-12 at \u00b6 7). Customers did not see any change in search results following purchase of the Citation Program. (ECF Nos. 229-7 at \u00b6 12; 229-8 at \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Unauthorized Billing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Pointbreak accepted two forms of payment from consumers: (i) credit card or (ii) a \"remotely created check\" that Pointbreak generated using the bank account information that business owners provided. (ECF Nos. 229-6 at \u00b6 7; 229-7 at \u00b6 5; 229-11 at \u00b6 4; 229-12 at \u00b6 6; 229-35 at 6). Pointbreak allowed Defendant Modern Spotlight to use its credit card merchant account for a short period of time in 2017 in exchange for 30% of the fees that Modern Spotlight generated from its sales of claiming and verifying services. (ECF No. 229, SUMF, at \u00b6 27). On October 20, 2017, Bank of America Merchant Services terminated Pointbreak's merchant account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32). Shortly thereafter, between October 23 and 27, 2017, Pointbreak wrote itself remotely created checks from at least 280 consumers' bank accounts, each in the amount of $ 100, without those consumers' prior knowledge or consent, and without providing increased services or benefits in return. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33; ECF Nos. 229-11 at \u00b6 10, 229-12 at \u00b6 13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     Pointbreak Reinvented Itself\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In mid-November 2017, Pointbreak stopped making new sales to customers, but continued its business practices through Defendant DCP Marketing, LLC and Modern Source Media, LLC. (ECF No. 229, SUMF, at \u00b6 28). DCP Marketing used Pointbreak as its fictious name, and a DCP merchant account with the \"Point Break\" alias was used to collect recurring charges from Pointbreak's Citation Program customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Remotely created checks identifying Pointbreak as the payee were also deposited into DCP's checking account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As for Modern Source, one of its sales agents referred to Pointbreak as \"the old name\" for Modern Source. (ECF No. 229-24 at 249). Modern Source sold only the Citation Program, and several of its employees had previously worked for Pointbreak. (ECF No. 229, SUMF, at \u00b6\u00b6 28-29). Modern Source teamed up with Defendant Modern Spotlight Group to sell its Citation Program. These companies had a close economic relationship. Modern Source made sales only to customers of Modern Spotlight Group, and Modern Spotlight Group provided its customers' information only to Modern Source in return for a percentage of Modern Source's sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29). Modern Spotlight Group sales agents set up appointments for its customers to speak with agents from Modern Source, and would forward telephone calls to Modern Source. (ECF No. 229-11 at \u00b6 57). Modern Spotlight Group also hired numerous employees who used to be employees of Pointbreak, and moved into the office space previously utilized by Pointbreak. (ECF No. 229, SUMF, at \u00b6 28). A Modern Spotlight Group sales agent even stated that Pointbreak and Modern Spotlight Group had \"merged companies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29). Further, Modern Spotlight Group, Pointbreak and Modern Source used substantially similar consumer contracts and welcome emails. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In early February 2018, Defendant Perfect Image took over the employees and customers that used to belong to Modern Spotlight Group. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30). Perfect Image sold its customers' information to Modern Source until March 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At or about that time, Defendant National Business Listings began selling claiming and verification services using the same script as Pointbreak and the same office space that Pointbreak and Modern Source occupied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    6.\n    <em>\n     Pillonato's Role\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Pillonato was an owner and manager of Pointbreak, Modern Source, National Business Listings and DCP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1). He was the sole signatory on the bank accounts for Modern Source and DCP, and was a signatory on Pointbreak's bank accounts along with Ramsey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3). Pillonato was also the sole signatory on Modern Source's credit card merchant account and opened DCP's merchant account with the \"Point Break\" alias. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1). He signed contracts with service providers and vendors on behalf of Pointbreak and Modern Source. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Pillonato, along with Ramsey, ran Pointbreak on a day-to-day basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2). He maintained the \"customer relationship database and train[ed] agents on upsell activities,\" handled \"[p]roduct fulfillment\" and provided telephone numbers to sales agents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Pillonato actively monitored Pointbreak's sales agents, and was involved in drafting Pointbreak's telemarketing sales scripts. (ECF Nos. 229-110 at \u00b6 13; 229-105 at 17-18; 229-52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Pillonato knew of the large volume of robocalls, and that Pointbreak's robocalls reached many non-businesses and phone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry. (ECF No. 229, SUMF, at \u00b6 8). Pillonato\n   also knew the content of Modern Spotlight's robocalls. (ECF No. 229-111 at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14). Pillonato admitted that clients who purchased Pointbreak's services \"saw 0 benefits\" and \"got 0 results\" and that \"only about half\" of the Citation Program charges \"are legit.\" (ECF Nos. 229-74 at 2; 229-80 at 2). Pillonato monitored and knew of consumers' negative reviews of Pointbreak, which included complaints that Pointbreak misrepresented its relationship with Google. (ECF No. 229, SUMF, at \u00b6 24). Pillonato also monitored Pointbreak's credit card chargeback rate, which he described as \"horrible,\" and knew about chargebacks that National Business Listings received.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 30). Pillonato further knew that Pointbreak deposited the unauthorized $ 100.00 checks into its bank accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    7.\n    <em>\n     Ramsey's Role\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Like Pillonato, Ramsey was an owner and manager of Pointbreak, Modern Source and National Business Listings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1). Ramsey was a signatory on Pointbreak's bank accounts and he opened Pointbreak's credit card merchant accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2). As noted, Ramsey and Pillonato ran Pointbreak on a day-to-day basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Ramsey trained and oversaw sales agents, and provided telephone numbers to \"push[ ] robocalls out to consumers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Ramsey knew of Pointbreak's telemarketing sales scripts and he managed Pointbreak's robocalls. (ECF No. 229-110 at \u00b6 16). He drafted Pointbreak's robocall scripts, (ECF No. 229, SUMF, at \u00b6 5), and was familiar with Modern Spotlight's and Modern Spotlight Group's robocall scripts. (ECF No. 229-111 at \u00b6\u00b6 13-15). Ramsey readily admitted that Modern Source was economically dependent upon Modern Spotlight Group, complaining that he does not like \"all our lively hoods [sic] being with pocker [an owner and manager of Modern Spotlight Group]...[because] [r]ight now we have 0 back up its pocker and pocker only.\" (ECF No. 229-59 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Ramsey knew of Pointbreak's large volume of robocalls, and that many of those calls were to non-businesses and telephone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry. (ECF No. 229, SUMF, at \u00b6 8). He monitored negative reviews that consumers made about Pointbreak, which included complaints of fraud, and knew that many of the Citation Program charges were not legitimate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 24). Ramsey also endorsed all 280 unauthorized $ 100.00 checks, and knew that they were deposited into Pointbreak's bank accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    8.\n    <em>\n     Prior Court Orders\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Pillonato and Ramsey have previously been enjoined from engaging in telemarketing fraud. In 2015, the Circuit Court in and for Palm Beach County, Florida entered a permanent injunction that prohibited Pillonato from, among other things, \"using any false or misleading statement to induce any person to pay for goods and services.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36;\n   <em>\n    Office of the Attorney General, Dep't of Legal Affairs, State of Fla. v.

Similarly, in April 2017, another division of this Court entered a permanent injunction prohibiting Ramsey from, among other things, (i) initiating or assisting others in initiating outbound telephone calls to any telephone number on the National Do Not Call Registry, (ii) initiating or assisting others in initiating outbound telephone calls to non-businesses that deliver a prerecorded message (i.e., robocalls), and (iii) violating the\n   Telemarketing Sales Rule.

This is an unfair billing practice punishable under Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. Pillonato and Ramsey make no argument to the contrary, and do not dispute their personal liability for Pointbreak's unfair billing practice. The FTC's evidence supports Pillonato's and Ramsey's concession. As already discussed, both had authority to control Pointbreak. Both also directly participated in and knew about Pointbreak's unfair billing practice, as Ramsey endorsed all the unauthorized $ 100 checks with Pillonato's knowledge and both knew that the unauthorized checks were deposited in Pointbreak's bank accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at pp. 1280-81.

Pillonato and Ramsey do not dispute that Pointbreak was a telemarketer and a seller within the meaning of the TSR. (ECF No. 234). They also do not dispute that Pointbreak, with their knowledge, initiated robocalls, including robocalls to telephone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Indeed, the evidence shows that over a seven-week period, Pointbreak made nearly 15 million telephone calls to telephone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at p. 1276. The evidence also shows that Pillonato and Ramsey provided the telephone numbers used for robocalls and by sales agents, that they were aware of the high volume of robocalls and that many telephone calls reached non-business and telephone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at pp. 1279-80. Based upon the foregoing, Pillonato\n   and Ramsey are individually liable for violation of the TSR and, thus, Section 5(a) of the FTC Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The only argument that Pillonato and Ramsey make in opposition is that Pointbreak's calls are exempted from the TSR under the business-to-business exception. The TSR exempts \"[t]elephone calls between a telemarketer and any business to induce the purchase of goods or services....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20310.6\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7). Pillonato and Ramsey assert that \"[i]f a non-business received calls such numbers were called in error likely due to the reassignment from a business line to a non-business line.\" (ECF No. 234 at 6). They offer no evidence to support their assumption. \"[U]nsupported speculation ... does not meet a party's burden of producing some defense to a summary judgment motion. Speculation does not create a\n   <em>\n    genuine\n   </em>\n   issue of fact; instead, it creates a false issue, the demolition of which is a primary goal of summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Cordoba v.

Notably, another district court squarely rejected the argument Pillonato and Ramsey make here. In\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v.

Pillonato and Ramsey do not dispute the FTC's calculation, and it is their burden to do so. (ECF No. 234 at \u00b6 6). In fact, they offer no objection to entry of a money judgment. The Court has carefully reviewed the FTC's calculation and finds that it represents a reasonable approximation of the Pointbreak Defendants' net revenues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The FTC asks the Court to hold Pillonato and Ramsey jointly and severally liable. (ECF No. 228 at 24, 241-1 at 7). This record, that Pillonato and Ramsey were jointly responsible for the acts of the common enterprise, supports their joint and several liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at pp. 1284-86;\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v.

The Court finds that the FTC is entitled to a monetary judgment against Pillonato and Ramsey, jointly and severally, in the amount of $ 3,367,66.30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The FTC argues that Pillonato and Ramsey are likely to continue to violate the FTC Act and TSR, and it therefore requests entry of a permanent injunction to protect consumers going forward. (ECF No. 228 at 24-25). A permanent injunction is permissible even if a defendant has ceased his unlawful conduct if \"the defendant's past conduct indicates that there is a reasonable likelihood of further violations in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v.

App'x. 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 975 (11th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). In determining whether a defendant is likely to commit future violations, courts consider the following factors: \"the egregiousness of the defendant's actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of the infraction, the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the defendant's assurances against future violations, the defendant's recognition of the wrongful nature of his conduct, and the likelihood that the defendant's occupation will present opportunities for future violations....\"\n   <em>\n    Lanier Law, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177536\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/194/1238/#p1274\">\n    194 F.Supp.3d at 1288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). The application of these factors to this record support entry of a permanent injunction, as necessary to protect the public and prevent future violations. Significantly, Ramsey and Pillonato engaged in these unlawful practices when they were subject to permanent injunctions that prohibited this very same misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at p. 1280.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The FTC submitted a proposed permanent injunction with its Motion for Summary Judgment and Reply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF Nos. 228-1, 241-1). The proposed injunction includes \"fencing-in\" provisions. \"[C]ourts may impose 'fencing-in' provisions, which extend beyond the specific violations at issue, to prevent defendants from engaging in similar deceptive practices in the\n   future, so long as they bear a reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found to exist.\"\n   <em>\n    Lanier Law, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177536\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/194/1238/#p1274\">\n    194 F.Supp.3d at 1288-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks and citations omitted). The FTC does not identify which provisions in its proposed permanent injunction are \"fencing-in\" provisions. However, the Court has carefully reviewed the proposed permanent injunction and notes that several provisions address conduct beyond the wrongdoing for which the Court is holding Pillonato and Ramsey liable. (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 241-1 at IV (Prohibition Against Misrepresentations), VIII (Compliance Reporting), IX (Recordkeeping) ). The Court finds that the provisions in the proposed permanent injunction reasonably relate to the unlawful practices Pillonato and Ramsey engaged in and, thus, are appropriate \"fencing-in\" relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Pillonato and Ramsey do not object to any provision in the proposed permanent injunction except for the provision requiring them to transfer possession, custody and control to the Receiver of 53 items of jewelry. (ECF No. 234 at \u00b6 6). Pillonato and Ramsey assert, without any supporting evidence, that they do not have possession of that jewelry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The FTC has submitted evidence of Ramsey's purchase of all 53 items of jewelry. (ECF No. 241-3). Ramsey does not deny this in his opposition. To defeat summary judgment, the non-moving party must submit\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   from which a reasonable jury can find in his favor. Pillonato and Ramsey have not done this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, entry of a permanent injunction and money judgment in the amount of $ 3,367,666.30 against Ramsey and Pillonato, jointly and severally, is warranted.
