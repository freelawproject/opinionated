Defendant filed a Response in Opposition (Doc. # 27) and an Affidavit of David Gee in Support (Doc. # 28) on February 13, 2019. Also before the court is the Joint Stipulation For Order of Dismissal With Prejudice (Doc. # 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff seeks costs and attorney fees pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2057.041\">\n    Fla.

Stat. \u00a7 626.9373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While defendant Scottsdale Insurance Company (defendant or Scottsdale) obtained jurisdiction in this Court by asserting plaintiff would be entitled to reasonable attorney fees if she prevailed (Doc. # 1, \u00b6 7), it now asserts that plaintiff is entitled to no attorney fees or costs. Alternatively, Scottsdale asserts plaintiff is entitled\n   only to fees for a portion of the litigation. For the reasons set forth below, the motion for attorney fees and costs is granted as to entitlement, and granted in part and denied in part as to the amount of attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The record in this case establishes the following chronology: On October 9, 2016, plaintiff's residence suffered damage to its roof and interior due to heavy wind and/or rain in a storm. Plaintiff filed a claim under her insurance policy with Nationwide Insurance Company, which was underwritten by Scottsdale, a surplus lines insurer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Scottsdale first received notice of plaintiff's claim on November 2, 2016. (Doc. # 28, \u00b6 5.) By letter dated November 28, 2016, Scottsdale notified plaintiff that a portion of the claimed damage was not covered by its policy, and that an independent adjuster had inspected the damages and determined that the \"roof leaked due to wear and tear, deterioration, and inadequate maintenance, which are excluded causes of loss.\" After deducting the $ 1,000 deductible and non-recoverable depreciation, Scottsdale issued a $ 7,218.69 check to plaintiff under separate cover. (Doc. # 28-3, p. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff disputed Scottsdale's determination of the claim, and therefore Scottsdale continued to investigate the claim, including hiring an engineering firm. On March 28, 2017 Scottsdale made an additional payment to plaintiff in the amount of $ 6,564.01. On May 10, 2017, Scottsdale made another supplemental payment to plaintiff in the amount of $ 1,407.24 (Doc. # 28-5.) Plaintiff continued to dispute the sufficiency of these amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 17, 2017, an attorney faxed a letter to Scottsdale notifying it of his representation of plaintiff. (Doc. # 28-6.) On May 19, 2017, plaintiff's attorney sent a letter to Scottsdale noting, among other things, that \"there is obviously a disagreement between the parties\" as to three specifically identified matters. Plaintiff's attorney requested that Scottsdale \"reevaluate its inadequate initial payment\" and \"make payment within the next 14 days\". (Doc. # 28-7.) Counsel included an estimate of damages in the amount of $ 60,161.49 from CNI Concepts Enterprises Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By a reply letter dated June 6, 2017, Scottsdale rejected counsel's estimate, but noted that another $ 5,115.20 supplemental payment was issued. (Doc. # 28-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 9, 2017, plaintiff's attorney sent a letter to Scottsdale noting plaintiff's continued disagreement and again requesting reevaluation and payment of more money within fourteen days. Because of an address error, Scottsdale asserts it did not receive this letter until June 17, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 27, 2017, plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Scottsdale in state court for breach of the insurance policy. (Doc. # 1-1, p. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   By letter dated July 11, 2017, Scottsdale advised plaintiff that \"no additional payment is due.\" Scottsdale also invoked the appraisal clause of the insurance Policy and appointed Brian Wasserman of Worley as its appraiser. (Doc. # 28-1, Exh. A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 17, 2017, plaintiff's attorney sent the Complaint and Summons to the Chief Financial Officer of the State of Florida, who then electronically delivered a copy to defendant on July 21, 2017. (Doc. # 1-1, p. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 18, 2017, defendant removed the case to federal court based upon diversity of citizenship (Doc. # 1) and filed a Motion to Compel Appraisal and Abate All Proceedings Pending Completion of Appraisal, or, in the Alternative, to Dismiss or Require a More Definite Statement\n   (Doc. # 3.) On August 30, 2017, the parties filed a Joint Motion to Abate All Proceedings Pending Completion of Appraisal (Doc. # 7), which was granted and the case was stayed (Doc. # 8.) The appraisal process did not go smoothly, and required court intervention. (Docs. ## 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 4, 2018, a $ 94,083.58 appraisal award was drafted and signed by defendant's appraiser and a neutral umpire. (Doc. # 26-3.) On December 26, 2018, Scottsdale sent checks for the full amount of the appraisal award, offset by the prior payments, to plaintiff's counsel. (Doc. # 24, \u00b6 4.) The parties notified the Court on January 7, 2019, that the appraisal process was complete and they were exploring the possibility of settling remaining issues, including attorney fees. (Doc. # 24, \u00b6 5.) The Court directed the parties to file a stipulation for dismissal and agreed that unresolved issues regarding attorney fees would be addressed after dismissal. (Doc. # 25.) On February 18, 2019, the parties filed a Joint Stipulation for Order of Dismissal With Prejudice (Doc. # 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Here, plaintiff has obtained the functional equivalent of a judgment by virtue of the\n   appraisal award, and will have an order pursuant to the Joint Stipulation (Doc. # 29), which effectively approves the appraisal award in favor of plaintiff and against Scottsdale. The amount of the appraisal is greatly in excess of the amount otherwise paid by Scottsdale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Scottsdale argues, however, that plaintiff is not entitled to any attorney fees under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.9373\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.9373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) because she did not serve her Complaint, which was filed before Scottsdale invoked the appraisal procedure, until after the invocation of the appraisal process. The service of the complaint after invocation of the appraisal process, Scottsdale argues, establishes that plaintiff unnecessarily filed the suit, and therefore is not entitled to any attorney fees. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Florida case law establishes that service of process is not the proper focal point, rather it is the filing of a complaint. In any event, under Florida law attorney fees may be appropriate even when appraisal is invoked prior to the filing of a complaint.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Florida's cases have uniformly held that a section 627.428 attorney's fee award may be appropriate where, following some dispute as to the amount owed by the insurer, the insured files suit and,\n   <em>\n    thereafter\n   </em>\n   , the insurer invokes its right to an appraisal and, as a consequence of the appraisal, the insured recovers substantial additional sums.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Goff v.

The decisions in these cases plainly indicate that whether suit is filed before or after the invocation of the appraisal process is not determinative of the insured's right to fees; rather, the right to fees turns upon whether the filing of the suit served a legitimate purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

The Court finds that plaintiff's lawsuit was necessarily filed for the valid purpose of resolving a legitimate dispute, and not for the purpose of generating and seeking attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   While Scottsdale argues that plaintiff should have not served the Complaint after its invocation of the policy appraisal right, the Court is not persuaded. None of the state cases mentioned in\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   focus on service of process, but upon filing of a complaint. Additionally, a party has no right to file a case and simply sit on it without serving process. Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.070(j) (if no service within 120 days court must take action to dismiss case or effect\n   service); Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) (generally, court \"must\" dismiss complaint which is not served within 90 days). Accordingly, the Court finds that plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Scottsdale argues in the alternative that plaintiff is not entitled to attorney fees for pre-litigation work by plaintiff's attorney, nor for attorney fees incurred after September 6, 2017, when the appraisal was invoked. Scottsdale argues that the Policy requires each party to bear their own expenses for the appraisal and umpire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As to the pre-litigation hours, the Court finds that the hours should not be excluded, and that plaintiff is entitled to the fees. As of November 28, 2016, Scottsdale rejected portions of plaintiff's claim and paid plaintiff only a nominal amount. Plaintiff disputed the payment, and had an initial meeting with counsel on December 14, 2016. After reviewing the claim file, counsel initiated contact with an expert around February 16, 2017, to conduct an inspection, which initial report was not received and reviewed until May 9, 2017. (Doc. # 26-6, pp. 8-9.) Scottsdale did not make a second payment until March 28, 2017, which was another small payment, and a third small payment on May 10, 2017. It was after this payment that counsel sent a letter of demand to Scottsdale. The Court finds that the pre-litigation actions were necessary and part of the process to get to a stage for appraisal and the final award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As to the post-appraisal hours, the Court finds that these hours should also be allowed. Although the Court stayed the case pending appraisal on September 6, 2017, immediately thereafter Scottsdale sought to reopen the case to establish certain deadlines to complete the appraisal process, and the parties disputed the issue of attorney's fees. As the Court's intervention was required after September 6, 2017, the request to exclude these hours is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Policy does provide for each party to pay its own appraiser and to bear the \"other expenses\" equally, Doc. # 28-2, p. 35, but the term \"expenses\" does not encompass attorney fees. Plaintiff is entitled to \"attorney's fees associated with an expensive and drawn out appraisal,\"\n   <em>\n    Travelers Indem. Ins. Co. v.

Plaintiff seeks $ 14,439.00 in attorney fees based on the Affidavit of Plaintiff's Counsel, Kenneth R. Duboff, Esq. Regarding Amount of Attorney[']s\n   Fees and Costs. (Doc. # 26-6, Exh. F.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Hourly Rate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff seeks a rate of $ 600 per hour for Kenneth R. Duboff, who was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1976; $ 500 per hour for Joshua A. Blacksten, who was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1999; $ 500 per hour for Nicole S. Duboff, who was admitted to the Florida Bar in 2003; $ 300 an hour for Gabriela Perez-Dumois, who was admitted to the Florida Bar in 2015; $ 300 an hour for Gabriel Perez, who was admitted to the Florida Bar in 2016; $ 250 an hour for Marian Rivera, who was admitted to the Florida Bar in 2017, and $ 400 an hour for Alexander M. Navarro, who was admitted to the Florida Bar in 2014. (Doc. # 26-6, Exh. F, \u00b6\u00b6 4b.) Counsel refers to Miami-Dade County, Florida as to the customary hourly rates charged, however the prevailing market is the Fort Myers Division of the Middle District of Florida.\n   <em>\n    Olesen-Frayne v.

Sept. 21, 2009). The rates in Fort Myers are significantly lower than Miami. Therefore the hourly rates will be reduced as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-42\"><strong>Requested Rate</strong> <strong>Reduced Rate</strong> Kenneth R. Duboff (KRD) $600 $400 Joshua A. Blacksten (JAB) $500 $350 Nicole S. Duboff (NSD) $500 $300 Gabriela Perez-Dumois $300 $250 (GPD) Gabriel Perez (GP) $300 $200 Marian Rivera (MR) $250 $200 Alexander M.

Number of Hours\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court has reviewed the number of hours expended by each attorney and finds that the hours are reasonable with a few exceptions. As a preliminary matter, all requested hours for AF will be eliminated as the individual was not identified by name or experience and AF is not listed in the billing records as one of the of the attorneys of record. On those occasions that Mr. Duboff charged $ 500 instead of the customary $ 600, the rate was still reduced to $ 400 an hour. The entry on October 23, 2018, at 4:27 PM (0.3 hours) fails to identify an attorney with the task and time and therefore will be eliminated. The 0.3 hours for e-filing the lawsuit and 0.5 hours for opening a new file and importing documents will be eliminated as clerical or administrative tasks. The Court will otherwise allow the requested hours at the reduced hourly rates for a total of $ 9,747.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
