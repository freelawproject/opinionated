FRANK, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   This matter is before the Court upon Respondents Kirstjen Nielsen, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Jefferson B. Sessions, United States Attorney General, and Peter Berg, Acting ICE Field Office Director's (\"Respondents\") objections (Doc. No. 12) to Magistrate Judge David T. Schultz's March 23, 2018 Report and Recommendation (Doc. No. 11) insofar as it recommends that: (1) on or before April 20, 2018, ICE shall hold a bond hearing or release Petitioner Awil Mohamed (\"Petitioner\") from custody on such terms and conditions as it deems necessary to protect the community and ensure Petitioner's appearance; and (2) in the event ICE does not conduct a bond hearing on or before April 20, 2018, that a Writ of Habeas Corpus issue immediately compelling Petitioner's unconditional release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The factual background for the above-entitled matter is clearly and precisely set forth in the Report and Recommendation and is incorporated by reference for purposes of Respondents' objections. In short, this case involves Petitioner's petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus seeking release from custody pending removal. In the Report and Recommendation, the Magistrate Judge concluded that Petitioner, having been detained for over 15 months at the time of the Report and Recommendation\n   and not currently being subject to an actionable final removal order, was entitled to a bond hearing to determine whether his release would pose a risk of flight or danger to the community. In reaching this conclusion, the Magistrate Judge carefully analyzed the state of the law on pre-removal detention pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Respondents object to the Report and Recommendation, arguing that Petitioner's pre-removal detention is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Court has conducted a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the record, including a review of the arguments and submissions of counsel, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) and Local Rule 72.2(b). After this review, the Court finds no reason that would warrant a departure from the Magistrate Judge's recommendations. The Court finds that Petitioner's continued detention has been so prolonged as to require a bond hearing to determine whether his release would pose a risk of flight or danger to the community. The Court also grants Respondents' request for thirty days to implement the Court's order. Therefore, based upon the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the record and all of the arguments and submissions of the parties and the Court being otherwise duly advised in the premises, the Court hereby enters the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   1.

Mohamed asserts that his continued detention is unreasonable and violates his due process rights. He therefore seeks a Writ of Habeas Corpus securing his immediate release. This Court recommends the Petition be granted as outlined below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Mohamed's Criminal Convictions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mohamed is a native and citizen of Somalia who entered the United States on\n   July 5, 2001 as a refugee. Notice to Appear 4, Docket No. 5 Ex. 5. Mohamed has multiple criminal convictions in the United States, including providing a peace officer a false name/birthdate/ID in 2006, fifth degree assault in 2008, and third degree sale of cocaine in 2013 and 2014. Ligon Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-9, Docket No. 5 Ex. 1. Following the 2014 conviction, Mohamed was sentenced to two concurrent sentences of 52 months in prison. Ligon Decl.

Ligon Decl. \u00b6 10, Docket No. 5 Ex. 1. In order to effectuate his removal, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") arrested Mohamed on December 5, 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    \u00b6 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The immigration judge (\"IJ\") who heard the matter determined that repatriating Mohamed to Somalia would violate Article III of the Convention Against Torture because, as a Somali tribal minority, he was likely to be tortured upon his return to Somalia.

Therefore, on January 30, 2017, the IJ deferred Mohamed's removal to Somalia but ordered him removed to any other country that would accept him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On February 17, 2017, The Government appealed the IJ's decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\").

On August 21, 2017, the IJ reconsidered Mohamed's removability and again concluded repatriation to Somalia would violate the Convention Against Torture, but that Mohamed could otherwise be removed elsewhere. Ligon Decl. \u00b6 15, Docket No. 5 Ex. 6. On September 6, 2017, the Government again appealed to the BIA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    \u00b6 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On January 26, 2018, the BIA vacated the IJ's decision because Mohamed had not borne his burden to show that he would likely be tortured upon his return to Somalia because of his minority tribal status.

Thus, Mohamed's petition must rise or fall based on what this court can glean from\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   , and on its best judgment of the constitutional issue raised by Mohamed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that the mandatory detention provision of \u00a7 1226(c) was not on its face unconstitutional because the period of detention was (1) not \"indefinite\" (it terminated upon conclusion of the removal proceedings); (2) was relatively brief (it could be expected to last no more than five months, typically); and (3) served the government's legitimate purposes of securing the alien's presence during the removal process and preventing the alien form committing further crime. Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court distinguished\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   because the statutory provision at issue in that case involved an indefinite period of detention that was potentially permanent. The cases applying\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   have focused on the critical assumption that detention under \u00a7 1226(c) would typically be brief to find that prolonged detention-whether or not indefinite-was unconstitutional. In this case, it is undisputed Mohamed's detention is now over 15 months-far longer than the presumed \"limited period necessary for his removal proceedings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because the majority opinion in\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   does not directly consider whether due process prohibits such lengthy detention under \u00a7 1226(c), and because the post-\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   decisions have also avoided directly addressing this Constitutional question, this Court begins its analysis with Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Demore.\n   </em>\n   In his concurrence Justice Kennedy noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   ...the Due Process Clause prohibits arbitrary deprivations of liberty, a lawful permanent resident could be entitled to an individualized determination as to his risk of flight and dangerousness if the continued detention became unreasonable or unjustified....Were there to be an unreasonable delay by the INS in pursuing and completing the deportation proceedings, it could become necessary to inquire whether the detention is not to facilitate deportation, or to protect against the risk of flight or dangerousness, but to incarcerate for other reasons. This is not a proper inference, however, either from the statutory scheme itself or from the circumstances of this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/#p527\">\n    538 U.S. at 532-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/#p527\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Thus, under Justice Kennedy's analysis, an unreasonable delay in completing the removal process may, in individual \u00a7 1226(c) cases, trigger the right to an individualized determination of the detainee's risk of flight and/or dangerousness (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a bond hearing). Though the statute serves a valid Constitutional purpose, its\n   facial validity stems not only from the purpose it serves, but from the assumption that it will typically serve that purpose expeditiously. If the process is unreasonably delayed, it could be necessary to inquire whether continued detention is in fact serving the valid purpose of protecting against the risk of flight or dangerousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This Court is aware that Justice Kennedy's opinion did not command a majority of the Supreme Court. Though merely a concurrence, however, Justice Kennedy's opinion is consonant with the majority opinion (which found the statute constitutional, in part, because detention would be brief). So, too, though the post-\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   cases were based upon an improper application of the canon of constitutional avoidance, they nonetheless identified that unreasonably prolonged detention under \u00a7 1226(c) could violate the detainee's due process rights. Finally, though\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   concerned a different detention provision that raised concerns unique to that statute, that decision also recognized that an unreasonably prolonged period of detention can violate due process. Aware there is no controlling precedent on the issues presented here, this Court proceeds with caution. In light of the above, this Court concludes that unreasonably prolonged detention under \u00a7 1226(c) without an individualized determination of flight risk or danger to the community potentially violates a detainee's right to due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The question thus becomes whether Mohamed's detention has become unreasonable so as to require a bond hearing. This Court recently applied a fact-based individualized standard to determine the constitutionality of an alien's continued pre-removal detention.\n   <em>\n    Wilson Nduri Tindi, Petitioner, v. Sec'y, Dep't of Homeland Security; Jefferson Sessions, Attorney General; Scott Baniecke, ICE Field Office Director\n   </em>\n   ; &amp;\n   <em>\n    Kurt Freitag, Freeborn Cty.

Minn. Feb. 5, 2018). Adopting this approach here leads the Court to conclude that Mohamed's continued detention has been so prolonged as to require a bond hearing to determine whether his release would pose a risk of flight or danger to the community. Courts have been clear that as the period of detention grows longer, the heavier is the government burden to justify continued detention.\n   <em>\n    Davies\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204277145\">\n    2017 WL 4277145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reid v.
