CLELAND, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a Social Security appeal stemming from the denial of disability benefits. The case was referred to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation (ECF No. 3.) Both Plaintiff and Defendant filed motions for summary judgment. (ECF No. 12, 14.) The magistrate judge considered these motions and issued a Report and Recommendation (\"R &amp; R\") that recommends granting Plaintiff's motion and remanding the case for\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   consideration. (ECF No. 20.) Defendant timely filed two objections to the R &amp; R. (ECF No. 21.) After reviewing the R &amp; R and the parties' filings, the court concludes that a hearing is unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(f)(2). For the reasons stated below, the court will overrule the R &amp; R, grant Defendant's objections, and grant Defendant's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In recognition of this precedent, the magistrate judge does not suggest that Appointments Clause challenges are categorically exempted from forfeiture principles but recommends nonetheless that normal rules governing waiver and forfeiture ought not apply to Social Security cases.

(ECF No. 20, PageID 1419.) The court cannot agree. The ALJ considered Dr. Henry's opinion as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Johnathan Henry, M.D., opined that the claimant had marked and moderate limitations, and that his impairments would cause him to be absent from work three days a month (23F). This opinion is inconsistent with the claiming's activities of daily living and clinical observations. The claimant testified that he plays Scrabble up to three times a month, reads books, and pays video games. These activities require the claimant to display a fair degree of concentration, a fact that the claimant acknowledged during his testimony.... I only accord this opinion partial weight, as it is generally inconsistent with the objective medical record and the claimant's reported activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (ECF No. 8-2, PageID 27-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The ALJ also considered treatment records that demonstrated Plaintiff's ability to live independently, complete tasks of daily living, and engage in social activities in addition to Plaintiff's \"unremarkable\" mental evaluations and \"relatively static and conservative\" course of treatment. (ECF. No. 8-2, PageID 69.) The court finds that the ALJ's opinion, read as a whole, provides a sufficient explanation and good reasons for partially discounting the inconsistent opinion of Dr. Henry. Substantial evidence supports the ALJ's finding of no disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The magistrate judge details evidence related to Plaintiff's mental health issues and contends that the normal results outlined in the ALJ's report \"do not contradict the overwhelming evidence\" of Plaintiff's mental health impairments. (ECF No. 20, PageID 1418.) However, the fact that some evidence suggests impairment does not invite the court to reweigh the evidence and reach its own conclusion. In fact, the ALJ's decision \"cannot be overturned if substantial evidence, or even a preponderance of the evidence supports the claimant's position, so long as substantial evidence also supports the conclusion reached by the ALJ.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Thus, an ability to cite evidence in support of Dr. Henry's opinion is not relevant to the court's inquiry at this stage. Substantial evidence also supports the ALJ's opinion, so the court will not disturb that opinion. The court will grant Defendant's objection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
