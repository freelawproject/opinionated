Appellant spells her last name \"Keeven\u201d in her brief, a usage we adopt herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b454-21\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b454-22\">The district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sentenced Laura Keeven to 41 months imprisonment after she pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). A Missouri trial judge later sentenced Keeven to serve five years in prison for a weapon-flourishing offense arising from the same conduct as the \u00a7 922(g) charge. In this appeal, Keeven contends the district court failed to account for her state sentence in meting out federal punishment. She directs us to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b), which requires a district court to run a sentence concurrent to an as-yet \u201cundischarged term of imprisonment\u201d imposed in state or federal court. Keeven suggests the district court should have run her 41-month federal sentence concurrent to, rather than consecutive to, the five-year sentence imposed in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>We find two fatal flaws in Keeven\u2019s argument. First, \u00a7 5G1.3(b) did not apply because Keeven was not serving an \u201cundischarged term of imprisonment\u201d from the state court when the district court sentenced her. <em>United States v. Mun, </em>41 F.3d 409, 413 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cAt the time the federal court sentenced Mun he was not serving another sentence. The state sentence was imposed after the federal sentence. Therefore, \u00a7 5G1.3 did not require the district court to alter its sentence to make it run concurrently with the state sentence.\u201d); <em>accord United States v. Otto, </em>176 F.3d 416, 418 (8th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>23 F.3d 1317, 1319 &amp; n. 3 (8th Cir.1994). Second, we have held that \u201ca district court may impose a federal sentence to be served consecutively to a yet-to-be-imposed state sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Mayotte, </em>249 F.3d 797, 798-99 (8th Cir.2001) (per curiam); <em>see United States v. Robinson, </em>217 F.3d 560, 566 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b454-23\">.
