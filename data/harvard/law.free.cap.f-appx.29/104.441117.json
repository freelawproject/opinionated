Garner\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising the issue as to whether Garner\u2019s sentence violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because he was held accountable during sentencing for additional drug amounts neither charged in the indictment nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Garner has filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">Under <em>Apprendi, </em>any fact, other than a prior conviction, that increases the maximum penalty for a crime is an element of the offense, and as such, must be charged in the indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 530 U.S. at 490. This court, however, has held that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to a judge\u2019s exercise of sentencing discretion within a statutory range, so long as a defendant\u2019s sentence is not set beyond the maximum term specified in the substantive statute. <em>United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 201-02 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001); <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>235 F.3d 215, 219 (4th Cir.2000) (applying a plain error standard of review). Because Garner\u2019s sentence of 112 months is below the lowest possible statutory maximum of life imprisonment, the sentence is permissible under <em>Lewis </em>and <em>Kinter. </em>We therefore find no reversible error as to this claim. We further find Garner\u2019s claims in his pro se supplemental brief without merit. Accordingly, we affirm Garner\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and we find no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion should state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
