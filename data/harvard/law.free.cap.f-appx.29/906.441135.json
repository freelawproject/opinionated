The detailed plea bargain agreement contained a number of provisions relative to sentencing. It did not, however, cover the question of a possible downward departure on the basis of coercion and duress, which is the sole issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-15\">We do not gainsay that Ms. Parra makes a plaintive and sympathetic case for such a downward adjustment, as set forth even in the government\u2019s version of Parra\u2019s tale, set forth in the margin. On the other hand there are the following countervailing considerations: (1) Parra failed to report any of the offense conduct to anyone or seek help; (2) the Court had to consider her motivation for the offense $5,000; (3) she tried to evade being detected when she arrived in Newark; and (4) although she now submitted that the pellets were inserted into her, at the plea hearing she answered \u2018Yes\u201d when asked whether she \u201cingested\u201d the pellets. At all events, the Court explicitly recognized that it had the \u201cauthority to depart downwardly under Section 5K2.12, for coercion and duress.\u201d (A 48). The Court explained, however, that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-17\">deeline[d] to do so in this case, because in my view the defendant has not carried her burden, demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that she is entitled to such a departure in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-18\">(A48).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-19\">Our jurisprudence is clear that we lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to depart from the applicable guideline range where the court recognizes it has the authority to depart, but determines that a departure is not warranted. See, e.g., <em>United, States v. Georgiadis, </em>933 F.2d 1219, 1222 (3d Cir.1991) (\u201cIf we determine the district court was aware of its authority to depart from the Guidelines, and chose not to, we are without power to inquire further into the merits of its refusal to grant [defendant\u2019s] request.\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), which grants the defendant the right to appeal his or her sentence, \u201csimply does not authorize such an appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Denardi, </em>892 F.2d 269, 271-72 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-20\">Parra argues that the District Court misapplied the duress Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12. However, we find no indication that the District Court misapplied or failed to understand the duress Guideline. Rather, having developed an ample record and surveyed the situation, the District Court exercised its discretion not to depart. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>noted above, that decision is not reviewable on appeal. The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
