Nickerson, <em>Judge) </em>dismissing his complaint and imposing a filing injunction requiring Prince to obtain the court\u2019s permission before filing additional lawsuits pertaining to the defendants\u2019 care of his sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Prince\u2019s sister resided at the Shore View Nursing Home from 1990 until her death in 1998. In January 2000, Prince brought suit against Ernest Dicker, the owner of Shore View, as well as Shore View\u2019s business manager, administrator, and attorney. Prince claimed that the defendants illegally charged him for expenses related to his sister\u2019s care. His complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>violations of the Medicare/Medicaid anti-fraud provisions, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(d), and the Nursing Home Reform Amendments, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r. It also alleged that by engaging in a long-term scheme to double-bill patients and the government, the defendants operated a criminal enterprise in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The defendants moved to dismiss Prince\u2019s complaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(6) and 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court, finding Prince\u2019s complaint unintelligible and difficult to adjudicate, referred the matter to Magistrate Joan M. Azrack for a hearing. On March 26, 2001, Magistrate Azrack held a hearing at which she provided Prince with an opportunity to clarify the allegations in his complaint. Afterwards, she issued a written report concluding that it remained \u201cimpossible to make sense out of plaintiffs numerous assertions\u201d and that even with assistance from <em>pro se </em>staff and her chambers, Prince would be unable \u201cto present a legally sufficient complaint.\u201d Report and Recommendation at 2. She therefore recommended that the complaint be dismissed in its entirety. Because Prince had brought a similar complaint in 1998 \u201crequesting that a special counsel be appointed to investigate these same claims,\u201d the dismissal of which had been affirmed by this Circuit, she further recommended that Prince be required to obtain the permission of the district court before filing \u201cfurther lawsuits regarding the defendants\u2019 care of his sister.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The district court adopted Magistrate Azrack\u2019s report and recommendation in its entirety, granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and imposing a filing injunction on Prince requiring him to obtain the court\u2019s permission before filing \u201cadditional lawsuits regarding the defendants\u2019 care of his sister.\u201d J. at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">We review the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 8 for abuse of discretion, <em>Kittay v. Kornstein, </em>230 F.3d 531, 541 (2d Cir.2000), and dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) <em>de novo, id. </em>at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">We discern some potentially cognizable claims in Prince\u2019s complaint, but we nonetheless affirm under Rule 12(b)(6) because the allegations fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. First, Prince cannot invoke the Medicare/Medicaid anti-fraud provisions in a civil complaint because these are criminal provisions. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(d). Second, the Nursing Home Reform Act\u2019s provisions do not confer a right of action on Prince that can be enforced against a private nursing home such as Shore View. <em>See Brogdon ex rel. Cline v. Nat\u2019l Healthcare Corp., </em>103 F.Supp.2d 1322, 1330-32 (N.D.Ga.2000). Finally, Prince\u2019s putative civil RICO action is barred by the statute of limitations. The limitations period for a civil RICO action is four years. <em>Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff &amp; </em>Assoc., <em>Inc., </em>483 U.S. 143, 156, 107 S.Ct. 2759, 97 L.Ed.2d 121 (1987). Prince\u2019s cause of ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>tion accrued in 1991 at the latest because a civil RICO cause of action accrues when a defendant commits an act that injures the plaintiff, not when the plaintiff has both suffered an injury and discovered the pattern of alleged RICO activity. <em>See Rotella v. Wood, </em>528 U.S. 549, 120 S.Ct. 1075, 145 L.Ed.2d 1047 (2000). Prince did not bring this action until 1998, several years after the four-year statutory period expired. His civil RICO claim is therefore time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">We find the remaining claims raised in Prince\u2019s complaint too vague and unintelligible to meet the standards of Rule 8. <em>See Kittay, </em>230 F.3d at 541 (\u201c[Ujnder [Rule 8\u2019s] liberal pleading standards, a plaintiff must disclose sufficient information to permit the defendant to have a fair understanding of what the plaintiff is complaining about and to know whether there is a legal basis for recovery.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Prince\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">We reverse the district court\u2019s imposition of a filing injunction, however, because of \u201c[t]he unequivocal rule in this circuit ... that the district court may not impose a fifing injunction on a litigant <em>sua sponte </em>without providing the litigant with notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Moates v. Barkley, </em>147 F.3d 207, 208 (2d Cir.1998) <em>(per </em>curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Our review of the record on appeal, which includes letters Prince submitted to the district court after Magistrate Azrack issued her report. and recommendation, suggests that the district court did not give Prince adequate notice of the proposed fifing injunction. It also suggests that Prince may not have understood that his only opportunity to object to the injunction would be within the ten-day period following his receipt of Magistrate Azrack\u2019s report and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">We recognize the district court\u2019s authority and \u201cobligation to protect the public and the efficient administration of justice from individuals who have a history of litigation entailing vexation, harassment and needless expense to other parties and an unnecessary burden on the courts and their supporting personnel.\u201d <em>Lau v. Meddaugh, </em>229 F.3d 121, 123 (2d Cir.2000) (internal punctuation, alterations, and citations omitted). But a fifing inunction \u201cmay not issue without notice to the party enjoined and an opportunity for that party to be heard.\u201d <em>MLE Realty </em>Assocs. <em>v. Handler, </em>192 F.3d 259, 261 (2d Cir.1999). That opportunity is meaningless \u201c \u2018if the party is not given adequate time to prepare his response.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lau, </em>229 F.3d at 123 (quoting <em>Schlesinger Inv. Partnership v. Fluor Corp., </em>671 F.2d 739, 742 (2d Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">We cannot conclude on the record before us that the district court provided Prince with notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before enjoining him from fifing additional lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court dismissing Prince\u2019s complaint in its entirety is hereby AFFIRMED, but the court\u2019s imposition of the fifing injunction is REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
