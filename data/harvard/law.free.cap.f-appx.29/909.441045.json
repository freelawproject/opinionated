We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Following his sentencing, defendant filed a notice of appeal. His court-appointed attorney subsequently filed an Anders brief, stating there were no non-frivolous issues for appeal. <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Thereafter, however, defense counsel filed an amended brief stating there was a non-frivolous issue for appeal; namely, the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Defendant argues this section is outside of Congress\u2019s power to regulate interstate commerce and all other sources of congressional authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">Subsequent to the filing of defendant\u2019s supplemental brief, this court decided <em>United States v. Singletary, </em>268 F.3d 196 (3d Cir.2001), in which we upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) against the same argument as that advanced by defendant. Therefore, defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">None of the issues proffered by counsel for the defendant in his Anders brief are meritorious. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
