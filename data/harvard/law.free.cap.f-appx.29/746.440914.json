McAvoy, <em>Judge, </em>dismissing his petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 seeking a discretionary waiver of deportation pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1994). We affirm substantially for the reasons stated in Judge McAvoy\u2019s Decision and Order dated March 28, 2001, granting reconsideration of its prior order of dismissal and entering a new order of dismissal. Discretionary relief from deportation is not available to an alien who, like petitioner, has been tried for and convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and has served for such felony or felonies a term of imprisonment of at least five years. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (as amended in 1990). This 1990 provision applies retroactively. <em>See, e.g., Giusto v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 8 (2d Cir.1993) (per curiam); <em>Buitrago-Cuesta v. INS, </em>7 F.3d 291, 294-95 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-25\">We have considered all of petitioner\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found in them no basis for reversal. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
