Kram, Judge) convicting her, after a jury trial, of one count of bank larceny in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b) and one count of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Between February 1998 and October 1999, several member states of the United Nations mistakenly wired funds totaling more than $700,000 to Madakor\u2019s account at Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. (\u201cChase\u201d). The intended recipient of these funds was the U.N. Environmental Program (\u201cUNEP\u201d), which also maintains an account at Chase, to which it instructed the U.N. member states to wire their annual contributions. The account numbers of UNEP and Madakor differed by one digit. Because of an oft-repeated error, thirteen separate wire transfers intended for UNEP were credited to Madakor\u2019s account. Each time, she received credit advices from Chase notifying her of the deposits.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">Madakor, a receptionist who earned approximately $23,500 per year, did not contact Chase in order to inquire into the source of this newfound wealth. She used the funds to pay off existing credit card debts, purchase a business, open an account for her son, and buy thousands of dollars worth of consumer goods. When a representative from Chase inquired about the unusual influx of funds, Madakor told him that she had inherited the money from her father and also saved it from her prior career as a model. She remarked to her boyfriend that she \u201chad saved up from modeling\u201d and also made the money \u201cin real estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">Chase discovered one of the mistaken deposits in the Summer of 1999. After Madakor refused to authorize Chase to debit her account for the amount of the mistaken credit, Chase investigated Madakor\u2019s account and realized the full extent and magnitude of the thirteen mistaken wire transfers. On November 3, 1999, Chase froze Madakor\u2019s accounts. In December 1999, Madakor responded by suing Chase in Supreme Court, New York County, seeking an order from the court directing Chase to release the funds. In support of her suit, she submitted an affidavit in which she swore that she believed she had won the funds in an \u201cInternational Lottery,\u201d which she allegedly had entered in 1997. On January 4, 2000, she repeated this claim during an interview on the television news program \u201cDateline/NBC,\u201d which aired a segment on her lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">The government indicted Madakor on April 7, 2000 for, <em>inter alia, </em>bank fraud and bank larceny. Following a jury verdict, the district court entered a judgment of conviction and sentenced her to twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">The defendant challenges her convictions on two grounds: (1) that the district court erred by failing to note that under New York law the funds \u201cmisdirected to the Madakor account\u201d became the \u201cfunds of Ms. Madakor,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 20, and a person cannot steal from herself; and (2) that the district court erred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>admitting into evidence Madakor\u2019s affidavit claiming that she won the funds in an \u201cInternational Lottery\u201d because as a matter of law the affidavit was not \u201cmaterial\u201d in the sense required to satisfy the \u201cmaterial false statement\u201d element of bank fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Because Madakor did not raise either of these challenges in her motion for acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, thereby waiving them, <em>see United States v. Dandy, </em>998 F.2d 1344, 1356-57 (6th Cir.1993) (noting that \u201cwhere a Rule 29 motion is made on specific grounds, all grounds not specified are waived\u201d), we now review these asserted grounds for acquittal under the \u201cplain error\u201d standard. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Gore, </em>154 F.3d 34, 43 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201cA \u2018plain\u2019 error is \u2018an error so egregious and obvious as to make the trial judge and prosecutor derelict in permitting it, despite the defendant\u2019s failure to object.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Tillem, </em>906 F.2d 814, 825 (2d Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Madakor\u2019s first argument fails because New York law clearly recognizes the \u201cmistake of fact\u201d doctrine, and \u201cmoney paid under a mistake of fact may be recovered back.\u201d <em>Banque Worms v. BankAmerica Int'l </em>77 N.Y.2d 362, 366-67, 570 N.E.2d 189, 191-92, 568 N.Y.S.2d 541, 543-44 (1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see Mfrs. Hanover Trust Co. v. Chem. Bank, </em>160 A.D.2d 113, 117, 559 N.Y.S.2d 704, 707 (1st Dep\u2019t 1990) (applying the mistake-of-fact doctrine to uphold recovery of funds mistakenly credited to the wrong account). The funds mistakenly credited to Madakor\u2019s account therefore did not become the \u201cfunds of Ms. Madakor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Madakor\u2019s second argument relies on <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999), in which the Supreme Court held that the \u201cmateriality\u201d of a false or fraudulent statement is an element of bank fraud, <em>id. </em>at 25, 119 S.Ct. 1827. She contends that the affidavit she submitted in the state-court litigation that she initiated was not material because a material misstatement must have \u201ca natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision of the decision-making body to which it [was] addressed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 16, 119 S.Ct. 1827 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Rodriguez, </em>140 F.3d 163, 168 (2d Cir.1998) (noting in the context of bank fraud that \u201c[a] misrepresentation is material if it is capable of influencing the bank\u2019s actions\u201d). Madakor argues that because Chase would be unlikely to unfreeze her accounts based on the state-court affidavit, this fraudulent statement was not \u201ccapable of influencing\u201d Chase\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">This argument likewise fails. As the Eleventh Circuit has noted, a false or fraudulent \u201cstatement need not have exerted actual influence, so long as it was <em>intended to do so and had the capacity to do so.\u201d United States v. Gregg, </em>179 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.1999) (emphasis added). Madakor plainly intended her affidavit to influence Chase\u2019s actions; she submitted it in the course of litigation she initiated in order to <em>force </em>Chase to unfreeze her accounts. While it may be true that Chase would be unlikely to unfreeze Madakor\u2019s accounts after discovering the error in this case, it does not follow that the affidavit lacked the \u201ccapacity\u201d to influence Chase\u2019s actions; it only implies that that capacity may have been low. The district court therefore did not err by admitting Madakor\u2019s affidavit for consideration by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
