Cote, <em>Judge, </em>convicting him of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute approximately 1,162 grams of substances containing heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A), and sentencing him principally to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release. On appeal, Sanchez argues that his conviction should be reversed because his plea of guilty lacked a factual basis as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f). Finding no merit in his contention, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The district court\u2019s determination that the record furnishes a factual basis sufficient to support a plea of guilty is reviewable only for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. DeJesus-Abad, </em>263 F.3d 5, 9 (2d Cir.2001) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>160 F.3d 117, 122 (2d Cir.1998). In the present case, Sanchez was arrested after having placed in his car a bag containing more than one kilogram of heroin and more than three kilograms of cocaine. He was charged with distribution and possession of heroin (count one) and distribution and possession of cocaine (count two). He entered into a plea agreement with the government stating that he would plead guilty to the heroin charge in count one. At his plea hearing, when the court asked Sanchez whether he knew the bag contained drugs, Sanchez\u2019s response was that the person who gave him the bag told him it contained cocaine and did not tell him it contained heroin. Although the court noted that that response spoke more directly to count two of the indictment than to count one, the Assistant United States Attorney urged the court to accept Sanchez\u2019s allocution as a plea of guilty to count one, stating that the government would establish at trial that one of the substances Sanchez had placed in his car was in fact heroin and that Sanchez plainly knew he was carrying controlled substances. The court asked whether defense counsel had any objection to the entry of a plea of guilty to count one, and each of Sanchez\u2019s attorneys answered in the negative. Defense counsel immediately conferred off-the-record with Sanchez, and following that conference there was no retreat from the defense agreement that there was no reason not to enter a plea of guilty to count one. Given Sanchez\u2019s arrest while in possession of heroin, the lack of any direct statement that he had no knowledge that he was carrying heroin (with Sanchez stating only, not entirely responsively to the court\u2019s question, that heroin was not mentioned by the person who gave him the bag), and his plea agreement that his offense involved heroin, we see no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s conclusion that there was a factual basis for Sanchez\u2019s plea of guilty to distribution and possession of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We note also that after entering that plea, Sanchez wrote a <em>pro se </em>letter to the district court complaining about, <em>inter alia, </em>the quantity of cocaine attributed to him in the presentence report, but acknowledging the foreseeability to him of the presence of heroin. <em>(See </em>letter from Sanchez to Judge Cote dated April 16, 2000, at 1 (\u201cI was told as I informed the court on January 31, 2000, that I was in possession of only three kilograms of cocaine there is no evidence I was foreseeable to <em>[sic] </em>any other \u2018drug quantity\u2019 <em>except for the heroin (approx. 1500 grams).\") </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">We have considered all of Sanchez\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
