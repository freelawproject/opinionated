Clemons\u2019 counsel filed a vigorous brief which states it was filed under the aegis of <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). He also filed a motion for leave to withdraw from representing Clemons, expressing counsel\u2019s belief that all of Clemons\u2019 grounds for appeal are frivolous. Clemons, who was notified by this court of the opportunity to file a pro se brief, failed to do so. Because counsel\u2019s brief did not explain why the arguments made are frivolous, this court asked counsel to explain further. Counsel then filed a reply brief, which states that the District Court neither erred nor abused its discretion as to the various issues raised in the principal brief. After reviewing the various briefs, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-24\">Clemons presents seven arguments. He first argues that the District Court erred in denying his motion to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>miss the indictment pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the indictment did not allege a specific weight of crack cocaine. In our recent en banc decision, <em>United States v. Vazquez, </em>271 F.3d 93 (3d Cir.2001), we held \u201cthat an Apprendi violation only occurs if the drug quantity is not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt and the defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 841 exceeds 20 years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98. Clemons\u2019 sentence under \u00a7 841 did not exceed twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Second, Clemons argues he should have been granted a new trial based on newly discovered evidence to the effect that he was searched without a warrant after he was arrested. Searches conducted incident to a lawful arrest of a suspect\u2019s person and the area of his immediate control do not violate the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., <em>Illinois v. Lafayette, </em>462 U.S. 640, 644, 103 S.Ct. 2605, 77 L.Ed.2d 65 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Third, Clemons argues the District Court erred in denying him a two level reduction in offense level for his acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a). Clemons points us to no testimony or action reflecting an acceptance of responsibility. Given the \u201c\u2018great deference on review\u2019 \u201d we accord to trial judges under \u00a7 3E1.1(a), this court discerns no error. See <em>United States v. Cohen, </em>171 F.3d 796, 804 (3d Cir.1999) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 application note 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Fourth, Clemons argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss every sentencing enhancement under Apprendi because no prior drug felony convictions were alleged in the indictment, and the government did not prove any prior felony drug convictions at trial. Where, as here, a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence does not exceed the prescribed statutory maximum, a court need not en-quire whether the enhanced sentence was based on the fact of a prior conviction. <em>United States v. Mack, </em>229 F.3d 226, 238-39 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Fifth, Clemons argues he was entitled to notice of a sentencing enhancement pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1) for his prior felony convictions. However, \u201cwhen a defendant is not being sentenced pursuant to a \u00a7 851 statutory enhancement i.e., one that exceeds the statutory maximum embodied in the Guideline\u2019s sentencing ranges the defendant is not entitled to rely on the procedural protections contained in \u00a7 851.\u201d <em>United States v. Escobales, </em>218 F.3d 259, 263 (3d Cir.2000) (emphases omitted). Clemons was not sentenced pursuant to a \u00a7 851 statutory enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">Sixth, Clemons argues the District Court abused its discretion by declining to depart downward based on Clemons\u2019 pretrial confinement at Gander Hill, a local Delaware prison, under allegedly substandard conditions. We have held on numerous occasions that we are without jurisdiction to review discretionary refusals to depart downward where the district court \u201cfully understood the scope of its discretion to depart from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Sally, </em>116 F.3d 76, 79 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">Seventh, Clemons argues the District Court erred in calculating Clemons\u2019 base offense on the basis of Clemons\u2019 possession of cocaine base, or \u201ccrack,\u201d rather than cocaine, pursuant to U.S.S.G. 2D1.1(e) and the definition of cocaine base contained in Note D to that table. Given the government chemist\u2019s testimony and the testimony of the drug officer, the District Court did not clearly err in determining the substance was cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Convinced by the reasoning proffered in counsel\u2019s reply brief of the frivolity of Clemons\u2019 seven arguments, and having found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal upon our independent review, we will affirm the convictions and sentence of the District Court, and will grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
