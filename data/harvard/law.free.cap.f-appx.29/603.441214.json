Cardona seeks review of the March 27, 2001, decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board, No. DA0752010196-I-1, affirming his dismissal from the United States Postal Service. We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-26\">Cardona has served as a rural letter carrier for three years. While servicing his route, he was spotted throwing mail into a dumpster. During the ensuing investigation, Cardona admitted to throwing away mail but attempted to justify it by explaining that he was \u201crunning late\u201d and wanted to save time.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-27\">Our review is limited to setting aside any action that is \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (1994). <em>See Yates v. M.S.P.B., </em>145 F.3d 1480, 1483 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Because Cardona admitted to throwing away mail, the board\u2019s finding with regard to that charge is supported by substantial evidence. The only remaining issue is the reasonableness of the imposed penalty. \u201cIt is a well-established rule of civil service law that the penalty for employee misconduct is left to the sound discretion of the agency.\u201d <em>Miguel v. Dep\u2019t. of the Army, </em>727 F.2d 1081, 1083 (Fed.Cir.1984). An agency\u2019s penalty determination is reviewed for an abuse of discretion and we \u201cwill not disturb a choice of penalty within the agency\u2019s discretion unless the severity of the agency\u2019s action appears totally unwarranted in light of all factors.\u201d <em>Mings v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>813 F.2d 384, 390 (Fed.Cir.1987). Given the nature of Cardona\u2019s misconduct, dismissal is not \u201ctotally unwarranted.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
