On appeal, counsel moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and filed a brief raising arguments that Mr. Torres received ineffective assistance of counsel; that statements Mr. Torres made to Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agents should not have been used in determining drug quantity attributable to him at sentencing; that he was pressured by his attorney to sign the plea agreement; that he was under the impression the agreement provided for a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and had been entered into under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(e)(1)(C); and that the government should have moved for a downward departure because of the assistance that Mr. Torres had provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">These arguments fail: (1) Mr. Torres\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim is more appropriately presented in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, <em>see United States v. Martin, </em>59 F.3d 767, 771 (8th Cir.1995); (2) pursuant to a sentencing stipulation entered into at sentencing, Mr. Torres\u2019s statements to DEA agents were not used to compute drug quantity; (3) he gave assurances under oath at his plea hearing that he understood he could receive from 10 years to life imprisonment, that no one had threatened or forced him to enter a guilty plea, and that he had carefully reviewed the plea agreement (which did not purport to be an agreement made under Rule 11(e)(1)(C)), <em>see United States v. Embrey, </em>250 F.3d 1181, 1183-84 (8th Cir.2001); and (4) at the sentencing hearing, in exchange for the sentencing stipulation, he abandoned his earlier complaint that the government had not filed a substantial-assistance motion, cf<em>. United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995) (defendant who voluntarily exposes himself to specific sentence may not challenge that punishment on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">Finally, following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\">. The Honorable Charles R. Wolle, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
