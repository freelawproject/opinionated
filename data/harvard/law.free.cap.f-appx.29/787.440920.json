Plaintiffs suit was brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming violations of her constitutional rights, under state law, alleging various torts, and, after the United States was substituted for Defendant Miller in some claims, under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The district court, (Murtha, <em>C. </em>J.), in a series of opinions, dismissed all of Plaintiffs claims. She appeals from some of these dismissals and challenges the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to amend her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">All of Plaintiffs claims on appeal, including those connected to her proposed amended complaint, depend on the absence of probable cause for Plaintiffs arrest and prosecution. Based on Plaintiffs complaint and the uncontested portion of Defendant Chartier\u2019s Affidavit in support of Plaintiffs arrest (the traversing of which is a necessary part of Plaintiffs case), we find that no sufficient facts have been pled denying the existence of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">We have considered all of the claims that Plaintiff has asserted and have concluded that they are meritless. The district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Plaintiffs suit is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
