Even if Middleton\u2019s federal claims against the New York state defendants were not jurisdictionally barred by <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983) and <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923), and, separately, by the Eleventh Amendment, Middleton has failed to allege facts with the particularity required to survive a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Middleton\u2019s conclusory argument on appeal that Eleventh Amendment immunity and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine should not apply because appellees have \u201cengaged in obstruction of justice\u201d is unsubstantiated and meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
