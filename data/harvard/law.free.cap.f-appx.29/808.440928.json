He was sentenced to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment, one year supervised release, a $25 assessment and restitution of $820 to Six Flags Great Adventure Theme Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in not applying the minor role deduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">Moore was involved in a counterfeit money operation led by David Delisi that also involved Kirsten Kirch and two other juveniles. On July 19, 1999, Moore, Delisi and one of the juveniles passed three counterfeit $20 Federal Reserve notes at a convenience store in Jackson, New Jersey. Joined by Kirch and the other juvenile, they subsequently passed a total of 16 counterfeit $20 notes at Six Flags Great Adventure Theme Park in Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">Delisi accepted responsibility as the leader of the operation. He created the counterfeit notes at his home using a personal computer, scanner, printer and paper cutter. Moore assisted in manufacturing by cutting sheets of counterfeit notes into individual notes. With Moore\u2019s assistance, Delisi created $2000 in counterfeit $20 notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-16\">The statutory maximum sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 491(b) is 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. Moore\u2019s base offense level was 9. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.1. In his plea agreement, Moore stipulated to an offense level of 15 for his involvement in manufacturing counterfeit currency. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.1(b)(2). Two levels were reduced because Moore had clearly accepted responsibility for his actions. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.l(a). With an adjusted offense level of 13 and a Criminal History Category of I, Moore\u2019s sentencing guideline range was 12 to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. The sentencing judge denied Moore\u2019s motion for a minor role deduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 and sentenced Moore to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-18\">Moore contends the denial of his \u00a7 3B1.2 motion was not factually supported. We review \u00a7 3B1.2 denials based on allegedly faulty factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d 236, 237 (3d Cir.1998) (citing <em>United States v. Bierley, </em>922 F.2d 1061, 1064 (3d Cir.1990)). A \u201cminor role\u201d deduction is applicable when the defendant was less culpable than most of the other participants. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, Application Note 3. Sentencing courts have broad discretion in applying \u00a7 3B1.2, \u201cand their rulings are left largely undisturbed by the courts of appeal.\u201d <em>Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d at 238. The factual determination depends on \u201c(1) the defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise; (2) the nature of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>relationship to the other participants; and (3) the importance of the defendant\u2019s actions to the success of the venture.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>250 F.3d 811, 819 (3d Cir.2001). These factors should be weighed comparatively between the defendant and other participants. <em>Id. </em>at 819. The record supports the sentencing court\u2019s determination that Moore was not less culpable than most of the participants involved in the criminal conduct. We see no clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Moore also contends the District Court mistakenly believed a \u00a7 3B1.2 deduction could not be granted in a misdemeanor conviction. This claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
