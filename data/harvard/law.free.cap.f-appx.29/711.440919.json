The government alleges that Zedner approached a number of financial institutions and attempted to open accounts with bogus $10 million \u201cTreasury Bonds\u201d issued by a non-existent \u201cMinistry of Finance of U.S.A.\u201d The bonds featured various obvious misspellings. The government asserts that Zedner intended to borrow $300,000 against the bonds. Zedner has, on a number of occasions since his arrest, insisted that the bonds are genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-17\">On March 21, 2001, the district court found Zedner incompetent to stand trial. The court ordered Zedner committed to a suitable facility for a period not to exceed four months, for the purpose of determining whether there was a substantial probability that in the foreseeable future he would attain competency. Zedner contends that the district court\u2019s Commitment Order should be vacated because: (1) in focusing on Zedner\u2019s delusions, to the exclusion of his ability to assist counsel and understand the proceedings against him, the court applied the wrong legal standard in evaluating Zedner\u2019s competency; (2) the court erroneously focused on Zedner\u2019s pri- or psychiatric history rather than his mental state at the time of trial; and (3) the court\u2019s finding of incompetency contradicts the medical evidence and is therefore clearly erroneous. This Court stayed the district court\u2019s Commitment Order pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-18\">A defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial is a question of fact entrusted to the discretion of the district court, to be reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Morrison, </em>153 F.3d 34, 46 (2d Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>56 F.3d 403, 411 (2d Cir.1995). In order to be competent to stand trial, a defendant must possess (1) \u201csufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u201d and (2) \u201ca rational as well as factual understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Nichols, </em>56 F.3d at 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The court\u2019s finding of incompetency in this case was not clearly erroneous. \u201cA finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Zervos v. Verizon New York, Inc., </em>252 F.3d 163, 168 (2d Cir.2001) (citations omitted); <em>accord Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (\u201cWhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the fact-finder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d). The district court\u2019s finding in this case was supported by the expert report submitted to the court by Dr. Sanford Drob, which stated that Zedner was incompetent to stand trial because \u201che is so severely delusional at the present time that his judgment with respect to his case is completely conditioned, and impaired, by mental illness.\u201d Dr. Drob found that Zedner\u2019s delusions regarding the authenticity of the bonds at issue in the case and his exalted role in the world financial system \u201cmake it impossible [for him] to effectively cooperate with counsel.\u201d Dr. Drob did testify at the hearing that Zedner might be competent if he could put his delusions \u201cin the corner\u201d and no longer insist on a legal defense based on those delusions. In the light of the evidence presented, however, it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to conclude that Zedner\u2019s delusions would interfere with his ability to assist his counsel to a degree rendering him incompetent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The district court did apply the correct legal standard, finding that Zedner was \u201csuffering from a mental disease or defect which renders him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.\u201d Also, although the question of competency to stand trial is limited to the defendant\u2019s abilities at the time of trial, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(d), the district court did not err in considering Zedner\u2019s prior history of delusions in reaching a decision regarding his present competency. <em>See Nichols, </em>56 F.3d at 412 (\u201c[T]he district court may consider psychiatric history in its deliberations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">We have considered all of appellant\u2019s other arguments and find them to be meritless. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
