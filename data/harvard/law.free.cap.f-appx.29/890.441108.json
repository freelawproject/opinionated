Because we write for the parties only, the background of the case need not be set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-22\">The Bankruptcy Court properly dismissed the appellant\u2019s involuntary bankruptcy petitions against The Law Center and Shinko-Miele Rentals because the appellant\u2019s petitions did not satisfy the statutory requirements and because the petitions were filed in bad faith. The Bankruptcy Court found that the only debt alleged in the petitions was one alleged by the appellant that she had reason to know was the subject of a bona fide dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-23\">According to the relevant portion of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(b), \u201c[a]n involuntary case against a person is commenced by the filing with the bankruptcy court of a petition under chapter 7 ... by ... a holder of a claim against such person that is not ... the subject of a bona fide dispute.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(b) (emphasis added). The Bankruptcy Court correctly concluded that the alleged claim was clearly the subject of a bona fide dispute, one that had been seriously contested in many rounds of state court litigation. Because of this conclusion, the Bankruptcy Court properly dismissed the involuntary petition under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-24\">Moreover, the Bankruptcy Court was similarly justified in dismissing the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>tion under this Circuit\u2019s case law permitting dismissal when petitions are filed in bad faith, which was specifically found in this case. See <em>In re Tamecki, </em>229 F.3d 205 (3d Cir.2000); <em>In re SGL Carbon Corp., </em>200 F.3d 154 (3d Cir.1999); <em>In re Lilley, </em>91 F.3d 491 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Finally, the Bankruptcy Court properly exercised its discretion to impose reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(i)(l) and punitive damages under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(i)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">We have considered all of the appellant\u2019s arguments and see no basis for reversal. The judgment of the District Court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
