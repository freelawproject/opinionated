Perrotte brought suit, seeking one billion dollars in damages, against numerous state, federal, and private defendants, including the Department of Corrections, former President of the United States William J. Clinton, former Mayor of New York City Rudolph Giuliani, the Queens Family Court, and the U.S. military, alleging, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-12\">Actions for violations of civil rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 ... based on the Murder of Kenneth Perrotte and Family at his private resident [sic] at Salem Ave. in Elizabeth!,] New Jersey by the U.S. military on Sept. 13, 1999.
