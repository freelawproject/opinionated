While at Indian Trails, Burleson removed $500 from a staff member\u2019s office. The money did belong to Burleson, but Burleson was not allowed to enter the staff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>member\u2019s office or to remove the money. After this incident, Burleson became unruly and threatened Indian Trails staff members. At Indian Trails\u2019s request, Burleson was removed. The district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> revoked the conditional release which had allowed Burleson to reside at Indian Trails, adopting the conclusion of two psychological reports and the magistrate judge: Burleson would likely be a danger to other persons or property if released unconditionally. The court also ordered that continuing efforts should be made to place Burleson in an appropriate state placement or conditional release plan, but because neither option is currently available, Burleson is now in prison. Burleson appeals the revocation of his conditional release.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">If a person released to a medical facility under a conditional discharge violates the prescribed treatment plan, a federal district court must determine \u201cwhether the person should be remanded to a suitable facility on the ground that, in light of his failure to comply with the prescribed regimen of ... treatment, his continued release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246(f) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Burleson first argues the court wrongly applied this statute to his case because his rule-breaking and disruptive behavior at Indian Trails did not constitute a failure to comply with the prescribed treatment regimen. <em>See United States v. McAllister, </em>225 F.3d 982, 986 (8th Cir.2000) (de novo review). At the hearing to determine whether the conditional release should be revoked, however, Burleson\u2019s attorney stated: \u201cI\u2019ve talked to Mr. Burleson and while he denies the specific allegati\u00f3n of taking the $500, he does admit that thereafter he became unruly and that would probably be a sufficient basis for the revocation.\u201d J.A. at 31. Generally, a patient\u2019s violation of the rules of a medical facility is a sufficient reason for the court to revoke the individual\u2019s conditional release. <em>See United States v. Woods, </em>970 F.Supp. 711, 713 (D.Minn.1997). In this case, the district court reasonably concluded Burleson\u2019s rule breaking and aggressive behavior at Indian Hills violated his treatment plan and thus triggered the application of the statute, requiring the court to reevaluate an appropriate remedy for Burleson.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Burleson also argues the district court committed clear error in reaching its factual conclusion that Burleson\u2019s unconditional release would create a risk of harm to another person or to property. <em>See United States v. Steil, </em>916 F.2d 485, 487-88 (8th Cir.1990) (standard of review). The district court\u2019s conclusion was based on two independent, thorough psychological reports which both concluded Burleson\u2019s unconditional release could be a risk of harm to another person or to property because of his intermittent explosive disorder and mild mental retardation. <em>See </em>J.A. at 15, 25. Given these facts, the district court\u2019s conclusion about Burleson\u2019s dangerousness is free from clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">In sum, the district court properly applied the law and reasonably interpreted the facts in Burleson\u2019s case. Thus, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\"> The Honorable Ortrie D. Smith, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
