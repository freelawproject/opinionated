Judgment was entered in favor of Diamond in the amount of $1,050.00. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-16\">Diamond challenges the amount of damages she was awarded for injury to her property caused by Beltman North American Van Lines (\u201cBeltman\u201d), the company she hired to move her furniture from Atlanta, Georgia to New York, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-17\">The Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act is the exclusive remedy a shipper may use to recover damages from a carrier for damage to property during shipment. <em>See Cleveland v. Beltman N. Am. Co., </em>30 F.3d 373, 380-81 (2d Cir.1994). Under the Carmack Amendment, Beltman is hable for \u201cthe actual loss or injury caused\u201d during delivery. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14706.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-19\">Diamond was unable to prove her damages because her relevant evidence\u2014 including the appraisal report and other documents in which salespeople or businesses purportedly noted the value of the damaged furniture \u2014 was properly excluded on hearsay grounds. Diamond did not call an appraiser or other expert witness, nor did she offer her own testimony or any other admissible evidence regarding the amount of damages to her belongings. Had she done so, she may have stood to recover considerable damages as her allegations suggest that Beltman faced potentially serious liability. Lamentably, Diamond\u2019s failure to submit such admissible evidence leaves her now without recourse. The only evidence before the magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>judge regarding damages was the letter Beltman had previously sent to Diamond admitting to damages of $1,050.00. Accordingly, the magistrate judge properly granted Beltman\u2019s motion for a directed verdict based only on the recovery of $1,050.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment entered by the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
