Having reviewed the parties\u2019 filings, the district court\u2019s opinion and orders, and the record on appeal, we affirm. Additionally, we grant the Appellees\u2019 motion to file supplemental materials, deny Langdon\u2019s motions for sanctions, deny Langdon\u2019s motion to strike Appellees\u2019 informal brief, and deny Langdon\u2019s motion for default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Turning to the merits of Langdon\u2019s appeal, we find his actions were properly dismissed by the district court. As the district court noted, Langdon\u2019s prior state actions named the North Carolina Department of Transportation (\u201cNCDOT\u201d) as defendant and addressed issues arising from the same incidents at issue here. However, in federal court Langdon named only the NCDOT in the first complaint and four employees of the NCDOT in the separate complaint alleging an improper taking. We find Langdon\u2019s first action was properly subject to dismissal on the basis of res judicata. <em>Bockweg v. Anderson, </em>333 N.C. 486, 428 S.E.2d 157, 161 (N.C.1993); <em>Caswell Realty Assoc. I, L.P. v. Andrews Co., </em>128 N.C.App. 716, 496 S.E.2d 607, 610 (N.C.Ct.App.1998). Further, because takings actions sound against governmental entities rather than individual state employees in their individual capacities, <em>see Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 687, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); <em>see also Kentucky v. Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 165, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985), Langdon\u2019s second federal suit was properly subject to dismissal either based on res judicata, in light of the complete identity of the parties and issues involved, <em>see Bockweg, </em>428 S.E.2d at 161; <em>Caswell, </em>496 S.E.2d at 610, or for failure to state a claim. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of Langdon\u2019s actions as frivolous or malicious under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (West Supp.2001).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">Langdon also raises two additional assignments of error, which we also find to be meritless. First, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Langdon\u2019s motion to recuse the district court judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a) (1994). <em>See United States v. DeTemple, </em>162 F.3d 279, 283 (4th Cir.1998). Second, we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s granting Appellees\u2019 motion to reopen the period for filing their answer pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 6. <em>See Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick </em>Associates <em>Ltd., </em>507 U.S. 380, 392, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993); <em>Mendez v. Elliot, </em>45 F.3d 75, 79 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">For these reasons, we affirm the dismissal of Langdon\u2019s civil actions and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b202-9\"> We reiterate the district court\u2019s warning that continuing to file frivolous or malicious pleadings in this Court or the district court could lead to the imposition of sanctions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
