He was sentenced to 84 months in prison, with the recommendation to the Bureau of Prisons that he receive credit for time served. He was also sentenced to three years of supervised release, a fine of $500.00, and a special assessment of $100.00. The judgment was later amended to include a recommendation to the Bureau of Prisons that credit for time served extend back to Blair\u2019s initial appearance in federal court, or September 22, 2000. Blair appeals, raising the four issues listed in Section I below. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-14\">I. ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b852-15\">1. Did the District Court err by finding that Blair\u2019s previous conviction for a violation of N.J.S.A. \u00a7 2C:35-6, Employment of a Juvenile in Drug Distribution, was a controlled substance offense for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b), thereby enhancing his base offense level by four levels?</p>\n<p id=\"b852-16\">2. Did the District Court err by finding that two of Blair\u2019s prior state convictions were not part of a single scheme or plan, due to the fact that there was an \u201cintervening arrest,\u201d even though Blair\u2019s first offense had not been adjudicated prior to his second arrest?</p>\n<p id=\"b852-17\">3. Did the District Court err when it found that it did not have the authority to give Blair custodial credit back to his original sentencing date?</p>\n<p id=\"b852-18\">4. Did the District Court err by not sua sponte dismissing the indictment for lack of any commercial or transactional aspects to Blair\u2019s possession of a firearm?</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Appellant first argues that the District Court erred by finding that one of his prior convictions, \u201cemployment of a juvenile in a drug distribution,\u201d was a controlled substance offense as defined under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). We reject that argument. First, appellant stipulated in his plea agreement to that fact. Moreover, the evidence of record and the state court documents fully support the District Court\u2019s finding that the appellant employed a juvenile to distribute cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Secondly, appellant\u2019s claim that his two prior drug trafficking offenses were \u201crelated\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) is also meritless. The simple response to his argument is that those sentences arose from offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest. (See Application Note 3 of \u00a7 4A1.2)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Appellant\u2019s third contention on appeal is the District Court erred by concluding it did not have the authority to order the Bureau of Prisons to grant him credit from the date of his initial appearance. The date on which a defendant\u2019s sentence is deemed to commence is controlled by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(a), and the decision is committed, in the first instance, to the exclusive authority of the Bureau of Prisons. The District Court was correct. It simply did not have the authority to effectively \u201cback date\u201d a sentence to commence on the date his sentencing was arguably scheduled. That would effectively give him credit for presentence custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Finally, the appellant argues that the District Court erred by not sua sponte dismissing the indictment for lack of any commercial or transactional aspects to Blair\u2019s possession of a firearm. Inasmuch as this issue was not raised before the District Court, to prevail on appeal, he must show that it was plain error. We conclude that it is not. Appellant\u2019s argument is essentially that \u00a7 922 was beyond Congress\u2019s powers under Article I, Section 8, of the United States Constitution. This argument has no merit. See <em>United States v. Singletary, </em>268 F.3d 196 (3d Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Gateward, </em>84 F.3d 670 (3d Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Rybar, </em>103 F.3d 273 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">In summary and for all the reasons explained above, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
