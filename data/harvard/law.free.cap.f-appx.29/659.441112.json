Gosselin requests that we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing on the grounds that the district court (J. Garvan Murtha, <em>Chief </em>Judge) misconstrued its authority to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines and that the resulting sentence violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">On October 12, 2000, the Government filed a three-count superseding indictment against defendant in United States District Court for the District of Vermont, charging him with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), conspiracy to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and with possession of fourteen firearms following a conviction in Vermont state court for a misdemeanor crime of domestic .violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9). Although defendant had been initially indicted with three other co-defendants, the superseding indictment was filed after these co-defendants were convicted and thus charged defendant alone. Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the charge of possession with intent to distribute and the remaining charges were dropped. Under said agreement, the Government promised, <em>inter alia, </em>not to oppose a recommendation by the sentencing judge that defendant be allowed to participate in the 500 Hour Drug and Alcohol Education Program (the \u201cDrug Program\u201d) run by the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Prior to sentencing, defendant moved for a downward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines on various grounds, all of which were denied. On May 4, 2001, Chief Judge Murtha sentenced defendant to 57 months imprisonment, to be followed by a three-year period of supervised release. Judge Murtha did, however, recommend to the BOP that defendant be allowed to participate in the Drug Program and retain eligibility for the attendant early release benefits, despite the BOP\u2019s policy of categorically denying such benefits to prisoners whose offenses involved the possession of firearms. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8621; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">On appeal, defendant argues, <em>first, </em>that the district court misconstrued its authority to depart based on (a) defendant\u2019s \u201cextraordinary rehabilitation,\u201d (b) his ineligibility for early release benefits, and (c) the alleged unwarranted disparity between his sentence and those of his co-defendants. It is well established that we cannot review a district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart unless that decision was made \u201cin violation of law\u201d or resulted from a \u201cmisapplication of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lawal, </em>17 F.3d 560, 562 (2d Cir.1994). As we have explained, \u201c[a] decision not to depart downward would be \u2018in violation of law\u2019 ... if it was based upon constitutionally impermissible considerations or an erroneous interpretation of law, such as a sentencing court\u2019s mistaken conclusion that it lacked the statutory authority to depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Adeniyi, </em>912 F.2d 615, 619 (2d Cir.1990). At sentencing, the district court, in reviewing defendant\u2019s arguments for departure \u2014 arguments that included those he makes here on appeal \u2014 stated that \u201cI realize I have the discretion to downwardly depar[t] on these bases, but I will not do so for the reasons that I stated.\u201d Based on this statement, and on our reading of the sentencing transcript as a whole, we find no reason to conclude that defendant\u2019s sentence resulted from the district court\u2019s failure to recognize its authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>ty to depart.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>98 F.3d 690, 694 (2d Cir.1996) (per curiam) (noting the presumption \u201cthat district judges understand the much-discussed processes by which they may, in circumstances permitted by law, exercise discretion to depart from the sentence range prescribed by the Guidelines calculus.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><em>Second, </em>defendant brings a new argument on appeal that the disparity between his sentence and those received by his co-defendants raises equal protection concerns. This argument is unpersuasive for several reasons, not the least of which is that the disparity alleged here resulted from the fact that the sentencing factors properly applicable to defendant and his co-defendants were different. So, for example, co-defendant Luis Alvarez was eligible for the \u201csafety valve\u201d reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6) and did not possess firearms during his offense. Similarly, co-defendant Kenneth Perez did not possess firearms and, unlike defendant, cooperated with the Government during its investigation, thus qualifying for a substantial assistance departure. Accordingly, there is no plain error or defect affecting substantial rights to be found in the differing sentences received by the defendants in this case. <em>See United States v. Keppler, 2 </em>F.3d 21, 23 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We have considered all of defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the District Court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ATK\">. In such a circumstance, a district court\u2019s denial is not appealable, and therefore, we need not address the Government\u2019s arguments that ineligibility for early release benefits and inter-defendant disparity are not proper grounds for departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
