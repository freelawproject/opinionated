It is</p>\n<p id=\"b37-21\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the petition for review be DENIED. Under the applicable Board regulation, a \u201cperson who ... visits a Board office stating that he or she wishes to file for [a disability] annuity ... but puts off filing because of an action or lack of action by an employee of the Board, can establish a filing date based on that oral notice\u201d provided certain conditions are met. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 217.21. In this case, it is not even necessary to determine whether Perry meets the relevant conditions because the Board\u2019s conclusion that Perry \u201cfail[ed]\u201d to \u201cexpress[ ] an intent to file for [a disability] annuity\u201d is supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Reed v. R.R. Ret. Bd., </em>145 F.3d 373, 375 (D.C.Cir.1998) (reviewing Board fact-findings for \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d) Perry\u2019s memory of his visit to the Board\u2019s office is hazy at best. He testified that after his visit to the Board office, he was left with the \u201cimpression\u201d that both disability and sickness benefits were discussed and that \u201cmaybe\u201d he got the idea that he ought not file for a disability annuity from a conversation with a Board employee. At the very most, this testimony establishes that Perry may have discussed the subject of a disability annuity not that Perry actually expressed an intent to file for a disability annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-22\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>hearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
