Kaplan, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b707-20\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b707-21\">ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of said District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED and plaintiffs\u2019 motion to vacate a prior order of this court striking their reply brief is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-22\">On January 29, 1999, the Poughkeepsie Journal printed an article with the head<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>line \u201cMilitant sues Red Hook.\u201d The body of the article explained that J. Keith Idema, the \u201coperator of a former anti-terrorism training facility\u201d had sued Red Hook because the town\u2019s 1985 prosecution of Idema for zoning violations, which was dismissed in 1987 on procedural grounds, forced him to close his anti-terrorism school, Counterr Group, Inc. (\u201cCounterr\u201d), for financial reasons. The article went on to report that Counterr, which has since reopened in North Carolina, \u201cclaimed many of its instructors were former commandos in special forces units ...\u201d and that \u201c[i]n 1983, it boasted \u2018some of the most exotic and state-of-the art hostage rescue training ranges in America.\u2019 \u201d The article also noted that Counterr had been \u201cfeatured by CBS as the most professional organization of its kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">After a futile attempt to obtain a retraction of the headline\u2019s characterization of Idema as a \u201cmilitant,\u201d plaintiffs filed suit. Their lawsuit-filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York-contained claims for libel and defamation, civil conspiracy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and \u201cviolation of civil rights.\u201d On October 29, 1999, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that (1) neither the word \u201cmilitant\u201d in the headline of the article nor the publication as a whole was defamatory; (2) plaintiffs had not pled special damages, (3) there is no cause of action for civil conspiracy; (4) plaintiffs did not state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (5) plaintiffs failed to state a claim for violation of civil rights. The district court granted this motion on default on December 14, 1999, but later vacated as to Idema. After obtaining counsel, Counterr moved to vacate its default.</p>\n<p id=\"A3_T\">On November 2, 2000, Judge McMahon dismissed all of the claims against defendants and denied Counterr\u2019s motion to vacate the default judgment because Counterr\u2019s claims lacked merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Plaintiffs appealed. Because plaintiffs limited their briefing to their defamation and civil rights claims, they have abandoned their conspiracy and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims. <em>See Price v. Int\u2019l Union, UAW, </em>927 F.2d 88, 93 n. 5 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">A defamatory statement is \u201cone that exposes an individual \u2018to public hatred, shame, obloquy, contumely, odium, contempt, ridicule, aversion, ostracism, degradation or disgrace, or ... induces an evil opinion of one in the minds of right-thinking persons, and ... deprives one of ... confidence and friendly intercourse in society.\u2019 \u201d <em>Celle v. Filipino Reporter Enters., Inc., </em>209 F.3d 163, 177 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Kimmerle v. New York Evening Journal, </em>262 N.Y. 99, 186 N.E. 217, 218 (N.Y.1933)). It is for the court to determine in the first instance whether the words are susceptible of a defamatory meaning. <em>Celle, </em>209 F.3d at 177. In performing this task, the court must read the offending words in the context of the whole article and test them against \u201cthe understanding of the average reader.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). If the words can be understood in both a defamatory and a non-defamatory sense, the court must submit the issue to the jury for its finding as to whether the words were used and understood in a defamatory manner. <em>Id. </em>at 178. Here, the context of the entire article ensures that the word \u201cmilitant\u201d could not be understood by the average reader as defamatory. The article quotes a favorable assessment of Counterr by a major television network and indicates that Counterr was an anti-terrorism school. Contrary to plaintiffs position, neither the article nor the head<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>line suggests in any fashion that Counterr or Idema are themselves communists or terrorists. Therefore, the district court correctly dismissed the defamation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Judge McMahon dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights claim because the newspaper was not a state actor and plaintiffs\u2019 interest in their reputation is not constitutionally protected. Plaintiffs contend that the district court erred by finding a lack of state action because they alleged that defendants conspired with Red Hook officials. They also suggest that defendants retaliated against them for exercising First Amendment and Due Process rights. Below, plaintiffs asserted that their constitutional injury was their loss of reputation and did not claim a retaliatory motive; thus we do not consider plaintiffs\u2019 second argument. <em>Robinson v. Government of Malaysia, </em>269 F.3d 133, 147 (2d Cir.2001). Even assuming that plaintiffs adequately pleaded defendants\u2019 status as state actors, they did not describe a constitutional wrong. Plaintiffs\u2019 interest in protecting their reputation from defamation \u201cis neither \u2018liberty\u2019 nor \u2018property5 recognized by state or federal law.\u201d <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 712, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976). Because plaintiffs have not described any of the special circumstances that elevate defamation to a constitutional wrong, <em>see, e.g., Valmonte v. Bane, </em>18 F.3d 992, 1001-02 (2d Cir.1994), their civil rights claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">We have considered all of plaintiffs\u2019 arguments and found that they lack merit. We also deny plaintiffs\u2019 motion to vacate a prior order of this court that struck plaintiffs\u2019 reply brief because the reply brief sought to add materials that were not before the district court. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(a).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
