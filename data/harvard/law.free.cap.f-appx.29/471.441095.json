Six months after a jury verdict finding him guilty, Allen filed a motion for a new trial on the asserted ground that a juror was prejudiced against him and should not have been allowed to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-28\">Under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>a new trial on any grounds other than newly discovered evidence must be made within seven days of the verdict or finding of guilty or within such further time as the court may fix within the seven-day period. In <em>United States v. Hanoum, </em>33 F.3d 1128, 1130 (9th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1068, 115 S.Ct. 1702, 131 L.Ed.2d 564 (1995), we held \u201cthat a Rule 33 motion based upon \u2018newly discovered evidence\u2019 is limited to whether the newly discovered evidence relates to the elements of the crime charged.\u201d Here, Allen\u2019s motion did not relate to the elements of the crime charged but rather to the conduct of the trial itself. Furthermore, the evidence was not in any sense \u201cnewly discovered\u201d because, as Allen concedes, he told his attorney during trial of the alleged bias but his attorney did not act on this information. Allen\u2019s motion came six months too late and did not involve newly discovered evidence. The trial court properly denied it, without a hearing, for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Second, Allen argues that his conviction should be reversed because the prosecutor improperly bolstered and vouched for government witnesses and evidence in closing argument. We are required to view these claims by an \u201cexamination of the entire proceedings,\u201d see <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 643, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974), i.e., \u201cin the context of the entire trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>241 F.3d 638, 652 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 986, 121 S.Ct. 1634, 149 L.Ed.2d 494 (2001). After careful review of the entire proceedings, we hold that the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments in context were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b501-18\"> This disposition is inappropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
