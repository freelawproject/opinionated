(\u201cERSE\u201d) appeals the District Court\u2019s orders granting the motions to dismiss and to stay discovery of defendants the Pennsylvania Employees Benefit Trust Fund (\u201cPEBTF\u201d) and Thomas G. Paese and the motion to intervene and for a protective order of Independence Blue Cross, Capital Blue Cross, and Blue Cross of Northeastern Pennsylvania (collectively \u201cBlue Cross\u201d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Because we write only for the parties who well understand the procedural history and facts of the case, we will not repeat them except as necessary to provide context. Instead, we will move directly to ERSE\u2019s primary contention that the statute of limitations does not bar the three causes of action contained in its complaint (1) First Amendment violation; (2) breach of contract; and (3) intentional interference with contractual relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">The first count of the complaint seeks relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for a violation of ERSE\u2019s First Amendment right to free speech. ERSE asserts that this claim is not time-barred. It is mistaken. Section 1983 claims are governed by the relevant state\u2019s statute of limitations for personal injury actions. <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 276, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985); <em>McDowell v. Delaware State Police, </em>88 F.3d 188, 190 (3d Cir.1996). In Pennsylvania, the statute of limitations for personal injury actions is two years and begins running when the cause of action accrues. 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 5524(2) (West 1981 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2001); <em>S.T. Hudson Engineers, Inc. v. Camden Hotel Dev. Assocs., </em>747 A.2d 931, 934 (Pa.Super.Ct.2000). The question as to when a section 1983 action accrues is, however, one of federal law. <em>Genty v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>937 F.2d 899, 919 (3d Cir.1991). Under federal law, the statute of limitations begins to run \u201cwhen the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury upon which its action is based.\u201d <em>Sameric Corp. of Delaware, Inc. v. City of Philadelphia, </em>142 F.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Here, ERSE\u2019s section 1983 action accrued over five years before the complaint was filed in the District Court and, thus, is barred by the two-year statute of limitations. Defendants allegedly violated ERSE\u2019s First Amendment right to free speech when they \u201cretaliated\u201d against ERSE for a letter it sent to PEBTF on April 21, 1995, which warned that political interests were compromising the Blue Cross matter. A month after the letter was sent, PEBTF terminated ERSE. It was at this moment, May 24, 1995, that any First Amendment right to free speech was violated and that ERSE suffered injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">ERSE counters that the unconstitutional retaliation occurred when PEBTF withheld an earned contingent fee and that this fact was not discoverable before September 1998 because defendants actively concealed information about the settlement with Blue Cross. This argument does not rescue ERSE from the statute of limitations. ERSE possessed in 1995 facts essential to a First Amendment retaliation claim. See <em>United States v. Kubrick, </em>444 U.S. 111, 122, 100 S.Ct. 352, 62 L.Ed.2d 259 (1979) (statute of limitations runs once a plaintiff possesses \u201cthe critical facts that he has been hurt and who has inflicted the injury\u201d). ERSE knew it had exercised its First Amendment right to free speech by sending the letter. ERSE also knew that PEBTF had terminated it because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>letter. On May 24,1995, therefore, ERSE possessed the information necessary to file an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violation of its First Amendment right to free speech, and a jury could have calculated appropriate damages. Accordingly, ERSE\u2019s section 1983 action accrued more than two years before the complaint was filed and is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Similarly, ERSE\u2019s second claim, against PEBTF only, for breach of contract is barred by the statute of limitations. ERSE contends that PEBTF breached the fee agreement when it refused to pay an earned contingent fee. Although ERSE attempts to characterize its claim as one for breach of contract, it is in fact a claim for quantum meruit. In Pennsylvania, it is well-established that a client has an absolute right to terminate an attorney at any time for any reason, regardless of any contract. <em>Kenis v. Perini Corp., </em>452 Pa.Super. 634, 682 A.2d 845, 849 (Pa.Super.Ct.1996); <em>Hiscott &amp; Robinson v. King, </em>426 Pa.Super. 338, 626 A.2d 1235, 1237 (Pa.Super.Ct.1993). The dismissed attorney\u2019s remedy is a quantum meruit action to recover the value of services rendered. <em>Novinger v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc.; </em>809 F.2d 212, 218 (3d Cir.1987); <em>Kenis, </em>682 A.2d at 849; <em>Hiscott &amp; Robinson, </em>626 A.2d at 1237; <em>Sundheim v. Beaver County Bldg. &amp; Loan Assoc., </em>140 Pa.Super. 529, 14 A.2d 349, 351 (Pa.Super.Ct.1940). The statute of limitations for a quantum meruit action is four years. 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 5525(4) (West 1981 &amp; Supp.2001); <em>Kenis, </em>682 A.2d at 849; <em>Fowkes v. Shoemaker, </em>443 Pa.Super. 343, 661 A.2d 877, 880 (Pa.Super.Ct.1995). A quantum meruit action accrues on the date of the attorney\u2019s termination. <em>Kenis, </em>682 A.2d at 849; <em>Fowkes, </em>661 A.2d at 880. Under these well-recognized principles, ERSE\u2019s action against PEBTF for legal fees arose on May 24, 1995, the date of its termination, and is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">ERSE attempts to avoid this result by arguing that PEBTF and Blue Cross intentionally conspired to cheat it out of its contingent fee and that under these conditions a discharged attorney may recover the full fee on a breach of contract theory. We recognize that under Pennsylvania law a breach of contract action for contingent fees may he when \u201ca collusive and fraudulent settlement is made for the purposes of defrauding an attorney out of his fees.\u201d <em>Paul v. Horton, </em>No. CIV.A. 95-5791, 1996 WL 297572, at *8 (E.D.Pa. May 22, 1996); see also <em>Bennett v. Sinclair Nav. Co., </em>33 F.Supp. 14, 17 (E.D.Pa.1940). However, we do not read the complaint as alleging that PEBTF and Blue Cross conspired to defraud ERSE out of its fees. Although the complaint clearly alleges that PEBTF terminated ERSE for political reasons, it does not allege a factual scenario in which, as in Bennett, PEBTF was on the verge of settling with Blue Cross through ERSE, but settled on its own in order to avoid paying ERSE its contingent fee. See also <em>Paul, </em>1996 WL 297572, at *8 (denying contingent fees to terminated lawyer where settlement was not near conclusion at time of termination).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Moreover, ERSE alleges no facts indicating that it had taken substantial steps towards settling the Blue Cross matter before it was terminated. See <em>id. </em>at *8 (denying contingent fees to terminated lawyer where the attorney\u2019s services had not contributed to the settlement). Indeed, ERSE did not even allege that it ever contacted counsel for Blue Cross, much less held negotiations with them. ERSE\u2019s work consisted solely of preparing a draft of a complaint. In light of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>factors, ERSE\u2019s claim cannot be considered a claim for breach of contract, but rather as one for quantum meruit, and is therefore barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">ERSE\u2019s last claim, against Paese only, for intentional interference with contractual relations is also barred by the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations in Pennsylvania for the tort of interference with contractual relations is two years. 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 5524(3) (West 1981 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2001); <em>Bednar v. Marino, </em>435 Pa.Super. 417, 646 A.2d 573, 577 (Pa.Super.Ct.1994); <em>Torchia v. Keystone Foods Corp., </em>431 Pa.Super. 83, 635 A.2d 1082, 1086 (Pa.Super.Ct.1993). The cause of action accrues \u201cas soon as the right to institute and maintain a suit arises; lack of knowledge, mistake or misunderstanding do not toll the running of the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Pocono Int\u2019l Raceway, Inc. v. Pocono Produce, Inc., </em>503 Pa. 80, 468 A.2d 468, 471 (Pa.1983). In other words, the statute of limitations commences upon the defendant\u2019s first act interfering with the contract. <em>Dellape v. Murray, </em>651 A.2d 638, 640 (Pa.Commw.Ct.1994); <em>Eagan v. U.S. Expansion Bolt Co., </em>322 Pa.Super. 396, 469 A.2d 680, 681 (Pa.Super.Ct.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">On the facts alleged in the complaint, ERSE should have first become aware of Paese\u2019s interference with the PEBTF contract when it received a draft of Paese\u2019s tolling agreement on January 25, 1995. This agreement was negotiated by Paese without ERSE\u2019s knowledge or assistance. If this act was not enough to notify ERSE of Paese\u2019s interference, certainly Paese\u2019s transmittal of a final copy of the tolling agreement was more than enough; indeed, ERSE itself contends that the tolling agreement severely undermined PEBTF\u2019s ability to obtain maximum recovery from Blue Cross. Paese\u2019s interference was even more evident at the March 10, 1995 meeting where he allegedly explicitly acknowledged that he would not allow PEBTF to maximize recovery due to outside political interests. And, at the very latest, ERSE should have realized on May 24, 1995 that Paese was frustrating its contract with PEBTF when it received a letter stating that the \u201clitigation committee\u201d was terminating ERSE\u2019s representation. At that point, ERSE suffered concrete and substantial harm, i.e., it lost the contract and any contingent fees therefrom. Clearly, a cause of action for intentional interference with contractual relations, if one indeed existed, accrued no later than May 24, 1995, and is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">In sum, ERSE\u2019s claims are barred by the relevant statutes of limitations. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
