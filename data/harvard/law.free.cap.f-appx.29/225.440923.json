This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1). Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">On January 27, 1995, Roberts sent a letter to the Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d), which has been construed as an employment discrimination complaint filed under the ERA. The complaint alleged that Roberts had been employed by the Battelle Memorial Institute from September 1979 until July 18, 1994, when her employment was terminated. Roberts alleged that her employment was terminated in retaliation for her whistleblowing activities related to health and safety issues. The DOE referred Roberts\u2019s complaint to the Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d), which determined that the complaint was untimely. Roberts appealed the DOL\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) recommended that Roberts\u2019s complaint be dismissed as untimely. Upon review, the ARB adopted the ALJ\u2019s recommended order and dismissed Roberts\u2019s complaint. On appeal to this court, Roberts submitted for the first time a letter dated January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>12, 1995, which would constitute a complaint under the ERA and, if mailed on that date, would have been timely. Thus, in light of the purported January 12, 1995, letter, this court vacated the ARB\u2019s decision and remanded the case for further proceedings \u201cso that the nature of the letter can be more precisely determined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Upon remand, the ARB vacated its prior decision and order and remanded the case to the ALJ for further proceedings consistent with this court\u2019s order. Following further proceedings before the ALJ, the ALJ again recommended that Roberts\u2019s complaint be dismissed as untimely. Upon review, the ARB agreed with the ALJ\u2019s recommendation and dismissed Roberts\u2019s complaint as untimely on April 30, 2001. Roberts has filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">According to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5851(c)(1), judicial review of an agency action in an ERA case is guided by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-06. <em>Bartlik v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>73 F.3d 100, 102 (6th Cir.1996). Thus, this court reviews such an agency action to determine whether it \u201c \u2018is unsupported by substantial evidence\u2019 \u201d or \u201cis \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Varnadore v. Sec\u2019y of Labor, </em>141 F.3d 625, 630 (6th Cir.1998) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) and (E)). Legal conclusions are reviewed de novo, \u201calthough we defer somewhat to the agency because it is charged with administering the statute.\u201d <em>Am. Nuclear Res., Inc. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>134 F.3d 1292, 1294 (6th Cir.1998). Findings of fact are reviewed \u201cto ensure that substantial evidence supports them.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Upon review, we conclude that the ARB\u2019s determination that Roberts\u2019s ERA complaint was not timely filed is supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, there is substantial evidence to support the ARB\u2019s conclusion that Roberts\u2019s January 12, 1995, letter was never mailed to the DOE and forwarded to the DOL, as asserted by Roberts. First, Roberts did not present a copy of the purported January 12, 1995, letter during the prior proceedings in this case despite her knowledge that timeliness was an issue. In fact, it was not until her case was being heard on appeal to this court in 1997 that she presented a copy of the letter in question. Second, neither the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs nor the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) have a copy of the January 12, 1995, letter in their files. Third, the record indicates that the DOL forwarded a \u201cForm CC-4\u201d complaint form dated January 12, 1995, that it received from Roberts to the EEOC for processing. In a letter to Roberts from the EEOC, dated February 6, 1995, the EEOC acknowledged receipt of Roberts\u2019s letter of complaint under Executive Order 11246, which prohibits employment discrimination by federal contractors on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e. Executive Order 11246 does not deal with retaliatory discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Contrary to Roberts\u2019s contention, the February 6, 1995, letter to her from the EEOC does not support her contention that the January 12, 1995, letter in question was mailed to the DOE. The February 6, 1995, letter acknowledges receipt of a discrimination complaint filed pursuant to Executive Order 11246. Thus, the February 6, 1995, letter does not support the conclusion that Roberts mailed a discrimination complaint alleging retaliation under the ERA to the DOE on January 12, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Accordingly, the ARB\u2019s final decision and order is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
