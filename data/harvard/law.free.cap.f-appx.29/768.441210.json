During February and March of 1999, Chajmovicz made one smuggling trip himself, and recruited three others to take similar trips. One of these recruits, on Chajmovicz\u2019s behalf, recruited three additional couriers. Chajmovicz provided some of these individuals with airline tickets and spending money for their trips, as well as a beeper number contact in Europe. In March 1999, two of the couriers recruited by Chajmovicz were caught reentering the United States with MDMA tablets. At this point, Chajmovicz contacted an attorney and agreed to cooperate with the government. In a series of proffer sessions, Chajmovicz provided information to the government about his own involvement in the smuggling network and the involvement of others. Chajmovicz later pled guilty to one count of importation of MDMA, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a). The government agreed to write a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 letter informing the sentencing judge of Chajmovicz\u2019s assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) found Chajmovicz to be responsible for the importation of 268,950 MDMA tablets. This drug quantity was based on the amounts seized from the two couriers who were caught, as well as estimated amounts smuggled by Chajmovicz, two other couriers who had traveled with him to Europe, and the other couriers Chajmovicz had recruited. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. The PSR also recommended a three-level enhancement for Chajmovicz\u2019s role in the offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. The total recommended offense level was thirty-two, which carries a range of imprisonment of one hundred twenty-one to one hundred fifty-one months. The district court adopted the guideline calculations and the recommendations of the PSR, and departed downward on the basis of the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 letter to a sentence of eighteen months of imprisonment, with a recommendation that Chajmovicz be placed in the Shock Incarceration Program. The court also sentenced Chajmovicz to three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">On appeal, Chajmovicz argues primarily that the district court erred in imposing an enhancement for his role in the offense and in its determination of the drug quantities for which he was responsible. As the district court noted, the PSR correctly determined the quantities of drugs attributable to Chajmovicz. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. 2D1.1, cmt., application note 12 (\u201cWhere there is no drug seizure ..., the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance.\u201d); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>116 F.3d 641, 684 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201c[T]he quantity of narcotics attributable to a given defendant may be approximated ....\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Shonubi, </em>103 F.3d 1085, 1090-92 (2d Cir.1997) (requiring district courts to base any estimate of drug quantity on \u201cspecific evidence\u201d about the quantity for which a given defendant is responsible, including drug records, admissions, live testimony, and the like); <em>see also United States v. Chalarca, </em>95 F.3d 239, 243 (2d Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Perrone, </em>936 F.2d 1403, 1416-17 (2d Cir.1991). The district court also properly found that, given Chajmovicz\u2019s hiring and managing of participants in the smuggling network, a three-level enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1 was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>We have considered all of appellant\u2019s other arguments and find them to be meritless. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the sentence of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
