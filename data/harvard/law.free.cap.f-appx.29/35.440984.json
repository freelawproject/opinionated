Skretny, Judge), entered after a bench trial, finding Del-Rain liable for breach of contract, unfair competition under section 48(a) of the Lanham Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), and unfair competition under New York common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-19\">The protracted litigation culminating in this appeal arises out of a complex set of facts pertaining to the ownership of the trademark \u201cPELONIS,\u201d which has been used on certain ceramic-disc furnace space-heaters since 1986. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>court held a bench trial from November 8 to November 23, 1999. On September 5, 2000, the court issued its decision, which sets forth detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The district court found that in 1993 Del-Rain developed a strategy whereby it sought to drive the PELONIS name out of the space-heater market by, <em>inter alia, </em>introducing two completely new product lines (the \u201cLIFETIME\u201d and \u201cSAFE-TIME\u201d models) while at the same time placing advertisements that suggested that PELONIS model heaters had safety defects. Because this strategy failed, and the public continued to demand PELONIS model heaters \u2014 which the appellee Pelonis USA had manufactured for Del-Rain the previous year and then for sale independently \u2014 Del-Rain sought to reclaim the PELONIS mark. In August 1994, as part of this effort, it sued Pelonis USA, which counterclaimed successfully for breach of contract and unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">On appeal, Del-Rain does not challenge the district court\u2019s ruling on Pelonis USA\u2019s breach of contract claim, but contests the court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law pertaining to the PELONIS trademark. In particular, Del-Rain argues that the court erroneously determined that it abandoned the PELONIS trademark in early 1993 and concurrently engaged in bad-faith efforts to undermine Pelonis USA as a competitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">We apply a \u201chighly deferential standard of review\u201d to a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s findings entered after a bench trial.\u201d <em>S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. v. Clorox Co., </em>241 F.3d 232, 239 (2d Cir.2001). We review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law <em>de novo. Mobil Shipping and Transp. Co. v. Wonsild Liquid Carriers, Ltd., </em>190 F.3d 64, 67 (2d Cir.1999). To find \u201cclear error\u201d in the district court\u2019s findings of fact, we must be \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67-68 (quoting <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">We have reviewed the extensive trial evidence reproduced in the record on appeal and do not find any clear error. To the contrary, we conclude that the record amply supports the district court\u2019s factual findings and therefore reject Del-Rain\u2019s multiple challenges to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">Del-Rain\u2019s principal legal argument on appeal is that the district court misapplied federal law governing the abandonment of trademark rights because it did not find that Del-Rain, which the district court concluded <em>did </em>enjoy rights to the PELONIS mark between 1990 and 1993, ever actually ceased to \u201cuse\u201d that mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127 provides that \u201ca mark shall be deemed to be \u2018abandoned\u2019 \u201d if \u201cits use has been discontinued with intent not to resume such use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consistent with this statute, we have held repeatedly that a showing of abandonment requires two elements: \u201cnon-use of the name by the legal owner and no intent ... to resume use in the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d <em>Stetson v. Howard D. Wolf &amp; Assocs., </em>955 F.2d 847, 850 (2d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">The district court found that Del-Rain discontinued \u201cnormal bona fide commercial use [during the period in which Del-Rain abandoned the PELONIS trademark]\u201d because \u201cany \u2018use\u2019 of PELONIS by Del-Rain during this period was to phase out its inventory of PELONIS products,\u201d \u201cto undermine the trademark,\u201d and \u201cto drive the PELONIS name out of the industry.\u201d Slip op. at 77, \u00b6131. It therefore found that Del-Rain abandoned the PELONIS trademark under \u00a7 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Del-Rain argues that even assuming the truth of the district court\u2019s findings, it nonetheless never actually ceased to \u201cuse\u201d the PELONIS mark within the meaning of \u00a7 1127. Counsel for Del-Rain emphasized at oral argument that during the period in which the district court found abandonment, Del-Rain sold approximately 25,000 PELONIS model heaters \u2014 albeit, according to the court, only in order to unload its remaining PELONIS inventory. Still, Del-Rain contends that this amounts to \u201cuse\u201d sufficient to defeat a claim of abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Del-Rain misconceives the meaning of \u201cuse\u201d under the Lanham Act. The Act does not protect <em>any </em>use; nor is the quantity of ostensible use \u2014 here, the number of heaters sold \u2014 necessarily relevant. The Lanham Act provides that \u201c \u2018[u]se\u2019 of a mark means <em>bona fide </em>use of such mark made in the ordinary course of trade.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127 (emphasis added); <em>see Blue Bell, Inc. v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. </em>497 F.2d 433, 437 (2d Cir.1974) (noting the \u201cclear line of decisions holding that the use must be bona fide, with token transactions accepted only where there is an accompanying intent to engage in commercial use in the future\u201d); <em>accord Exxon Corp. v. Humble Exploration Co., </em>695 F.2d 96, 101 (5th Cir.1983) (\u201cThe [Lanham] Act does not allow the preservation of a mark solely to prevent its use by others.\u201d); <em>cf. O\u2019Connor &amp; Gordon, Inc. v. Handicraft Publ\u2019ns, </em>206 Misc. 1087, 1089-90, 136 N.Y.S.2d 558, 560 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1954) (holding that under New York State law purely \u201cpro forma\u201d use, intended only to acquire rights, is not \u201cbona fide\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">An effort to dispose of the remaining stock of an abandoned line of merchandise does not constitute a \u201cbona fide use ... in the ordinary course of trade,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127, that suffices to defeat a finding of abandonment. <em>See Uncas Mfg. Co. v. Clark &amp; Coombs Co., </em>309 F.2d 818, 820 (1st Cir.1962). That Del-Rain may have sold 25,000 PELONIS heaters in the course of disposing of an abandoned line of merchandise does not affect the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Del-Rain further argues that the district court neglected to consider Del-Rain\u2019s substantial expenditures on advertisements of PELONIS model heaters during the period in which the court found abandonment. The court did not neglect this evidence. It found that Del-Rain\u2019s advertisements, which included a consumer safety-advisory suggesting that PELONIS heaters suffered from hazardous defects, were part of Del-Rain\u2019s bad-faith campaign to drive the PELONIS trademark out of the industry. <em>See </em>Slip Op. at 76-77. Because these advertisements were intended to destroy the PELONIS trademark, they were not part of \u201can ongoing program to exploit the mark commercially,\u201d <em>Societe Anonyme des Parfums Le Galion v. Jean Patou, Inc., </em>495 F.2d 1265, 1272 (2d Cir.1974); and they therefore do not show \u201cbona fide commercial use\u201d sufficient to defeat the district court\u2019s finding of abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\u201cBona fide\u201d means: \u201c1. Made in good faith; without fraud or deceit. 2. Sincere; genuine.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>168 (7th ed.1999). It is therefore something of an oxymoron to contend that a bad-faith use should be deemed a \u201cbona fide use\u201d within the . meaning of \u00a7 1127. <em>Cf. Intrawest Fin. Corp. v. W. Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>610 F.Supp. 950, 958 (D.Col.1985) (finding that a \u201csham use\u201d of a trademark \u201cdevised to prevent others from using the mark\u201d did not suffice to establish or preserve rights to that trademark). A bad-faith campaign to destroy a trademark\u2019s value and undermine a competitor does not constitute a \u201cbona fide commercial use\u201d that suffices to defeat a finding of abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>We have reviewed Del-Rain\u2019s remaining claims and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
