First, Defendant asserts that his crimes constituted a direct challenge to licensing and identification laws that he perceived to be \u201cevil.\u201d Second, Defendant argues that he engaged in criminal activity only as a means of furthering his goal of regaining custody of his son. Neither of these rationales is sufficient to establish a necessity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-20\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s refusal to give a jury instruction on the necessity defense. <em>United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.Bd 1119, 1125 (9th Cir.2001). Defendant may invoke this defense only if he can colorably show: \u201c \u2018(1) that he was faced with a choice of evils and chose the lesser evil; (2) that he acted to prevent imminent harm; (3) that he reasonably anticipated a causal relation between his conduct and the harm to be avoided; and (4) that there were no other legal alternatives to violating the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1126 (quoting <em>United States v. Aguilar, </em>883 F.2d 662, 693 (9th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>As to the first theory, even if we were to construe Defendant\u2019s criminal activity as \u201cdirect civil disobedience,\u201d Defendant\u2019s reliance on the necessity defense would be misplaced. It is clear that the social costs of Defendant\u2019s criminal scheme outweigh the supposed social benefits arising from it and, accordingly, Defendant cannot establish that he chose the lesser of two evils when he decided to break the law. <em>See United States v. Schoon, </em>971 F.2d 193, 196-97 (9th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>588 F.2d 1235, 1239 (9th Cir.1978). Similarly, Defendant cannot establish that the purported harm he sought to prevent was imminent. <em>Schoon, </em>971 F.2d at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Defendant\u2019s assertion that his criminal activities were a means of regaining custody of his son also fails to establish at least two elements of the necessity defense. First, it is unclear how Defendant\u2019s production, sale, or possession of false documents aided him in his custody battle. Therefore, Defendant did not prove a sufficient nexus between his illegal conduct and the harm to be avoided. <em>Id. </em>at 198. Second, Defendant did not demonstrate that there were no legal alternatives to his criminal behavior. <em>Id. </em>at 198-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">B. <em>Commerce Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">We review de novo whether a jury instruction violates due process by creating an unconstitutional presumption or inference. Ta<em>pia v. Roe, </em>189 F.3d 1052, 1056 (9th Cir.1999) (citing <em>Hanna v. Riveland, </em>87 F.3d 1034, 1036-37 (9th Cir.1996)). We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The district court correctly perceived the need for a jury instruction clarifying the meaning of the phrase \u201cin or affects commerce.\u201d The legal significance of this element of the crime may not be readily apparent to lay jurors and, thus, it was proper for the court to define its meaning. <em>United States v. Ripinsky, </em>109 F.3d 1436, 1444-45 (9th Cir.1997), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by United States v. Sab\u00edan, </em>114 F.3d 913, 916 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">The district court\u2019s instruction on the meaning of \u201cin or affects commerce\u201d did not require the jury to find that any element of the crime had been proved. Instead, the instruction went no further than to define what constituted \u201ccommerce,\u201d leaving it to the jury to decide whether the government had in fact proved the facts necessary to establish this element beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">C. <em>Leadership Enhancement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">Defendant asserts that the district court erred in finding that he was \u201can organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a). We review factual findings supporting the application of a leadership enhancement for clear error. <em>United States v. Lopez-Sandoval, </em>146 F.3d 712, 716 (9th Cir.1998). In light of that deferential standard, we affirm the application of this enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">First, although the district court did not identify five or more specific participants in Defendant\u2019s criminal scheme, it found that his operation was \u201cotherwise extensive.\u201d This finding is not clearly erroneous, because the evidence proved that Defendant engaged in the production and sale of false documents for nearly 15 years, amassing \u201chundreds to thousands\u201d of customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">Second, the district court did not clearly err when it found that Defendant acted as a leader or organizer of at least one other participant. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 2. Although Defendant attempts to characterize <em>all </em>other participants in his scheme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>as \u201ccustomers,\u201d <em>see United States v. Egge, </em>223 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir.2000), he concedes that two of his housemates helped him to produce false documents. In addition, the evidence shows that Defendant encouraged his \u201ccustomers\u201d to recruit new clients for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">D. <em>Fraud-Loss Enhancement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines and review for abuse of discretion the court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts of a particular case. <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>241 F.3d 1096, 1099 (9th Cir.2001). Because the district court failed to make factual findings with the requisite level of specificity, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The sentencing guidelines hold defendants responsible for all \u201creasonably foreseeable acts ... of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(A)(l)(b). The district court properly supported its finding that the fraud loss occasioned by two of Defendant\u2019s customers was \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d However, the court failed to make findings as to the scope of the \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under our precedents, this failure constitutes reversible error. <em>United States v. Palafox-Mazon, </em>198 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Conviction AFFIRMED; REVERSED and REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AbV\">. The court made ambiguous statements, some of which suggested that financial fraud was outside the scope of the agreement between Defendant and those who committed the fraud, and some of which suggested otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
