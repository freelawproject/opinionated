We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of Smallwood\u2019s federal habeas petition, <em>Patterson v. Gomez, </em>223 F.3d 959, 968 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Smallwood contends his Sixth Amendment right to self-representation was violated by the trial court\u2019s refusal to consider his motion pursuant to <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), unless it was in writing. Smallwood also contends the trial court erred by denying his request for access to the law library for the purpose of preparing his written <em>Faretta </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), we can reverse a state court decision denying relief only if that decision is \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The \u201cSupreme Court need not have addressed a factually identical case[;] \u00a7 2254(d) only requires that the Supreme Court clearly determine the law.\u201d <em>Houston v. Roe, </em>177 F.3d 901, 906 (9th Cir.1999). \u201c[0]ur independent review of the legal question ... [must] leave[] us with a \u2018firm conviction\u2019 that one answer, the one rejected by the [state] court, was correct and the other, the application of the federal law that the court adopted, was erroneous-in other words that clear error occurred.\u201d <em>Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1153-54 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 944, 121 S.Ct. 340, 148 L.Ed.2d 274 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The State court here properly found that Smallwood failed to make an unequivocal assertion of his right to self-representation, which is required as such a right does not attach until asserted. <em>Sandoval v. Calderon, </em>241 F.3d 765, 774 (9th Cir.2000); see <em>also Hendricks v. Zenon, </em>993 F.2d 664 669 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201cIt is well established in the Ninth Circuit [ ] that in order to invoke the Sixth Amendment right to self-representation, the request must be: (1) knowing and intelligent, and (2) unequivocal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Indeed, our review of the record belies Smallwood\u2019s contention otherwise. Moreover, Smallwood has failed to rebut by clear and convincing evidence the State court\u2019s findings that his request was not unequivocal and merely in response to the denial of his second <em>Marsden </em>motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Finally, although an incarcerated criminal defendant who chooses to represent himself has a constitutional right to access to law books or other tools to assist him in preparing a defense, there is nothing in the record before us to suggest either that the State acted or would have acted unconstitutionally in restricting or denying Smallwood such access, regardless of whether the trial court denied his request for access to the prison law library in order to prepare a written <em>Faretta </em>motion. <em>Bribiesca v. Galaza, </em>215 F.3d 1015 1020 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Because the State court\u2019s decision was not clearly erroneous, the district court properly denied Smallwood\u2019s federal habeas petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Van Tran, </em>212 F.3d at 1153-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b473-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
