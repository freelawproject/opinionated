Rowan hired an attorney who already represented one of Rowan\u2019s co-defendants, so the district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> conducted a hearing and determined a conflict did not exist. Rowan then signed a conflict waiver. With his attorney\u2019s assistance, Rowan pleaded guilty to possessing approximately one kilogram of cocaine with intent to distribute it. Rowan\u2019s written plea agreement also stipulated that approximately 452 grams of crack cocaine would be considered relevant conduct during Rowan\u2019s sentencing. Rowan told the court he understood and consented to this agreement, and the court sentenced Rowan to 151 months in prison. Rowan appeals, challenging his sentence and his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-17\">Rowan contends the district court abused its discretion because it failed to consider Rowan\u2019s request for a downward sentencing departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 (allowing a departure when the defendant\u2019s criminal history category significantly overrepresents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history). At sentencing, the court heard both parties\u2019 arguments regarding the propriety of departure and then denied Rowan\u2019s request, stating: \u201cThe court has imposed this sentence within the range applicable to you for this offense because it finds the facts to be the kind contemplated by the guidelines.\u201d Because the district court concluded Rowan\u2019s case fell within the guidelines\u2019 heartland and did not indicate it lacked the authority to depart from the guidelines, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>assume the district court recognized its authority to grant a downward departure and declined to do so. <em>See United States v. Correa, </em>167 F.3d 414, 417 (8th Cir.1999). Thus, we cannot review the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See United States v. Lim, </em>235 F.3d 382, 385 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Rowan raises three pro se challenges to his conviction, but we cannot reach the merits of these issues, either. First, Rowan\u2019s claim that he was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel because of his attorney\u2019s actual conflict relies on allegations outside the record and is more appropriately raised in a collateral proceeding. <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>59 F.3d 767, 771 (8th Cir.1995). Second, Rowan\u2019s claim that his guilty plea was involuntary is unreviewable because it was not raised in the district court. <em>See United States v. Arps, </em>197 F.3d 1202, 1203 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam). Third, Rowan\u2019s claim that the district court wrongly held him responsible for the 452 grams of crack cocaine during sentencing is rejected because, in his written plea agreement, Rowan explicitly and voluntarily consented to consideration of this drug quantity during his sentencing. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In sum, we affirm Rowan\u2019s sentence and conviction, and deny his motion to supplement the record.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b448-13\">The Honorable Paul A. Magnuson, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
