Spivey (the \u201cALJ\u201d) and the Appeals Council, denying Plaintiffs application for Supplemental Security Insurance (\u201cSSI\u201d) benefits pursuant to Title XVI of the Social Security Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-13831.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-21\">On January 17, 1997, Christian applied for SSI benefits, claiming that he became disabled on June 8, 1995, when he was injured in an automobile accident. The application was denied initially by the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d). The report stated that the SSA had \u201cconsid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>ered the medical and other information, [Christian\u2019s] age, education, training, and work experience in determining how [his] condition affects [his] ability to work.\u201d Based on Christian\u2019s description of his job as a data entry clerk, the SSA determined that his \u201ccondition [did] not prevent [him] from performing this work.\u201d Christian\u2019s application was also denied on reconsideration. Christian thereafter filed a request for a hearing before an administrative law judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Following a hearing, the ALJ issued, on June 18, 1998, a decision finding Christian not to be disabled. In reaching his decision, the ALJ applied the five-step sequential evaluation for determining whether a person is disabled within the meaning of the Act. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920. The ALJ concluded that Christian \u201cretain[ed] the residual functional capacity to return to his past relevant work and that [Christian] ha[d] not been \u2018disabled\u2019 for the 12 month duration requirement of the Act.\u201d The ALJ noted that the objective medical evidence did not support Christian\u2019s subjective complaints or his allegation of disability and, further that, although Christian\u2019s treating physicians and several examining physicians listed work restrictions for Christian, \u201ctheir conclusions do not support a finding of disabled as defined in the Act.\u201d The Appeals Council denied Christian\u2019s request for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">On appeal to this Court, Christian claims, as he did below before the district court, (1) that the ALJ failed to give proper weight to the opinions of his treating physicians, (2) that the ALJ faked to articulate adequate reasons for his finding that Christian retained the residual functional capacity for light work, and (3) that the ALJ did not apply proper legal standards when he rejected Christian\u2019s subjective complaints as not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Whhe, in reviewing the district court\u2019s decision sustaining the denial of benefits by the SSA, \u201cwe undertake our own plenary review of the administrative record,\u201d <em>Pratts v. Chater, </em>94 F.3d 34, 37 (2d Cir.1996); see <em>Curry v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 117, 122 (2d Cir.2000); <em>Schaal v. Apfel, </em>134 F.3d 496, 501 (2d Cir.1998), \u201c[i]t is not our function to determine <em>de novo </em>whether [Christian] is disabled.\u201d <em>Pratts, </em>94 F.3d at 37; see <em>Curry, </em>209 F.3d at 122; <em>Schaal, </em>134 F.3d at 501. \u201cRather, we must determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s conclusions \u2018are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole or are based on an erroneous legal standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schaal, </em>134 F.3d at 501 (citing <em>Beauvoir v. Chater, </em>104 F.3d 1432, 1433 (2d Cir.1997)); <em>accord Curry, </em>209 F.3d at 122; <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). \u201cSubstantial evidence is \u2018more than a mere scintika. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\" <em>Curry, </em>209 F.3d at 122 (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>accord Schaal, </em>134 F.3d at 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">After reviewing the administrative record, we find that the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and affirm for substantially the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
