We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">In February 2000 McGlothlin pleaded guilty to theft and firearm-related offenses. The court sentenced him to imprisonment and supervised release, and ordered him to pay \u201cin full immediately\u201d $97,724.49 in restitution and a $1,300 special assessment. Special instructions in the judgment provided that \u201cbeginning the first month of supervised release, payments will be a minimum of 10 percent of the defendant\u2019s net monthly household income.\u201d After the court denied McGlothlin\u2019s request for a repayment schedule for the time he was to be imprisoned, McGlothlin appealed. We vacated and remanded the restitution order, with instructions for the district court to impose a detailed schedule of restitution payments to commence during incarceration. <em>See United States v. McGlothlin, </em>249 F.3d 783, 785 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The day before his resentencing hearing, McGlothlin moved for a continuance. At the hearing, he testified that he had prepared legal documents but had been prevented from mailing them to his attorney or bringing them to the hearing. McGlothlin\u2019s counsel indicated that his client had wanted to make an analogy to a federal garnishment statute. The court replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s applicable here,\u201d and denied the continuance motion. Concerning restitution payments, the government requested a monthly payment of 50% of the funds \u201cavailable\u201d to McGlothlin, whereas McGlothlin sought to make payments of only 25% of his \u201cearnings\u201d so that he could save at least $1,200 for use following incarceration. The court selected 50% of McGlothlin\u2019s earnings as a reasonable amount for his payments during incarceration, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a continuance: the hearing was not complex, McGlothlin\u2019s counsel did not argue that he lacked adequate time to prepare, and McGlothlin failed to prove resulting prejudice. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>247 F.3d 741, 771 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review; moving party must be prejudiced by denial of motion to continue); <em>United States v. Little, </em>567 F.2d 346, 348-49 (8th Cir.1977) (factors in considering motion for continuance), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 969, 98 S.Ct. 1608, 56 L.Ed.2d 60 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in setting the restitution payments, based on the figures McGlothlin provided to the court regarding his monthly income and estimated expenses. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2)(B)-(C) (court shall consider defendant\u2019s projected earnings and financial obligations); <em>United States v. Riebold, </em>135 F.3d 1226, 1231 (8th Cir.) (standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>524 U.S. 944, 118 S.Ct. 2356, 141 L.Ed.2d 725 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-17\">. The Honorable Henry Woods, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
