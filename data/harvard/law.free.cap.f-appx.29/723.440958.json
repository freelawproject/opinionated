Mukasey, <em>Chief Judge), </em>construing his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas petition as an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and transferring it to us for authorization because Myers has filed previous \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>See Myers v. United States, </em>01CV3136 (S.D.N.Y. April 16, 2001) (citing <em>Liriano v. United States, </em>95 F.3d 119 (2d Cir.1996) <em>(per </em>curiam)). Because Myers failed to file an application requesting that we authorize a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, we issued an order dismissing his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Myers v. United States, </em>No. 01-3560 (2d Cir. June 13, 2001). Myers then filed in this court a <em>pro se </em>motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>A panel of this court granted this motion and appointed counsel to brief one issue: \u201cwhether 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is available to a petitioner to raise a \u2018legal innocence\u2019 claim under <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999), that was unavailable to the petitioner at the time he filed his first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Myers v. United States, </em>No. 01-2282 (2d Cir. July 11, 2001). The sole issue on appeal is whether Myers\u2019s may receive relief pursuant to \u00a7 2241 from his forty-year sentence for conducting a continuing criminal enterprise in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">We lack jurisdiction to hear Myers\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because he is incarcerated in a federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas. While a \u00a7 2255 motion may be brought in the district where the petitioner was convicted and sentenced, a \u00a7 2241 petition may be brought only in the district where the petitioner is confined, unless the district where the petitioner is confined is in the same state in which he was convicted and sentenced. <em>Id </em>\u00a7 2241(a) (\u201cWrits of habeas corpus may be granted by the Supreme Court, any justice thereof, the district courts and any circuit judge <em>within their respective jurisdictions.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); <em>id. </em>2241(d); <em>Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court, </em>410 U.S. 484, 493-501, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973); <em>Billiteri v. United States Bd of Parole, </em>541 F.2d 938, 948 (2d Cir.1976); <em>Dunne v. Henman, </em>875 F.2d 244, 247-50 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">Usually we would transfer this case to a Kansas district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, which allows for transfer from a court without jurisdiction to a court with jurisdiction \u201cif it is in the interest of justice.\u201d But it is not \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d to transfer this petition because Myers has already filed two unsuccessful \u00a7 2241 petitions in the Kansas district courts. <em>Myers v. Booker, </em>232 <em>F.3d </em>902 (table), No. 00-3232, 2000 WL 1595967, at *1 (10th Cir. Oct.26, 2000). Myers filed the present action only after the Tenth Circuit dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>rejecting on the merits the identical claims he raised before Chief Judge Mukasey. <em>See </em>2000 WL 1595967, at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Myers\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
