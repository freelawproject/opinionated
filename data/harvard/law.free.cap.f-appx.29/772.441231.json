Accordingly, citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on Han-ton\u2019s claims that the defendants prevented him from attending religious services on October 9, 1997 and October 12 through October 30,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The district court then turned to the merits of Hanton\u2019s free exercise claims with respect to which it had found that he had exhausted his administrative remedies, <em>i.e., </em>his claims that he was denied religious services on August 7 and October 10 and 11, 1997. The district court dismissed Hanton\u2019s claim that he was denied services on October 11 for failure to allege the defendants\u2019 personal involvement. As for Hanton\u2019s claims that he was denied religious services on August 7 and October 10, 1997, the district court held that \u201cthe plaintiff was not deprived of reasonable opportunities to practice his religion by being unable to attend congregate religious services on two days during a three month period in 1997 and that the defendants did not violate his First Amendment right to practice his religion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See <em>Tenenbaum v. Williams, </em>193 F.3d 581, 593 (2d Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1098, 120 S.Ct. 1832, 146 L.Ed.2d 776 (2000). Summary judgment is required where \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), <em>i.e., </em>\u201cwhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). A fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d for these purposes if it \u201cmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). An issue of fact is \u201cgenuine\u201d if \u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We resolve all ambiguities and factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, but require the non-movant to come forward with specific facts creating a genuine issue for trial rather than simply offer eonclusory allegations. <em>See Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 585-87, 106 S.Ct. 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Having reviewed the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo, </em>we agree that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that summary judgment was properly granted for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated herein and in the district court\u2019s opinion, <em>see Hanton v. Mathiau, </em>98-cv-1388 (D.Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Sept. 19, 2000), the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
