We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because McSheffry\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-21\">Parties are accorded thirty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-23\">The district court\u2019s order was filed on July 30, 2001, and entered on the docket on July 31, 2001. MeSheffry\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on October 25, 2001. Because MeSheffry failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We further deny McSheffry\u2019s motion for a transcript. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
