Stein, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b771-5\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">IN CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be and it hereby is REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Plaintiff Ellen Fitzgerald appeals from the court\u2019s entry of judgment as a matter of law in favor of defendant, overturning a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff. Plaintiffs action against her former employer alleged hostile environment and constructive discharge constituting unlawful sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>New York State Human Rights Law, Executive Law \u00a7 296 <em>et seq.; </em>and Administrative Code of the City of New York \u00a7 8-101 <em>et seq. </em>The jury found for Fitzgerald on the hostile environment claim and awarded $80,000 in compensatory damages. Following the verdict, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment as a matter of law, concluding that the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Fitzgerald, did not show a hostile environment \u201csufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of Fitzgerald\u2019s employment,\u201d as required by <em>Mentor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, </em>477 U.S. 57, 67, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s grant of a judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b), we apply the same standard as the district court. <em>Eagleston v. Guido, </em>41 F.3d 865, 875 (2d Cir.1994). Such a judgment is proper only if the evidence cannot reasonably support a verdict in favor of the non-moving party. <em>McCarthy v. New York City Technical College, </em>202 F.3d 161, 165 (2d Cir.2000); <em>Fisher v. Vassar Coll., </em>114 F.3d 1332, 1346 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">In passing on such a motion, a court is obligated to assess the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Although the court stated that it \u201cassume[d] the correctness of Fitzgerald\u2019s version of the facts,\u201d the court on numerous instances construed significant evidence in a light more favorable to the defendant-employer. As examples, notwithstanding Fitzgerald\u2019s testimony that she was offended by her supervisor\u2019s conduct toward her and had a poor working relationship with him, coupled with the supervisor\u2019s own testimony that their relationship was \u201cgoing to hostilities\u201d and that he refused to work with her, the court found that Fitzgerald had a \u201ccomfortable working relationship\u201d with the supervisor and that he was \u201chighly supportive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">Where Fitzgerald testified to the effect that her socializing with various coworkers who harassed her represented her effort to make the best of her employment situation, the court construed this evidence as showing that her relationship with the coworkers was friendly.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">As for Fitzgerald\u2019s evidence that her supervisor repeatedly called her \u201cbutch\u201d and \u201cdyke,\u201d the court treated these events as a joke of no significance for plaintiffs claim of sexual harassment on the ground that no one in fact \u201cthought that Fitzgerald was a lesbian.\u201d A 2697</p>\n<p id=\"b771-15\">And where an associate sent Fitzgerald an email saying \u201cyou know who to come to and I can take care of you,\u201d the court dismissed this as \u201ccrude humor\u201d without significance for the sex discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>claim, because there was no indication he was in fact propositioning her. A 2703</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">As to these and other matters, the jury could have found that the defendant\u2019s conduct did not have the innocuous cast that the district court put on it, but rather represented successful efforts to belittle and humiliate Fitzgerald by reason of her gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The evidence furthermore included several instances in which lawyers, including partners, made remarks belittling female lawyers. It was suggested that one female lawyer had become a partner only by rendering sexual favors.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff \u2014 as the jury was entitled to do \u2014 we have no doubt that the jury could reasonably find a gender biased pattern of discriminatory conduct constituting a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Defendant makes a cavalcade of other arguments which, it asserts, justify a directed verdict in its favor, or, at a minimum, a new trial. We have considered all of these, and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, and because we find that the jury verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor was properly supported by the evidence, we direct that the jury verdict be reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
