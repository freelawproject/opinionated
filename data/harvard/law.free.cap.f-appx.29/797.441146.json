(the \u201cAct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b828-18\">Figueroa applied for disability benefits on April 6, 1995, claiming that she had been disabled since May 31, 1989 due to back pain and asthma. The application was denied initially and then again on reconsideration. Figueroa thereafter requested a hearing before an ALJ. Following the hearing, the ALJ issued, on June 21, 1996, a decision finding that Figueroa was not disabled. In reaching his decision, the ALJ applied the five-step sequential evaluation for determining whether a person is disabled within the meaning of the Act. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920. Though the ALJ found that Figueroa did suffer from \u201c \u2018severe\u2019 asthma and a back disorder,\u201d he also held that \u201cclaimant\u2019s subjective complaints are inconsistent with the objective medical evidence and are not fully credible.\u201d Despite her impairments, according to the ALJ\u2019s findings: \u201cclaimant has the residual functional capacity to perform work-related activities except for work involving excessive exposure to noxious inhalants, or lifting more than 10 pounds occasionally, or walking more than two hours per day.... The claimant\u2019s past relevant work as data entry clerk/computer operator did not require the performance of work-related activities precluded by the above limitation.\u201d Thus, the ALJ stated that Figueroa was not disabled at any point prior to the date of decision. The Appeals Council denied Figueroa\u2019s request for review on January 21, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-19\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b828-20\">On appeal to this Court, Figueroa claims, as she did before the district court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>(1) that the ALJ failed to give proper weight to the opinion of her treating physician, Dr. Luis E. Guerrero, and (2) that the ALJ failed properly to evaluate Figueroa\u2019s subjective complaints and credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">When deciding an appeal from a denial of social security disability benefits, \u201cwe focus on the administrative ruling rather than the district court\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Curry v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 117, 122 (2d Cir.2000); <em>see Schaal v. Apfel, </em>134 F.3d 496, 500-01 (2d Cir.1998). In reviewing the district court\u2019s decision, \u201cwe undertake our own plenary review of the administrative record.\u201d <em>Pratts v. Chafer, </em>94 F.3d 34, 37 (2d Cir.1996); <em>see Curry, </em>209 F.3d at 122; <em>Schaal, </em>134 F.3d at 501. But \u201c[i]t is not our function to determine <em>de novo </em>whether [Appellant] is disabled.\u201d <em>Pratts, </em>94 F.3d at 37; <em>see Curry, </em>209 F.3d at 122; <em>Schaal, </em>134 F.3d at 501; <em>Pratts, </em>94 F.3d at 37. \u201cRather, we must determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s conclusions \u2018are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole or are based on an erroneous legal standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schaal, </em>134 F.3d at 501 (quoting <em>Beauvoir v. Chafer, </em>104 F.3d 1432, 1433 (2d Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>accord Curry, </em>209 F.3d at 122; <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Diaz v. Shalala, </em>59 F.3d 307, 312 (2d Cir.1995). \u201cSubstantial evidence is \u2018more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Curry, </em>209 F.3d at 122 (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)); <em>accord Schaal, </em>134 F.3d at 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">After reviewing the administrative record, we conclude, substantially for the reasons given by the district court, that the ALJ\u2019s decision that Figueroa is not disabled is sufficiently supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">We have considered all of Figueroa\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
