The milk he adulterated was dumped into tanker trucks which delivered the milk to processing plants. When it reached the plants, the milk was then added to large silos; all of the milk in the silos was adulterated as a result. The milk from the silos was then distributed into interstate commerce for purchase and consumption. Santana-Mendoza pleaded guilty to conspiracy to deliver adulterated food for introduction into interstate commerce, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(a), 333(a)(2), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-24\">In calculating the loss caused by the defendant\u2019s scheme for a sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(1), the district court adopted as the relevant volume of contaminated milk the total amount of milk in the tanker trucks that collected milk from Santana-Mendoza\u2019s farm. In doing so, the court rejected the government\u2019s contention that the loss should be measured on the basis of all the milk contained in the silos, and also rejected the defendant\u2019s assertion that the loss should be calculated on the basis of the amount of water added to the milk. This resulted in a final offense level of 13, for which the district court imposed a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>tence of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment, a fine of $3,000, and a supervised release term of 3 years. Santana-Mendoza here appeals the district court\u2019s calculation of loss, reasserting his contention that the relevant volume in figuring loss under \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(1) was the amount of water which he caused to be added to the silos.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Our recent decision in <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Alvarez, </em>277 F.3d 73, is dispositive of this issue. The relevant volume of milk for the purpose of calculating loss under the Guidelines was the entire supply of contaminated milk in the silos. Because the government did not cross-appeal in this case, however, we decline to remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
