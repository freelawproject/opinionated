We affirmed his sentence in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">In 1997, Williams filed a petition for habeas corpus in the Eastern District of New York (pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255) arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that his conviction on the \u00a7 924(e)(1) count should be vacated in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995). On July 25, 1997, the district court vacated Williams\u2019 \u00a7 924(c)(1) conviction under <em>Bailey </em>and denied all other claims for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Williams was directed to be produced for resentencing, which was delayed due to clerical error until June 27, 2000. At re-sentencing, Williams argued (inter alia) that a portion of the 68.9 grams of cocaine base found in his apartment was for personal consumption, and that the court should subtract that amount in calculating his Guidelines range and in deciding whether he was subject to the statutory minimum sentence (under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)) of 240-months\u2019 imprisonment for possession of more than 50 grams of cocaine base. The district court found that all the cocaine was possessed for distribution, reasoning in part that the jury was \u201cquite specifically instructed ... on the difference between drugs which are possessed for purposes of personal use and drugs which are possessed for the purposes of distribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">On appeal, Williams (i) challenged that finding and (ii) argued that the sentence violated Apprendi <em>v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). With respect to the personal use question, we held that it was clear error for the district court to rely on the jury verdict, because the jury was in fact instructed that \u201c[i]t is sufficient if the government has proved that the defendant possessed cocaine with intent to distribute it, <em>regardless of what its quantity was.\u201d United States v. Williams, </em>247 F.3d 353, 359 (2d Cir.2001) (emphasis added). Additionally, we considered the <em>Apprendi </em>question, but made no ruling, recommending, instead, that the district court await our decision in <em>United States v. Guevara, </em>277 F.3d 111 (2d Cir.2001) \u2014 a \u201ccase [that] raises the same <em>Apprendi </em>question that the defendant in this case presents.... \u201d <em>Williams, </em>247 F.3d at 359-60 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">On remand, the district court declined to stay its decision for <em>Guevara </em>and held, instead, \u201cthat Apprendi was not offended.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>146 F.Supp.2d 249, 262 (E.D.N.Y.2001). The district court resentenced Williams to 240 months of imprisonment, and issued a lengthy opinion clarifying alternative bases for its personal use finding. <em>Id. </em>at 255-62. Now, appealing that ruling, Williams reasserts both his <em>Apprendi </em>claim and his argument that the district court\u2019s personal use finding constitutes clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">As an initial matter, we affirm the court\u2019s district court\u2019s findings on personal use. The district court provided a number of grounds for finding that Williams possessed the entire 68.9 grams of cocaine base for distribution, citing: (1) Williams\u2019 post-arrest statement that he bought and sold the cocaine to buy jewelry and clothes for his wife and children; (2) Williams\u2019 statement, reported in the Pre-sentence Report (PSR), that he had not used cocaine or crack in the two years preceding his arrest; (3) the absence of objection by Williams at sentencing to any information in the PSR; (4) the absence of any proffered evidence of personal drug use by Williams; (5) Williams\u2019 possession of tools of the drug trade, including a scale, strainers, bullet-proof vest, and weapons; (6) the testimony at trial of an expert, explaining how this equipment is used for processing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>and packaging cocaine base for sale; and (7) the amount of drugs possessed. <em>Id. </em>at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">That evidence, sufficiently supports the finding that all of the drugs were possessed for distribution. <em>See White v. White Rose Food, </em>237 F.3d 174, 178 (2d Cir.2001) (holding that we review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error). Therefore, the district court properly considered the full weight in calculating Williams\u2019 Guidelines range. Having reached that conclusion, we are now compelled to decide whether, under <em>Apprendi, </em>that judge-made finding is also sufficient to support a statutory minimum sentence (under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)), where that sentence exceeds Williams\u2019 Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\"><em>Apprendi </em>holds that \u201cany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Williams\u2019 240-month statutory <em>minimum </em>sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) matches (but does not exceed) the 240-month statutory <em>maximum </em>sentence to which he otherwise would be exposed under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (the statute applicable to drug trafficking offenses under \u00a7 841(a) involving an indeterminate quantity of drugs). However, Williams\u2019 contends that the rule in <em>Apprendi </em>was violated because his sentence <em>does </em>exceed his otherwise applicable Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Recognizing that the <em>Guevara </em>appeal presented the same question, we elected to delay our ruling on Williams\u2019 <em>Apprendi </em>claim pending the decision in <em>Guevara. </em>The <em>Guevara </em>opinion was filed recently, and in light of its ruling, we now hold that because the finding of the quantity of drugs Williams possessed for distribution took his sentence outside his Guidelines range, the finding must be made by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">In <em>Guevara, </em>we reasoned that the Guidelines have \u201cthe force and effect of laws\u201d; therefore, Apprendi\u2019s protections apply to findings that remove the defendant\u2019s sentence from the Guidelines range. <em>Guevara, </em>277 F.3d at 118 (quoting <em>Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 523 n. 11, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (Thomas, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The defendant in <em>Guevara, </em>like Williams, was sentenced under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) on the basis of a judge\u2019s preponderance finding of drug weight. <em>Id. </em>at 116. <em>Guevara </em>held that \u201conce the Guideline range is calculated, facts that increase a defendant\u2019s sentence above this must be found by a jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122. Accordingly, the sentencing in <em>Guevara </em>constituted plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 123. Following <em>Guevara, </em>we vacate Williams\u2019 sentence and remand for resentencing within Williams\u2019 applicable Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part and VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
