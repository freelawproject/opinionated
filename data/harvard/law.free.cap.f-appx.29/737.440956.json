Munera pled guilty to conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine, and to possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Munera contends that the district court erred by not permitting him to make a new proffer to satisfy the \u201csafety valve\u201d provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6), and 5C1.2(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">In an effort to qualify for the safety valve, Mu\u00f1era made proffers at two meetings with the Government\u2019s attorneys, and after each proffer the Government concluded that he had lied. The Government gave Mu\u00f1era an additional opportunity to make a proffer, which Mu\u00f1era indicated that he was not interested in pursuing. On December 7, 2000, the day set for sentencing, Mu\u00f1era requested that the court adjourn sentencing to permit him to make a new proffer. SA 35 The court adjourned sentencing, and the Government scheduled a meeting to permit Mu\u00f1era to make a proffer, but on the day scheduled, the defense canceled, telling the Government that Mu\u00f1era no longer wished to meet. On January 29, 2001, when sentencing resumed, the court explained that he would not be entitled to receive the benefit of the safety valve provisions because of his untruthful answers and refusal to meet with the Government. Mu\u00f1era then asked to make a proffer. The district court properly rejected the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">This ruling was proper. The defendant has the burden of showing that he has met the criteria of the safety valve provisions. <em>United States v. Gambino, </em>106 F.3d 1105, 1110 (2d Cir.1997). The Guidelines permit application of the safety valve where <em>\u201cnot later than the time of the sentencing hearing, </em>the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(5) (emphasis added). On this record, the defendant cannot satisfy that burden.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
