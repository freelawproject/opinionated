Dion M. ALLEN, a/k/a \u201cFathead\u201d, Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b849-14\">No. 01-1908.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b849-15\">United States Court of Appeals, Third Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b849-17\">Submitted Jan. 17, 2002.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b849-18\">Jan. 30, 2002.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b850-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Before ALITO and ROTH, Circuit Judges, and SCHWARZER, Senior District Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b850-6\">MEMORANDUM OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b850-7\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">Because we write for the parties only, the background of the case need not be set out. We reject the appellant\u2019s argument that this Court has jurisdiction to review this appeal, which involves the District Court\u2019s discretionary refusal to grant a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. We therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">Athough this Court is without jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s discretionary refusal to grant a downward departure from the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range, this Court does have jurisdiction over an appeal from a District Court\u2019s refusal to depart downward when it believes that it lacks the authority to do so. <em>United States v. Higgins, </em>967 F.2d 841, 844 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">In this case, the defendant asked for a downward departure on a ground that is well recognized in the case law, namely, that his criminal history overstated the severity of his past offenses. Both parties presented relevant case law to the District Court supporting its discretionary authority to grant a downward departure, if it found such a departure warranted in this case. The government conceded that the District Court had the power to grant the downward departure, while arguing that it should not do so given the facts of this case. The District Court ultimately agreed with the government\u2019s position. Athough the District Court said that it saw no \u201cbasis\u201d for granting the downward departure, we interpret that statement to mean that the facts here did not warrant the downward departure under prior precedent. This interpretation is bolstered by the District Court\u2019s statement that it could see no basis for the departure \u201cin this case.\u201d Under this reasonable interpretation, the District Court\u2019s conclusion would be an unreviewable discretionary refusal to depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">We have considered all of the defendant\u2019s arguments and see no basis for finding jurisdiction over this appeal. Therefore, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
