Cogburn entered into an oral plea agreement and pleaded guilty to unlawfully transporting a stolen car in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312. Eight days later, Cogburn was convicted on an unrelated charge of petty theft arising out of a December 2000 shoplifting incident. Five months later, pretrial services reported that a June 2001 urine sample provided by Cogburn had tested positive for amphetamine, methamphetamine, marijuana, and cocaine. At Cogburris August 2001 sentencing hearing on the charge of transporting a stolen car in interstate commerce, she claimed a two-point sentencing level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> denied this request, adopting the presentence report recommendation that Cogburn not receive a reduction because of her post-plea agreement petty theft conviction and illegal drug use. Cogburn was sentenced to eight months in prison. Cogburn appeals the denial of a reduction in her sentencing level.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-18\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a sentencing level reduction for clear error. <em>See United States v. Byrd, </em>76 F.3d 194, 195 (8th Cir.1996). Defendants often request an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility after pleading guilty, but a guilty plea does not automatically entitle a defendant to a downward adjustment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 Application Note 3 (2001). The court may consider many factors when deciding whether to grant this adjustment, including whether a defendant has voluntarily withdrawn from criminal conduct. <em>Id. </em>at Application Note 1(b). When evaluating Cogburris request for an acceptance of responsibility reduction, the district court was acting within its discretion when it considered Cogburris post-plea agreement petty theft conviction and illegal drug use, even though both incidents of criminal conduct were unrelated to the offense for which Cogburn was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>being sentenced. <em>See Byrd, </em>76 F.3d at 197. Because the district court did not commit clear error when it denied Cog-burn an acceptance of responsibility sentencing reduction, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-15\"> The Honorable Gary A. Fenner, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
