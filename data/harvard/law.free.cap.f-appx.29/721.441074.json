On appeal, Small asserts (1) that the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant him a mitigating role adjustment; (2) that the district court failed to understand its discretion to downwardly depart because the amount of laundered money attributable to Small allegedly overstates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>his culpability; and (3) that the district court committed plain error by citing to a summary order during the sentencing hearing. These arguments are all without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Small asserts that he should have received a two point mitigating role downward adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) because his role during the beginning of the conspiracy was minor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree. While Small\u2019s role in the conspiracy increased in 2000 near the end of the conspiracy, he had a supervisory role in the conspiracy beginning at least as early as 1998 when he recruited and supervised another member of the conspiracy. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to grant Small a mitigating role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Small\u2019s argument that the district court failed to recognize its discretion to downwardly depart pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 is similarly without merit. Small did not raise this argument before the district court so we review it only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>263 F.3d 1, 4 (2d Cir.2001) (citation omitted). We find that there was no error, much less plain error. Absent evidence to the contrary, we presume that the district court understood its discretion to downwardly depart. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>98 F.3d 690, 694 (2d Cir.1996) (citation omitted). Small does not point to any evidence in the record that indicates that the district court failed to understand its discretion to depart downwardly, and our independent review of the record also reveals no misunderstanding. Small\u2019s argument to the contrary therefore must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Finally, Small assets that he was sentenced in error because the district court cited an unpublished decision of this court. While the district court did violate \u00a7 0.23 of the rules of this Court by citing the unpublished decision, Small\u2019s argument still fails. Small did not raise this argument before the district court and has failed to demonstrate how the district court\u2019s citation to a summary order caused him prejudice. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>274 F.3d 655, 668 (2d Cir.2001) (in banc) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">We have considered Small\u2019s remaining arguments and find them all to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\">. Notably, Small does not challenge the three point managerial role adjustment he received pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
