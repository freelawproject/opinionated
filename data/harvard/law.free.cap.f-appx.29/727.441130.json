Fuller appeals from a judgment entered on May 16, 2001, by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Batts, <em>J.), </em>revoking his supervised release and sentencing him to 23 months\u2019 incarceration. In 1996, defendant was convicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri on one count of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. He was sentenced to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by three years\u2019 supervised release. On December 31, 1997, defendant was released from federal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Defendant\u2019s time in supervised release (both under the jurisdiction of the Eastern District of Missouri and, more recently, under the jurisdiction of the Southern District of New York) has been marked by repeated violations of his supervision, most often involving the use of marijuana. For present purposes, it suffices to recount that on July 10, 2000, defendant pleaded guilty before Judge Batts of the Southern District of New York to violating his supervision through unlawful possession of a marijuana cigarette. Judge Batts imposed a sentence of time served (approximately 40 hours\u2019 incarceration) and re-imposed a three-year period of supervised release. Judge Batts, however, expressly warned defendant that further violations of his supervision would result in his incarceration for the maximum statutory sentence. On May 4, 2001, defendant pleaded guilty to charges by the Probation Office that he had tested positive for marijuana use on four occasions between August 10, 2000 and November 28, 2000 \u2014 a \u201cGrade C\u201d violation of supervised release under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4 (2001) (policy statement). Thereafter, on May 16, 2001, Judge Batts revoked defendant\u2019s supervised release, imposed a sentence of 23 months incarceration, recommended that defendant be placed in a residential drug treatment program, and declined to impose any term of supervised release following his imprisonment. In imposing this sentence, Judge Batts also noted that defendant had failed to report to his probation officer on at least six occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the recommended term of imprisonment for a Class C violation of supervised release is three to nine months. <em>See id. </em>This is a recommendation only, however, and takes the form of a \u201cpolicy statement\u201d rather than a guideline. Although policy statements must be considered in sentencing, see <em>United States v. Sweeney, </em>90 F.3d 55, 57 (2d Cir.1996), they are \u201cadvisory, rather than binding.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>15 F.3d 278, 284 (2d Cir.1994). In the absence of an applicable guideline, a defendant may obtain reversal of a sentence imposed for a violation of supervised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>release by demonstrating that the sentence was \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4); <em>see United, States v. Wirth, </em>250 F.3d 165, 169 (2d Cir.2001). As we have noted, we will affirm a sentence imposed outside the recommended range for a violation of supervised release, \u201cprovided (1) the district court considered the applicable policy statements; (2) the sentence is within the statutory maximum; and (3) the sentence is reasonable.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>15 F.3d at 284. The statutory maximum applicable to defendant\u2019s violation was two years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Defendant argues that his sentence was \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d given (a) the recommendation of the Probation Office and Government at sentencing that he be sentenced within the range established by the Guidelines\u2019 policy statement, (b) the minor, non-violent nature of his offense, and (c) the fact that he had maintained steady employment during most of his release and was supporting a son. Defendant further argues that a sentence for mere marijuana use that falls so close to the maximum of the applicable statutory sentencing range leaves no \u201croom\u201d to impose higher sentences on other offenders with records of violent, or at least more serious, crimes. However, in light of defendant\u2019s repeated failure to abide by the conditions of his supervised release, the district court\u2019s previous leniency, and its clear warning to the defendant of the likely consequences of further violations, we cannot conclude that the district court\u2019s sentence was \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Accord United States v. Pelensky, </em>129 F.3d 63, 70 (2d Cir.1997) (concluding that maximum sentence for violation of supervised release through substance abuse was within district court\u2019s discretion where court had previously warned defendant that further violations would result in stiffer sentence). <em>See also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) (listing purposes relevant to determination of sentence, including need \u201cto promote respect for the law,\u201d and for \u201cdeterrence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">We have considered all of defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the District Court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
