On or about July 22, 1999, Maslin and his then-attorney entered into a proffer agreement with the Government, which provided in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny statements made by your client are on the record, that is, any statements Defendant makes can and will be used by the government against Defendant, except as limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>below.\u201d Maslin thereafter gave a debriefing statement to the Government in which he made admissions regarding his involvement with the crime charged. Subsequently, the parties entered into plea negotiations, which ultimately failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">In the interim, the trial, which was originally scheduled for December 27, 1999, was adjourned to permit a competency evaluation of Maslin. Following a notice issued by the district court on February 28, 2000, scheduling the trial for March 7, 2000, defense counsel requested a further adjournment on the grounds (1) that Maslin had only been recently released from a federal facility in Virginia, where he had undergone psychiatric evaluation, and that, during Maslin\u2019s confinement there, \u201cit was virtually impossible for [counsel] to speak with [Maslin] regarding his defensef,] thus hindering [counsel\u2019s] ability to prepare his case,\u201d (2) that defense counsel had not been aware that trial was imminent, and (3) that he had not yet received discovery materials from the prosecutor. With respect to discovery, defense counsel acknowledged that the prosecutor had made the materials, which were characterized as \u201cnumerous and voluminous,\u201d available at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. Based on the foregoing, defense counsel argued that \u201cit would be unfair to compel ... Maslin to stand trial with such short notice and without the ability to review all of the documents and evidence that may be presented against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The district court denied Maslin\u2019s motion for a continuance and, since Maslin had been found competent to stand trial- and no parties objected to that finding, the court proceeded with the trial. At trial, the Government introduced, in its case-in-chief, admissions made by Maslin during the course of the debriefing that was conducted pursuant to the proffer agreement that Maslin had entered into with the Government. Because no audio recordings or verbatim transcripts of Maslin\u2019s statements were made during the debriefing, the Government introduced the testimony of John Bokal, an agent of the FBI who was present during the debriefing, regarding his recollection of the admissions there made by Maslin.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">On appeal, Maslin makes several claims, including (1) that the district court erred in permitting the Government to introduce Maslin\u2019s debriefing statements as part of its case-in-chief, (2) that the district court abused its discretion when it denied Maslin\u2019s motion for a continuance, (3) that there was insufficient evidence of a single conspiracy, and (4) that Maslin\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to file pretrial motions and adequately to request or obtain discovery. In addition, Maslin filed a brief, <em>pro se, </em>in which he contends (1) that he was denied his right to a speedy trial, and (2) that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">With respect to the first claim, Maslin argues that the proffer agreement was ambiguous regarding the admissibility of his statements and that, in any event, he did not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waive his rights under Fed.R.Evid. 410 and Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(6). The district court\u2019s interpretation of a proffer agreement is a matter of contractual interpretation and, hence, a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. United States v. Liranzo, </em>944 F.2d 73, 77 (2d Cir.1991). Defense counsel made several hearsay objections during Bokal\u2019s testimony. At no time, however, did the defense object to the admissibility of Maslin\u2019s debriefing statements on the grounds either that Maslin\u2019s statements were inadmissible in the Government\u2019s case-in-chief, or that Maslin had not knowingly, intelligently or voluntarily waived his rights under Fed.R.Evid. 410 and Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(6) to permit such statements to be admitted at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>his trial. Because this claim was not raised before the district court, it is deemed unpreserved and, thus, forfeited on appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 464, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). While we acknowledge that, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), the failure of a timely objection would not deprive us of the discretion to review Maslin\u2019s forfeited claim on appeal, we decline to exercise such discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">We have considered all of Maslin\u2019s remaining contentions and have found them to be without merit. The district court\u2019s judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
