The record demonstrates that the district court was fully aware of its authority to grant a downward departure but determined that the defendant had not established that a departure was warranted under the applicable guideline. Because denials of motions for downward departure are reviewable only where the district court fails to recognize its authority to depart downward under the guidelines, the judgment below must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-15\">Gulley and a co-defendant were indicted for the manufacture and possession of methamphetamine with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). When a question arose about Gulley\u2019s competence to enter a guilty plea, the district court ordered a psychological evaluation. After examining Gulley, Dr. David Solovey concluded that he was competent to enter a plea. However, Dr. Solovey also reported that Gulley \u201chas suffered from [bjrain injury as a result of several minor head injuries and a severe one from a motorcycle accident in 1993.\u201d He further noted that Gulley was manic depressive and \u201ctaking medications to maintain emotional and mental stability.\u201d Intelligence testing revealed that Gulley\u2019s intellectual capacity was in the \u201cvery low\u201d range, with an IQ of 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-16\">After Gulley\u2019s counsel provided Dr. Solovey\u2019s report to the government and the court. Gulley pleaded guilty to the sole count of the indictment. Prior to the sentencing hearing three months later, Gulley filed with the district court a sentencing memorandum and motion for downward departure, citing several grounds that he believed supported a downward departure. The most significant among them, and the only one at issue here, was Gulley\u2019s limited mental capacity. Gulley relied on Dr. So-lovey\u2019s findings regarding his brain injury and limited intelligence in arguing that his \u201csignificantly reduced mental capacity\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>qualified him for a departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">At Gulley\u2019s sentencing hearing, his lawyer explained to the court that her client\u2019s \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d was the \u201cstrongest basis\u201d for a downward departure. The district court directed Gulley\u2019s counsel\u2019s attention to the application note to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13, which requires that a defendant seeking a downward departure under that guideline have \u201ca significantly impaired ability to (A) understand the wrongfulness of the behavior comprising the offense or to exercise the power of reason; or (B) control behavior that the defendant knows is wrongful.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13, cmt. (n.l). The court asked Gulley\u2019s lawyer \u201cto speak to those two items.\u201d After Gulley\u2019s counsel was heard, the court made the following observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">From this doctor\u2019s report and from what you\u2019ve indicated, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question but that Mr. Gulley has a diminished mental capacity, both in terms of how he compares with the general population and also how he compares with himself at some former time. The application note indicates that the reduced mental capacity has to be significant, and it says that there has to be an \u201cimpaired ability to understand the wrongfulness of the behavior or (2) an impaired ability to control behavior that the defendant knows is wrongful.\u201d I don\u2019t see that much in the report, other than what we\u2019ve already talked about that really helps the Court on those two scores, but I don\u2019t think there is any issue that Mr. Gulley has a diminished capacity. I think my question here is whether it meets the two criteria set forth in the application note.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In response, Gulley\u2019s counsel suggested that Dr. Solovey\u2019s report \u201cdemonstrates that Mr. Gully does have problems with controlling behavior, making good judgments.\u201d The court responded by noting that such problems are common to criminal defendants, and that the language of the guideline suggested that something more was needed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">I wouldn\u2019t speak in terms of percentages, but many of the offenders that we see commit what we would consider almost irrational crimes. They\u2019re impulsive, they have difficulty controlling their impulses, and they exercise poor judgment. That\u2019s a characteristic of their lives. So I don\u2019t think that that in and of itself must be what the authors of the guidelines are talking about .... I think that what they\u2019re getting at is something less than the old definition of insanity but something that is out of the ordinary, something that is \u2014 I won\u2019t say \u201cunique,\u201d but at least is rare, separating people that would fall within this guideline from the large category of defendants that we see who repeatedly commit crimes ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">The court went on to note that of the two defendants charged in the indictment, it was Gulley who was the \u201cleader\u201d in the methamphetamine-manufacturing operation. Referring back to the application note, the court denied the motion for downward departure, concluding that it \u201ccannot make a finding that Mr. Gulley suffered from a significantly reduced mental capacity, although, as the Court stated, it is convinced that he does suffer from a reduced mental capacity.\u201d Ultimately, the court sentenced Gulley to a term of 33 months imprisonment, the low end of the applicable guideline range of 33-41 months. Gulley appeals from this sentence, arguing that the district court erred in refusing to grant a downward departure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">It is now well-settled under Sixth Circuit precedent that \u201cthe refusal of a district judge to make a downward departure is not ordinarily appealable.\u201d <em>United States v. Byrd, </em>53 F.3d 144, 145 (6th Cir.1995). In fact, we \u201cmay review a denial of a downward departure only if the district court incorrectly believed that it lacked the authority to grant such a departure as a matter of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Owusu, </em>199 F.3d 329, 349 (6th Cir.2000). Moreover, the district judge is not under an obligation to state affirmatively that he knows he has the power to make a down-</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">ward departure but declines to do so. <em>See Byrd, </em>53 F.3d at 145. And, the reviewing court \u201cshould be reluctant to \u2018treat as ambiguous\u2019 a ruling which does not affirmatively state that the judge knew he could depart downward but failed to do so,\u201d but should instead assume that the district court, \u201c \u2018in the exercise of its discretion, found downward departure unwarranted.\u2019 \u201d <em>See id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Barrera-Baron, </em>996 F.2d 244, 245-46 (10th Cir. 1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">It is plain from the record that the district court was aware of its authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>issue a sentence below the applicable guideline range upon a determination that the Gulley\u2019s mental condition met the requirements of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13. Not only did the court entertain oral argument on Gulley\u2019s written motion seeking a downward departure under that provision, but the district court made several statements regarding its applicability during the sentencing hearing. The court made clear that it was not convinced that Gulley suffered from a <em>\u201csignificantly </em>reduced mental capacity,\u201d as contemplated by the guideline. Further, the court invited Gulley\u2019s counsel to explain how Gulley met the definition set forth in the guideline\u2019s application note for \u201csignificantly reduced mental capacity.\u201d The court\u2019s pointed statements and questions of counsel demonstrate that it was fully aware of its authority but concluded that Gulley\u2019s mental limitations were not severe enough to warrant a downward departure. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Shabazz, </em>263 F.3d 603, 611 (6th Cir.2001) (\u201cUnless Shabazz would have us believe that the district court heard arguments on a motion that it thought it lacked the legal authority to grant, only an affirmative statement could more directly reflect the district court\u2019s knowledge of its discretion to depart.\u201d). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Notwithstanding the district court\u2019s acknowledgment of its authority, Gulley argues that our intervening holding in <em>United States v. Sadolsky, </em>234 F.3d 938 (6th Cir.2000), changed the law with respect to the application of section 5K2.13. After a review of that opinion, we conclude that <em>Sadolsky </em>is not applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\n<em>For the reasons set out above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\">. Although not raised by the parties on appeal, we note a problem with the notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>appeal in this case. The judgment and commitment order was signed on September 21, 2000, and entered by the district cotut on October 3, 2000. Thus, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1)(A), Gulley\u2019s notice of appeal was due to be filed on or before October 13, 2000. On November 2, 2000, Gulley moved unopposed under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4) for an enlargement of time in which to file a notice of appeal. The district court granted the motion on November 7, 2000, stating that Gulley \"shall have an additional 30 days from November 2, 2000 within which to file an appeal in this matter.\u201d Gulley filed his notice of appeal on November 20, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"AkH\">Notwithstanding the language of the district court's November 7 order, Gulley\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed. Rule 4(b)(4) provides that \"[ujpon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may\u2014 before or after the time has expired, with or without motion or notice \u2014 extend the time to file a notice of appeal <em>for a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(b).\u201d </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the district court was authorized to enlarge the time for Gulley to file his notice of appeal until no later than November 13, 2000, which is 30 days from the expiration of the time prescribed by Rule 4(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"Adk\">Given that the notice of appeal of November 20 was filed one week late, the question becomes whether Gulley\u2019s motion to enlarge the time in which to appeal, filed on November 7, can be deemed the \"functional equivalent\u201d of a notice of appeal. <em>See Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 248, 112 S.Ct. 678, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992). In <em>Smith, </em>the Supreme Court held that a filing not meeting the formal requirements of a notice of appeal may be treated as a proper notice where \"the filing is timely under Rule 4 and conveys the information required by Rule 3(c).\" <em>Id. </em>at 249. In <em>United States v. Christoph, </em>904 F.2d 1036, 1040 (6th Cir.1990), this court treated a motion for enlargement of time as a notice of appeal where the motion met the requirements of Rule 3(c).</p>\n<p id=\"AUKR\">We conclude that Gulley\u2019s motion can be treated as the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal. The information contained in the motion satisfies the requirements of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c), in that it specifies the party taking the appeal and the judgment being appealed. Although the motion does not specify the <em>court </em>to which the appeal was being taken as required by Rule 3(c)(1)(C), this court held in <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>184 F.3d 556, (6th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc) </em>that \"where only one avenue of appeal exists, Rule 3(c)(1)(C) is satisfied even if the notice of appeal does not name the appellate court.\u201d The motion was filed on November 7, 2000, making it timely given the district court\u2019s order extending the time in which to appeal and Rule 4(b)(4). There can be no question that the government was not prejudiced by Gulley\u2019s technical failures \u2014 the government did not oppose the motion to enlarge time and has raised no jurisdictional objections to this appeal. As such, this court has jurisdiction and should address the merits of Gulley\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
