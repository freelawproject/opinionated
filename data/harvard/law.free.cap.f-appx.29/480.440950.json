Guma contends that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel when the district court denied his request to discharge his trial attorney during a pretrial hearing. Guma also argues that the district court erred by declining to reduce his offense level for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 because he admitted the elements of the assault at trial and expressed remorse at sentencing. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and, because the district court rejected Guma\u2019s request to discharge trial counsel without an adequate inquiry, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">A district court\u2019s denial of a motion for substitution of counsel is reviewed for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Corona-Garcia, </em>210 F.3d 973, 976 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 898, 121 S.Ct. 231, 148 L.Ed.2d 165 (2000). Although Guma is not entitled to the lawyer of his choice, \u201cif the relationship between lawyer and client completely collapses, the refusal to substitute new counsel violates [his] Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>159 F.3d 1154, 1158 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-15\">We consider three factors when evaluating whether a defendant was wrongly denied the opportunity to substitute counsel: 1) whether the district court\u2019s inquiry was adequate; 2) the extent of the conflict between the defendant and counsel; and 3) the timeliness of the motion weighed against any inconvenience or delay that would result from granting the motion. <em>Corona-Garcia, </em>210 F.3d at 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-18\">The district court provided Guma with an opportunity to elaborate on his request, but did not ask any questions of either Guma or his counsel. As confirmed at oral argument, Government counsel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>not excused from the room and the district court did not hold an ex parte hearing to evaluate Guma\u2019s request. Unfortunately, the district judge provided no reason on the record to support his denial of Guma\u2019s request for substitution of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">In light of several recent decisions of this Court, we conclude that the court\u2019s inquiry was inadequate. In <em>United States v. Adelzo-Gonzalez, </em>we reversed a conviction where \u201c[t]he district court asked only open-ended questions and put the onus on defendant to articulate why the appointed counsel could not provide competent representation.\u201d 268 F.3d 772, 778 (9th Cir.2001). <em>See also United States v. Nguyen, </em>262 F.3d 998, 1002-05 (9th Cir.2001) (reversing conviction where the district court refused to grant a full ex parte hearing in response to a request to substitute counsel); <em>United States v. Musa, </em>220 F.3d 1096, 1098, 1102-03 (9th Cir.) (vacating sentence where district court denied request to substitute counsel \u201cwithout inquiry\u201d), cert. <em>denied, </em>531 U.S. 999, 121 S.Ct. 498, 148 L.Ed.2d 469 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The district court\u2019s inquiry into Guma\u2019s request to substitute counsel was inadequate in light of our case law. Because we are reversing his conviction and remanding for a new trial with new defense counsel, we do not reach Guma\u2019s arguments regarding his sentence. They are now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b511-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-12\">. Based on the record before us, we conclude that Guma\u2019s request was for substitution of counsel, not a motion for self-representation. A defendant\u2019s assertion of the right to self-representation must be knowing, intelligent, timely, not for the purpose of delay, and unequivocal. <em>Adams v. Carroll, </em>875 F.2d 1441, 1442 (9th Cir.1989). Guma never stated that he wished to represent himself, and we see no other unequivocal evidence that he wished to proceed pro se.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
