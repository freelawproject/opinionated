After indictment in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Azcarate pleaded guilty to exporting monetary instruments of more than $10,000 in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5316 and 5324. His appeal challenges the District Court\u2019s two level sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(l) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-22\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. This court enjoys jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-24\">Azcarate argues that the District Court erred by enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(1), which provides for a two level enhancement for a failure to report monetary transactions where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>defendant \u201cknew or believed that the funds were proceeds of unlawful activity.\u201d According to Azcarate, the government did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he \u201cknew or believed that the funds were proceeds of unlawful activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Facts upon which sentencing determinations are made must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Dorsey, </em>174 F.3d 331, 332 (3d Cir.1999). This court reviews a District Court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Jarvis, </em>258 F.3d 235, 239 (3d Cir.2001). \u201c \u2018Under the clearly erroneous standard, a finding of fact may be reversed on appeal only if it is completely devoid of a credible evidentiary basis or bears no rational relationship to the supporting data.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Haut, </em>107 F.3d 213, 218 (3d Cir.1997) (quoting <em>American Home Products Corp. v. Barr Laboratories, Inc., </em>834 F.2d 368, 370-71 (3d Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">On March 5, 1998, Azcarate attempted to board a non-stop flight from Newark Airport to Panama City, Panama with $133,576 in United States currency and $9,984 in unendorsed money orders hidden in his computer bag and shoes. Following his arrest, United States Customs officials repeatedly questioned him where the money he was transporting came from. At his sentencing hearing, Azcarate testified that in response to these inquiries he ultimately replied, \u201cIt probably came from drugs, it probably came from something illegal.\u201d App. at 25. The District Court found that, \u201cMr. Azcarate\u2019s testimony supports a belief that the funds were proceeds of illegal activity.\u201d App. at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Azcarate argues that his testimony is insufficient to support a determination that he knew or believed the money came from unlawful activity. According to Azcarate, he was speculating about the money\u2019s origin at the behest of Customs agents. Thus, at the sentencing hearing, Azcarate testified, \u201cI do not know where [the money] actually came from. I could not prove it.\u201d App. at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">At the outset, we note that our clearly erroneous review is \u201c\u2018more deferential with respect to determinations about the credibility of witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Newark Branch, NAACP v. City of Bayonne, </em>134 F.3d 113, 120 (3d Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Igbonwa, </em>120 F.3d 437, 441 (3d Cir.1997)). To the extent the District Court\u2019s finding was based on Azcarate\u2019s testimony at the sentencing hearing, the District Court may simply have disbelieved Azcarate because of his demeanor or tone of voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">A sentencing court may also consider evidence contained in a noticed pre-sentence report. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Hart, </em>273 F.3d 363, 379 (3d Cir.2001). According to the pre-sentence report, which Azcarate reviewed, App. at 23, upon his arrest Azcarate stated that he \u201cknew the confiscated cash/money orders represented proceeds from drug-trafficking activity.\u201d Pre-sentence Report, \u00b611. Azcarate also admitted that he was commissioned to transport the money in exchange for $10,000. Pre-sentence Report, \u00b611. Furthermore, the currency Azcarate transported was in small denominations, Presentence Report, \u00b617, and his activity was commissioned by a contact he made while traveling in Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">All of these facts support the trial court\u2019s determination that Azcarate believed the money he carried was from unlawful activity. Courts have considered large amounts of small denomination bills in connection with travel to Colombia to support a determination that the defendant believed the money was derived from an illicit source. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Berrio, </em>77 F.3d 206, 209 (7th Cir.1996). That Azcarate\u2019s \u201cemployer\u201d was willing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>reward him so generously for his efforts despite the availability of considerably more economical and secure means of transferring funds internationally further bolsters the District Court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"AtT\">Based on the evidence before the sentencing court, and the deferential stance we adopt in applying the clearly erroneous standard of review, we cannot say the District Court\u2019s finding was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
