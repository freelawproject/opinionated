Hood, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b226-10\">This is a direct appeal from a judgment in a criminal prosecution. The parties have agreed to waive oral argument and, upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">In 2000, Bobby Blevins was named in a two-count indictment in connection with the manufacture and distribution of cocaine base. The district court subsequently accepted Blevins\u2019s guilty plea to the indictment and sentenced Blevins to a sixty-three month term of imprisonment and a five year period of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">Counsel for Blevins advances two issues for appellate review; both are addressed to the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines. This court reviews for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying the sentence, <em>United States v. Clements, </em>144 F.3d 981, 982 (6th Cir.1998), and gives due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts of the case. <em>United States v. Kushmaul, </em>147 F.3d 498, 500 (6th Cir.1998). This court, however, reviews de novo the sentencing court\u2019s application of the guidelines when the application presents a purely legal question. <em>United States v. Moerman, </em>233 F.3d 379, 380 (6th Cir.2000). An examination of the record and law under this standard supports the judgment on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">Blevins and co-defendant Roy Douglas Potter were arrested by federal authorities on July 14, 2000, and Blevins remained in federal custody up to and including the date he pleaded guilty to two charges on November 9, 2000. The matter was held over for sentencing pending completion of a pre-sentence report. On December 18, 2000, while Blevins was presumably in federal custody, the State of Tennessee revoked two of Blevins\u2019s suspended sentences for driving and drug offenses. The federal pre-sentence report was completed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>and counsel for Blevins registered two objections to the calculation of the criminal history category that are relevant to this appeal. Counsel specifically objected to the inclusion of one criminal history point in recognition of a twelve-month suspended sentence meted out to Blevins in Georgia for driving without a license on the theory that \u201ctwelve months\u201d does not equal \u201cone year\u201d within the meaning of USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c). Counsel also objected to the inclusion of five criminal history points in recognition of the revocation of the Tennessee suspended sentences on December 18, 2000, because Blevins was allegedly taken from federal to state custody without a writ of prosequendam. The district court rejected both objections and sentenced Blevins to the lowest end of the sixty-three to seventy-eight month guideline range. This appeal followed and counsel for Blevins raises the same two issues for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Counsel objected to the addition of one criminal history point pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.2(c) for having received a probated sentence of \u201ctwelve months\u201d in Georgia in 2000 for driving without a license. Section 4A1.2(c)(1) mandates the inclusion of all misdemeanor and petty offenses in a defendant\u2019s criminal history score except certain enumerated (and similar) offenses that did not result in either a minimum of \u201cone year probation\u201d or thirty days in jail. Counsel argues that, for federal sentencing purposes, there is some substantive difference between Georgia\u2019s \u201ctwelve month\u201d probationary term and the reference in \u00a7 4A1.2(e) to \u201cone year\u201d based on some unwritten intention by the guideline drafters to differentiate between similar sentences handed out for felonies or misdemeanors. Counsel cites no support for this claim, however, and our independent efforts have likewise failed to show any statutory or decisional basis for this claim. There is no apparent reason to strain the plain language of the guideline as urged by counsel. This issue lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Counsel also objected to the assessment of five criminal history points under \u00a7 4Al.l(a) and (b) in recognition of a state court\u2019s (Tennessee) revoking Blevins\u2019s suspended sentences allegedly after Blevins was taken from federal custody without a warrant of any kind. Counsel\u2019s theory is that the state court judgment, entered without having acquired personal jurisdiction over Blevins legally, is void and not countable under the sentencing guidelines. Counsel for the government argued that however a defendant arrives before a court of law, the court has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The government\u2019s position, and the district court\u2019s adoption of that position, is correct. In <em>Frisbie v. Collins, </em>342 U.S. 519, 72 S.Ct. 509, 96 L.Ed. 541 (1952), the defendant had been kidnaped in Chicago by Michigan officers and brought to trial in Michigan. The Supreme Court upheld the conviction over objections based on the Due Process Clause and the federal Kidnaping Act, declaring that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agq\">This Court has never departed from the rule announced in <em>[Ker v. Illinois, </em>119 U.S. 436, 7 S.Ct. 225, 30 L.Ed. 421 (1886) ] that the power of a court to try a person for crime is not impaired by the fact that he had been brought within the court\u2019s jurisdiction by reason of a \u201cforcible abduction.\u201d No persuasive reasons are now presented to justify overruling this line of cases. They rest on the sound basis that due process of law is satisfied when one present in court is convicted of crime after having been fairly apprized of the charges against him and after a fair trial in accordance with constitutional procedural safeguards. There is nothing in the Constitution that requires a court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>permit a guilty person rightfully convicted to escape justice because he was brought to trial against his will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><em>Frisbie, </em>342 U.S. at 522 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Ag5\">The appeal lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
