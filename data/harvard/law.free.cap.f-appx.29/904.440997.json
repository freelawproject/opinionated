Buckley was formerly a bartender and warehouseman. He last worked full-time in 1992, and alleges that he became disabled in 1994 due to pain in his groin and lower back.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">Our role as a reviewing court is limited to determining whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d which is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). We are bound by the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">The ALJ found Buckley\u2019s subjective complaints not fully credible. One of his doctors, Dr. Albornoz, had noted that his complaints were \u201cout of proportion\u201d to what he encountered in his examination and imaging studies. The ALJ found that Buckley\u2019s daily activities, although somewhat limited, were consistent with the ability to perform sedentary work. Another doctor, Dr. Dworkin, stated that Buckley\u2019s pain was controlled so that he could function in a \u201cfairly normal manner.\u201d The ALJ relied on the grids to direct a finding of non-disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">The District Court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s ruling noting that the objective medical evidence did not support Buckley\u2019s allegations of total disability. The District Court addressed each of Buckley\u2019s contentions. These were: (1) the ALJ erred in finding that his testimony was not fully credible; (2) that the ALJ erred by failing to take into account the impact of the side effects of his medication; and finally (3) that the ALJ erred in relying on Rule 201.27 to find that he was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">The District Court considered all of these contentions and analyzed them thoroughly, rejecting them in a ten-page memorandum opinion and order. Buckley raises these same issues on appeal. After a thorough review of the record, and giving due consideration to the briefs filed in this appeal, we find that the District Court\u2019s opinion sets forth the proper reasoning with respect to each of these issues. Accordingly, we will not restate the analysis here but, instead, incorporate by reference the memorandum opinion and order of the District Court in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-16\">Accordingly, we will AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
