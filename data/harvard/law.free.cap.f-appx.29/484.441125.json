R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Rabiya Akhter appeals her 16-month sentence imposed following a guilty plea conviction for harboring an illegal alien, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Akhter contends that the district court erred when it applied the two level \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(b)(1), to her base offense level because: (1) there is no evidence that her victim was more vulnerable than the usual victims of the offense; and (2) the factor making her victim vulnerable, namely alienage, was a necessary prerequisite to the commission of harboring an illegal alien. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines and its finding of victim vulnerability for clear error. <em>See United States v. Castaneda, </em>239 F.3d 978, 980 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">The record shows that the victim in this case was found to be \u201cparticularly susceptible to the criminal conduct\u201d based on the surrounding circumstances of the crime, in addition to several of the victim\u2019s particular characteristics. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(b)(1) comment, (n. 2) (stating a vulnerable victim is one who is \u201c... otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.\u201d); <em>United States v. Weischedel, </em>201 F.3d 1250, 1254 (9th Cir.2000) (stating the \u201cotherwise particularly susceptible\u201d prong requires a sentencing court to consider the characteristics of the victim, the victim\u2019s reaction to the criminal conduct and the circumstances surrounding the criminal act). Upon review of the record, we conclude that the totality of the circumstances in this case support such a finding. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>50 F.3d 751, 756 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cThe plain language of \u00a7 3A1.1 does not contain a requirement that the vulnerability must be present in only \u2018some victims of [the] of crime.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Weischedel, </em>201 F.3d at 1250 (stating the vulnerable victim analysis should \u201cfocus on the particular vulnerability of the individual victim\u2019s situation, rather than upon attributes common to a large segment of the population\u201d). Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b515-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
