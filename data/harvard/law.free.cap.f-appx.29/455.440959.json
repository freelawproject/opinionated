We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Watson contends that the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to quash violated his due process rights. We review the denial of a motion to quash for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Chen, </em>99 F.3d 1495, 1499 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Watson first contends that the property seized from his home cannot be used to satisfy the over $300,000 restitution ordered by the district court at Watson\u2019s 1996 sentencing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Under the Victim Witness Protection Act (\u201cVWPA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1512-1515 and 3663-3664, an order of restitution can be enforced by the government \u201cin the manner provided for the collection and payment of fines in subchapter B of chapter 229 of [Title 18].\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(h)(1)(A). One of the provisions of subchapter B states that a fine is a hen \u201cupon all property belonging to the person fined,\u201d which \u201carises at the time of the entry of the judgment and continues until the liability is satisfied.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(a); <em>accord United States v. Mills, </em>991 F.2d 609, 612 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201c[A] restitution order is enforceable as a hen upon all of the defendant\u2019s property at the time judgment is entered.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">Watson next contends that the district court should have stayed the writ of execution in order to resolve his claim concerning computer chips seized from Watson\u2019s home which allegedly became missing while in the care of the government. Watson, however, neither cites any authority to support his claim, nor sought any form of declaratory rehef concerning the seized property alleged to have been misplaced by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">Watson further contends that the government\u2019s erroneous reference to the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), instead of the Sentencing Reform Act (\u201cSRA\u201d), violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. Watson previously raised this same contention in his counterclaim for declaratory relief before the district court in a separate action, and as the district court correctly concluded, a lien on all of Watson\u2019s property automatically arose in favor of the government under the SRA upon entry of the criminal judgment and order of restitution, despite the government\u2019s erroneous reference to the AEDPA. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">Watson then contends that the government improperly resorted to force by seeking payment of the restitution by writ of execution rather than by allowing payment in installments, and that he was entitled to notification of delinquency or notification of default. These contentions fail for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-15\">First, the district court\u2019s restitution order, as contained in the 1996 order of judgment, specifically states that payment is due \u201cin full immediately,\u201d and once again a lien on all of Watson\u2019s property arose in favor of the government upon entry of the criminal judgment and order of restitution. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(a); <em>Mills, </em>991 F.2d at 612. Furthermore, Watson was on constructive notice that the government was seeking to enforce the restitution order by the government\u2019s November 24,1998 complaint for declaratory relief, in which it sought clarification from the district court as to the ownership of the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>seized vehicles, and to which Watson responded. <em>See Hammer v. Drago, </em>940 F.2d 524, 526 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cA party\u2019s conduct is culpable if he has received actual or constructive notice of the filing of the action and failed to answer the complaint.\u201d); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>944 F.2d 618, 622 (9th Cir.1991) (stating that due process is satisfied by affording the defendant an adequate opportunity to present his objections).</p>\n<p id=\"AqL\">Finally, Watson\u2019s contention that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the government\u2019s lien on the two seized vehicles is without merit because the government provided evidence that clearly established that Watson owned the two seized vehicles.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ah5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b486-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A0G\">. Even assuming, without deciding, that Watson did not own the two seized vehicles, he would have lacked standing to raise any challenge or would have had to establish more than a conclusory claim of interest. <em>See United States v. $191,910.00 in U.S. Currency, </em>16 F.3d 1051, 1058 (9th Cir.1994) (\"[A] simple claim of ownership will be sufficient to challenge a forfeiture. Mere unexplained possession will not be sufficient.\u201d); <em>Baker v. United States, </em>722 F.2d 517, 518-19 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
