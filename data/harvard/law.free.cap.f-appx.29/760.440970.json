Although, as the district court indicated, there are no decisions of this Circuit or the New York State courts as to whether negligence by a state actor that results in property damage can provide the basis for a claim under the Takings Clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>of the Constitution, if such a claim were stated here it would not be ripe for adjudication, given plaintiffs failure to pursue available state remedies for compensation, <em>see Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank, </em>473 U.S. 172, 194-95, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">We have considered all of plaintiffs contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
