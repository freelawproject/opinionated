R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">This case is before the court on Jose Socorro Alvarez\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Alvarez seeks a COA so that he can \u2019appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (providing that no appeal may be taken from a \u201cfinal order in a proceeding under section 2255\u201d unless the movant first obtains a COA). Because Alvarez has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses the appeal. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, Alvarez pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine and was sentenced to a term of eighty-seven months in prison. The plea agreement contained a waiver of direct appeal and collateral attack rights. Alvarez nevertheless filed the instant \u00a7 2255 motion claiming that his counsel had been constitutionally ineffective in several respects. Relying on this court\u2019s recent decision iri <em>United States v. Cockerham, </em>237 F.3d 1179, 1187 (10th Cir. 2001), the district court concluded that Alvarez had waived the right to bring all such claims, with the- exception of \u201cineffective assistance of counsel claims challenging the validity of the plea or the waiver.\u201d Upon examining the record, the district court concluded that Alvarez had knowingly and voluntarily pleaded guilty and that he had completely failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by any of counsel\u2019s actions' in negotiating the plea agreement and waiver of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">Alvarez is entitled to a COA only if he can make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). He can make this showing by demonstrating that the issues he raises are debatable among jurists, that a court could resolve the issues differently, or that the \u2019 questions presented deserve further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). This court has conducted a thorough review of Alvarez\u2019s appellate brief and request for a COA, the district court order, and the entire appellate record. That review demonstrates that Alvarez\u2019s conclusory allegations that his attorney \u201cpressured\u201d him to make an \u201cinvoluntary\u201d plea are simply insufficient to overcome his statements in open court during the plea hearing that he was knowingly and voluntarily executing the guilty plea and waiver of rights. <em>See Lasiter v. Thomas, </em>89 F.3d 699, 702 (10th Cir.1996) (\u201c[Representations of the defendant ... as well as any findings made by the judge accepting the plea constitute a formidable barrier in any subsequent collateral proceedings. Solemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity. The subsequent presentation of conclusory allegations unsupported by specifics is subject to summary dismissal.\u201d (quotation omitted)). Furthermore, there is absolutely no evidence in the record indicating that the United States was willing to enter into a conditional plea agreement preserving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Alvarez\u2019s right to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion. Nor is there any evidence that Alvarez would have insisted on going to trial rather than pleading guilty if his counsel had informed him that course was necessary to preserve the right to appellate review of the suppression question. Accordingly, this court DENIES Alvarez\u2019s request for a COA for substantially those reasons set out in the district court\u2019s order entered March 6, 2001, and DISMISSES the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
