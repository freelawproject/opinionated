Whether the District Court erred in concluding that a Section 1983 action based upon use of excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment is a claim \u201cwith respect to prison conditions\u201d which requires the exhaustion of remedies under Section 1997e(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-4\">2. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the administrative remedies \u201cavailable\u201d to appellant had to be exhausted prior to filing suit, despite the fact that the remedies that were available did not provide for the relief appellant sought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">We resolved both of these issues against the appellant\u2019s position in <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>206 F.3d 289 (3d Cir.2000). Our resolution of the second of these issues in <em>Booth </em>was affirmed by the Supreme Court. 532 U.S. 731, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (May 29, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
