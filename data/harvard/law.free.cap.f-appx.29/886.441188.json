In its March 26, 2001 judgment and order, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey granted summary judgment in favor of the Board and dismissed DeVito\u2019s complaint with prejudice. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-20\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343, and 1367. We exercise appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and the applicable standard of review is plenary. <em>Saldana v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number><em>Kmart Corp., </em>260 F.3d 228, 231-32 (3d Cir.2001). Summary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the Board is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>We must view all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in DeVito\u2019s favor. <em>Id. </em>However, DeVito may not rely on the allegations in his pleadings; instead, through \u201cmore than a scintilla\u201d of evidence, he must present \u201cspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>see Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Because we write exclusively for the parties, a full recitation of the facts is unnecessary. DeVito, a Caucasian male, alleges that the Board committed a series of discriminatory employment acts in violation of the NJLAD.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-6\">1. In June 1990, the Board demoted him from the position of Coordinator of Maintenance Services to electrician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-7\">2. In 1991, he applied for the position of Assistant Director of Repair and Maintenance and was denied the job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-8\">3. In 1993-1994, he applied for, and was denied, the same position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-9\">4. In April 1995, the Board created the position of Director of Repair and Maintenance and established hiring criteria that only one person could fulfill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-10\">5. In January 1996, the Board created the positions of Acting Assistant Director of Maintenance Services for Administration and Acting Associate Director of Maintenance Services for Operations. According to DeVito, the Board created these positions to promote favored employees. DeVito did not apply for either position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-11\">6. In March or April 1997, DeVito was reassigned from the electrical shop to the field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-12\">7. In 1999, the Board posted the positions of Building Manager and Engineer in Charge, although DeVito did not apply for either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-13\">8. In May 1999, DeVito was reassigned to the night shift. Despite his requests, the Board did not return him to the day shift.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">The District Court ruled that DeVito\u2019s NJLAD claim is time-barred with respect to the majority of these acts. A two-year statute of limitations applies to an NJLAD claim in which the operative facts arose after July 27,1993, while a six-year statute of limitations applies if the events occurred before this date. <em>Cardenas v. Massey, </em>269 F.3d 251, 255 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>Montells v. Haynes, </em>133 N.J. 282, 627 A.2d 654 (N.J.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-15\">Although the District Court properly held that the claim survives to the extent it relies on acts Seven and Eight, it erred in holding that act Three satisfies the statute of limitations. DeVito alleges that in 1993 he applied for, and was denied, the position of Assistant Director. Nevertheless, the record reflects two specific dates that we could consider in determining the timeliness of the allegation. On June 30, 1993, Joseph Richardson resigned from this position. See PA174. At the same time, DeVito\u2019s deposition testimony suggests that Richardson\u2019s replacement, Vincent Lupiano, began serving as Assistant Director sometime between April and December 1994. See PA80; PA91. DeVito claims that the Board discriminated against him by placing Lupiano in this position in violation of the applicable Eligibility List. See PA158.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-16\">Regardless which time period is considered determinative, the statute of limitations would bar DeVito\u2019s claim based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>this employment decision. If we consider June 30, 1993 as the date of the alleged discriminatory act, a six-year statute of limitations, expiring on June 30, 1999, would apply; in contrast, if we rely on the April to December 1994 time range, a two-year statute of limitations, expiring in 1996, would apply. Under either scenario, DeVito\u2019s NJLAD claim, filed July 2, 1999, would fail to satisfy the time bar to the extent it relies on the allegedly discriminatory hiring of Lupiano.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Despite this slight error, the District Court correctly held the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d theory for equitable tolling inapplicable under the facts presented. We apply three factors in determining whether a series of alleged discriminatory acts constitute a continuing violation: (1) whether the acts involve the same type of discrimination; (2) whether the acts are \u201crecurring ... or more in the nature of an isolated work assignment or employment decision;\u201d and (3) whether each act has a \u201cdegree of permanence which should trigger an employee\u2019s awareness of and duty to assert his or her rights.\u201d <em>Rush v. Scott Specialty Gases, Inc., </em>113 F.3d 476, 480 (3d Cir.1997). In evaluating the third and most important factor, the District Court properly held that each alleged act of employment discrimination had a degree of permanence which, at the time of its occurrence, should have triggered DeVito\u2019s awareness of a possible violation of his rights. <em>Id. </em>at 483 (\u201cRush\u2019s failure to promote and train claim addresses discrete instances of alleged discrimination that are not susceptible to a continuing violation analysis.\u201d). This holding is buttressed by the fact that these acts actually did trigger such awareness, as evidenced by DeVito\u2019s 1995 complaint that alleged a NJLAD claim based on the employment decisions involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">To the extent it relies on employment decisions that do satisfy the statute of limitations, DeVito\u2019s NJLAD claim cannot survive summary judgment. Establishing a discrimination claim under this statute involves the well-recognized burden shifting analysis established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). See <em>Erickson v. Marsh &amp; McLennan Co., </em>117 N.J. 539, 569 A.2d 793, 798 (N.J.1990). However, the prima facie stage is slightly modified in a reverse discrimination context where, as here, the plaintiff is part of a majority group. Accordingly, DeVito must present \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d suggesting that the Board is \u201cthe unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 799. The District Court held that DeVito failed to produce evidence of those \u201cbackground circumstances,\u201d and we agree. In support of his various allegations of discrimination, DeVito\u2019s only evidence is that the individuals who allegedly granted or received preferential employment treatment were African American. Without more, such evidence is insufficient. See <em>id. </em>at 800 (pointing to the minority status of favored employees, without more, is insufficient evidence of \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d); see also <em>Iadimarco v. Runyon, </em>190 F.3d 151, 156 (3d Cir.1999) (\u201c[T]he race of the selecting officials is not a sufficient circumstance to establish a prima facie case of discrimination by itself.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">DeVito\u2019s complaint also alleges that the Board engaged in political retaliation against him in violation of \u00a7 1983. The District Court properly rejected this claim as well. The Board cannot be held vicariously liable under \u00a7 1983. <em>Monell v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>436 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Instead, liability only arises if the Board adopted a policy, custom, or practice that resulted in DeVito\u2019s constitutional injury. <em>Id.; see Kneipp v. Tedder, </em>95 F.3d 1199, 1212 (3d Cir.1996) (defining what action constitutes a policy or custom). DeVito failed to produce any evidence establishing such a policy, custom, or practice, and thus, summary judgment in the Board\u2019s favor is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">^ ^ ^ ^ $</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
