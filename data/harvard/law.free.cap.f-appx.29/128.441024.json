For the reasons discussed below, we affirm in No. 01-4077, and in No. 01-4014, we reverse the order denying the Government\u2019s motion for reconsideration and remand for reimposition of Francis\u2019 original terms of imprisonment and supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-25\">Francis was convicted in 1997 of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u00a7 846 (West 1999), distribution of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2001), and using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c) (West 2000). The district court sentenced Francis to a 324-month term of imprisonment on the drug counts and a consecutive sixty-month term on the \u00a7 924(c) count, to be followed by five years of supervised release. We affirmed Francis\u2019 convictions and sentence on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Barber, </em>No. 97-4983(L), 1999 WL 95539 (4th Cir. Feb.17, 1999) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Francis filed a \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court challenging his convictions and sentence under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Francis also claimed, among other things, that the indictment was defective and that counsel provided ineffective representation.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The district court granted Francis\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion in part, holding that <em>Apprendi </em>applied retroactively to cases on collateral review, and reduced Francis\u2019 terms of imprisonment and supervised release to 240 months and three years, respectively. The court denied relief as to Francis\u2019 other claims. The Government filed a motion to reconsider, arguing that <em>Apprendi </em>should not be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review. The district court denied the motion. Francis and the Government appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In No. 01^1077, our review of the record and the district court\u2019s opinion to the extent it denied relief on Francis\u2019 claims discloses no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny Francis\u2019 motion for judicial notice and affirm the denial of relief on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Francis, </em>Nos. CR-96-21; CA-00-141-1 (W.D.N.C. Dec. 13, 2000). We also grant Francis\u2019 motion to file a pro se supplemental brief but find the claims raised therein to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">In No. 01-4014, the Government appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of its motion to reconsider the granting of relief on Francis\u2019 motion with respect to his claim under <em>Apprendi. </em>In <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 573, 151 L.Ed.2d 445 (2001), we held that <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>Id. </em>at 151. The district court\u2019s order squarely conflicts with <em>Sanders. </em>We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s order denying the Government\u2019s motion for reconsideration and remand with instructions to reimpose Francis\u2019 original 324-month sentence and five-year term of supervised release. In light of this disposition, we deny as moot the Government\u2019s motion for summary reversal of the district court\u2019s order to the extent that it granted partial relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b160-6\"> To the extent Francis does not challenge on appeal his remaining claims or the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for an enlargement of time in which to respond to the Government\u2019s motion for reconsideration, we find that he has abandoned those issues on appeal. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (noting that issues not briefed or argued on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
