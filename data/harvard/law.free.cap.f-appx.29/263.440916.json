Kendrick (Claimant), widow of James C. Kendrick (Miner), petitions pro se for review of the Benefits Review Board\u2019s (Board\u2019s) decision and order denying her claim for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-45. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The Miner, while living, filed three claims for black lung benefits. As a result of the most recent, filed in November 1992, benefits were awarded in a decision and order issued on March 22, 1995. The administrative law judge (ALJ) found that the Miner had established 14 years of qualifying coal mine employment, pneumoconiosis by means of x-ray and medical opinion evidence, causation, and total disability due in part to his pneumoconiosis. The Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision and order on August 24,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The Miner received a heart transplant in March 1992, but died on January 26, 1998, with the death certificate citing \u201cmultiorgan failure\u201d as the cause of death. The Claimant\u2019s application for survivor\u2019s benefits was denied by the district director on October 28, 1998. Upon appeal, the claim was transferred to the Office of Administrative Law Judges for a hearing. Following the hearing and after consideration of the evidence submitted, the ALJ denied benefits in a decision and order issued on June 22, 2000. The ALJ again found that the Miner suffered from pneumoconiosis, but further found that his pneumoconiosis did not cause, contribute to, or hasten his death. The Board affirmed this decision in an order filed on July 31, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">In her petition for review, the Claimant continues to argue that the Miner\u2019s lung condition contributed to his death and that the ALJ erred in crediting the opinions of the reviewing physicians over those who treated her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">This court must affirm the Board\u2019s decision if the Board has not committed any legal error or exceeded its statutory scope of review of the ALJ\u2019s factual determinations. <em>See Glen Coal Co. v. Seals, </em>147 F.3d 502, 510 (6th Cir.1998). The court reviews the ALJ\u2019s decision only to decide whether it is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with the applicable law. <em>See Seals, </em>147 F.3d at 510; <em>Peabody Coal Co. v. Greer, </em>62 F.3d 801, 804 (6th Cir.1995). Thus, as long as the ALJ\u2019s conclusions are supported by the evidence, they will not be reversed, \u201ceven if the facts permit an alternative conclusion.\u201d <em>Youghiogheny &amp; Ohio Coal Co. v. Webb, </em>49 F.3d 244, 246 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">Because the Claimant applied for benefits after January 1, 1982, she must establish that the Miner\u2019s death was due to pneumoconiosis in order to be entitled to benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.1(a) (2001). The criteria for determining whether a miner\u2019s death occurred as a result of pneumoconiosis are: (1) whether competent medical evidence establishes that the miner\u2019s death was due to pneumoconiosis; (2) whether pneumoconiosis was a substantial<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>ly contributing cause or factor leading to the miner\u2019s death, or death was caused by complications of pneumoconiosis; or (3) whether the presumption set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.304 is applicable to the survivor\u2019s claim. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(c)(l)-(3) (2001). The presumption found in \u00a7 718.304 does not apply to this claim because there is no evidence of complicated pneumoconiosis. Survivors are not eligible for benefits where the principal cause of death is a medical condition not related to pneumoconiosis, unless pneumoconiosis was a \u201csubstantially contributing cause\u201d of the death. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(c)(4) (2001). The regulations have now codified this court\u2019s interpretation of this regulatory language to encompass situations where pneumoconiosis, even if not a proximate cause of death, actually hastened a miner\u2019s death. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(c)(5) (2001); <em>Brown v. Rock Creek Mining Co., </em>996 F.2d 812, 816 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Despite the fact that the ALJ found that the Miner suffered from pneumoconiosis arising from his coal mine employment, he denied benefits on the basis that the Claimant failed to establish that this pneumoconiosis contributed to or hastened the Miner\u2019s death. As already noted, the Miner\u2019s death certificate listed the cause of death as multi-organ failure. No other causes or contributing factors were listed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In weighing a physician\u2019s report, the ALJ may take into consideration a number of factors, including the qualifications of the physician, the recency of the report, and whether the report is adequately documented and based upon accurate data. <em>See, e.g., Tussey v. Island Creek Coal Co., </em>982 F.2d 1036, 1042 (6th Cir.1993); <em>Phillips v. Director, OWCP, </em>768 F.2d 982, 984 (8th Cir.1985); <em>Director, OWCP v. Rowe, </em>710 F.2d 251, 255 (6th Cir.1983). While the ALJ may give greater weight to the opinion of a treating physician, he need not do so when the treating physician\u2019s opinion is equivocal. <em>See Griffith v. Director, OWCP, </em>49 F.3d 184, 186-87 (6th Cir.1995) (Lay, J., dissenting). This court will defer to the ALJ\u2019s determinations of credibility, including the weight to be accorded to physicians\u2019 opinions, where the ALJ\u2019s determinations are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Consolidation Coal Co. v. Worrell, </em>27 F.3d 227, 231 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">In this case, it is noted that the Miner\u2019s \u201ctreating physicians\u201d were not treating him in the last year of his life or, at least, not at the time of his death. The ALJ permissibly found that the opinion of Dr. Pajel that chronic obstructive lung disease \u201cmay have contributed\u201d to the Miner\u2019s death was \u201cspeculative at best.\u201d Dr. Santos admitted that the details leading to the Miner\u2019s death were unknown to him and offered no support or reasoning for his opinion that pneumoconiosis played a significant role. Dr. Sundaram also offered a conclusory opinion that was not backed by any reasoning or documentation. Moreover, none of these physicians evaluated the effect of the Miner\u2019s smoking history on any compromised pulmonary status. For these reasons, the ALJ did not err in granting little weight to these opinions as to the cause of the Miner\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The ALJ permissibly took into consideration the superior qualifications of the reviewing physicians as found in the record. The ALJ relied upon the reasoned and documented medical opinions of Drs. Caffrey, Dahhan, Castle, Fino, and Broudy to find that pneumoconiosis did not cause, contribute to, or hasten the Miner\u2019s death. The ALJ\u2019s reliance upon the opinions of Drs. Caffrey, Fino, and Broudy is tainted by their failure to find that the Miner even <em>had </em>pneumoconiosis \u2014 a position rejected by the ALJ himself. <em>See generally Skukan v. Consolidation Coal Co., </em>993 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>1228, 1233 (6th Cir.1993), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>512 U.S. 1231, 114 S.Ct. 2732, 129 L.Ed.2d 854 (1994). Nonetheless, the well-reasoned opinions of Drs. Castle and Dahhan are sufficient to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The ALJ\u2019s decision and order is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with the applicable law. Accordingly, the petition for review is denied. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
